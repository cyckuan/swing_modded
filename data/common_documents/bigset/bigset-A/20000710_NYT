<P>
   SEATTLE _ Eric Karros never has been named to the All-Star team
and likely won't be again this season. But as more and more
starters are sidelined by injuries, his frustration mounts.
</P>
<P>
   Karros, traditionally a second-half player, has 25 home runs and
70 RBI. His career bests are 34 homers and 112 RBI, set last year.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, when Mark McGwire said this week he won't play, Atlanta
manager Bobby Cox, who will coach the National League on Tuesday,
named Edgar Renteria as McGwire's replacement.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mike Piazza got up off the mat and came up swinging _
verbally _ at Roger Clemens Sunday night. To the Mets' catcher,
Clemens committed an unconscionable act on Saturday when the
Yankees right-hander gave Piazza a concussion with a fastball to
the head.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I could remember him as a great pitcher, as a Cy Young
award winner,'' Piazza said. ``But I know I can't do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Piazza missed Sunday night's 2-0 triumph over the Yankees, and
he will stay home and rest instead of going to Tuesday's All-Star
Game, where he was scheduled to be the starting catcher for the
National League.
</P>
<P>
   He said he felt fine, but also that he was groggy and had a
headache. Very soon, Piazza said he will have a magnetic resonance
imaging test to see if the beaning inflicted any damage to his
brain. ``I consider myself very fortunate that I have at least a
little bit of my faculties today,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza prepared some comments before answering questions from
the news media Sunday night, and he said that would be the only
time he would ever address the incident. He had plenty to say, and
in doing so gave voice to a rivalry that now may be more intense
between the teams than it is between fans of those teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about the team,'' said Mets General Manager Steve
Phillips. ``It's not exclusively about an individual.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips forbid the Yankees from using the weight room in the
Mets' locker room, a facility normally shared between teams. He
also scrapped plans to have Mets all-stars Al Leiter and Edgardo
Alfonzo and their families fly on the Yankees' post-game charter to
Atlanta for the All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if things are ever over,'' Phillips said. ``Guys
have long memories in baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Piazza was upset not only at Clemens but at other Yankees who
said Clemens was only trying to pitch inside when Piazza was hit in
the second inning.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought it was definitely intentional,'' Piazza said. ``I
could respect the fact that he's throwing inside, I could respect
the fact of getting hit, getting hit in the ribs or the body. I
know that's part of the game, I accept that and I don't have any
problem with that. But I feel there's a difference between that and
almost ending my career.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemens responded by saying he had no reaction to Piazza's
comments. He repeated what he said after Saturday's game, a 4-2
Yankees victory in the second game of their day-night doubleheader.
``I wasn't trying to hit him,'' Clemens said. ``I was trying to
pitch him inside.''
</P>
<P>
   Piazza, who has seven hits _ including three homers _ in 12
at-bats off Clemens, was not buying that.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got no remorse,'' said Piazza, who added he had no
interest in accepting Clemens' phone call on Saturday. ``I'm kind
of flattered, in a weird way, because he's trying to tell me the
only way to get me out is to try to hurt me.''
</P>
<P>
   Piazza and the Mets manager, Bobby Valentine, both said they
felt Clemens would not have thrown such a pitch at Shea Stadium,
where Clemens would have had to hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really can't say I have respect for him right now,'' Piazza
said. ``Roger has very good control. I think he only walked one guy
during the game. If the shoe fits, that's the way it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``Also, I want to say this: I thought sometime down the line in
my career maybe I could have been a designated hitter. But I think
that's probably not a good thing for baseball. I think that if he
knew he had to come up the next inning, he probably would have been
a little more careful.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentine said he did not remember if Clemens threw at any Texas
Rangers when Valentine managed there _ ``We beat him a lot, I
remember that,'' Valentine said _ but he also noted that Clemens
was protected by the presence of a designated hitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are responsible for your actions and the consequences,''
Valentine said. ``In that American League situation, there's very
little responsibility and very little consequences. So your
teammate gets hit in the butt by an 86 mph fastball.''
</P>
<P>
   That is what the Mets left-hander Glendon Rusch did to Tino
Martinez, the first Yankee he faced Saturday after Piazza was hit.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza, of course, was hit in a far more dangerous area, and he
wondered if it would have long-term implications on his career.
Piazza is one of baseball's best hitters, but he said he could not
be sure how he would be affected by the beaning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it's going to take me a little while to get comfortable
in the box,'' he said. ``You have to deal with it. I've been hit
before and you just put it behind you. You can not do the job if
you're not completely comfortable in the box. If you have one ounce
of anxiety or fear, you're not going to play well.''

is to be built in a few years to carry oil to the Atlantic coast,
where it will be shipped to the West. The pipeline, which the World
Bank endorsed in June after heated debates, will be a huge project,

medieval England but is finding fresh life in America, the global
leader in incarceration. Chief jailer Harold Taylor fondly recalls
his salad days in the 1960s when county inmates were respectful
winos who barely taxed the public budget, versus modern inmates who
sue for full dentistry, he says, running up bills under federal
regulations that under a new state law they will have to begin

   TAX-CUT-POLITICS _ With projections of the federal budget
surplus rising and both parties in full election-year mode, the
debate over tax cuts is shifting from whether to what kinds.
Republicans continue to press for bigger reductions than most
Democrats will support, and the super-charged politics of the
campaign season will make it difficult for any tax cuts to be
enacted before a new president and Congress take office next year.
But in Washington and on the campaign trail, Democrats from
President Clinton on down are joining Republicans in backing tax
cuts _ enthusiastically in some cases, grudgingly and with
conditions in others _ to a far greater degree than they were a
year or even six months ago. By Richard W. Stevenson.

   FISHING-QUOTAS _ The way the government limits the catch of
fishermen may heighten the risks for those who go down to the sea.
In most waters, you can catch all the fish you are able until the
overall quota is reached. That spurs a mad race, regardless of high
seas and foul winds. Instead, reformers want individual quotas: a
boat can catch so much, and it can take its time. By Carl Hulse.

   WORKPLACE-NOOSE (Undated) _ The hangman's noose has long been
one of the most frightening representations of racism in America, a
reminder that thousands of blacks met a horrific death at the hands
of lynch mobs from the end of the Civil War well into the 20th
century. But while the symbolic use of a noose has traditionally
been associated with hate groups like the Ku Klux Klan, employment
experts say that nooses, while still rare, are increasingly turning
up in workplaces. In most cases, they say, the noose was placed
anonymously on an employee's chair, in his locker, or on a door. By

   JEWISH-PRESS-MEDIA (Undated) _ Usually, The New York Jewish Week
newspaper, affiliated with the UJA-Federation, sees its job as
putting the Jewish community in a positive light. And so it was a
remarkable departure for the paper to run an extensive
investigative article recently about a local rabbi, the regional
director of the Orthodox Union's summer youth program, who had been
accused for years of sexual improprieties toward teen-age girls.
After the article appeared, the rabbi was fired, despite his
insistence that the accusations were false. The reaction, within
the metropolitan Jewish community, as well as the regional and
national Jewish press, highlights the tension between advocacy and
objectivity in specialized journalism that is aimed at specific
religious, ethnic or cultural groups. By Felicity Barringer.

GOLDEN BOY ESPINOZA IS NEW MAN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ A veteran racetrack official was strolling
past the Hollywood Park jockeys' room last weekend when he spotted
a young Latino man wearing riding pants, an undershirt and, ahem,
bright yellow hair.
</P>
<P>
   ``That,'' the official said lightly, ``used to be Victor
Espinoza.''
</P>
<P>
   Espinoza had dyed his hair - in honor, he said, of the upcoming
Hollywood Gold Cup. Gold, get it?
</P>
<P>
   Honestly, it's not a good look. A more pleasing makeover is the
one Espinoza has given to his career in the past year, an
application of glamour for which his victory aboard 24-1 Early
Pioneer in Sunday's Gold Cup provided the prettiest curl.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Espinoza, a 28-year-old native of Mexico City, was
just another jockey on the tough Hollywood Park-Santa Anita-Del Mar
circuit. Certainly he was no threat to win a riding title, to say
nothing of a $1 million race.
</P>
<P>
   Today, much improved and polished, he leads the standings at
Hollywood Park with two weeks to go in the spring-summer season and
has colored himself a formidable big-race rider to boot with his
performance aboard Early Pioneer.
</P>
<P>
   The 61st Gold Cup had shaped up as a wide-open race in which a
new star might be born. And one was. A two-legged one. A
yellow-haired one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, I've seen him (ride) for several years,'' winning
trainer Vladimir Cerin said after the race. ``But I never paid much
attention to him. I just thought he was an OK rider, a transplant
from Northern California who maybe should have stayed there.''
</P>
<P>
   That used to be Victor Espinoza.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then, the last couple of months, I watched him very
closely,'' Cerin said. ``This kid is just phenomenal, the way he
sees holes developing and judges pace.''
</P>
<P>
   Espinoza hadn't competed in a Gold Cup. He'd been aboard Early
Pioneer only once before and that was in a workout, not a race. The
ex-claiming horse had been ridden in recent starts by Matt Garcia,
a jockey on the fringes of the track's top 10. But when Cerin saw
an opportunity to put the leading man on his Gold Cup horse, he
didn't hesitate.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it's the horse who does most of the work and deserves
mWgl,B\uhe credit for beating favorite General Challenge and jockey
Corey Nakatani. Since his days as a $62,500 sprinter, Early Pioneer
has gone on to longer races and has gotten good.
</P>
<P>
   It's Espinoza, though, who gave him every chance to win, which
is the jockey's job description in a nutshell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good horse. Good ride,'' Espinoza said, putting it in the
right order.
</P>
<P>
   Espinoza says all the right things. And Sunday he made all the
right moves.
</P>
<P>
   Cerin's instructions called for Espinoza to let Early Pioneer
settle behind the front-runners in the opening stages of the 1-mile
race. The rest would be up to the rider.
</P>
<P>
   Espinoza and Early Pioneer rounded the clubhouse turn in the
middle of the nine-horse field. Ahead of them were David, Big Ten
and Cat Thief, who were supposed to be among the pacesetters, and
General Challenge, who was not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't expect General Challenge to be ahead of me. I
expected him to be behind me,'' Espinoza said later. ``I said,
`Well, that's the horse to beat, so I'll stay right here (following
him).' I wanted all the top horses in front of me. I didn't want
'em behind me.''
</P>
<P>
   Espinoza kept Early Pioneer well off the heels of the leaders, a
few running lanes away from the inner rail - by himself, the best
place a horse can be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather be 10-wide than stuck inside,'' Espinoza said.
</P>
<P>
   By the far turn, he sensed that his 5-year-old gelding needed
rousing, and he went to the whip earlier than he might have
preferred. The result was a three-eighths-mile drive that was too
much for a rusty General Challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a magnificent ride,'' Cerin said.
</P>
<P>
   For Espinoza - as for Cerin, owners David and Holly Wilson and
Early Pioneer himself - it was the first victory in a Grade I
stakes.
</P>
<P>
   It was especially emotional for Espinoza. He had spoken on the
phone Sunday morning with agent Tony Matos' mother, recovering from
emergency heart surgery in Puerto Rico. He told her, ``I want to
win just for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Matos had to leave for a couple of days to be with his mother,
and flew back to California only for the day to attend the Gold
Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Don't worry about it. Business will always be here.
Your family won't,''' Espinoza said.
</P>
<P>
   Espinoza is committed to seeing that he'll be here for a long
time. He speaks of wanting to work hard and ``do it right.'' The
results speak for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   He finished third in the standings at Santa Anita last winter,
so his Hollywood Park numbers are no fluke. His victory aboard 10-1
Elaborate in the $300,000 Triple Bend Handicap later on Gold Cup
day was his sixth stakes win of the meet, and only Hall of Famer
Chris McCarron has more.

   Is this the young jockey who didn't rate much attention? That
used to be Victor Espinoza. No longer.

<P>
   ARLINGTON _ The time has come to break up the Texas Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Their outfield has not produced enough offense, their starting
rotation was overrated, their defense is among the worst in the
American League and their bullpen has been a major disappointment.
It doesn't take long to figure out what went wrong for the Rangers
in the first half of the season or why they will spend the All-Star
break in last place in the AL West.
</P>
<P>
   Wait a minute...
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Rogers and Rick Helling have pitched well, John Wetteland
can still get people out in the ninth inning, their offense can
still score runs and the young players are becoming
battle-hardened. Just when it seemed to be time to write their
obituary, the Rangers finished the first half strong to pull within
striking distance of first place (they trail Seattle by 81/2 games)
or a wild-card spot (they trail Oakland by 51/2 games). They are
far from being finished.
</P>
<P>
   So...
</P>
<P>
   Break up the Rangers? Keep trying to win?
</P>
<P>
   The exhaustive debate is waged almost daily, both in public and
in the Rangers' clubhouse, where players openly wonder what changes
are coming. But the man who will ultimately answer the questions
won't say _ because he hasn't decided.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers general manager Doug Melvin just believes his team is
still in contention and needs to keep winning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll keep watching it and try to enjoy it while we're
winning,'' Melvin said.''I've got a feeling for what might happen
or not happen. I'd really like the team to win and to keep the team
together. We're still trying to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Win what?
</P>
<P>
   The wild card, possibly. The division title, maybe. The American
League pennant, doubtful. The World Series? Don't bet on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know people say the ultimate goal is to win the World
Series,'' Melvin said. ``But to win the World Series, you've got to
get to postseason. You take it one step at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   And other things must be considered.
</P>
<P>
   The Baltimore Orioles were in a similar situation in 1996 when
they were 52-52 on July 30. General manager Pat Gillick was ready
to start trading veterans for young players, but owner Peter
Angelos wouldn't let him. Angelos looked like a hero when the
Orioles won the wild-card spot in 1996 and the division in 1997.
But they failed to reach the World Series, and now they have aging
veterans and few decent young players.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin wants to avoid that. Owner Tom Hicks wants to win the
World Series, not just another division title. Trading some
marketable veterans now _ closer John Wetteland, pitcher Esteban
Loaiza, designated hitter David Segui _ could get the Rangers a
head start on putting together a World Series team next year.
</P>
<P>
   The Houston Astros traded reliever Larry Andersen to the Boston
Red Sox for minor-league third baseman Jeff Bagwell in 1990. The
Atlanta Braves traded pitcher Doyle Alexander to the Detroit Tigers
for John Smoltz in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   But the Oakland Athletics traded first baseman Mark McGwire to
the St. Louis Cardinals for pitchers Blake Stein, T.J. Mathews and
Eric Ludwick in 1997. Some midseason trades work out better than
others.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, the Rangers might win something this year.
</P>
<P>
   Go for it? Wait 'til next year? Each area of the team offers
reasons why the Rangers should keep going for a playoff spot and
why they should look toward next year. STARTING PITCHING
</P>
<P>
   GO FOR IT: The Rangers have two capable starters, Rick Helling
and Kenny Rogers, at the head of their rotation. Darren Oliver and
Esteban Loaiza pitched well in the second half last year. With
similar second-half performances from Oliver and Loaiza this year,
the Rangers could have the rotation they envisioned in spring
training.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, they would have an opening for a fifth starter, which
would allow them to look at Matt Perisho, Ryan Glynn or Doug Davis.
Even if the Rangers trade Loaiza, which seems a foregone
conclusion, they could make a strong run with two young pitchers in
the rotation.
</P>
<P>
   WAIT 'TIL NEXT YEAR: The Rangers have three promising young
pitchers: Perisho, Glynn and Davis. The Rangers need to find out
about them now because tough and expensive decisions will need to
be made in the off-season, particularly when pursuing free agents.
The potential free agents include Mike Mussina and Mike Hampton.
BULLPEN
</P>
<P>
   GO FOR IT: This area revolves around closer John Wetteland. He
has had some costly blown saves, but, for the most part, he has
pitched well since getting his 300th save. They won't win anything
this year if they trade him.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' biggest disappointment in the bullpen is that
right-handers Tim Crabtree and Jeff Zimmerman haven't been as
dominant as they were last year. But both are young, healthy and
able to throw the ball 93 to 95 mph. If they recapture last year's
glory, they can pair with left-handers Mike Venafro and Doug Davis
and middleman Francisco Cordero to give the Rangers a formidable
bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   WAIT 'TIL NEXT YEAR: Wetteland has been worth every nickel the
Rangers have paid him, even if he has never had a save opportunity
in the playoffs. But he will be a free agent after the season. The
Rangers would get two draft picks as compensation if he leaves as a
free agent, but they should be able to get more through a trade.
</P>
<P>
   The right trade would give the Rangers a big head start on next
year. And, if they trade Wetteland, the Rangers could take a hard
look at Crabtree, Zimmerman, Cordero, or even Loaiza, as closer.
and decide if next year's closer is already on the team or if they
need to pursue Robb Nen. INFIELD
</P>
<P>
   GO FOR IT: Include catcher Ivan Rodriguez and designated hitter
David Segui with the four regular infielders, and the Rangers have
a championship unit. Certainly, Luis Alicea would have to maintain
his pace and third baseman Mike Lamb would have to improve his
defense. But if first baseman Rafael Palmeiro and shortstop Royce
Clayton pick up their offense a little bit, then the Rangers would
have what it takes here to win the division.
</P>
<P>
   WAIT 'TIL NEXT YEAR: Then there is Frank Catalanotto. If the
Rangers decide to start getting ready for next season, he has to
figure prominently in their plans.
</P>
<P>
   Alicea and Segui can become free agents, and Catalanotto is a
candidate to replace either. First, the Rangers must find out if he
can play defense well enough to play every day at second base. If
not, he could end up as the Rangers' designated hitter. He appears
to be a front-line offensive player. OUTFIELD
</P>
<P>
   GO FOR IT: The Rangers have not had much good news in the past
three weeks. But if there is one bright spot, it is that left
fielder Rusty Greer is healthy and at the top of his game again.
That does wonders for the Rangers' offense and could help Palmeiro
break out in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   But, by staying the course, the Rangers commit themselves to
Gabe Kapler in center field and the platoon of Dave Martinez and
Chad Curtis in right. Even with Greer playing well, this is not an
outfield that produces enough power for a championship team. Kapler
would really need a big second half for the Rangers to win.
</P>
<P>
   WAIT 'TIL NEXT YEAR: The Rangers' outfield is missing something,
and Ruben Mateo's broken leg was a major blow, both for now and
next season. It's not that he won't be back next season, but he's
missing four good months of development that might have allowed him
to move to the next level next year.
</P>
<P>
   Kapler plays hard and plays good defense, but his slugging
percentage is under .400, totally unacceptable in the American
League.
</P>
<P>
   If the Rangers scrap the season, finding an outfielder with some
pop would be among their priorities. But they could move Kapler
back to right, put Scarborough Green in center and see if Green can
develop into a front-line leadoff hitter. GO FOR IT 1. The New York
Yankees and Cleveland Indians are down. The league is wide-open.
The team that improves the most between now and the end of the
season will win the pennant.
</P>
<P>
   2. Darren Oliver, Esteban Loaiza, Jeff Zimmerman and Tim
Crabtree could recover the form that made them successful pitchers
last year. Those are four big ifs but a four-pitcher parley
improves the Rangers' chances tremendously.
</P>
<P>
   3. Even if Oliver and Loaiza continue to struggle, the Rangers
could make a run with a rotation that includes Doug Davis, Ryan
Glynn and Matt Perisho.
</P>
<P>
   4. They have a powerful offense that could get better if Rafael
Palmeiro, Royce Clayton and/or Gabe Kapler step it up in the second
half.
</P>
<P>
   5. The Rangers had a bad first half, and they are right around
.500. WAIT 'TIL NEXT YEAR 1. This team is not good enough to win
the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   2. A good general manager should be able to get something good
in return for John Wetteland.
</P>
<P>
   3. Taking a hard look at young players will give the Rangers a
better idea of how to proceed in the free-agent market.
</P>
<P>
   4. The offense could stumble if Ivan Rodriguez, David Segui and
Luis Alicea can't maintain torrid first-half paces.
</P>
<P>
   5. George Steinbrenner will buy the Yankees another pennant.
ANALYZING THE TRADING BLOCK
</P>
<P>
   1. Esteban Loaiza. He's all but gone. Most contending teams need
pitching. Even if the Rangers don't give up, they're all but
convinced one Ryan Glynn or Doug Davis could do as well as Loaiza
now and be better in the future. 2. John Wetteland. He might not be
gone, even if the Rangers fall out of the race. Wetteland is a team
leader, and the Rangers think it would be easier to develop some
young pitching with a dependable closer saving their victories. 3.
David Segui. He has been great, on and off the field. Trading him
could put more pressure on the younger players _ Mike Lamb, Gabe
Kapler and Frank Catalanotto _ at the bottom of the lineup. Plus,
while some teams can use a .340 hitter, it's unlikely they'll give
up a big-time prospect for Segui. 4. Darren Oliver. The Rangers
might be sorely tempted to trade him if they could find somebody to
take his contract, allowing Texas to move another young pitcher
into the rotation. First, Oliver has to show he's healthy. 5. Luis
Alicea. What a shame if it comes to this. The guy has been terrific
and is a great player to have on the team. But the Rangers might
want to take a look at Catalanotto. nn

THINGS BREAK RIGHT FOR RED SOX 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ All it will take, of course, is the next loss,
especially if (God forbid) Pedro Martinez is less than perfect
Thursday night against the New York Mets.
</P>
<P>
   But for the next three days, at least, the grumbling about the
Red Sox will pale compared to other local aggravations of the
moment, like finding a decent perch from which to watch the Tall
Ships. Even newcomer Ed Sprague, who was booed Sunday as if he were
a cousin of Izzy Alcantara, should catch some slack after a 7-2 win
over the Atlanta Braves Sunday sent the Sox into the All-Star break
on a winning note.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody's walking out of here in a bad mood,'' said catcher
Jason Varitek, who had three hits, all of which figured in the
scoring on a day when shortstop Nomar Garciaparra hit two home runs
for the second time in five games, Jose Offerman rediscovered the
triple, and Brian Daubach did a three-point turn himself. ``It's
nice to end with a win.''
</P>
<P>
   Imagine if the opposite had occurred. Instead of celebrating
what looks as if it might be the start of something big _
cast-aside knuckleballer Tim Wakefield has won three in a row since
being restored to the starting rotation _ someone might be
demanding an investigation of why outfielder Carl Everett is
allowed to show up 45 minutes after the rest of the team was
required to be in uniform, as he did Sunday. (``Not an issue,''
said Jimy Williams.)
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Everett received best wishes from all corners of the
clubhouse as he headed to Atlanta for his richly deserved first
All-Star appearance, where both he and Garciaparra could be in the
American League's starting lineup because of injuries to elected
starters Manny Ramirez and Alex Rodriguez. Yankees manager Joe
Torre has told New York writers that Everett will, indeed, start
for Ramirez. Derek Lowe, who pitched a 1-2-3 ninth, will be in the
AL bullpen as another first-timer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was listening to WEEI the other day,'' said Jeff Frye, who
spent another day as Trot Nixon's stand-in in right field, ``and I
heard people saying we're ruining their summer. Unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   Far too early, of course, to nail a ``Condemned'' sign on this
season. The Sox, who dodged a date with Greg Maddux Sunday when the
Braves' ace was winged during batting practice Saturday by a line
drive and scratched with a bruised right shoulder (also knocking
him out of the All-Star Game), collected 14 hits against Maddux's
replacement, Kevin Millwood, and two relievers to avoid a
three-game sweep by the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   They go into the break just two games over .500 (43-41), 2 1/2
games behind the Yankees in the AL East. They were 10 games over
.500 (49-39) and four games behind the Bombers at the break last
season. The big difference was in the wild-card standings. The Sox
were three games in front of the pack at this point last season;
they were five games back Sunday &UR;  &LR; night, and six teams were ahead
of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's nothing,'' said outfielder Troy O'Leary, referring to
the ground that has to be made up.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the end of the month, everybody should be back,'' said
O'Leary, whose second-inning single helped set up the Sox' first
run, ``and everybody here knows what we can do if we've got
everybody back.''
</P>
<P>
   Wakefield, of course, has been here all along, even if it has
been back among the rakes in Joe Mooney's toolshed. Wakefield, who
was mutinous after being used as mopup man in the Sox' 22-1 loss to
the Yankees, two days after he'd thrown 58 pitches, gave up a
second-inning home run to Reggie Sanders but otherwise limited the
Braves to just five singles and a walk in his seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   How important have Wakefield's three wins in a row been to the
cause? Since May 30, Sox starters have won just seven games _ Ramon
Martinez has two, brother Pedro and rookie Paxton Crawford one
each, and Wakefield three.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not trying to prove a point,'' Wakefield said. ``I just
want to be as consistent as I can.''
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra, who walked and scored on Varitek's single in the
second, homered to make it 2-1 in the third. Offerman, who has led
the AL in triples the last two seasons, hit his first triple since
the calendar rolled over to score two more runs in the fourth. In
the fifth, Daubach's triple, Garciaparra's second home run, and
Varitek's RBI double made it a 7-2 breeze.
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra now has four home runs in his last five games after
hitting seven in his first 62 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think home runs are as important as driving in runs,''
Williams said. ``It doesn't matter. I don't look at home runs. I
look at RBIs and runs scored.''
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra has knocked in 59 runs, second to Everett's 69, and
his 47 runs scored are also second to Everett (53).
</P>
<P>
   ``Nomar knows how to play the game,'' O'Leary said. ``If we need
a home run, he'll hit it. If we need a base hit or an RBI, he'll
get it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sprague, the infielder acquired last weekend from San Diego,
went hitless on the weekend (0 for 9) and is batting just .118 (4
for 34) since switching coasts. The sellout crowd of 33,018 let him
know it noticed by booing each successive at-bat.

DODGERS WASTE FINE JOB BY PARK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ In a frustration-filled season, why would the final
game before the All-Star break be any different?
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Dodgers mixed solid pitching by Chan Ho Park
with more anemic hitting Sunday. The results were bitter: a 2-0
shutout by the AL West-leading Mariners before a sellout crowd of
45,251 at Safeco Field. This was the second time this season the
Dodgers have been shut out in consecutive games.
</P>
<P>
   Park gave up just three hits in seven innings, and all were to
catcher Joe Oliver, including a two-run home run in the second
inning. Park (9-6), foiled in his fourth try at 10 wins, gave up
just one earned run with six strikeouts and three walks, and
retired 16 of 18 Seattle batters in one stretch.
</P>
<P>
   The only other hit Seattle got was an Edgar Martinez single off
Antonio Osuna in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would think you give up two runs, you should have a
ballgame,'' catcher Jim Leyritz said.
</P>
<P>
   Not this season. Not after suspensions, injuries and overall
inconsistent play.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday was just another day at the ballpark for the Dodgers, who
with a $90 million payroll didn't think they would stand 44-42 at
the break and trail Arizona by six games. That's a lot better than
39-47 and 10 behind last year, but it's far below what they
expected at season's start.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel we're a better team,'' Gary Sheffield said. ``We don't
play with a lot of enthusiasm. We don't take it to the other team
and put them on their heels. Can't play the whole season like that.
Can't wait 'till September thinking we're going to catch them.
</P>
<P>
   ``This late in the season, you'd think we'd pick it up a
notch.''
</P>
<P>
   All general manager Kevin Malone and manager Davey Johnson can
do is shrug their shoulders. Malone knows the July 31 trading
deadline approaches, but at this point, any available players
wouldn't be ``upgrades.'' Nor is he sure there's enough depth in
the farm system to make a deal.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has had to deal with Chad Kreuter's eight-game
suspension, injuries to seven pitchers, including Kevin Brown and
Jeff Shaw, and five position players, including the still-disabled
Devon White.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, there are more suspensions to be served, Mark Grudzielanek
and F.P. Santangelo are sick and Todd Hundley has a bruised thumb.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a lot of adversity,'' Malone said in echoing the
season's theme. ``That's why in the second half we'll perform
better. We've got a better team than we've performed. ... Talent
rises to the occasion, and the desire to win. Players will elevate
their performance to the next level. It becomes a pride issue.
They're frustrated.''
</P>
<P>
   Park has reason to be frustrated. By many accounts, he made just
one bad pitch and Oliver made him pay with his drive to left. He
drove in David Bell, who reached on Shawn Green's error.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the best hitter in the world today,'' Park said of
Oliver. ``He was 3 for 3: a curve down (for) a double, 3-2 curve
(for) a single; an 0-2 fastball and he hit (a) home run. ... I
pitched good. I concentrated one pitch at a time. ... I believed
we'd be back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hard luck. Very hard luck.''
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the Dodgers woes was Seattle starter Jamie Moyer
(8-3), who scattered seven hits and struck out eight in seven
innings.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth inning, Sheffield walked and Eric Karros singled
with one out, but Leyritz hit into a double play.
</P>
<P>
   In the seventh, Mike Metcalfe got his first major-league hit,
and Adrian Beltre - who Johnson placed second in the lineup in an
attempt to get him to shorten his swing - also singled with none
out. But Moyer got Green to fly out, caught Sheffield looking and
induced a pop fly out of Karros.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Paniagua pitched a perfect eighth with a strikeout, and
Kazuhiro Sasaki pitched a perfect ninth for this 19th save and
ninth in his past nine games.

SAMPRAS BRINGS DOWN HOUSE WITH RECORD WIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Darkness had just about put a lid on the sodden gloom
that scarred the day, and the figure below on the faded green turf
was virtually an apparition. Then, suddenly, startlingly, he was
fully illuminated as the air crackled with flashing lights in every
corner of Centre Court, like beacons to eternity.
</P>
<P>
   The sedate Wimbledon nights never had been punctured like this
before, but tennis's grandest amphitheater never had seen anything
like this before.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end, it was just a great moment,'' said Pete Sampras.
``It was an amazing setting because it was getting dark, the
flashes. The roar of the crowd was something that I'll never
forget.''
</P>
<P>
   They were saluting a luminous achievement, because Sampras had
just become the most bemedaled man in tennis annals. His 6-7
(10-12), 7-6 (7-5), 6-4, 6-2, victory over valiant Patrick Rafter _
extended into the dying light by rain delays (2 hours 57 minutes)
that lasted almost as long as the match (2:58) _ represented his
seventh Wimbledon and 13th Grand Slam crown.
</P>
<P>
   With that, he technically tied Willie Renshaw for the most men's
singles titles here, but in fact, Sampras stands alone, for Renshaw
accumulated his gold trophies in the 1880s when the defending
champion got a bye into the final, and in winning five of his
championships, he played only one match.
</P>
<P>
   No such numerical nuances accompany Sampras's other achievement
as he eclipsed Roy Emerson for the most victories ever in the four
major championships _ Wimbledon and the US, French, and Australian
opens.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras, the shy, almost diffident 28-year-old Californian, is
the antithesis of the Australian bon vivant he shoved out of the
archives. And his entrance into history was as restrained and
methodical as the man. At his request, his parents, Sam and Georgia
_ who had not seen him play a Grand Slam final since he lost in the
1992 US Open _ had flown in from Los Angeles to mark the occasion
even though watching him play in person makes them too nervous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told myself if I got to the final here or any major (with a
chance to break the Grand Slam record) that I wanted them to be
here,'' said Sampras. ``I'm glad they both came.''
</P>
<P>
   But they are people who have ``always kept their distance,''
according to their son, and this was reflected in their
inconspicuous seating arrangements Sunday _ in the southeast
stands, opposite the highly visible box reserved for players'
friends and families.
</P>
<P>
   So when Sampras went to share the accomplishment with his
parents, it was in contrast to the euphoric skip through the stands
Venus Williams had taken the previous day to punctuate her women's
singles victory.
</P>
<P>
   After Rafter launched a return wide for match point at 8:57
p.m., Sampras bent over and lowered his head, as if overcome by the
magnitude of the moment. Then, as the camera flashes sparkled in
the gloaming, he slowly raised his arms over his head and walked
almost aimlessly about. He looked up into the VIP box where his
coach, Paul Annacone, and fiancee, Bridget Wilson, sat. Then he
turned, almost as if in a daze, and headed into the stands on the
opposite side.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked over at my box,'' he said. ``They're all pointing to
my parents, that I should go up there. It took me a while to find
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Once he did, a path was cleared for him, and he slowly,
methodically, made his way up, step by careful step, just as he had
progressed to the top rung of tennis with his Wimbledons and his
four US and two Australian opens. When he reached his folks, he
hugged them vigorously and began crying. This intensely private man
had shed tears in public only once before _ after discovering at
the 1995 Australian Open that his beloved coach, Tim Gullikson, had
contracted terminal brain cancer.
</P>
<P>
   But these were so wonderfully different, tears of joy for
himself and his family, and of relief that he had overcome a back
injury and then tendinitis of his lower left leg to ring up his
fourth straight Wimbledon title.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very emotional for a number of reasons,'' he said. ``The
past week and a half, the fact that my parents are here, obviously
the title and how important this tournament is to me, just all kind
of hit me in the end when I won.''
</P>
<P>
   It had seemed as if the end wouldn't come, at least not on this
day, and the suspicion was that Emerson was at his tennis school in
Gstaad, Switzerland, doing a rain dance to delay Sampras's reign
dance.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras and Rafter's entrance was deferred for more than an
hour. Then, sandwiched around a 26-minute delay, they managed to
get in 34 minutes of tennis, during which they battled evenly, to
4-4, deuce.
</P>
<P>
   There followed a 2:31 downpour during which Sampras figured he
wouldn't take the court again until Monday and Rafter had his
travel plans ruined; he was supposed to catch a 10 p.m. flight to
Brisbane, where he's headed for Australian Davis Cup duty.
</P>
<P>
   Once they returned to the court, it looked as if the weather
signaled Sampras's doom. Each man had said that how he handled the
other's serve would determine his fate. Sure enough, neither could
break serve through the first two sets. So the tiebreakers became
monumental. The first one stretched to 12-10, Rafter's favor, and
the two-time US Open champion, who has made an expeditious recovery
from October rotator cuff surgery on his right shoulder, seemed
ready to put the match and Sampras away when he jumped out to a 4-1
lead in the second breaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all choke,'' said Sampras. ``No matter who you are, you
just get in the heat of the moment. I felt like I was outplaying
him the first set. I didn't get the break. I was outplaying him a
little bit in the second. Comes down to a tiebreaker. Anything can
happen. Just roll the dice.''
</P>
<P>
   They came up ``7'' for Sampras, who won six of the next seven
points _ and the set.
</P>
<P>
   That turned the match for Sampras, who had felt Rafter was about
to make him extinct. He didn't realize that Rafter wasn't so sure
about that.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I felt very confident in being up at two sets to love, I
guess I wouldn't have been nervous,'' said Rafter. ``I knew I still
had to do some work. Probably made me a little bit tight.''
</P>
<P>
   And Sampras gradually loosened up. After surviving the set, he
punched the air and exhorted himself _ ``Yeah!'' _ a most
uncharacteristic gesture for him. He went on to post the first
break of the match at 2-2 in the third and served out the set. And
Rafter was unable to protect the record of Emerson, his fellow
swashbuckling Aussie, as he was broken at 2-2 and 4-2 in the
fourth.
</P>
<P>
   By now, the two were playing against nature's deadline, with
``maybe 10 minutes of light left,'' according to Sampras.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't need them. And then came the light show, which even
Rafter, the ultimate good sport, conceded was ``pretty cool.''
</P>
<P>
   The runner-up believes Sampras's record will have a void until
he rounds it out with a French Open. ``But Pete in my eyes,'' said
Rafter, ``still goes down as the greatest player ever.''
</P>
<P>
   The proclamation fairly lit up the sky.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One casualty of the rainy afternoon was the women's doubles
final, which was postponed until Monday. Venus and Serena Williams,
seeded No. 8, will play fourth-seeded Julie-Halard Decugis and Ai
Sugiyama at noon London time.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ A young woman walking from church to an East Side
subway station suffered a fractured skull Sunday afternoon when she
was struck from behind by a man wielding a melon-sized chunk of
concrete, the authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The attack on the woman, Tiffany F. Goldberg, 25, occurred
minutes after noon. It was the latest frightening and seemingly
random assault in a public place in Manhattan, and bore uncanny
similarities to the attack last November on Nicole Barrett, a young
woman from Texas who was attacked in Midtown by a man who smashed
her skull with a 6{-pound paving stone.
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Brown, who lives directly across the street from the
scene of Sunday's crime, came out of her building moments after
Goldberg was struck. She said an off-duty firefighter, who had
leapt from his car as the attack occurred, began helping Goldberg
as she toppled to the sidewalk in front of an electrical
substation.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg was bleeding heavily, she said, and the firefighter was
cradling her head and trying to stanch the flow.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was just floored,'' Brown said. ``But she was conscious,
because she was squeezing the hand of this guy who was helping
her.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg, who moved to New York four years ago and is a waitress
at the Bryant Park Grill in Manhattan, was taken to Bellevue
Hospital Center; the authorities there said she had survived the
attack with surprisingly few injuries. Wes Anglin, the hospital
administrator on duty, said she was in stable condition Sunday
night and described her as ``alert and oriented.''
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. Andrew McInnis, a police spokesman, said that the stone
struck her directly in the back of the head, fracturing her skull,
and that she also suffered two chipped teeth and lacerations when
she fell face-first to the ground. But there was no apparent sign
of neurological damage, the authorities said, and Goldberg was held
for observation and to wait for a specialist to interpret the
results of a CT-scan.
</P>
<P>
   McInnis also said that although Goldberg had no recollection of
the attack, she had remained conscious throughout the afternoon and
was strong enough to be interviewed by detectives. She had also
been able to talk by telephone with her father in Madison, Wis.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has talked with many people, but she is unaware of exactly
what happened, because she was hit from behind,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Like Barrett, Goldberg, 25, was not robbed, although on Sunday
night the authorities said the attacker apparently reached for her
handbag before hitting her with the concrete. And, as in the
earlier assault, the man who fractured Goldberg's skull ran away
and was not immediately apprehended.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities declined to discuss their investigation in
detail but said that they were seeking a man, believed to be in his
20s to 40s, who was about 5 feet 6 inches tall and 150 pounds, and
was wearing a bright gold shirt at the time of the attack. They
also said the chunk of concrete, apparently from a shattered
sidewalk, was recovered on the street. It weighed 3 to 5 pounds,
the police said.
</P>
<P>
   Police supervisors said the investigation's initial focus was on
the homeless, because two witnesses said the man who struck
Goldberg appeared disheveled. Detectives were seen late Sunday at
the nearby Bellevue Men's Shelter. Bernard Samson, a shelter
supervisor, said the police took a man into custody for questioning
Sunday about 5:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. Elias Nikas, a police spokesman, said the man had merely
been questioned briefly and was not a suspect. ``The person they
interviewed was released,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The police also said the investigation was following other
leads.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not just attacking the homeless, we're looking at many
possibilities,'' McInnis said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the buildings on the block where Goldberg was attacked
have security cameras pointed toward the sidewalks. But the two
cameras at the electrical substation are still being installed and
were not working Sunday, said Sandy Miller, a spokeswoman for the
utility company Con Edison.
</P>
<P>
   However, Miller said, the police had obtained videotape from
another building. ``There's an adjacent building with a camera
working, and I am told that the police have a videotape of the
entire attack,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The police declined to comment about any videotape.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Goldberg, who lives in Manhattan, had moved to New York four
years ago, the police said. She had lived in Brooklyn until
recently and planned to enroll at Columbia University this fall.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday she had attended the 10:30 a.m. service at the Marble
Collegiate Church and lingered afterward for coffee and pastry.
McInnis said she planned to pick up a newspaper and return home by
subway, and was attacked just after leaving the church.
</P>
<P>
   About 12:10 p.m. she was walking on the sidewalk when the man
slammed the concrete into her head. Brown, who arrived seconds
later, described a disturbing scene: a young woman, stylishly
dressed in a blue sleeveless top and black pants, sprawled on the
ground, struggling through the disorientation and blood, trying to
sit up. The firefighter was holding her head. He was calmly urging
her to stay down.
</P>
<P>
   McInnis said that given the severity of the attack, the outcome
was surprising. ``She's conscious,'' he said. ``It appears she's
going to be fine.''

SCIOSCIA: DODGER STADIUM RETURN NO PROBLEM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GORDON VERRELL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Even though he spent 13 years as a player, two
as a coach and two more as an instructor with the Los Angeles
Dodgers, Angels manager Mike Scioscia said he expects no problem
figuring out which dugout to go to Thursday when Anaheim begins a
three-game interleague series at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``After some of those collisions I had at home plate, I wasn't
always sure which dugout was ours,'' Scioscia said Sunday. ``But
this shouldn't be a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia said he got over any nervousness about glimpsing Dodger
Blue for the first time since leaving the organization last year
when the Dodgers played in Anaheim in June.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are still a lot of close ties ... with guys I played
with, like Eric Karros and Dave Hansen,'' Scioscia said, ``and guys
I coached, like Paul LaDuca. (Coach) Rick Dempsey and I go back a
long way. And Claude Osteen was my pitching coach last year at
Albuquerque.
</P>
<P>
   ``That part of it is strange, seeing those people on the other
side. But as far as preparing our club to play them, they're just
another club.''
</P>
<P>
   Merk perks up: Scioscia, on left-hander Kent Mercker, still
recovering from a cerebral hemorrhage suffered nearly two months
ago:
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all excited about what he has accomplished. That first
day we visited him in the hospital, ... if somebody had told me
then that he'd be pitching again in the major leagues in two or
three months, I'd have said they were crazy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so encouraging seeing him. But, it's like the first week
of spring training for him. He's got to keep going, and maintain.''
</P>
<P>
   Another left-hander, Scott Schoeneweis, disabled since June 17
because of a strained right rib cage, moved closer to getting back
into the starting rotation with a strong showing in a three-inning
simulated game Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Schoeneweis didn't seem overly impressed with his 45-pitch
workout - ``All a part of getting back,'' he said - but Scioscia
termed the session ``great.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shame he wasted so many pitches,'' Scioscia kidded.
``We could have used him (Sunday night). It was very encouraging.
He had great stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Schoeneweis, who was 5-5 with a 5.08 ERA in 14 starts before he
was hurt, will make at least two rehab starts, the first one Friday
for Lake Elsinore. If all goes well, he'll be back with the Angels
in two more weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Around the horn: Ken Hill and Kent Bottenfield will start the
Angels' first two games after the All-Star break, Thursday and
Friday nights at Dodger Stadium. Rookie left-hander Seth Etherton,
recalled last week from Edmonton, will start Saturday. ... Colorado
entered Sunday evening's game as the No. 1 NL team hitting with
runners in scoring position: .326. Yet, in the first two games
against the Angels, the Rockies were just 2 for 18 hitting with
runners at second or third base.

STEWART DEDICATES WIN TO IRWIN 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUDON, N.H. _ You know what? This is the way it should have
ended, in leaden skies with the rain falling to bring a premature
halt to a race that was frustratingly inconclusive, and,
ultimately, flawed.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Stewart won the race and money at the New England 300 at
Sunday's New Hampshire International Speedway, but a good time was
not necessarily had by all. From the minute Kenny Irwin's car
slammed into the wall at Turn 3 Friday, everything changed. In a
better world, everyone would have gone home, right then and there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked at that spot more than once today,'' said third-place
finisher Mark Martin, alluding to the infamous Turn 3 where Irwin
lost his life in a practice run. ``I'm not going to elaborate for
you, but more than once I did look at those skid marks.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be untruthful to suggest that Irwin's death meant
nothing. Each competitor had a decal in memory of Irwin slapped on
the driver's side door. Bishop Michael Cote of the Diocese of Maine
made immediate references to the deaths of both Irwin and Adam
Petty, who was killed on that same turn two months ago, during his
invocation. There was an Air Force flyover that supposedly paid
symbolic respect, assuming you were versed in Air Force customs.
But it took grand marshal Ken Squier two tries to make any allusion
to the tragic deaths. The wall where Irwin's car made contact has
been freshly painted (frequent re-paintings, we were told, is track
policy). And how is it remotely possible that the American flag on
display was not flying at half-mast?
</P>
<P>
   I'm sorry, but the overriding feeling conveyed by both NASCAR
and track officials was: ``Business as usual.'' They certainly
could have dispensed with the balloons at the start of the race.
Oh, and did anyone ever hear of black armbands?
</P>
<P>
   Death at a NASCAR event is a messy topic, and death at New
Hampshire International Speedway is a particularly unsavory item
now that two drivers have gone to their final rewards at the same
treacherous turn within two months. The drivers suddenly have
safety issues with NHIS.
</P>
<P>
   Should that turn be better-banked coming off a long
straightaway? Some people say yes. Others say it's a bogus issue,
that there are many tracks similarly configured and that what
happened to Petty and Irwin adds up to a totally improbable
coincidence.
</P>
<P>
   The denial policy is easy for those people to adopt. They know
that lots of people will show up _ 101,000 in this instance _ and
that few of them have spent much time dwelling on either the Petty
or Irwin tragedies. The great risk these brave men take racing
these cars at tremendous speeds is the lure. If one of them cracks
up every now and then, well, it's supposed to be a dangerous
enterprise. If everybody could do it, racing wouldn't be such a big
deal.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't so easy for the drivers. A fatality is a graphic
reminder of their own mortality. There was hardly a man among the
43 starters for whom this race was not just a little less important
than he would have thought a week ago, and that most specifically
includes the man who won.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a long weekend,'' said Stewart, ``and I would like
to dedicate this race to Kenny Irwin.''
</P>
<P>
   To Stewart, Irwin was not just another driver on the Winston Cup
circuit. Irwin was his personal measuring stick. ``I spent the last
nine years competing with him,'' said Stewart. ``I spent more time
with him than I did with my parents. We had our ups and downs, but
it wasn't much different than it was with my fiancee. In the end,
we always had respect. It wasn't a bitter rivalry, but it was a
rivalry.''
</P>
<P>
   At every event, Stewart would have one question during
qualifying: ``How did Kenny do?''
</P>
<P>
   So, victory or no victory, Stewart will not recall this trip to
Loudon with great fondness. ``Friday was difficult, and Saturday
was even worse because we all were able to get into race mode and I
was actually a little frustrated about that,'' said Stewart. ``And
it was just a weird feeling to get into a racing car today.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart altered his typical prerace routine. ``I watched all the
tributes on TNN and ESPN,'' he said. ``I didn't want to miss any of
them, because Kenny deserved them.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone had his own Irwin-related grief. For runner-up Joe
Nemechek, it opened wounds from having lost a brother in a crash in
Homestead, Fla., three years ago. ``You find yourself asking why so
many young drivers have this happen,'' he said. ``You just realize
that the Lord works in mysterious ways.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a wake-up call, a reality check,'' said Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   That said, the Irwin mishap is not likely to make ex-drivers out
of any of these men. They all know the risk; it is a given. These
are totally confident men who are immensely proud of their skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would rather drive 190 miles an hour at NHIS all day long
than run a half hour with some of the morons on the street,''
Stewart said. ``Our crews do everything they can to make us as safe
as possible in our cars. In fact, I feel for Kenny's crew. Someone
had to go home on Friday saying, `Did I make a mistake?' And we all
make mistakes. The day we don't make mistakes, this sport will
become boring.''
</P>
<P>
   What these men deserve is a fair shake from the tracks
themselves. If New Hampshire International Speedway is
fundamentally unsound, then someone had damn well better do
something to make it sound before another big race takes place. The
big boys are returning here Sept. 17 for the New Hampshire 300. It
would be nice if all the stories have to do with the competition,
and the competition only.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin's funeral will take place in Indianapolis Wednesday. May
it be the last one ever held for a fallen NASCAR driver.

 ENGLAND 300-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUDON, N.H. _ The first time he steered his car through Turn 3
in Sunday's New England 300 at New Hampshire International
Speedway, Tony Stewart made sure he was focused on the task at
hand.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart tried not to become distracted by thoughts of Kenny
Irwin, a former sprint car teammate and NASCAR Winston Cup rival
who was killed Friday in a violent wall crash that was hauntingly
similar to the death of 19-year-old Adam Petty _ in the same corner
_ May 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't look for the skid marks and they had painted the
wall, so I didn't see the spot on the wall, anyway,'' Stewart said.
``To be honest, the first time around there I was just trying to
get a tachometer reading. I kind of made sure I was getting a tach
reading.''
</P>
<P>
   When he toured the 1.058-mile oval at NHIS for the last time
Sunday, and led the field through that fateful corner under caution
on Lap 273, Stewart admitted, ``It was kind of hard to see out of
the car because of the raindrops on the windshield. But there were
periods of the day where I caught myself looking over there. It was
just hard. It wasn't so much what happened, it's the end result
that bothered me.''
</P>
<P>
   The rain proved heaven-sent for Stewart after the driver of the
No. 20 Home Depot Pontiac sweated out two delays and gambled on
fuel mileage to put himself in a position to be declared the winner
of the 300-lap race (which drew 101,000) when NASCAR officials
called it 27 laps from the finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to dedicate this win to Kenny Irwin,'' said a
glassy-eyed Stewart, his voice cracking. ``We were teammates and I
knew him and raced with him for the last nine years. We weren't
always on the best terms with each other, but we always respected
each other in a race car and what each other could do in a race
car.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't the first time I've made this quote, but he is part
of the reason I got to Winston Cup because he made me become a
better race car driver. I had to beat him every week, and he was as
tough as anybody around, week in and week out, no matter whether it
was a sprint car, Silver Crown (car), or a midget.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the guy that I had to beat every week to win the
race.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory, Stewart's second at NHIS after a 1998 Indy Racing
League triumph, was especially redemptive for crew chief Greg
Zipadelli, a native of Berlin, Conn. Zipadelli took responsibility
for a fuel shortage that cost Stewart a victory here in last year's
race when he ran out of gas with two laps to go and finished 10th
behind three-time Loudon winner Jeff Burton.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, it seemed Zipadelli was doomed to suffer a similar fate
when Stewart pitted out of sequence with the leaders on Lap 28. He
then inherited the lead on Lap 87 when Geoffrey Bodine pitted under
green. Then Zipadelli and Stewart were forced to agonize over their
next move when the race was red-flagged for almost 52 minutes by
rain on Lap 132 _ 18 laps from the halfway mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``That first red flag, I'm sure that probably took three or four
years off Greg Zipadelli's life,'' Stewart said, ``because you're
leading the race. What do you do? Do you come in and pit under the
yellow like everybody else? Do you stay out and hope that when it
goes back to green you are only going to run 18 laps to get to the
halfway and it rains, or what?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a tough situation for him,'' he added. ``Luckily,
all I have to do is drive the race car. He is the guy who's got to
have all the weight on his shoulders of whether it is the right
call or the wrong call.''
</P>
<P>
   In this case, Zipadelli opted to keep Stewart out to preserve
their track position, until they were forced to surrender it with a
green-flag pit on Lap 187. He wound up falling out of the Top 20,
but slowly worked his way to the front under a series of green-flag
stops by the lead pack. Stewart, who led twice for a total of 156
laps, inherited the lead for good when Bobby Labonte pitted under
green on Lap 218.
</P>
<P>
   With runner-up Joe Nemechek also in need of fuel to make it to
the finish, and third-place finisher Mark Martin ready to go the
distance, Stewart and Co. knew they were going to need a miracle to
pull out their third NASCAR victory of the season.
</P>
<P>
   When the dark and swollen clouds began weeping on Lap 268,
Stewart knew that Irwin had delivered some raindrops that induced
the fifth and final caution of the day. Five laps later, NASCAR
officials red-flagged the race for the second and final time under
a steady rain.
</P>
<P>
   The shower had a cleansing effect on Stewart and Zipadelli, who
were able to wash their hands of last year's messy outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trust me, I was happy to see that rain come,'' said Stewart,
who won a rained-out race at Michigan June 11. ``The rain was what
hurt us to begin with, and the rain came back and justified itself.
Do I feel bad about winning a race this way? Absolutely not. We
were the fastest car all day.''

NASCAR RACE NOT SHORT ON EMOTION 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS-2   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<P>
   LOUDON, N.H. _ You know what? This is the way it should have
ended, in leaden skies with the rain falling to bring a premature
halt to a race that was frustratingly inconclusive, and,
ultimately, flawed.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Stewart won the race and money at the New England 300 at
Sunday's New Hampshire International Speedway, but a good time was
not necessarily had by all. From the minute Kenny Irwin's car
slammed into the wall at Turn 3 Friday, everything changed. In a
better world, everyone would have gone home, right then and there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked at that spot more than once today,'' said third-place
finisher Mark Martin, alluding to the infamous Turn 3 where Irwin
lost his life in a practice run. ``I'm not going to elaborate for
you, but more than once I did look at those skid marks.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be untruthful to suggest that Irwin's death meant
nothing. Each competitor had a decal in memory of Irwin slapped on
the driver's side door. Bishop Michael Cote of the Diocese of Maine
made immediate references to the deaths of both Irwin and Adam
Petty, who was killed on that same turn two months ago, during his
invocation. There was an Air Force flyover that supposedly paid
symbolic respect, assuming you were versed in Air Force customs.
But it took grand marshal Ken Squier two tries to make any allusion
to the tragic deaths. The wall where Irwin's car made contact has
been freshly painted (frequent re-paintings, we were told, is track
policy). And how is it remotely possible that the American flag on
display was not flying at half-mast?
</P>
<P>
   I'm sorry, but the overriding feeling conveyed by both NASCAR
and track officials was: ``Business as usual.'' They certainly
could have dispensed with the balloons at the start of the race.
Oh, and did anyone ever hear of black armbands?
</P>
<P>
   Death at a NASCAR event is a messy topic, and death at New
Hampshire International Speedway is a particularly unsavory item
now that two drivers have gone to their final rewards at the same
treacherous turn within two months. The drivers suddenly have
safety issues with NHIS.
</P>
<P>
   Should that turn be better-banked coming off a long
straightaway? Some people say yes. Others say it's a bogus issue,
that there are many tracks similarly configured and that what
happened to Petty and Irwin adds up to a totally improbable
coincidence.
</P>
<P>
   The denial policy is easy for those people to adopt. They know
that lots of people will show up _ 101,000 in this instance _ and
that few of them have spent much time dwelling on either the Petty
or Irwin tragedies. The great risk these brave men take racing
these cars at tremendous speeds is the lure. If one of them cracks
up every now and then, well, it's supposed to be a dangerous
enterprise. If everybody could do it, racing wouldn't be such a big
deal.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't so easy for the drivers. A fatality is a graphic
reminder of their own mortality. There was hardly a man among the
43 starters for whom this race was not just a little less important
than he would have thought a week ago, and that most specifically
includes the man who won.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a long weekend,'' said Stewart, ``and I would like
to dedicate this race to Kenny Irwin.''
</P>
<P>
   To Stewart, Irwin was not just another driver on the Winston Cup
circuit. Irwin was his personal measuring stick. ``I spent the last
nine years competing with him,'' said Stewart. ``I spent more time
with him than I did with my parents. We had our ups and downs, but
it wasn't much different than it was with my fiancee. In the end,
we always had respect. It wasn't a bitter rivalry, but it was a
rivalry.''
</P>
<P>
   At every event, Stewart would have one question during
qualifying: ``How did Kenny do?''
</P>
<P>
   So, victory or no victory, Stewart will not recall this trip to
Loudon with great fondness. ``Friday was difficult, and Saturday
was even worse because we all were able to get into race mode and I
was actually a little frustrated about that,'' said Stewart. ``And
it was just a weird feeling to get into a racing car today.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart altered his typical prerace routine. ``I watched all the
tributes on TNN and ESPN,'' he said. ``I didn't want to miss any of
them, because Kenny deserved them.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone had his own Irwin-related grief. For runner-up Joe
Nemechek, it opened wounds from having lost a brother in a crash in
Homestead, Fla., three years ago. ``You find yourself asking why so
many young drivers have this happen,'' he said. ``You just realize
that the Lord works in mysterious ways.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a wake-up call, a reality check,'' said Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   That said, the Irwin mishap is not likely to make ex-drivers out
of any of these men. They all know the risk; it is a given. These
are totally confident men who are immensely proud of their skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would rather drive 190 miles an hour at NHIS all day long
than run a half hour with some of the morons on the street,''
Stewart said. ``Our crews do everything they can to make us as safe
as possible in our cars. In fact, I feel for Kenny's crew. Someone
had to go home on Friday saying, `Did I make a mistake?' And we all
make mistakes. The day we don't make mistakes, this sport will
become boring.''
</P>
<P>
   What these men deserve is a fair shake from the tracks
themselves. If New Hampshire International Speedway is
fundamentally unsound, then someone had damn well better do
something to make it sound before another big race takes place. The
big boys are returning here Sept. 17 for the New Hampshire 300. It
would be nice if all the stories have to do with the competition,
and the competition only.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin's funeral will take place in Indianapolis Wednesday. May
it be the last one ever held for a fallen NASCAR driver.

GARCIAPARRA A PERFECT MATCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Two more homers Sunday. Nomar Garciaparra heads to the
All-Star Game batting .389.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, there never has been a ballplayer like him. Red Sox
manager Jimy Williams said it best two years ago when he observed,
``It's like he's been here before.''
</P>
<P>
   True. Sometimes it seems as if Garciaparra is the reincarnation
of Tris Speaker or Rogers Hornsby _ an old hardball soul in a young
man's perfect baseball body. Notice the Nomar hairstyle _ it's
young Ted Williams, 1939. Remember the 1908 uniforms the Sox wore
three years ago? The old threads made Mo Vaughn look like Notorious
B.I.G. Garciaparra looked perfect, the old-timey player in the
old-timey uniform.
</P>
<P>
   Within the reasonable margins of baseball performance, he has
been nothing less than perfect in 3 1/2 seasons here. Fred Lynn was
able to do that for a while, and Carl Yastrzemski had a perfect
season in 1967, but the Red Sox never have had a player like this.
Unlike Ted Williams, there've been no feuds with the fans or the
media. There's been no controversy. And he plays shortstop to boot.
</P>
<P>
   Take your Jeters, A-Rods, and Vizquels. You can have Griffey,
Bonds, Bagwell, Chipper, and Walker. Mike McGwire, Sammy Soo-ser.
Take them, too.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't matter what Yankees manager Joe Torre decides when he
names a replacement starter for fan-favorite shortstop Alex
Rodriguez (concussion) for Tuesday's star-fest in Atlanta. Give me
one pick in the worldwide pool of talent and I'll start my 2000
All-Star team with Garciaparra _ the perfect baseball player.
</P>
<P>
   Less than four years into his Boston career, he's already a
candidate for the Hub sports pantheon that includes only Bill
Russell, Larry Bird, Bobby Orr, and Ted Williams. Sure, he needs to
do it longer (a couple of championships wouldn't hurt, though Teddy
Ballgame never got a ring), but when is Nomie going to furnish the
slightest hint that he is anything but the perfect player?
</P>
<P>
   It's been more than 500 games now and we haven't seen a flaw
yet. He's had some fielding slumps, and he throws on the run more
than some would like, but that only speaks highly of his
fearlessness. At times maybe he could be a little more patient at
the plate. But the worst thing anyone's said about Garciaparra thus
far is that he works out too much and might have trouble staying
off the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   Wow. There's a rip. This guy could be a true immortal if only
he'd stop that Navy Seal routine that produces Spiderman in Spikes
with 5 percent body fat.
</P>
<P>
   Leading the struggling Red Sox to a much-needed 7-2 victory over
the Braves Sunday, he hit two homers in a game for the second time
in five days and the 14th time in his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a true superstar,'' said Braves manager Bobby Cox. ``I
focus on him up there. I don't even look at our pitcher when he's
up there at the plate.''
</P>
<P>
   This man who hates statistics has eye-popping numbers. He was
Rookie of the Year. He won a batting title (.357) in his third
season. A .322 career hitter, he's averaged 30 homers, 41 doubles,
and 108 RBIs in his first three seasons and enters the break with
12 homers, 28 doubles, and 55 RBIs despite missing 16 games. In 13
postseason games, he's hitting .383 with seven homers and 20 RBIs.
Defensively, he's going to make more errors than some of his
contemporaries, but some of that is because he takes more chances.
</P>
<P>
   By now every child in Red Sox Nation knows that Nomar is not
about numbers.
</P>
<P>
   His teammates like him because he is about winning. Most
ballplayers won't admit it, but they'd rather go 4 for 4 in a loss
than 0 for 4 in a win. It's impossible to get inside anyone's head,
but everything we've seen and heard from Garciaparra indicates that
he is the rare exception. His words and actions indicate he'd take
the 0 for 4 in a win anytime. He hit a harmless fly ball for the
final out of Friday's 5-3 loss to the Braves, yet he ran the ball
out as if he were bound for an inside-the-park homer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's like that, he really is,'' said manager Williams. ``He
plays the game hard, he practices right, he's always on time.
Everything. He plays with respect for his teammates and the team
concept.''
</P>
<P>
   Fans love him because he loves them back. Garciaparra's maniacal
ritual includes autograph time every day _ after batting practice,
before stretching _ down by the first base tarp. When the Sox were
beaten in the playoffs by Cleveland in '98 and New York in '99,
Nomar was last to leave the field. Like Springsteen devoting time
to fans behind the stage, Garciaparra stayed around to thank the
faithful masses who'd supported the team all season.
</P>
<P>
   He says the right things about team, fans, and family. He talks
up his parents, his sisters, and his brother. He appreciates the
advantages he had and encourages young people to make the most of
their abilities. He's never going to be a media darling, but that
only makes him a bigger favorite with the front office, teammates,
and fans. He's like a Miss America contestant who wants to save the
whales and end world hunger.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't matter if he starts in Atlanta Tuesday night. Along
with Pedro Martinez, Carl Everett, and Derek Lowe, the Red Sox are
sending the perfect baseball player to the All-Star Game.

WAKEFIELD'S KNUCKLER HAS KEPT RED SOX AFLOAT 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-WAKEFIELD-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The odd man out is in again.
</P>
<P>
   Three months after the Red Sox abruptly exiled Tim Wakefield
from the starting rotation, the knuckleballer Sunday officially
reclaimed his job by discombobulating the Braves for his third
straight win as a temp worker among Boston's beleaguered corps of
starters.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, he stopped short of saying he told us so. But in
containing the Braves by yielding only two runs over seven innings
and helping the Sox dodge a demoralizing sweep before the All-Star
break, Wakefield submitted powerful evidence to support his prior
protests that he merits a starter's job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I'm wearing one hat, and mentally it's a lot easier to
know what your role is,'' Wakefield said after manager Jimy
Williams announced the once-shunned knuckleballer will join the
Brothers Martinez, Pete Schourek, and Jeff Fassero as the team's
starters after the break.
</P>
<P>
   Wakefield made no secret of his anger over being yanked from his
starting role when the Sox signed the lefthanded Schourek after he
was released by the Pirates just before the season started. And
Wakefield complained last month about being bounced from long
relief to a setup role and finally to a mop-up assignment in a 22-1
loss to the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Wakefield had answered the mop-up call after throwing 58 pitches
in relief just two days earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've worn almost every hat you can think of here,'' he said.
``I don't frown upon that. It's just nice to be in a consistent
role.''
</P>
<P>
   Consistency was the key to beating the Braves, as Wakefield
confounded the heart of Atlanta's order with his 65-mile-per-hour
floater. The first five batters in the Braves lineup went 2 for 15,
with slugger Andres Galarraga eking out a harmless single in the
fourth inning and Quilvio Veras poking a Wall-ball single in the
fifth that drove in Javy Lopez.
</P>
<P>
   In improving his record to 5-5, Wakefield lowered his ERA to
4.98, though he has posted a 3.54 ERA in his last three starts. He
walked only one and left it to Rich Garces and Derek Lowe to stifle
the Braves in the eighth and ninth, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has pitched very well for us as a starter, he really has,''
Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   Pitching coach Joe Kerrigan attributed Wakefield's victory to
his mastery of the delicate mechanics of delivering the
knuckleball. ``He changed speeds . . . very well,'' Kerrigan said.
``He kept a good delivery throughout, and kept a good flight on his
knuckleball.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerrigan indicated Wakefield could be pivotal to the team's
second-half plans. ``He's in a good groove now,'' he said, ``and we
want to keep him in a good groove.''
</P>
<P>
   That's comforting to Wakefield, though he appeared resigned to
the possibility of future upheaval. ``The way the last couple of
years have gone here, I don't know what to expect hardly anymore,''
he said. ``But hopefully I can wear the one hat I'm wearing now and
help the club do what it can to win from that aspect.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he can't help looking over his shoulder. ``It's just
something I have to live with,'' he said.

OVER-THE-TOP EFFORT RESONATES DOWN UNDER 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ There is no joy in Blackbutt or Mount Isa Monday
because Pete Sampras is the biggest killjoy known to those two
Australian country towns somewhere in the vast, desolate reaches of
Queensland.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras killed two burgs with one stony serve that comes at you
as a swirling rock, daring you to get a racket on it, making a
tennis court a very hard place. It makes strong men weep. Although
Patrick Rafter controlled his tear ducts Sunday evening in Pete's
Parlor (also known as Centre Court, Wimbledon), when he had a right
to cry, he couldn't control the Sampras serve that snakes and bakes
with venom and heat.
</P>
<P>
   In beating Rafter, the favorite son of hot, dusty Mount Isa, in
four sticky sets and almost 3 hours, Sampras also erased the pride
of Blackbutt, Roy Emerson, from the record book, evicting ``Emmo''
after a 33-year residence. Is that any way to treat a 63-year-old
good old Aussie boy?
</P>
<P>
   The double dip was enough to make strong men, women, and
children weep in both outposts. Surely it unmade their day and may
have caused the dark-trunked eucalyptus trees from which Blackbutt
takes its name to turn pale. Facing the Sampras serve would do that
to anybody or anything.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras collects major titles _ especially Wimbledons _ the way
Imelda Marcos snaps up shoes or congressmen rake in soft money.
He'll soon run out of fingers and toes to count them on. He's up to
13 majors, dissolving the tie with Emerson at a dozen, and seven of
those _ also a record _ have been seized at the Big W, which, as he
points out, is ``the biggest event in our game.'' His decade's
quest began with the 1990 US Open triumph at 19 over Andre Agassi.
</P>
<P>
   Illuminating the gloaming with his firepower, Sampras fought off
both Rafter and impending darkness. He beat Rafter, 6-7 (10-12),
7-6 (7-5), 6-4, 6-2, and nightfall ``by 10 minutes,'' Sampras said.
``I didn't want to have to try to sleep knowing I'd have to come
back Monday to finish.''
</P>
<P>
   Rafter might as well have cuddled up in a sleeping bag on court
during the fourth set for all the good it did him as he probed for
Sampras's serve like a drunk trying to find a keyhole in a dark
room. Two intermissions for rain-watching pushed the dicey finish
back to 8:57 p.m., the latest conclusion for a Wimbledon singles
finale.
</P>
<P>
   It is not wise to go into the same room with Sampras at the All
England Club _ if that room is rectangular, carpeted in grass, and
contains 13,812 people who will scream with glee as he serves
yellow bullets at speeds of up to 133 miles per hour. ``Pistol
Pete'' is too tame a sobriquet for him, actually a one-man firing
squad.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Rafter gamely went after Sampras with abandon.
</P>
<P>
   The US Open champ in 1997-98 had _ for a few shining moments _ a
chance to bring down this American contender for baptism as
greatest of the greats.
</P>
<P>
   ``My title was slipping away there. I was tight, I'd lost my
nerve,'' Sampras said. ``We all choke, you know. Then Pat lost his
when I thought I was gone.''
</P>
<P>
   He meant the moment that Rafter led, 4-1, in the second-set
tiebreaker with two serves to come and 3 points from a two-set
lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``But things can change so fast in a match like that,'' Sampras
said. Within two minutes, they had changed.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras grabbed 6 of the breaker's remaining 7 points _ the
critical ones to 6-4 _ and rediscovered his invincible Centre Court
self, an ogre who has permitted only two foes of 41 to emerge from
his torture chamber breathing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within two minutes I knew I'd win,'' said Sampras.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I was screwed. It was a mental blow, and I went
downhill,'' Rafter said.
</P>
<P>
   Two minutes out of the 277 played, 5 points of 299, and the
championship slid from the Aussie's hands into those accustomed to
its weight.
</P>
<P>
   At 4-1, Sampras rapped a good, low forehand return. Rafter
double-faulted, 4-3. The Aussie wasn't through. He poked a
net-skimming backhand return to the server's feet. Though Sampras
dug it out, his half-volley lazed to the service line where Rafter
waited to deliver a crushing forehand passer. They were
eyeball-to-eyeball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I make that and it's another mini-break, 5-3,'' Rafter said.
However, he lashed the ball into the net. ``I'm screwed.''
</P>
<P>
   Reprieved, Sampras socked a service winner, and then a sizzling
backhand return to set up a forehand passer. From 4-1 down to 6-4
up.
</P>
<P>
   Having become Wimbledon's Man of the Century last year with his
sixth title, surpassing Bjorn Borg and Laurie Doherty, Sampras is
now this tennis bee's current Man Forever. All right, I know Willie
Renshaw also won seven, and Sampras has merely tied him 111 years
later.
</P>
<P>
   But things might not have been quite so demanding in the 1880s.
Renshaw shined during the era of the ``challenge-round'' system
whereby the defending champ had to play only one match the
following year, against the survivor of a preliminary tournament.
Renshaw, who won five titles as one-round knockouts, had a career
record of 22-3 at Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras is 59-5, with title-bout knockouts of Jim Courier, Goran
Ivanisevic, Boris Becker, Cedric Pioline, Ivanisevic again, and
Andre Agassi starting in 1993, a pretty fair cast of wrecking-ball
artists themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Pained by a gimpy left shin and foot, Sampras played
nevertheless, and persevered in his kind of bing-bang, slick-quick
game. Let's charge, bump heads, and see who lasts.
Serve-and-volley. Five shots was a long and rare point. They stayed
back on all of 4 points, their lengthiest rally 14 strokes.
</P>
<P>
   Though not engrossing like Rafter over Agassi in that sublime
semifinal, it was tense and suspenseful because at that highly
competitive pace, one mistake could be costly.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his infirmity, Sampras had said, ``If my right arm stays
on I'll get through it.'' He was right.
</P>
<P>
   Rafter's main difficulty was literacy. Reading. ``You can't read
Pete's serve, pick where it's going, or what spin is coming.''
</P>
<P>
   It's easier reading James Joyce in Sanskrit than deciphering the
Sampras serve: same toss and motion for every delivery. LA Pete is
the Boston Pedro of tennis the way he works his plate (the service
box) and opponent, moving the ball to maddening locations. Heat,
changeups, breaking balls, in and out, jams manicuring the other
guy's nails.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras holds serve like Slobodan Milosevic hangs onto his job.
Particularly in Wimbledon finals, where he's 7 for 7. But he does
lose it every few years. Courier broke him twice in 1993,
Ivanisevic twice in 1998. Four serving games lost of 137 over seven
finals. Five guys couldn't splinter that serve even with a
jackhammer. Scroogian-plus.
</P>
<P>
   Centre Court never has experienced a weapon so devastating. Of
the 101 points he won while serving, his serve was responsible for
64 unplayables: 27 aces, 37 winners.
</P>
<P>
   Rafter did have a look at two break points. Obstructed view, you
might say. They vanished like snow in Florida. But Sampras broke
Rafter only once in the first two sets. That's how tight it was.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the situation I love. Nerves, anxiety,'' said Sampras.
That's the way champions talk. For Sampras, high anxiety means
higher achievement. Bad as they might feel about him beating up on
their guys, Rafter and Emerson, the good folks of Mount Isa and
Blackbutt would recognize greatness and salute him with, ``Good on
you, Yank!''

SEASON DOESN'T ADD UP FOR VARITEK

 SOX-VARITEK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN VELLANTE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ He had two singles and a double, hit the ball hard four
times, drove in a pair of runs, and had a role in three run-scoring
innings.
</P>
<P>
   All this while handling the dancing knuckleball of Tim
Wakefield. But Red Sox catcher Jason Varitek still isn't quite
where he wants to be.
</P>
<P>
   What he did Sunday at Fenway Park, as the Sox went into the
All-Star break with a 7-2 win over Atlanta, is what he wants to do
every day.
</P>
<P>
   Varitek enters the break batting .284 _ 41 points higher than
the same time a year ago _ but, he insists, it's been a struggle at
times.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're not playing very consistent as a team, and when
you're not playing that consistent as a player, you hope for better
things in the second half,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When it was brought to Varitek's attention that his stats now
(.284, 5 HRs, 31 RBIs vs. .243, 9, and 31) compare very favorably
with a year ago, he just shrugged.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure they do, but I'm not where I need to be yet to make
myself the player that I want to be. I want to be consistent.
That's what everybody reaches for, consistency.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have guys like your Nomars and Everetts, they're
consistent. They've reached that point. Not numberwise, but every
day they're going to have the same swing. That's what I'm looking
for.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, he was a model of consistency.
</P>
<P>
   --In the second inning, he drilled a one-out single to left,
driving in Garciaparra to put the Sox ahead, 1-0.
</P>
<P>
   --In the fourth, he followed Morgan Burkhart's single to right
with one of his own and they both rode home on Jose Offerman's
triple to open up a 4-1 Sox lead.
</P>
<P>
   --In the fifth, he lined a two-out, run-scoring double to left
to chase home Everett with the seventh and final Sox run.
</P>
<P>
   --In the seventh, looking to match his career high of four hits,
he grounded sharply to first base.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was nice,'' said Varitek. ``I'm just trying to be
aggressive and taking a lot of things I'm working on before the
game and putting them into play.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Four very good at-bats, to say the least,'' said Red Sox
manager Jimy Williams. ``He hit the ball hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if a nagging wrist injury was hampering Varitek more at
the plate or in the field, Williams said, ``I don't think so and
you won't get him to say anything. To me, he's fearless. He's going
to play. These three days will probably help him.''
</P>
<P>
   Varitek, whose only comment about the wrist was that it was
``getting better,'' said handling Wakefield Sunday was a lot easier
than last week in Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   ``When (Wakefield) throws as many strikes as he did today, he
gets in a good rhythm. The other day in Minnesota, he was really
tough to catch. He couldn't get in a consistent rhythm, therefore
I'm back there battling even more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today he got in that real good rhythm. Really only one ball
got away from me and hit me in the heel of the glove. He did a
great job and got us through seven and then we went to our strength
(Rich Garces and Derek Lowe) in the bullpen.''
</P>
<P>
   Varitek said he would use the All-Star break to spend time with
his wife and 7-month-old daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I'm starting to get healthy,'' he said. ``The
break will be good for some guys. It will be a good little mental
break. I think our pitching staff needs a little break.''

   LOS ANGELES _ With school back in session, more students are

from cramped rooms filled with clunky card catalogs and dusty old
books to slick multimedia centers where they can polish PowerPoint
presentations and use the Internet to research papers.

QUICK EXIT SUITED DRIVERS AND CREWS 
</HEADLINE>
 REACTION-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHIRA SPRINGER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUDON, N.H. _ When light rain led to a red flag before the
halfway point of the New England 300, some race teams kept moving.
They packed up their haulers and left New Hampshire International
Speedway. The Kellogg's transporter was the first to go Sunday,
knowing the No. 5 car, driven by Terry Labonte, sustained too much
damage in an early wreck to continue. As the rain tapered off,
other teams that dropped out of the race because of accidents
prepared to vacate the premises. The John Deere hauler closed its
back door. The K-Mart/Route 66 hauler flashed its brake lights as
it prepared to back away.
</P>
<P>
   Another red flag for rain with 27 laps remaining allowed the
mass moving efforts to continue. Crew members rolled water coolers,
used gas containers, tool boxes, and extra tires off Pit Road. Just
the barest of mechanical essentials remained as drivers and crew
waited to learn whether the race would continue.
</P>
<P>
   On race day, it's customary for drivers and crew to make quick
exits. But Sunday, there was added motivation. The death of driver
Kenny Irwin in a Friday practice session made the weekend longer.
The tragedy dominated conversations around the track, especially
since it came eight weeks after the death of Adam Petty at NHIS.
And although NASCAR did not interrupt the racing schedule, the
drivers were clearly disturbed, even distracted, by the fatality.
</P>
<P>
   ``I say the track looks wet,'' said driver Jerry Nadeau, during
the second and final stoppage that gave him a career-best
fourth-place finish. ``Let's just call this thing and go home. I
hope this rain stays. I think everybody's ready to get out of here
this weekend. It's been a tough weekend for everybody here. All our
hearts and prayers go out to Kenny's family.''
</P>
<P>
   The somber atmosphere that set in Friday never lifted. The only
way for the racers and their crews to gain some distance from death
was to leave NHIS. Loading haulers that faced Turn 3 where Irwin
and Petty crashed, it was difficult for crew members to put the
deaths behind them while competing at NHIS.
</P>
<P>
   David Lippard, who works on Dale Earnhardt Jr.'s No. 8 Budweiser
Chevy, mentioned that the fatal crashes will give the track a
stigma in the short term. As they were packing, some race team
members got ``eerie'' and ``strange'' feelings looking at Turn 3.
But as the years go by, Lippard predicted memories of the tragedies
on Turn 3 will fade.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to put it behind you,'' said Charlie McDonell, a
member of the Square D/Cooper Lighting crew. ``As soon as we leave
the track, we try to put racing out of our minds. You want to move
on (from the deaths) and the easiest way to move on is to go home.
You try not to think about it too much at home. It's easier to
forget about it when you're there.''
</P>
<P>
   Even drivers who thought they could gain a better finishing
position and points if the race continued were glad to get going
home. Mike Skinner praised his crew for piecing the No. 31 Lowe's
Chevrolet back together after an early accident, but lamented that
their efforts gained only an extra nine points. Many teams in the
same position likely would have placed the wrecked vehicle on a
trailer and carried it home. Still, despite the time invested in
repairing the car, Skinner was anxious to leave NHIS.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be glad to get away from here,'' he said. ``This has not
been good to us this year. This place has been pretty treacherous
for some guys and it's really a shame. I hate it.''
</P>
<P>
   Under a dark, gray sky spitting rain, the last haulers left NHIS
and completed the quick exodus. The longest and saddest weekend of
the year for NASCAR Winston Cup teams was over. But with Irwin's
funeral scheduled for Wednesday in Indianapolis, the entire racing
community is in for a long week.

TIME RUNS OUT FOR MARTIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE BURRIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUDON, N.H. _ He had spent much of the race outrunning
misfortune. When the rains came to the New England 300 on Lap 273,
Mark Martin was sitting pretty. The Daytona Beach, Fla., resident
was in third place, with first-place Tony Stewart and second-place
Joe Nemechek running out of fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Martin boldly declared in an interview during the rain delay
that if the rain stopped and the race began again he would triumph.
But the light drizzle quickly became a steady downpour, and Martin
knew long before the race officially was called that he would not
get a chance to make good on his declaration.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for someone who had to settle for third, Martin was upbeat,
and added that a victory probably would have been a stroke of luck,
since Stewart had run a more dominant race.
</P>
<P>
   ``After they (put out the caution flag), I was thinking that I
had nothing to gain and everything to lose, really,'' said Martin,
who was looking for his second win of the season, having won the
Goody's Body Pain 500 in Martinsville, Va.
</P>
<P>
   He also earned 170 points and five lap-leader bonus points to
move up one spot to sixth in the Winston Cup points standings (he
led from Lap 192 to Lap 204). It was his 11th top-10 finish this
season.
</P>
<P>
   In the standard postrace inspection, an irregularity was found
in Martin's Valvoline Ford. NASCAR officials said Sunday night his
third-place finish would stand and the issue would be addressed
this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started off wallowing in mediocrity and we progressively,
with the Valvoline team, made it better with each pit stop,'' said
Martin, who said it didn't bother him that the ending denied him
his first triumph at New Hampshire International Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the last stop we were actually cutting some really good
laps,'' he added. ``Though we didn't really need to, we were
sitting in a real good position with enough gas to go all the way.
Everybody behind us wasn't able to keep up with us and two guys in
front of us had to stop for gas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a pretty straightforward deal, just sit there and hope
the light sprinkles stay that way. Great strategy by the team,
great fuel mileage. That was our only chance to win and we were set
up for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin reiterated his belief that if the race had continued, he
would have been sitting in Victory Lane. But he added, ``It would
sorta have been robbery. (Tony Stewart) was the class of the
field.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, you get the feeling he wished Mother Nature had
cooperated more. ``Some people were going to be frustrated,''
Martin said, ``but it certainly wouldn't have been us. That's how
it goes in racing. Somebody is always frustrated, but I think you
would have seen much greater frustration in (Stewart's) crowd. I've
been there before.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin, who began the race from third position, has run well at
NHIS; Sunday marked his ninth top-10 finish in 11 races at Loudon,
more than any other driver.
</P>
<P>
   He also has finished in the top 5 in his last four races, after
finishing 32d or lower in three of his previous five races. He said
that is why he wasn't somber after he didn't get the break he
wanted with the rain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little bit more grateful when things go good right now
than I was three months ago,'' said Martin, the winningest driver
in the NASCAR Busch Series. A victory Sunday would have been his
32d in NASCAR. ``I feel right now that third place is good.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many drivers, Martin said he thought about Kenny Irwin, who
was killed in practice Friday, during the race. ``I looked at the
spot (where Irwin crashed),'' he said. ``The spot was painted on
the wall now, but I know where the cracks are. (I looked) more than
once in the race.''

BAHRE DEFENDS NHIS TRACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALLEN LESSELS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUDON, N.H. _ The longest race weekend yet at New Hampshire
International Speedway was finally nearing an end and track owner
Bob Bahre soon would close it out the same way he finishes most
race weekends: by getting in his car and driving home to South
Paris, Maine.
</P>
<P>
   For the second straight NASCAR event at the track, the weekend
started with a driver killed when he slammed into the concrete wall
in Turn 3 during a practice run.
</P>
<P>
   Winston Cup driver Kenny Irwin crashed and died late Friday
morning in much the same manner that Busch Series driver Adam Petty
crashed and died May 12.
</P>
<P>
   The deaths stunned the racing community and had drivers and crew
members and the media questioning whether there is something wrong
with the cars or the track.
</P>
<P>
   Bahre, as he did earlier in the weekend, defended his track.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the track is fine,'' he said. ``It was good for 10
years and you have trouble one year. I think that should be the
answer.''
</P>
<P>
   The deaths were the first in NASCAR-sanctioned events at the
track since it opened in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   That they happened on the same spot on the track, in scarily
similar fashion and within eight weeks of each other, raised
concerns throughout the NASCAR garage area.
</P>
<P>
   Drivers and crew members talked of stuck throttles and
mechanical problems and NASCAR promised to look at that issue
again.
</P>
<P>
   And drivers and crew members brought up the tight corners at the
ends of this track and how there is little time to recover if there
is a problem, partly because there is little banking in those
corners. They talked of the styrofoam barriers that are used at
some tracks to protect cars from some corners and how NASCAR should
perhaps consider such barriers here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barricades would just blow all to pieces,'' Bahre said. ``All
they do is just fly everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Other tracks are at least as flat, Bahre said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's flatter tracks than this,'' he said. ``Milwaukee is
perfectly flat. There's Phoenix, which is flatter. You've got
Martinsville, Christ, you've got flat tracks.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Helton, NASCAR's chief operating officer, said Saturday
that he thinks fingers should not be pointed at the track.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think every facility we go to is unique and has its own
different characteristics,'' he said. ``I don't know why we've had
two accidents here in such a short period of time that are very
similar to each other, but those answers are tough to come up
with.''
</P>
<P>
   He gave no indication that the organization will study the
facility.
</P>
<P>
   If NASCAR does check out the track, Bahre said, he certainly
will listen.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my opinion the track is fine, but if NASCAR says to me we
want this done or that done, it will be done,'' Bahre said. ``I
talk to NASCAR quite often, it's all up to them. But as far as when
anything happens, if a skier gets killed going down a hill, people
(complain) the tree shouldn't have been there, you know what I
mean? Nothing's ever going to be perfect in life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't get me wrong. I'm not saying this is right by any means,
what happened. But at the same time, things happen. Look at
Daytona, they had two deaths in one weekend (in 1994). At a race
two weeks ago at a half-mile track in the Midwest a guy got
killed.''
</P>
<P>
   That said, this was one rough weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good to have it behind you,'' Bahre said. ``This is kind
of behind us and you pray to God nothing ever happens again.''

HERE'S A SWITCH _ NEMECHEK IS 2D 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM GREENIDGE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUDON, N.H. _ Last season's Dura-Lube/ K-Mart 300 victory at
New Hampshire International Speedway was the first of Joe
Nemechek's Winston Cup career.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday at NHIS, Nemechek couldn't overcome the weather nor
winner Tony Stewart, and settled for a second-place finish in the
rain-shortened New England 300, pocketing $107,550 for his efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Starting 30th in his Oakwood Homes Chevrolet, Nemechek made up
steady ground and led the race for three laps, 187-189. He took
over second on Lap 220, and trailed only Stewart when the race was
called with 27 laps remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only time we led was when we started making green-flag pit
stops,'' said Nemechek, from Lakeland, Fla. ``Tony was doing
exactly what I would have done in the lead. I was trying to run as
hard as I could. He knows you've got to run as hard as you can
every lap. There's no conserving. You've got to get as many guys
down a lap as you can. When he pitted, I kept my pace until we had
to pit.''
</P>
<P>
   It helped that Nemechek switched engines Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our motor shop was working on the engine in the morning, and
we overcame some odds by doing what we did,'' he said. ``We didn't
use the same engine that we had used in the qualifier. We had a
good feeling with the engine, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of those close-but-not-enough days. I was in
control all day, we passed a lot of cars early, and Tony was tough.
I wasn't quite sure if I had anything left, our cars were quite
comparable. I wish I could have run with him more by putting more
pressure on him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tony could get through traffic better and I would get held up.
He would get that distance. I was held up more than he was.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither driver had much gas left when the race was winding down.
``That was the big question, we think we would have had enough to
get to a couple of laps from the end with the gas we had,''
Nemechek said. ``I'm sure we had enough to go all the way, we were
in a lot better shape than Tony was, and a lot better than some of
the cars behind us.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't sure how we would do with the gas, so I focused on
Tony in trying to run faster laps. I was sure that there would be
rain on the 190th lap. We pretty much expected it to come at that
time. I never asked if we could make it, though.''
</P>
<P>
   It's been an interesting year for Nemechek, who finished fifth
at the Cracker Barrel in Atlanta and seventh at the Coca-Cola 600
in Charlotte, N.C. He also has had an eighth and two ninths. But
there were times Nemechek didn't even finish, suffering two
accidents as well as engine and oil pressure problems.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, there was also the issue of maintaining his focus. The
death of Kenny Irwin, killed during a practice lap Friday, hit very
close to home for Nemechek. His brother, John, died while racing at
Miami Homestead in March, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're out there focusing on what you have to do, you try
to block out everything you can as perfectly as you can,'' Nemechek
said. ``The accident happened this week and it hit no one harder
than it did me. I keep asking myself why these things are happening
to these young men. I've been thinking about it since it
happened.''

CARDINAL PREACHES TO INMATES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 &HT;    By ERIK NELSON  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Following the example of Pope John Paul II, who
led thousands of Roman Catholic clerics into prisons worldwide,
Cardinal Roger Mahony preached the words of St. Paul to about 240
inmates in the Los Angeles County Men's Central Jail on Sunday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   Even the apostle ``was wrestling with the fact that he is a weak
man, he is a sinner, and he has many faults and failures,'' the
cardinal said in his English and Spanish sermon to the inmates in
jumpsuits of royal blue, lime-green and white.
</P>
<P>
   Mahony urged the inmates, although they dwell behind locked
gates, to ``open wide the doors of our hearts and our lives'' to
divine help.
</P>
<P>
   ``The amazing thing is Jesus does not force himself into our
lives,'' said Mahony, who celebrated Mass and distributed Communion
wafers with the bishops of Orange County and Salt Lake City. ``He
stands at the door to our lives and knocks.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca called the day ``a wonderful
opportunity for inmates to reflect on their lives and get in touch
with their spirituality.'' He said the church's worldwide interest
in prisoners helps show inmates that their lives have value.
</P>
<P>
   After the Mass in the concrete-walled chapel, the serene
countenances and messages of the cardinal and bishops were replaced
by the stern faces and orders of sheriff's deputies. The host of
deputies, who serve as jail guards, commanded the inmates to stand
and walk single file from the chapel.
</P>
<P>
   The special celebration in jail was part of the Roman Catholic
observation of this year as a time for reinvigorating the church's
vision, according to a printed statement released by Mahony.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the inmates left with a card commemorating the day as
the Jubilee in the Prisons of the World. The back of the card shows
the pope offering forgiveness to the man convicted of shooting him
in 1981, Mehmet Ali Agca. The photograph is framed by the words
``justice,'' ``conversion'' and ``forgiveness'' in several
languages, including English and Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   Catholic clergy, including bishops from around the country who
had been attending a conference in Los Angeles, visited jails and
prisons throughout the Southland.
</P>
<P>
   Mahony faced a calm and quiet congregation in which several men
lifted their palms skyward during prayers. One inmate sketched a
portrait of the cardinal. Mahony said, ``I like that because it
shows me as much younger than I am.''
</P>
<P>
   But the celebration was canceled at the North County
Correctional Facility in Lancaster because a brawl erupted there
the previous night between African-Americans and Latinos, according
to spokesmen for the Archdiocese of Los Angeles and the Sheriff's
Department.
</P>
<P>
   Eight inmates suffered minor injuries in the disturbance at 8:20
p.m. Saturday, said sheriff's Deputy Carlos Lopez. Guards fired
rubber pellets and crowd-control gas to stop the fight, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Rome, the pope celebrated Mass behind bars, the Associated
Press reported. About 75 prisoners and twice as many guards
surrounded John Paul II in Regina Coeli, the city's oldest prison.
He appealed to authorities for a sign of clemency. Italian
officials have been grappling with clemency as a form of relief for
overcrowding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Punishment, prison only make sense if, while affirming the
needs of justice and discouraging crime, they serve man's
renewal,'' AP quoted the pope.
</P>
<P>
   Mahony's message was similar: ``We are called to stand in
solidarity with those who are incarcerated and with the victims of
crime and their family members.'' Catholic parishioners need ``to
assess how they can more actively assist victims of violent crime,
pTUZilrs and their respective family members in order to facilitate
the restoration of our communities,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the same light, society at large must promote more
effective alternatives to our current criminal justice system.
Revenge must give way to restoration so that the possibility of
healing can be actualized.''

ERSTAD HELPS ANGELS WIN FOURTH STRAIGHT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GORDON VERRELL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ What kind of season is Darin Erstad having? In
the seventh inning Sunday evening at Edison Field, the Anaheim
Angels left fielder grounded out. And he received a loud, standing
ovation from the 23,820 fans.
</P>
<P>
   It was the only time the Colorado Rockies got Erstad out and
even then, his grounder to short drove home a run in the Angels'
10-4 win, their season-high fourth in a row.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels arrive at the All-Star break a season-best six games
above .500 and, better yet, with big hopes for the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've said all along, this team has yet to play its best
ball,'' said Erstad, who had two doubles and two singles, drove in
two runs, scored three runs and stole a base.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're clicking right now,'' Erstad went on. ``We're heading in
the right direction and we'll have some fresh bodies when we come
back (after the All-Star Game).''
</P>
<P>
   If any are even half as fresh as Erstad's, well. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't found a thing this guy can't do,'' manager Mike
Scioscia said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at his run production,'' Scioscia said, ``his home runs,
his stolen bases, his tremendous defense, the way he hits in the
clutch. It's contagious. Everybody feeds off what he's doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Erstad heads off to Atlanta for Tuesday's All-Star Game with a
major- league-leading 144 hits, the most since Ralph Garr's
pre-All-Star Game total of 149 in 1974, and only four shy of his
entire 1999 total of 148; a major-league-leading 47 multihit games,
including 13 in his past 18 games; and a .384 batting average,
second in the majors only to Boston's Nomar Garciaparra (.389).
</P>
<P>
   ``Phenomenal,'' Scioscia said. ``Man, he's exciting to watch.
But, I know this: He'd trade his All-Star appearance for a playoff
appearance.''
</P>
<P>
   That's down the line, of course, but the Angels at least are
talking about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't come close to our expectations,'' Erstad said.
``There are two very good teams in front of us. We can't slip or
falter in any way.''
</P>
<P>
   Angels starter Kent Bottenfield did a little of both early
Sunday evening, but he got it together well enough to pitch into
the eighth inning and emerge with his fifth win in 12 decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows he can bend and not break,'' Scioscia said after
Bottenfield twice let early leads get away. ``But he didn't panic.
He made his pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I'm not far off my game,'' said Bottenfield, ``but it
was an emotional roller coaster. It was frustrating, but things are
starting to feel normal. Pitching into the eighth (which he hadn't
done in almost two months) was a big thing for me emotionally.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels opened the first with four successive hits off
Colorado starter Masato Yoshii (4-9), including three doubles in a
row by Erstad, Kevin Stocker and Mo Vaughn. That provided
Bottenfield with a 3-0 lead, which lasted all the way until the
second inning. The reeling Rockies, losers of seven in a row, tied
the score with four consecutive hits of their own.
</P>
<P>
   Garret Anderson's home run - his 26th, which established an
Angels record for most homers before the All-Star break - with two
outs in the third put the Angels on top again 4-3, only for
Colorado to tie the score in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, in the bottom of the fourth, the Angels knocked out
Yoshii, scoring three times. This time Bottenfield, after giving up
eight hits the first four innings, allowed only two more hits
before leaving after 7 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Fittingly, it was Erstad's third of four hits, a double to
center, that knocked in the go-ahead run in the Angels' fourth.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels added one more run in the sixth - on a run-scoring
double by Stocker off Colorado reliever Gabe White, which snapped
his franchise- record scoreless streak at 29 innings - and two more
in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   The second run in the seventh was set up by Orlando Palmeiro's
grounder to first, which moved Adam Kennedy to third. That enabled
him to score the Angels' final run on Erstad's sharp grounder to
short.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was huge,'' Erstad said afterward. ``Whenever we get guys
in scoring position, we've got to score them ... you've got to
pound that last nail in the coffin, and that's how you do it. I tip
my hat to Orlando.''
</P>
<P>
   He even does that well.

CANADA CAN'T PLAY THROUGH U.S. PAYNE
</HEADLINE>

 Long Beach Press-Telegram

<P>
   LOS ALAMITOS, Calif. _ U.S. goalkeeper Nicolle Payne admitted
she was uncomfortable nearly the entire match Sunday when the
American national team met Canada in a tight game for the Holiday
Cup championship.
</P>
<P>
   But not nearly as uncomfortable as she would have been if she
was sitting on the sideline watching Brenda Villa score three goals
as the U.S. held off their arch-rivals 5-4 to win the tournament
title before 2,200 at the U.S. National Aquatic Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because we never had a big lead, I never was comfortable,''
said Payne, who had 13 saves, including eight in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Payne, a four-time national champion at UCLA, began the
tournament as the team's backup goalkeeper to Bernice Orwig, who
was in goal for April's Olympic Qualification Tournament in Italy.
Payne, the team's goalie in wins over Australia and Kazakhstan
during round-robin play, ended the six-day tournament cradling the
hardware honoring the Holiday Cup's most outstanding goalkeeper and
celebrating six consecutive victories for the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a hard year with a lot of ups and downs,'' said
Payne, who was the team's starting goalkeeper for a couple of
years, including during the 1999 Fina World Cup, before being
unseated by Orwig. ``I want to be out there. But I'm also a team
person. It sucks we both can't be out there. If I'm not out there,
I at least want to push Bernie and make her the best goalkeeper she
can be.''
</P>
<P>
   The Holiday Cup championship can be categorized as an up for
Payne and the U.S. team. But U.S. coach Guy Baker said the 6-0
record against the five other teams in the Olympic field doesn't
make the Americans the Sydney favorite.
</P>
<P>
   ``Australia and Holland are still the favorites,'' Baker said.
``They have the resumes. But we're gonna show up.''

O'BANNONS HEDqjk2  I S PAST CANADA 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. _ Maybe the O'Bannon house could become its
own country. Possibly get a flag and compose an anthem of some
kind.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't the Olympic games, but Ed and Charles O'Bannon, along
with Baron Davis and the LA Pros, defeated the Steve Nash-led
Canadian Olympic team 113-99 in the Summer Pro League at the
Pryamid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I could play in the Olympics,'' said Ed O'Bannon, who
led LA Pros with 21 points. ``I think we wanted to come out and
play hard. They're a nation team and Olympic team.''
</P>
<P>
   Ed O'Bannon played last season in Greece and Argentina and
worked out on his own in preparation for the Summer League.
</P>
<P>
   The LA Pros hadn't practiced together for the summer league;
they basically threw the ball out and played Sunday at the Pyramid.
</P>
<P>
   Charles O'Bannon had 16 points and Davis, who flew to the rim on
a number of alley-oop attempts and some completions, finished with
21.
</P>
<P>
   Add Canada: The Canadian Olympic team is at the Summer Pro
League for four games in five days in preparation for Sydney in
September.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to play against the best competition we can play
against,'' said Canada coach Jay Triano in an interview before the
game. ``We felt we needed to go against the best players available.
We knew we could play a lot of games in a short period of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Canada qualified for the Olympics in a tournament in San Juan,
Puerto Rico. The team faces a tough bracket in the Olympics with
host Australia, Russia, Yugoslavia, Spain and Angola. Triano said
Canada would be considered the fifth seed out of the six teams.
</P>
<P>
   Not playing for Canada is Laker Rick Fox and Jamaal Magloire,
the first-round pick of the Charlotte Hornets. But the team does
have Dallas Mavericks point guard Nash.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to be prepared as a team to be ready for the
Olympics,'' Nash said in a previous interview.

<TEXT>
<P>
   DURBAN, South Africa _ Opening the first international
conference on AIDS in a developing country, South African President
Thabo Mbeki Sunday singled out extreme poverty, rather than the
disease ravaging his country and continent, as the leading killer
both here and across Africa.
</P>
<P>
   South Africa is the country with the largest number of people
infected with HIV, the AIDS virus _ 4.2 million _ and its
president, who has become embroiled in international controversy
over the causes of the disease, pledged to intensify his response.
But he dashed the hopes of thousands of participants _ and noisy
protesters _ who wanted to hear him state clearly that HIV causes
AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Mbeki skirted the controversy that has arisen because
he has questioned the use of certain drugs in treating HIV, and has
even questioned whether the virus causes AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Among the many researchers he has contacted in his quest to
understand the epidemic are two U.S. biochemists, Peter Duesberg
and David Rasnick, who argue that poverty and malnutrition, not
HIV, cause AIDS. When word of this consultation became public,
international consternation arose.
</P>
<P>
   As Mbeki described his attempts to understand how one of the
worst epidemics in history has enveloped his country just as it
freed itself from apartheid, he reflected on AIDS and a long list
of other diseases afflicting his country.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I listened and heard the whole story told about our own
country, it seemed to me that we could not blame everything on a
single virus,'' Mbeki said.
</P>
<P>
   The 13th international conference on AIDS is being held as U.N.
officials have been intensifying the alarm about HIV, which infects
34.3 million people in the world, mostly in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes after Mbeki finished talking, Dr. Peter Piot, the head
of UNAIDS, a U.N. program that monitors the spread of AIDS, said it
will take at least $3 billion a year to deliver the basic measures
in Africa and tens of billions of dollars more each year to provide
in Africa the standard drugs used to treat the disease in developed
countries.
</P>
<P>
   The $3 billion figure is ten times what is now being spent in
Africa, Piot said. UNAIDS estimates that 90 percent of people with
HIV do not know they are infected.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need billions, not millions, to fight AIDS in the world,''
and ``we can't fight an epidemic of this magnitude with peanuts,''
Piot said.
</P>
<P>
   In news conferences and interviews, Piot said he welcomed a
pledge of $500 million from the World Bank this weekend as a
positive step. He said the remainder needs to come from the
affected African countries and the developed countries.
</P>
<P>
   Piot urged developed countries to cancel the $15 billion in debt
repayment that African countries have incurred each year and return
it so countries can use the money for health care and social
services for AIDS and other diseases.
</P>
<P>
   But political will is as important as money in stopping the AIDS
epidemic, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past six years, scientists and AIDS activists have
repeatedly criticized South African leaders for their lack of
leadership in combatting the AIDS epidemic. In 1993, HIV infected 4
percent of South Africa's adult population. Now, it is 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night, as conference participants drifted out of the
cricket grounds where Mbeki spoke, many left feeling disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We, the majority of South African scientists, would have liked
a clear, unequivocal statement about the relationship between HIV
and AIDS rather than the hints he made,'' said Alan Whiteside, who
heads the AIDS research program at the University of Natal in
Durban.
</P>
<P>
   Whiteside and others said they were encouraged by Mbeki's pledge
to intensify his recently announced program to encourage safe sex
and to sponsor additional research into drug therapy and a possible
vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of people conducted a protest rally at City Hall hours
before the meeting opened, with Winnie Madikizela-Mandela and
others in the crowd berating the government for failing to speak
frankly about the link between HIV and AIDS and lagging in its
efforts to fight the epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   ``AIDS exists, HIV causes AIDS,'' Madikizela-Mandela said. ``We
cannot proclaim this century the African century and then ignore
the AIDS pandemic as some political leaders are.''
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki did speak about the heavy toll of HIV and AIDS on young
people. He also spoke about the toll from malaria, cholera,
syphilis, Vitamin A deficiency, and ``other illnesses with
complicated Latin names'' as among the diseases of poverty.
</P>
<P>
   The text of Mbeki's remarks released in advance of his speech
said: ``The world's biggest killer and the greatest cause of ill
health and suffering across the globe, including South Africa, is
extreme poverty.''
</P>
<P>
   When he spoke, he omitted that passage, but referred explicitly
to a 1995 report by the World Health Organization that described
poverty as the world's largest killer. ``Five years later,'' he
added, ``the essential elements of this story have not changed.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A strong hint that Mbeki would disappoint most AIDS conference
participants in not saying that HIV causes AIDS came earlier in the
day when scientists canceled a news conference because of what they
said was pressure from the South African government.
</P>
<P>
   The news conference had been scheduled to discuss a statement
signed by 5,000 scientists in the world and known as the Durban
Declaration. It affirmed that scientific evidence supporting the
link between HIV and AIDS is ``clear cut, exhaustive and
unambiguous'' and was published in the July 6 issue of the
scientific journal, Nature, after review by scientific peers.
</P>
<P>
   But the news conference was unexpectedly canceled minutes before
it was to begin. The reason was that ``the South African government
put pressure on us'' and threatened to dismiss any signatory who
worked for the government, said Dr. Charles van der Horst, a
professor of medicine at the University of North Carolina who
signed the Durban Declaration.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, van der Horst declined to name the government
official who made the call and said the South African scientist who
received it was a representative of the Durban Declaration. The
unidentified official spoke on behalf of Mbeki, van der Horst said
he was told.
</P>
<P>
   Tasneem Carrima, a spokesman for Mbeki, denied knowledge of any
such threat. ``We certainly would not threaten anybody,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The declaration came in response to Mbeki's decision to appoint
a panel to review the claims of dissidents who do not believe that
HIV causes AIDS, van der Horst said. The panel included such
dissidents and experts who signed the Durban Declaration.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought no one would give the denialists credence, and we
were wrong,'' van der Horst said.
</P>
<P>
   Van der Horst criticized the scientific community for not having
published a summary statement earlier of all the scientific
evidence that HIV causes AIDS. Now, by giving a platform to a small
group of dissidents, Mbeki has helped to divert efforts to fight
AIDS, Van der Horst said.
</P>
<P>
   Becoming embroiled in new arguments over the causes of AIDS
diverts attention and resources from finding a solution, several
scientists say.
</P>
<P>
   The declaration was intended as a scientific statement because
it was published in a scientific journal, van der Horst said.
However, he said, the South African government viewed the
declaration as a political statement. After the declaration was
released last week, Mbeki's spokesman, Parks Mankahlana, said it
should be thrown in the dustbin.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Mbeki's government tempered its stringent criticism
of anti-HIV drug therapy by announcing that it had reversed its
view about AZT, which it had deemed unsafe for pregnant women.
</P>
<P>
   In discussing his administration's plan to battle AIDS and
responding to critics, Mbeki said ``there is no substance to the
allegation that there is any hesitation on the part of our
government to confront the challenge of HIV/AIDS.''
</P>
<P>
   Piot said that underdeveloped countries, though poor, will have
to spend more on AIDS because ``it is about the survival of the
nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Mbeki and Piot are leaving the conference early to attend a
meeting of the Organization of African Unity in Lome, Togo, where
AIDS is to be discussed.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The only thing shocking so far about CBS' new
reality series ``Big Brother'' is how they almost frittered away
the whole franchise with Wednesday's stultifyingly dull debut. I
say host (and soon-to-be-former journalist) Julie Chen, she of the
insanely fluttering hands, and ``reporter'' Ian O'Malley, whose
transparent phoniness should automatically strip the show of its
``reality'' moniker, should be voted off the series first -- and
(italics) tout de suite (end italics).
</P>
<P>
   That idiotic caravan of houseguests -- and their first shameless
product placement, for SUVs -- galumphed along so endlessly it felt
like they were driving in from Arizona. The profiles made the
houseguests seem as hopelessly bland as New Age musicians. What
kind of battles could these Yawnis get into?
</P>
<P>
   These guys, however, started mixing it up almost immediately,
with William trying to turn the bedrooms coed. They were trying a
little too hard at this point, it seems, to provoke one another.
Were they able to read this, I'd have reminded them: It's a
marathon, guys, not a sprint. Ease up.
</P>
<P>
   Then came Friday's episode, filled with tedious discourse and
kooky makeovers and embarrassing chicken dances, and I was
hungering for caged death matches. If that's the best they can
manage for prime time, how dull must the live Internet streams be?
</P>
<P>
   It's a little hard, initially, to define what CBS saw in this
bunch. For one thing, casting not one but two film/TV college
majors -- Eddie and Jordan -- seems a touch of mediacentric
overkill. This show will be painfully self-reflexive enough without
these two deconstructing everything. Scratch them from the
scorecard, on the other hand, and you lose two major TV archetypes:
guy who surmounted his handicap and stripper desperately trying to
justify shedding her knickers for pathetic drunks.

   LOS ANGELES _ The only thing shocking so far about CBS' new
reality series ``Big Brother'' is how they almost frittered away
the whole franchise with Wednesday's stultifyingly dull debut. I
say host (and soon-to-be-former journalist) Julie Chen, she of the
insanely fluttering hands, and ``reporter'' Ian O'Malley, whose
transparent phoniness should automatically strip the show of its
``reality'' moniker, should be voted off the series first -- and
(italics) tout de suite (end italics).
</P>
<P>
   That idiotic caravan of houseguests -- and their first shameless
product placement, for SUVs -- galumphed along so endlessly it felt
like they were driving in from Arizona. The profiles made the
houseguests seem as hopelessly bland as New Age musicians. What
kind of battles could these Yawnis get into?
</P>
<P>
   These guys, however, started mixing it up almost immediately,
with William trying to turn the bedrooms coed. They were trying a
little too hard at this point, it seems, to provoke one another.
Were they able to read this, I'd have reminded them: It's a
marathon, guys, not a sprint. Ease up.
</P>
<P>
   Then came Friday's episode, filled with tedious discourse and
kooky makeovers and embarrassing chicken dances, and I was
hungering for caged death matches. If that's the best they can
manage for prime time, how dull must the live Internet streams be?
</P>
<P>
   It's a little hard, initially, to define what CBS saw in this
bunch. For one thing, casting not one but two film/TV college
majors -- Eddie and Jordan -- seems a touch of mediacentric
overkill. This show will be painfully self-reflexive enough without
these two deconstructing everything. Scratch them from the
scorecard, on the other hand, and you lose two major TV archetypes:
guy who surmounted his handicap and stripper desperately trying to
justify shedding her knickers for pathetic drunks.
</P>
<P>
   Julie, the chipmunk-voiced, purported brainiac who looks like a
descendant of Rondo Hatton (prediction: The winner will be the
first to give her an unnecessary tracheotomy), and the inevitably
named Brittany, whose belabored quirkiness is as rebellious as a
Tommy Hilfiger wardrobe, will clearly become tiresome quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis, the born-again attorney, is a walking contradiction and
still dull. William has appointed himself the role of
provocateur/mac daddy; if he gets voted off, things will get really
dull really quickly. And the less said about the lachrymose
fortysomething parents who constantly weep about abandoning their
children, the better: If these sniveling fogies can't seize
responsibility meaningfully for their kids, how can they be
expected to contribute usefully to this household?
</P>
<P>
   The show's battle royale at this point is between Karen and her
husband, and he's not even on the show. If the guy isn't contacting
a divorce attorney today after her Saturday brutal slagfest of him,
he's even more brittle than she said he was.
</P>
<P>
   But for those who think this represents the penultimate,
wheezing gasps of our tattered culture, relax: The number of people
who seriously considered venturing into the house is lower than,
for example, the number of murderers in this country. Those in the
house are therefore merely a statistical anomaly, and the
houseguests who could be most damaged by their decision to do this
-- i.e., the parents -- were the ones who most should have been
smart enough not to do this. (Well, their kids are no doubt already
embarrassed by their parents' antics).
</P>
<P>
   Those who feel these shows diminish the concept of celebrity --
who grouse these guys haven't worked hard enough to deserve the
attention being heaped upon them -- haven't bothered to notice how
much celebrity has already been cheapened by the Monica Lewinskys
of the world.
</P>
<P>
   The only people for whom this show represents a legitimate pain
in the side are TV critics, who have to churn out think pieces
about reality TV and skirt what they really think, which is, people
who get addicted to this stuff are idiots. Most of us will tune in
from time to time for a guilty glimpse and walk away, sated and
relieved that our own privacy still exists, no matter how
nominally. No one will be forced to watch it, so there's no need to
pummel it too much -- though, admittedly, you do have to read a lot
about it in the Daily News.

FOSTER CARE SPENDING ON GIFTS QUESTIONED

<P>
   LOS AA0WeH k+$ 9Y &QC; 19Q pa!l0Los Angeles County
for the first time has decided to give 675 children leaving foster
care on their 18th birthday a valuable going-away gift: new laptop
computers and 500 telephone cards.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say`:)e $2.5 million worth of computers and phone cards
paid for with a windfall $3.5 million surplus could be better spent
by a county that hasn't computerized some of iM7 +:n vital records.
</P>
<P>
   But county officials defended their decision, saying the
computers will help the college-bound teens enter society as
adults.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this day and age, computers are important in the lives of
young people,'' said Anita Bock, director of the county Department
of Children and Family Services. ``There is a growing recognition
that if we don't help these children with relatively minor expenses
now, they end up on welfare or in prison, and we all know what the
cost of that is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think children in foster care deserve every chance that
other children in America have to succeed,'' said Bock, who took
over  &LR; -Q/Y8Irt[Y7t la.] Uul &UR;
</P>
<P>
   The decision to buy computers comes despite a critical grand
jury report that found the department lacks computer-based and
manual systems to maintain ``even the most basic data, such as
up-to-date lists of certified foster families and their
addresses.''
</P>
<P>
   Some say the county is too quick to spend money.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goodness,'' said Jon Coupal, president of the Howard Jarvis
Taxpayers A &UR; rJtion. ``This is reflective of the use-it-or-lose-it
mentality of government. Private business does not work this way.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they have ongoing needs, they should be able to put it in a
reserve account and use it for worthwhile projects.''

 &HT;    What next for Netscape?
 &HT;    By Heather Cocks
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. _ A tongue-in-cheek shrine commands a
second-story wall at Netscape Communications Corp.: collages of
cut-out photos, articles, cartoons and e-mail jokes ripping
Microsoft Corp. founder Bill Gates.
</P>
<P>
   Deep in the heart of the Netscape engineering department, where
software writers create the Navigator browser, the anti-tribute is
a motivational tool of sorts. The enemy's in sight, but he's
stripped of his imposing aura.
</P>
<P>
   Hardly subtle, the display symbolizes a future Netscape hopes is
imminent. All year, its engineers have quietly honed a new weapon
pointed right at Microsoft _ a Web browser created with visions of
humbling the software giant's dominant Internet Explorer program.
</P>
<P>
   The next generation of computer software will be written for use
on the Web, making the Web browser battle between Netscape and
Microsoft the Internet world's equivalent of Windows vs. Macintosh.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape's upcoming offering, version 6.0, is designed to be a
sleeker, faster program that can run on a personal computer or a
smaller Internet-enabled device. A warm reception from consumers
and corporate partners alike could, in theory, turn the tide _ or
at least win an important skirmish _ in the long-running browser
wars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course we think about the competitive landscape,'' said
Chris Nalls, product manager for Netscape 6.0. ``We're very much
heads-down, focusing on getting this product out because we think
it's compelling.''
</P>
<P>
   To stop the free fall, it needs to be.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, 80 percent of Web surfers used Netscape's
product, which was virtually alone in a hot market. But after
pricing problems and a reputation for unreliability, combined with
hot competition from Microsoft, Netscape is now flirting with rock
bottom. A bare 13.9 percent of global Web denizens used Netscape's
product as of June 18, according to research company WebSideStory.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, a whopping 86 percent slice of the populace surfs
with the Microsoft browser. Even Netscape's parent company, America
Online Inc., years ago chose Internet Explorer as its default
browser sothat the AOL software might come pre-installed on
computers running the omnipresent Windows operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say Microsoft, which declined to comment for this
story, is so far ahead that there's no longer much point in
challenging it.
</P>
<P>
   RISE AND FALL From its 1994 debut until about 1996, Netscape
dominated the Web-browser market and began charging $50 for
unchallenged software.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft changed things when it launched the then-fresh Windows
95 operating system, which came with an early version of Internet
Explorer that symbolized the company's commitment to the Web. The
Redmond, Wash.,-based company pumped millions into its browser to
put it head-to-head with Netscape.
</P>
<P>
   Until 1998, the two companies leapfrogged each other in the race
to release better versions of their browsers _ and Netscape's
customer base dwindled. A University of Illinois study showed that
from early 1996 through mid-1998, Netscape's 70-percent share of
the market eroded to a 50-50 split with Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Then Netscape dropped out of sight.
</P>
<P>
   In late 1998, poring through six years' worth of scripted code,
the company's software team threw up its hands and threw out the
Navigator program. Instead of retooling something tethered to a
legacy losing steam, Netscape decided to start from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   The software writers spent 18 months creating a smoother, more
potent engine to power the redesigned software. They toiled under
an aluminum soda-can replica of the Golden Gate Bridge, suspended
with paper clips and spanning the office, and by the
orange-and-green neon lights peeking through a translucent
cylindrical ``Warp Core'' built of empty Aquafina bottles _ both
products of work-numbed minds seeking release.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape 6.0 is now available in a beta version, an early
preview that's still being tweaked and tested but which can be
downloaded via the Internet. The company promises two more betas
before the final product's scheduled release late this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bullet you chew is the amount of time it takes to get the
product out, and it's never fast enough for anybody,'' Nalls said.
``But it was absolutely the right decision to take the hit,
redesign and have something glorious when we're done.''
</P>
<P>
   And ultimately, the timing may be optimal.
</P>
<P>
   The federal antitrust lawsuit against Microsoft centered around
competitive methods the U.S. government claims roughly elbowed
Netscape out of the market _ methods such as distributing Internet
Explorer for free with Windows and inking deals similar to the AOL
pact that once tied that Internet service to Explorer. Federal
Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson dubbed Microsoft a monopoly and on
May 7 ordered that the company be split.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit unleashed a torrent of anti-Microsoft sentiment that
could translate into a resurgence for Netscape if its latest
version meets early hype.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Netscape could come back, that would be great,'' said Bobby
George, a lead software engineer at Question.com Inc. ``We use
I.E., because it's one of those tools that you just have to use,
but I still like to pull for Netscape because everyone hates
Gates.''
</P>
<P>
   FOSTERING INNOVATION
</P>
<P>
   In Netscape's opinion, the guts of its browser are its true
glory.
</P>
<P>
   The engine that powers it all, christened Gecko after a tiny and
spry breed of lizard, is small enough to run on Internet
appliances. Gecko has attracted attention from companies such as
Intel Corp., Gateway Inc. and mobile-phone maker Nokia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're moving beyond the PC,'' Nalls said. ``We're seeing this
start now, with second and third Internet-access devices in the
home. These new platforms are very interesting to us.''
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, the real buzz _ at least in Netscape's eyes _
is what version 6.0 means to software developers.
</P>
<P>
   The new Netscape is what's called an open-source program.
Developers can access its core code for free and use it to their
advantage, creating new looks and color schemes for the browser
itself or making a specially branded tab for the new ``My Sidebar''
window. Companies and consumer users alike can distribute those
designs to global users, with Netscape's blessing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could hate your guts and you could still make a tab for the
browser, or a new program for it,'' said John Nagle, who handles
marketing for Netscape 6.0. ``This is more open to innovation.''
</P>
<P>
   Smiley said that availability could make it easier to win the
fight for dominance in the Internet-appliance market.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a developer wanted to build some kind of handheld pad or an
appliance, and needs to get to the market fast, that kind of
openness will be attractive,'' Smiley said. ``There's fierce
competition, but there's no winner, so Netscape could get some real
traction.''
</P>
<P>
   To attract a programmer writing Web-based software, browsers
must be compatible with an ever-expanding list of popular computer
languages, such as JavaScript and XML. Around 1996, some Web pages
could not load on Netscape's product because the browser did not
comprehend Java program code.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're quick to go with whatever has the best features,'' said
George of Question.com, which bases most of its programs on
Internet Explorer. ``Both products went back and forth through the
cycle of who's going to invent the best thing first, and Netscape
started falling behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Netscape built the new program around newly established
industry-wide standards for designing Web pages _ a raft of
languages that can shorten the time it takes to download certain
pages and which allow for changes to a Web site that can be
processed without having to reload it from the server.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft is also making its browser more compatible with these
standards, established by the World Wide Web Consortium. Netscape
expects to be the first to meet those standards completely, but
Smiley said its sudden compatibility isn't dramatic enough to
outweigh Microsoft, which all along was quicker to embrace new
languages as they popped up.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one's asking for that stuff any more,'' Smiley said. ``They
want stability, they want it to work and they want customer
service. That will be the test.''
</P>
<P>
   THE NAME GAME
</P>
<P>
   Consumers will notice that Netscape 6.0 bears the footprints of
its parent company, America Online, which bought the company in
late 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The e-mail messenger on Netscape 6.0 is entwined with AOL's
popular Instant Messenger, denoting with a special icon any message
arriving from someone who's also logged onto the chat service.
Users with AOL accounts can also check that mail through Netscape's
inbox.
</P>
<P>
   But those new features match step-for-step the changes Microsoft
is making to its browser. Internet Explorer 5.5, due in September
as part of the Windows Millennium Edition, similarly marries the
Outlook Express e-mail with Microsoft's MSN real-time message
program and the company's free HotmMail e-mail accounts.
</P>
<P>
   And that package comes out before Netscape 6.0 _ thus, there's a
crafty marketing trick.
</P>
<P>
   ``Naming it '6.0' is fluff,'' Smiley said. ``They did it to put
the version number ahead of Microsoft. There never was or will be a
Netscape 5.''
</P>
<P>
   The most striking changes are cosmetic, like the new dark-blue
color scheme, different icons and a retractable ``My Sidebar''
feature that can stay on-screen as people surf, tracking stocks and
news and storing the most recent search results for quick access.
</P>
<P>
   The program is also a smaller file _ just 5.5 megabytes,
occupying half the space inhabited by earlier versions and less
than the 7.8 megabytes required for Internet Explorer, according to
analyst Smiley.
</P>
<P>
   But even that might not matter in the war on the consumer front.
</P>
<P>
   ``Netscape was too late in its strategy,'' Smiley said. ``With
new high-speed Internet connections and faster computers, the
smaller file is a difference of just a few seconds, which is
meaningless.''

   Pomeroy Elementary School Principal Pat Kordelski, who witnesses
said seemed to be enjoying Cummings' mock threat until he actually
lobbed it, complained to Mesa Unified School District officials.
</P>
<P>
   The longtime teacher's forced transfer to another school has
provoked an angry uprising among parents who think Cummings has
been punished unfairly for the May19 gag {ndash} and that Kordelski
is too tough for their children.
</P>
<P>
   ``She wanted to have him fired. Over a piece of cake,'' parent
Petty Denisuk said. ``It's just blown out of proportion.''
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of parents banded together to support Cummings, and
presented the district with two petitions: one to reinstate
Cummings at Pomeroy and the other to have Kordelski transferred.
</P>
<P>
   They passed out hundreds of fliers and put up yard signs reading
``Save Our School'' and ``We Support Mr. C.''

   SAN JOSE - Envy tinged the voice of Maricopa County Supervisor
Mary Rose Wilcox last week as she gazed around a modern, sunlit
building here.
</P>
<P>
   ``(beginitalic)This(enditalic) is a homeless shelter?'' she
murmured as fellow Supervisor Jan Brewer stood nearby, shaking her
head in disbelief at the Montgomery Street Inn, a shelter for
homeless men.
</P>
<P>
   The spacious central dining hall features skylights in a high
ceiling. Men live in spotlessly clean, curtained cubicles.
Restrooms are immaculate.
</P>
<P>
   ``How did you get the capital to build this?'' asked Wilcox, who
with Brewer and other Valley leaders came to observe the shelter
and meet with Santa Clara County officials.
</P>
<P>
   Christine Burroughs, director of the charitable group InnVision,
smiled. ``All of us'' - she gestured at about 20 other Santa Clara
officials - ``pooled our knowledge and resources to make this and
places like it possible,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The visiting Valley officials want to make it possible in their
county, too. They've been agonizing over how to deal with the
Phoenix area's own growing homeless population, now numbering about
15,000.
</P>
<P>
   Most immediately, Valley leaders are trying to figure out how to
replace the aging, crowded Central Arizona Shelter Services
building in downtown Phoenix. It is the Valley's largest shelter,
but its decrepit condition and the fact that it stands in the way
of downtown redevelopment make moving it a top priority.
</P>
<P>
   But efforts to move CASS ``have been a mess,'' Wilcox said.
``There is controversy over where to put it, and even a greater
question over who will pay for it - the state, the county, the
city-who?''
</P>
<P>
   Former Phoenix Mayor Terry Goddard, now with the U.S. Department
of Housing and Urban Development, said haphazard efforts to move
CASS are symptoms of a greater problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't had a comprehensive approach to fighting
homelessness here,'' Goddard said. ``There are many city, county,
state, private agency folks helping the homeless, but they haven't
worked very well together. Now, they're making a good beginning
effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix officials once coordinated regional applications to HUD
for funds to fight homelessness Valley-wide, Goddard said, but gave
up that role last year. Now the Maricopa Association of Governments
is beginning to knit together efforts of local governments and
agencies to deal with homeless issues.
</P>
<P>
   But Goddard and many officials think local efforts need help.
Hence, the trip to California.
</P>
<P>
   Santa Clara and Alameda counties have been recognized by HUD as
among the most successful in the nation at taking a comprehensive
approach to homeless issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have brought every agency-government, church, private-to
the table,'' Goddard said. ``They have extraordinary non-profit and
governmental agency cooperation. Everyone involved is at the table,
enthusiastic, and they are there with money.''
</P>
<P>
   The trip to California included key players in Valley efforts to
end homelessness, among them the two county supervisors, former
Arizona Supreme Court Chief Justice Frank Gordon, officials from
Phoenix, Tempe and Mesa, a Catholic agency director, and
private-sector representatives. Gordon will lead MAG's efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to bring in all the Valley cities in, need the Board
of Supervisors to be the driver on this effort, but we particularly
need to get private industry to come in with significant funds,''
Gordon said. ``We saw how Santa Clara County worked with industry
to create a $20million trust fund. That should be an example for
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Guy Mikkelsen, head of the Catholic Diocese of Phoenix
Foundation for Senior Living, said, ``We've all been dealing with
homeless problems piecemeal. Terry has been trying impress upon us
the competitive nature of grants and how we have to work together
to secure federal funds. People now see that.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilcox said, ``I've been talking with Arnold Ramirez, who is
here for Phoenix, and we're going to get together and look at the
county and city as one entity instead of two.''
</P>
<P>
   Brewer said the responsibility for moving CASS ``is one we all
must shoulder.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The county should be the facilitator,'' she said. ``Part of
the financial solution may be using dollars available through HUD.
Other money should be raised from the private sector. Everyone must
step to the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're doing it up here,'' Brewer said. ``We can do it too.''

DEFECTIONS FELL BARAK'S COALITION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Prime Minister Ehud Barak's governing coalition has
collapsed on the eve of his departure for a Camp David summit and a
historic opportunity to clinch a far-reaching Israeli-Palestinian
peace deal.
</P>
<P>
   Three right-wing and religious parties, including Barak's
largest coalition partner, announced they were quitting the
government, reducing Barak's support in Parliament from a 68-52
majority to a 48-72 minority.
</P>
<P>
   Several key ministers in Barak's Cabinet handed in letters of
resignation. Foreign Minister David Levy announced he would boycott
the US-hosted talks.
</P>
<P>
   The defection, analysts said, was triggered by Barak's failure
to build a consensus before the summit, and by a perception in the
conservative wing of the coalition that he would turn over too much
West Bank land to the Palestinians at the bargaining table.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the crisis that swirled around him, Barak vowed to leave
for Tuesday's summit at the Maryland presidential retreat with
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing on national television Sunday night, Barak appealed to
Israelis, saying, ``I ask you to stand behind me . . . and join me
in the big prayer of us all, the prayer to see peace and security
for Israel at a time when we are facing the most important and
greatest challenge ever to stand before us.''
</P>
<P>
   Adding more drama to the pre-summit political tempest, Barak and
his Labor/One Israel Party government are set Monday to face a
previously scheduled no confidence vote. The measure, introduced by
the conservative Likud party opposition, requires 61 votes in the
120-member Knesset to topple Barak and force early elections.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts on Israel Radio confidently predicted that Barak would
thwart the measure by cobbling together support from leftist
Israeli and Arab Israeli parliamentary members.
</P>
<P>
   Both Barak and Arafat are hemmed in by domestic political
pressures. Barak's troubles broke wide open in Israel's unruly
political arena Sunday. But Arafat also has mounting pressure on
him to deliver the benefits of peace as frustration mounts in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
   Tension flared in Gaza Sunday after Israeli soldiers stationed
at a settlement fired on a passing taxi, killing a Palestinian
woman and severely wounding her infant son and her husband. Two
other civilians also were wounded. The Israeli military apologized
to the Palestinian Authority over the incident, saying shots had
been fired on the settlement, and the soldiers believed the taxi to
be the source of the shooting. Palestinian officials disputed the
Israeli version of events, saying that the Israeli soldiers fired
without provocation on innocent civilians.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said the Middle East ``can move forward toward
peace, or can slide back into turmoil'' depending on the outcome of
these talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the parties do not seize this moment to make more progress,
there will be more hostility and more bitterness _ perhaps even
more violence,'' the president wrote in Newsweek magazine. ``While
there clearly is no guarantee of success, not to try would
guarantee failure.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Barak and Arafat go into the talks looking over their
shoulders, knowing that even if they can reach a deal they may not
be able to sell it to their constituents back home. Barak,
especially, will be restricted at the talks by the domestic
political crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli newspaper reports in the days running up to the summit
said Barak was prepared to cede more than 80 percent of the West
Bank to Palestinians _ an amount that falls short of Palestinian
expectations yet is seen as a dangerous betrayal by Israeli
conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians currently have full or partial control over
roughly 40 percent of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   The rebelling members of Barak's coalition say the West Bank,
which was captured by Israel in the 1967 Six-Day War, is the
biblical birthright of the Jews and crucial to the security of
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, a 35-year veteran of Israel's military and its most
highly decorated soldier, fired back at his critics, saying, ``No
one will teach me what security is.''
</P>
<P>
   But Barak's leadership style _ as a general who hunkers down and
makes his own decisions without informing even his allies of the
details _ appears to have backfired.
</P>
<P>
   Interior Minister Natan Sharansky, head of a right-leaning
Russian immigrant party, was the first coalition partner to quit
Sunday. He told reporters, ``I've just now turned in my resignation
letter to the prime minister. As I told him this morning, I believe
it's a big mistake that he travels to Washington without drafting a
joint stance of coalition members. As a result of this, there were
all sorts of understandings with the Palestinians which are not
acceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   Just hours later, the powerful ultra-Orthodox Shas Party
announced it too was leaving the government. The National Religious
Party was the next to vow to defect.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no support for your trip,'' Shas Party chairman Eli
Yishai told Barak in comments to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   By law, Cabinet resignations take effect after 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Levy, Barak's foreign minister, also turned down an invitation
to join Barak at the summit. Analysts said Levy was angry that he
was marginalized by Barak during secret negotiations with the
Palestinians that reportedly led up to the summit.
</P>
<P>
   Israel and the Palestinians are heading to the United States for
the summit in an effort to finalize a deal by a self-imposed Sept.
13 deadline to have resolved the most difficult issues surrounding
the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The issues include not only the final borders, but the status of
Jerusalem, which both sides see as their capital, the future of
Jewish settlements built in the West Bank, and the fate of some 3
million Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, elected last year with a sweeping majority who supported
his avowal to reach a peace agreement, has promised to hold a
referendum on any deal before he signs it.
</P>
<P>
   So it seems Barak may be willing and able to go over the heads
of his coalition partners in bringing a momentous peace deal with
Palestinians directly to the voters themselves.
</P>
<P>
   And Barak has been publicly confident that if an agreement is
reached at Camp David, it will be approved by an overwhelming
majority of Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   He has also objected to right-wing criticisms that he should
have informed Israel of the precise ``red line,'' or limits of
proposed borders, ahead of the talks. To do so, he said, would
weaken Israel's negotiating position.

   ``Jim the Boy''
</P>
<P>
   ByTony Earley
</P>
<P>
   (Little, Brown, $23.95)
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult to describe a book like this, a small gem that
appears without fanfare and quietly puts other novels to shame.
It's the story of 10-year-old Jim Glass, whose father died a week
before he was born and who has been raised by his mother and her
three unmarried brothers, known collectively to Jim as ``the
uncles.'' They are a makeshift but solid family, working their
North Carolina farm during the years of the Great Depression. The
action, like the book cover, is deceptively simple, involving a new
suitor for Jim's mother, a new friend for Jim at school and a trip
with one of his uncles that opens Jim's eyes to the world beyond
the small town of Aliceville. Earley, who writes beautifully and
yet with studied restraint, creates a tangible world with these
characters and--bO,Y &UR; .H:hY deep 9

<TEXT>
<P>
   We all have our embarrassing little secrets. Mine is that I read
children's books.
</P>
<P>
   I started when I was a small boy, raiding our tiny elementary
school library for such kinder classics as Roy Chapman Andrew's
(beginitalic)All About Dinosaurs, (enditalic)and have continued to
this day.
</P>
<P>
   It was never the fictional or fairy tale books I latched onto
but the histories, biographies, science and natural history books.
Herbert S. Zim was my god.
</P>
<P>
   The books were filled with the answers to the questions I had
when I was in third grade. Why do some whales have teeth and others
baleen? How does an airplane stay in the air? Why is an egg shaped
that way?
</P>
<P>
   I still have questions, and books still provide answers. Or when
they don't give me answers, they show me the path to find my own
answer.
</P>
<P>
   But sometimes jumping straight into a serious adult tome is
confusing. The experts who write them know much more than I do. And
they don't care about my ignorance. As a result, they can write
well beyond my poor ability to understand them on first go-round.
They are either written with the assumption that you already have
the rudiments, or they are polemical and assume you know the
disputed territory, or they are specialist books filled with a new
vocabulary you haven't learned yet.
</P>
<P>
   That's where children's books come in.
</P>
<P>
   Children's books give you the simplified, coherent version that
the adult books won't deign to provide.
</P>
<P>
   I am aware that the version the children's book gives is often
distorted, grotesquely simplified and sometimes just plain wrong.
But that doesn't matter: They provide a start, a map to the subject
at hand and give you an orientation that can later be fleshed out,
made more subtle and transcended. But you have to begin somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   It is important to realize that knowledge is not merely a
collection of facts. We are bombarded with facts daily, and it
hasn't made any of us smarter. It just means we have more to
forget. And we do.
</P>
<P>
   Knowledge is a set of interrelationships between facts. The
interrelationship has a shape and coherence that cannot be
constructed from the facts alone.
</P>
<P>
   I am reminded over and over about Einstein and facts. ``If I
need a fact, I can look it up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   You can understand information by two different metaphors. I
choose what I call the ``tree of knowledge.'' It has roots and
branches and creates a unified, simple idea. There may be many
leaves on the tree, but if you keep the shape of the tree in mind,
the leaves - the facts - will turn out to be just where they need
to be.
</P>
<P>
   The other metaphor - the one we come across daily in TV
newscasts, magazine articles and written driving exams - is what I
call ``fact confetti.'' This is the blizzard of unconnected data
that piles up across our road. Get me a snowplow.
</P>
<P>
   If you think of history as a bunch of dates and names - 1588,
1492, June 6, A.D.79 - it's no wonder you have trouble remembering
it. But if you know the great flow, the big picture, all the
details make sense where they come.
</P>
<P>
   They are more than merely dates associated with the Spanish
Armada, the expulsion of Jews from Spain, D-Day or the destruction
of Pompeii, they are part of the inevitable flow of history.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a systemic view of anatomy, no bone will be
unconnected to its neighbor. If you know the division between
bivalves and univalves, the shells you find at the beach have an
instant home - a kind of mailbox in your brain - where they belong
and fit comfortably.
</P>
<P>
   I often have found that if I have forgotten a fact, I can
re-create it accurately by knowing its context. It is better to
know how the French Revolution fits into the change from the Age of
Enlightenment to the Age of Romanticism. If you feel the larger
flow, then you remember that the French Revolution (beginitalic)has
(enditalic)to come after the American one.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, once you have created enough of these ``trees of
knowledge'' on a large number of subjects, then you start seeing
the forest instead of the trees, and it becomes easier and easier
to fit a new shrub into the even larger system. All with almost
none of the pain of trying to learn facts by rote.
</P>
<P>
   Children's books give you a sense of the flow and very few
facts. If later you discover that the tree of knowledge you gained
from the kid's book is flawed, you can trim it or replant it, but
it has served its purpose. It has got you in the door.
</P>
<P>
   And, if you never get beyond a children's book, well, you still
know more than most people.

   &UR; THE COLONY OF UNREQUITED DREAMS &LR;  By Wayne Johnston. Anchor,
$14. The protagonist of this biographical novel is the weedy but
ambitious Joe Smallwood, who helped steer the incorporation of the
vast, mysterious island of Newfoundland into Canada and became the
province's first premier. ``Johnston's eloquent anti-epic is in its
thorny way a respectful tribute to a place more willful than even
its toughest inhabitants,'' Luc Sante wrote in The New York Times
Book Review in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NO OTHER BOOK: Selected Essays &LR;  By Randall Jarrell. Edited by
Brad Leithauser. Perennial/HarperCollins, $15. This collection of
the poet's major critical essays contains many valuations and
opinions _ about the pre-eminence of Frost, Eliot and Stevens in
the 20th-century pantheon of American poets, for example _ that
were once considered provocative but have become orthodoxy today.
``He was astute, insightful, passionate, sympathetic and remarkably
prophetic,'' Brooke Allen wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   In  &UR; THE BROKEN ESTATE: Essays on Literature and Belief &LR; , by
James Wood (Modern Library, $14.95), a combative critic explores
the transition from religious belief to literary belief in the 19th
century, and the effects of that shift on practitioners of fiction
from Melville to Pynchon. ``It is the excess, the polemical drive,
that makes him exhilarating to read, often to be instructed by,
sometimes to argue with,'' William H. Pritchard wrote in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MY RUSSIAN &LR;  By Deirdre McNamer. Ballantine, $14. After her
husband is wounded by an intruder and her lover, a Russian
gardener, drops out of sight, this novel's middle-aged heroine
assumes another identity to spy on her own life and try to correct
its course. ``McNamer is a careful writer, a master of the small,
telling observation,'' Susan Bolotin wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; JUNETEENTH &LR;  By Ralph Ellison. Edited by John F. Callahan.
Vintage International, $14. This tale of a racist white senator
raised as black, assembled from voluminous notes after Ellison's
death in 1994, never coheres as his second novel, Louis Menand
wrote last year. As a stew of various African-American oral
traditions, however, ``it is an interesting experiment'' that
features ``some quite Joycean riffs.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE MAJORS: In Pursuit of Golf's Holy Grail &LR;  By John Feinstein.
Back Bay/Little, Brown, $14.95. A reporter surveys 1998's four
major championships _ the Masters, the U.S. Open, the British Open
and the PGA Championship _ and the human dramas among both winners
and losers. ``If you want to know how touring pros think, on and
off the course,'' Dave Anderson wrote last year, ``this is the
book.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE MEME MACHINE &LR;  By Susan Blackmore. Oxford University,
$14.95. A psychologist sets out a Darwinian theory of cultural
evolution in which ``replicators'' _ words, beliefs and other
packets of shared data _ behave as biological genes to drive human
behavior. Last year in The New York Times Book Review, Robert
Wright called this an ``earnest and engaging, if not wholly
persuasive, book.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TRUMPET &LR;  By Jackie Kay. Vintage Contemporaries, $13. This
Scottish novel about a famous trumpet player, which features
several narrators, is evidently inspired by the life of the
American jazz musician Billy Tipton, who passed as a man until her
death in 1989. The book ``leaves us with a broad landscape of sweet
tolerance and familial love,'' Aoibheann Sweeney wrote in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NO ONE LEFT TO LIE TO: The Triangulations of William Jefferson
Clinton &LR;  By Christopher Hitchens. Verso, $10. An unabashed Clinton
hater makes his case with a blunt assessment of the president's
personal flaws and amazing manipulative skills. Even if his attack
is obsessive, Karen Lehrman said last year, ``Hitchens' brave
willingness to show all the sordid scenarios in which our emperor
has removed his clothes is beyond refreshing.''
</P>
<P>
   In  &UR; UNCOVERING CLINTON: A Reporter's Story &LR; , by Michael Isikoff
(Three Rivers, $14), the journalist responsible for many of the
revelations about Bill Clinton's sexual indiscretions defends his
work and explains how he lost scoops because of his editors'
hesitations. ``Isikoff makes a plausible case ... for continuing to
pursue a story that could possibly have brought down a president,''
Tom Goldstein wrote in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SURRENDER, DOROTHY &LR;  By Meg Wolitzer. Washington Square/Pocket
Books, $12.95. This novel explores the aftershocks of a woman's
sudden death on her friends and family, in particular the strange
jealousies that emerge among the survivors. In 1999 the reviewer
Sylvia Brownrigg admired the author's ``knack for wry comedy'' and
her ``easy and astute'' observations about her characters' lives.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE BOY IN THE LAKE &LR;  By Eric Swanson. St. Martin's Griffin,
$11.95. In this elegiac novel, a New York therapist returns to his
Ohio hometown after his grandmother's death and tries to make up
with a boyhood lover whom he had cruelly betrayed. ``Swanson writes
surely, sometimes beautifully,'' Peter Kurth wrote last year.

   (NOTE: Because of the complicated figuring involved, you are
requested to use these Best Sellers lists in full or not at all.
This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-to,
and Miscellaneous'' listings were separated from the nonfiction
list for important reasons, and not to print ``Advice, How-To and
Miscellaneous'' gives an impression that is incorrect, resulting in
criticism from publishing houses.)
</P>
<P>
   Rankings reflect sales figures for the week ending July 1 at
almost 4,000 bookstores plus wholesalers serving 60,000 other
retailers, statistically weighted to represent sales in all such
outlets nationwide. The number of titles within the two
subdivisions of nonfiction can change from week to week, reflecting
changes in book buying.

   An (x) following a book's ranking indicates that a book's sales
are barely distinguishable from those of the book above. A (b)

   U.S.-WORLD-POWER-REVIEW (Washington) _ The
U.S.-Israeli-Palestinian summit meeting raises anew the overarching
questions dogging President Clinton, his aspiring successors and
Congress. Toward what ends should America harness the astounding
economic, military, political and cultural power it has accrued in
recent years? Is it enough to act as the world's peacemaker? Why is
the country having so much trouble establishing its international
priorities? By David Sanger. (Moved in `i' category)

<P>
   PRESCRIPTION-DRUGS-REVIEW (Washington) _ In this election
season, helping the elderly pay for their pills is a political
no-brainer: Everybody's for it. The fight is over how to do it.
Republicans want private insurers to run any prescription drug
benefits plan. Democrats want the government in control. But that
classic liberal-conservative clash masks the real issue: how much
drugs will cost, and who will set their prices. By Sheryl Gay
Stolberg. (Moved in `a' category)

   SOCIAL-SPECIES-REVIEW (Undated) _ Like dolphins, chimpanzees and

Dining al fresco on crowded sidewalks with cell phones grafted to
our ears. You scratch my back, I'll de-flea yours. Synchronized
swimming, anyone? Biologists say the complexities of social life
are what gave rise to big brains and intelligence in the first
place. Highly social species are, as a rule, the smartest and most
sophisticated. But why is there nothing stupider, nothing more
primitive and dangerous, than a crowd of people? If human sociality
has its roots in its primate past, it's worth asking whether the
menacing side of a human crowd likewise resembles group behavior
among nonhuman species. By Natalie Angier.

   THEATER-SUPERSTITIONS-REVIEW (New York) _ The ``Macbeth'' curse,
in which productions of that play have been harried by misfortune,
is not the only hanging over the black-magic-laden world of the
theater, a profession where open incantations of blood lust
(``Break a leg!'') are routine. The list of taboos is lengthy:
never whistle in the dressing room, never open an umbrella onstage,
never play an electrical fuse. A brief rundown of some current and
ancient omens plaguing the stage. By James McKinley.
</P>

   SWEATSHOPS-REVIEW (undated) _ Many consumers are displaying
noblesse oblige toward the millions of foreign workers who make the
goods that flood American stores. For years, anti-sweatshop
protests accomplished next to nothing. But as the anti-sweatshop
movement continues to grow _ and grow louder _ manufacturers have
recently taken steps that just might improve working conditions
around the world. By Steven Greenhouse.
</P>
<P>
   MOVIE-HYPE-REVIEW (Undated) _ It's movie hype season. Since
1975, when ``Jaws'' devoured the box office and showed the film
industry new ways to get kids to see films over and over again
during the summer, hype has become its own industry. Colossal
promotional campaigns that studios create to sell their films
include the repetitive cover stories in glossy magazines, newspaper
and TV coverage and blanket advertising. Studios usually spend one
and a half times the production budget of a movie on publicity. By
Elvis Mitchell.
</P>

   BOYSCOUT-MANUAL-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ The recent Supreme Court
decision allowing the Boy Scouts to expel a gay member dealt in
part with the moral values of Scouting. The first Boy Scout manual,
published in 1910 by Scouting founder Ernest Thompson Seton, says
nothing about homosexuality, but has much to say about primal urges

   MEXICO-DEMOCRACY-REVIEW (Mexico City) _ The victory of
opposition presidential candidate Vicente Fox has raised hopes
among poor Mexicans, who are indicating that they will no longer
hand over their votes and expect little in return. What they most
expect from Fox are programs and reforms that will help Mexico's
new democracy expand beyond elections. But what some do not quite
realize is that the new president's powers have also been radically
altered _ and in some ways weakened _ by some of the same currents
that carried him to victory: he is not part of the one-party
apparatus that monopolized power but so often failed its people. By
Ginger Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   BOSNIA-ATROCITIES-REVIEW (Undated) _ Thousands of carefully
numbered, white plastic bags stacked on wooden shelves fill two
tunnels behind a morgue in central Bosnia. In warm weather, the
stench is overwhelming. The bags contain the remains of 2,000
bodies collected over the last five years from mass graves and
hillsides around Srebrenica. The limbo in which the bodies still
wait for final burial stands as a symbol of the uncertain fate of
Bosnia itself _ and much else in the Balkans. By David Rohde.

   One Thing Made Him Sweat
</P>
<P>
   When Queen Elizabeth II knighted Sean Connery in his hometown,
Edinburgh, Scotland, the actor called the occasion ``one of the
proudest days of my life.'' Shame on him. Didn't Connery know that
for James Bond, the legendary superspy he portrayed in seven
movies, the prospect of a knighthood was as horrifying as that of a
vodka martini stirred, not shaken?
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Man With the Golden Gun'' (1965), the last James Bond
novel written by the character's creator, Ian Fleming, Bond is
recommended for a knighthood _ specifically, the Knight Commander
of St. Michael and St. George (KCMG) _ but declines the honor.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had never been a public figure,'' Fleming wrote, ``and he
did not wish to become one. He had no prejudice against letters
after one's name, or before it. But there was one thing above all
he treasured. His privacy. His anonymity. To become a public
person, a person, in the snobbish world of England, of any country,
who would be called upon to open things, lay foundation stones,
make after-dinner speeches, brought the sweat to his armpits.''
</P>
<P>
   So in a telegram to M., the head of the British Secret Service,
Bond writes, ``EYE AM A SCOTTISH PEASANT AND EYE WILL ALWAYS FEEL
AT HOME BEING A SCOTTISH PEASANT AND EYE KNOW COMMA SIR COMMA THAT
YOU WILL UNDERSTAND MY PREFERENCE AND THAT EYE CAN COUNT ON YOUR
INDULGENCE.''
</P>
<P>
   007, being a Scottish spy, also had a Scottish reason for
spurning a knighthood. In a sentence that he ultimately strikes
from his telegram, Bond says: ``MY PRINCIPAL REASON IS THAT EYE
DONT WANT TO PAY MORE AT HOTELS AND RESTAURANTS.''
</P>
<P>
   Bond, presumably, has helped make Connery so wealthy that he no
longer has to worry about such things.

   Quidditch, Anyone?
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, J.K. Rowling, a struggling single mother in
Edinburgh, completed a children's novel, written mostly in coffee
shops. Today ``Harry Potter'' is the biggest publishing phenomenon
in history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone'' and two sequels, all
about an orphaned boy with wizard powers, have sold nearly 21
million copies. The fourth book _ ``Harry Potter and the Goblet of
Fire'' _ is being published with the kind of hoopla reserved for
the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The book was published Saturday, when a record first printing of
3.8 million copies went on sale in the United States. Scholastic
Inc., released the book at 12:01 a.m., and bookstores around the
nation gave midnight ``Harry Potter'' parties, with clerks dressed
as wizards and witches.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have been excited about this for months,'' said Barbara
Theroux, owner of the Fact and Fiction Bookstore in Missoula, Mont.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the extraordinary secrecy with which the book was
published, newspapers report that several lucky children in
Virginia received early copies. An 8-year-old girl in Fairfax got
one from a clerk who apparently didn't realize the book was
embargoed, and a Richmond Wal-Mart store mistakenly sold 20 copies
before the book was pulled from the shelves.
</P>
<P>
   To the delight of Scholastic and Warner Brothers, which owns the
movie rights, Rowling has promised three more ``Harry Potter''
books before the series concludes.

   Camp Clinton Opens For the Summer
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has invited Israel's prime minister, Ehud
Barak, and the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, to Camp David
this week to try to end a half-century of conflict. Administration
officials cautioned that success was not guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   News of the summit was greeted with skepticism among Palestinian
leaders, while two political parties announced they would pull out
of Barak's coalition government, leaving him with just 59 of the
120 seats in parliament.

   Cartel Comedy
</P>
<P>
   In a week marked by missteps and contradictory messages, the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries seemed more like the
Gang That Couldn't Shoot Straight than an immensely powerful global
cartel.
</P>
<P>
   First Saudi Arabia, the world's largest petroleum producer,
announced it would increase output by 500,000 barrels a day to
drive down high oil prices, and crude futures fell sharply.
</P>
<P>
   Then, other OPEC members said the Saudis had been misunderstood,
and a production increase was not imminent. Crude prices rose
again. The Saudis have since stayed quiet, and gas prices, not
surprisingly, continued to climb in most of the United States.

   Chechnya, Again
</P>
<P>
   Just one week after a Russian general proclaimed the war in
Chechnya all but won, a series of bombings killed at least 33
Russian troops in the breakaway republic.
</P>
<P>
   The truck bomb attacks, which occurred on Sunday night, took
place in towns and cities supposedly under Russian control.
President Vladimir Putin promised to curtail the role in Chechnya
of Russian police _ whose troops were killed in the bombings. The
police came from throughout Russia and their deaths have sent shock
waves through the nation.

   Two Apples for Gore
</P>
<P>
   As expected, Vice President Al Gore received overwhelming
endorsements from the two national teachers unions and enormous
ovations when he visited their conventions. Gore spoke first to the
American Federation of Teachers in Philadelphia, then flew to
Chicago to address the National Education Association.
</P>
<P>
   The teachers are part of a large labor coalition backing Gore
candidacy, and have been energized by his staunch opposition to
vouchers, which would allow public money to be used for
private-school tuition. His opponent, Gov. George W. Bush, supports
them.

   America Needs Lawyers
</P>
<P>
   Law school is hot, and business school is not. In a turnaround
that surprised educators, the number of people applying to the
nation's law schools has increased in each of the last two years,
after a decade of steep declines. Meanwhile, almost every top
business school received fewer applications this year. Some
experienced declines of up to 20 pecent.

   In a tight labor market, some deans said, companies may be

   Criminal or Kangaroo Court?
</P>
<P>
   A revolutionary court in the southern city of Shiraz convicted
10 of 13 Iranian Jews of spying for Israel. They received sentences
ranging from four to 13 years in prison. The other three were
acquitted.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict and the closed trial were greeted with protests by
Jewish and human rights groups, who saw the proceedings as possibly
more political than criminal in nature.
</P>
<P>
   Ismail Nasseri Mojarrad, part of the defense team, expressed
hope that the sentences would be reduced by the appeals court.
``The court lacks evidence except confessions by some of the Jews
which we insist are not valid according to the law,'' Mojarrad
said.

   A World of Misery
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations' annual Human Development Report ranks
nations according to the availability of schools, clean water,
medical care, life expectancy and political rights.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the report found that Sierra Leone was the worst
place in the world to be born, and that 30 of the 35 countries at
the bottom of the index were in sub-Saharan Africa. In that region,
the survey showed, life expectancy is down to the 40s and 50s, and,
largely because of AIDS, is falling for the first time in decades.
Less than half the regional population goes to school and most
people lack clean water.
</P>
<P>
   The next lowest-ranked nations, from the bottom up, are Niger,
Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Burundi, Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique, Chad,
the Central African Republic and Mali.
</P>
<P>
   Haiti was the sole representative from the Western Hemisphere
among the bottom 35 countries in the survey.

   Closing the Books
</P>
<P>
   The German Parliament approved a bill, on a vote of 556-42, that
set the stage for compensation to Nazi slave laborers and other
Holocaust victims. German industry and the government will each pay
$2.5 billion to the fund.
</P>
<P>
   The vote ends a half-century of denial of responsibility by
German manufacturers, including the German subsidiaries of Ford and
General Motors.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, German manufacturers argued that the Nazis had
simply required them to use the forced workers.

<P>
   Is America using a vast surveillance network, known as Echelon,
which receives and analyzes satellite communications, to give its
corporations a leg up in their business dealings? Washington says
no, but a lot of Europeans aren't buying it.
</P>
<P>
   The European Parliament has voted to form a committee to
investigate the matter and a French prosecutor has begun a
preliminary inquiry. What might become of either inquiry is
unclear, but together they testify to Europe's growing wariness of
U.S. global power.
</P>
<P>
   ``Echelon is used by the National Security Agency for strategic
and economic gains,'' Prosecutor Jean-Pierre Dintilhac said. ''You
cannot make me believe that the information is not passed on to
American companies.''

   A Brief Reprieve
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration will postpone the first federal
execution since 1963. A convicted murderer, Juan Raul Garza, is
scheduled to be executed on Aug. 5, but the White House, citing
concerns about the fairness of the death penalty and the absence of
clemency procedures, is awaiting Justice Department regulations on
how inmates on death row should seek clemency.
</P>

   The regulations should be completed within a couple of weeks,

   One Thing Made Him Sweat
</P>
<P>
   When Queen Elizabeth II knighted Sean Connery in his hometown,
Edinburgh, Scotland, the actor called the occasion ``one of the
proudest days of my life.'' Shame on him. Didn't Connery know that
for James Bond, the legendary superspy he portrayed in seven
movies, the prospect of a knighthood was as horrifying as that of a
vodka martini stirred, not shaken?
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Man With the Golden Gun'' (1965), the last James Bond
novel written by the character's creator, Ian Fleming, Bond is
recommended for a knighthood _ specifically, the Knight Commander
of St. Michael and St. George (KCMG) _ but declines the honor.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had never been a public figure,'' Fleming wrote, ``and he
did not wish to become one. He had no prejudice against letters
after one's name, or before it. But there was one thing above all
he treasured. His privacy. His anonymity. To become a public
person, a person, in the snobbish world of England, of any country,
who would be called upon to open things, lay foundation stones,
make after-dinner speeches, brought the sweat to his armpits.''
</P>
<P>
   So in a telegram to M., the head of the British Secret Service,
Bond writes, ``EYE AM A SCOTTISH PEASANT AND EYE WILL ALWAYS FEEL
AT HOME BEING A SCOTTISH PEASANT AND EYE KNOW COMMA SIR COMMA THAT
YOU WILL UNDERSTAND MY PREFERENCE AND THAT EYE CAN COUNT ON YOUR
INDULGENCE.''
</P>
<P>
   007, being a Scottish spy, also had a Scottish reason for
spurning a knighthood. In a sentence that he ultimately strikes
from his telegram, Bond says: ``MY PRINCIPAL REASON IS THAT EYE
DONT WANT TO PAY MORE AT HOTELS AND RESTAURANTS.''
</P>
<P>
   Bond, presumably, has helped make Connery so wealthy that he no
longer has to worry about such things.

   Quidditch, Anyone?
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, J.K. Rowling, a struggling single mother in
Edinburgh, completed a children's novel, written mostly in coffee
shops. Today ``Harry Potter'' is the biggest publishing phenomenon
in history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone'' and two sequels, all
about an orphaned boy with wizard powers, have sold nearly 21
million copies. The fourth book _ ``Harry Potter and the Goblet of
Fire'' _ is being published with the kind of hoopla reserved for
the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The book was published Saturday, when a record first printing of
3.8 million copies went on sale in the United States. Scholastic
Inc., released the book at 12:01 a.m., and bookstores around the
nation gave midnight ``Harry Potter'' parties, with clerks dressed
as wizards and witches.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have been excited about this for months,'' said Barbara
Theroux, owner of the Fact and Fiction Bookstore in Missoula, Mont.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the extraordinary secrecy with which the book was
published, newspapers report that several lucky children in
Virginia received early copies. An 8-year-old girl in Fairfax got
one from a clerk who apparently didn't realize the book was
embargoed, and a Richmond Wal-Mart store mistakenly sold 20 copies
before the book was pulled from the shelves.
</P>
<P>
   To the delight of Scholastic and Warner Brothers, which owns the
movie rights, Rowling has promised three more ``Harry Potter''
books before the series concludes.

<P>
   President Clinton has invited Israel's prime minister, Ehud
Barak, and the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, to Camp David
this week to try to end a half-century of conflict. Administration
officials cautioned that success was not guaranteed.
</P>

   News of the summit was greeted with skepticism among Palestinian
leaders, while two political parties announced they would pull out
of Barak's coalition government, leaving him with just 59 of the
120 seats in parliament.

   Cartel Comedy

<P>
   In a week marked by missteps and contradictory messages, the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries seemed more like the
Gang That Couldn't Shoot Straight than an immensely powerful global
cartel.
</P>
<P>
   First Saudi Arabia, the world's largest petroleum producer,
announced it would increase output by 500,000 barrels a day to
drive down high oil prices, and crude futures fell sharply.
</P>
<P>
   Then, other OPEC members said the Saudis had been misunderstood,
and a production increase was not imminent. Crude prices rose
again. The Saudis have since stayed quiet, and gas prices, not
surprisingly, continued to climb in most of the United States.

Russian troops in the breakaway republic.
</P>
<P>
   The truck bomb attacks, which occurred on Sunday night, took
place in towns and cities supposedly under Russian control.
President Vladimir Putin promised to curtail the role in Chechnya
of Russian police _ whose troops were killed in the bombings. The
police came from throughout Russia and their deaths have sent shock

American Federation of Teachers in Philadelphia, then flew to
Chicago to address the National Education Association.
</P>
<P>
   The teachers are part of a large labor coalition backing Gore
candidacy, and have been energized by his staunch opposition to
vouchers, which would allow public money to be used for
private-school tuition. His opponent, Gov. George W. Bush, supports
them.

   Law school is hot, and business school is not. In a turnaround
that surprised educators, the number of people applying to the
nation's law schools has increased in each of the last two years,
after a decade of steep declines. Meanwhile, almost every top
business school received fewer applications this year. Some

MEXICO'S VOTERS SPOKE. NOW THE VICTOR MUST ACT. 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Week in Review)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ On the night that Vicente Fox wrested control of
the Mexican presidency from the ruling Institutional Revolutionary
Party, the jubilant victor rushed out to celebrate with throngs of
supporters who had gathered at the monument of the Angel of
Independence in the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of miles away in a rural village in the eastern state
of Veracruz, a small group of potato farmers gathered around a
black-and-white television set to watch grainy images of the
celebration. Sometimes it was hard for them to hear Fox above the
chants from the crowd around him. But what the crowd had to say
came through loud and clear. ``Vicente no nos falles,'' the
televised crowd blared.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vicente, don't fail us.''
</P>
<P>
   The words stirred the farmers in Veracruz, and they picked up
the chant. That simple plea, said one farmer, summed up the deep
sense of betrayal people have long felt toward their government and
their desperation for change. But there was also an edgy challenge
in the plea.
</P>
<P>
   Mexicans will no longer hand over their votes and expect little
in return, the farmers said. And what they most expect from Fox are
programs and reforms that will help the nation's new democracy
expand beyond elections.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment of their greatest expectation, however, some
voters do not quite realize that the new president's powers have
also been radically reshaped _ in some ways weakened _ by some of
the same currents that carried him to victory. He is not part of
the one-party apparatus that for 71 years monopolized power in
Mexico but so often failed its people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Fox has made a lot of promises to the people, that he
would move the country forward,'' said Alvaro Gonzalez Arenas, 24.
``We have put our faith in him; faith that we are finally going to
be free of corruption and that we will be able to live with
dignity.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the first step in the development of a democracy _ free
and fair elections _ was accomplished here last Sunday in contests
that displayed an extraordinary level of civility and respect.
</P>
<P>
   But democracy, as shown from Central America to the former
Soviet Union, requires more than fair elections. Those in power
must prove able to work in cooperation with their opponents. In
Fox's case, only then can he take on Mexico's urgent tasks:
creating a credible justice system that protects civilians from
crime and corruption, and anti-poverty programs to lift the poor;
and opening education and employment opportunities to the best and
the brightest, rather than the best and most well-connected. Such
goals are extraordinarily complex, of course, and have been set
before.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have felt so betrayed by promises from candidates that
were never intended to be fulfilled and they not only stopped
believing in the government, but they stopped believing in
themselves,'' said Julio Faesler, a congressman and member of Fox's
National Action Party. ``It took a great leap of faith, and a lot
of internal courage for people to trust in something other than the
PRI. And living up to that confidence will not be easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Showing that he plans to work hard to fulfill his campaign
promises, Fox has barely taken a moment to rest since his victory.
But when he assumes power on Dec. 1, some analysts say he will be
in a weaker position than his PRI predecessors. He will not have
the support of the vast PRI machinery _ its political bosses, its
labor union and farmers' cooperative leaders and the directors of
the wealthiest social welfare programs. These were an important
part of the muscle that could support, and often impose, the will
of a PRI president.

 &UR; BC-MEXICO-DEMOCRACY-REVIEW-2NDTAKE-NYT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; MEXICO CITY: PRI president. &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And, unlike all PRI presidents until the midterm elections in
1997, Fox will not be able to count on enough votes in Congress to
override his opposition. He will have to reach for support across
party lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has to be a statesman and a mobilizer and an organizer of
the Mexican people,'' said Roberto Mangabeira Unger, an expert on
Latin American politics and a professor of law at Harvard
University. ``If he fails to do that, he will allow the powerful
organized interests to strike back at him, and to limit the margin
of innovation for his government, and to create the stage on which
a new opposition to his government can arise.''
</P>
<P>
   During his campaign, Fox was brash and prone to hurling insults,
and he paid a price: he could not establish partnerships with
logical allies, particularly the left-wing Democratic Revolutionary
Party.
</P>
<P>
   But Mangabeira said those are mostly ``superficial weaknesses,''
because Fox was elected president by a decisive margin in the midst
of a national feeling of rebirth. The challenge will be whether he
can turn the enthusiasm into bold political practice.
</P>
<P>
   One political analyst, Federico Estevez of the Autonomous
Technological Institute of Mexico, said Fox is uniquely well suited
for the challenges ahead _ primarily because he is much more a
pragmatist than an ideologue. For example, he is a devout Catholic
who has said he personally opposes abortion but has also said he
would consider signing legislation to legalize the procedure if he
thought it reflected the will of most Mexicans.
</P>
<P>
   And even though the president-elect could not win over all of
the Mexican left, he was able to lure several strategists from the
main leftist party to his campaign. In choosing his cabinet, Fox
plans to enlist international headhunting firms, and he has
promised to make his government one that reflects the range of
Mexico's political parties and regions.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Fox, who once managed the sale of Coca-Cola across
Latin America, has used his marketing experience to promote his
image and ideas. ``He is a magnificent salesman,'' Estevez said.
``And on top of that, he knows how to inspire people.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox has already signaled that he may use the first months of his
administration to push for approval of some of his most
controversial proposals. Last week, he announced plans to rebuild
the nation's federal law enforcement system. And he said he would
travel to the United States to press for a less restricted flow of
Mexican workers across the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``He announces his plans ahead of time,'' said Estevez,
``something that shows he's already treating the public to the kind
of transparent agenda they expect of him, and one that they would
have never gotten before under the PRI.''
</P>
<P>
   Even one of Fox's closest campaign advisers worried, though,
about whether public expectations had been set too high. ``Feelings
of optimism are volatile,'' Adolfo Aguilar Zinser wrote in a column
in the newspaper Reforma. ``If they do not turn into concrete
efforts, they turn bitter and dissipate.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us to accomplish our goals,'' he added, ``it will be
necessary to transform our political culture, to respect plurality
and to build, among ourselves, bridges and more bridges.''

THE BEIRUT I KNEW WASN'T SO DIFFERENT

   BEIRUT, Lebanon _ The last time I had set foot in the Beirut
airport, exactly 15 years before, a hijacked Trans World Airlines
jet sat on the runway. A U.S. Navy diver had been murdered and
thrown from the plane, and 39 Americans would be held hostage for
17 days before being freed in Damascus, Syria.
</P>
<P>
   In the filthy shambles of the terminal, pistol-waving hijackers
wearing hoods made from airline pillowcases held a news conference
that turned into a near riot when television cameramen climbed on
the table that the hijackers had carefully laid out with Lebanese
dishes. The windows in the control tower were still shattered from
the time a few years earlier when they were shot out by the man
known as ``Hamzi the Hijacker,'' who was working on his ninth
plane.
</P>
<P>
   The airport was convenient for hijackers in those days. When
they were done, all they had to do was to cross the tarmac to go
home, melting into into the surrounding Shiite Muslim shantytowns.
</P>
<P>
   Now, when I returned in the early summer of 2000, the terminal
was new and clean, partly lined with gleaming tile. An efficient
line processed visas, where once a grimy customs inspector
whispered to me, ``Be careful, my friend, you are in the Orient
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside, instead of the chaos I used to know, was an orderly
taxi line with a no-haggling fixed price. A smooth new highway,
swooping through tunnels and overpasses, had replaced the old
rutted road studded with militia checkpoints.
</P>
<P>
   We drove past gleaming new high-rises and glittery restaurants
to the Phoenecia, a huge and gaudy palace right on the Green Line,
the no-man's land that once divided the city. The hotel district
was one of the first and fiercest battlegrounds of the civil war
that made a Lebanon a synonym for brutal anarchy in the 1970s and
'80s, and next door the battered, shell-holed hulk of the Holiday
Inn still loomed.
</P>
<P>
   Just to travel across the city back then was to risk your life.
Snipers were dug into the broken buildings on each side: as the war
wound on they became skilled, hitting people in the head more
often.
</P>
<P>
   Christian right and Muslim left were the working cliches for the
journalists, but the reality was much more complex. Christians
killed each other to eliminate rivals, and alliances shifted
bloodily on the Muslim side. Even a traffic accident could set off
a gun battle that quickly spread through a wide area and lasted for
hours. All the militias had their own jails. Piles of rotting
garbage, occasionally set afire, lined the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinary Lebanese hunkered down through artillery barrages,
power outages and water shortages, siege and invasion, somehow
maintaining the extravagant style that is their endearing hallmark.
There are no real statistics here, but it is generally estimated
that 150,000 people died and 17,000 are still missing.
</P>
<P>
   The morning after I arrived I walked around the streets I used
to know. There were no gunmen and no garbage. A McDonald's stood at
the corner where the Associated Press correspondent Terry Anderson
was kidnapped in 1985; it had valet parking for the Range Rovers.
It was eerie at first to walk on the streets where 15 years before
you could not go, in the city center that had been the heart of the
Green Line, where I once met a gunmen who been in position so long
he had planted a garden.
</P>
<P>
   The old buildings, Ottoman and French Colonial, have now been
meticulously restored into one of the most gorgeous downtowns
anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   What happened, I wondered. Could these people have all suddenly
come to their senses?
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately not.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you see, it's all a facade, a fake veneer,'' grumbled a
veteran Lebanese journalist, launching into an hourlong tirade
against government corruption and inefficiency, an economic crisis
spinning out of control and Syrian domination _ after, of course,
making sure that his name would not be used.
</P>
<P>
   The new highway and the luxury hotels skirt and conceal the
slums and squatters in much of the city. Even in the flashy stores
on Rue Verdon _ Gucci, Versace, Valentino _ business is down. The
rebuilding was almost entirely the single-minded effort of Rafik
Hariri, prime minister from 1992 to 1998; his enemies are now in
power and cutting off his permits.

 BEIRUT: his permits.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Over and over, old friends and new acquaintances, using phrases
like ``rotten'' and ``crooked,'' told me that, fundamentally,
nothing has changed in Lebanon; that politics and economics remain,
as one put it, ``parasitical, feudal and entirely rapacious.''
</P>
<P>
   But of course some things have changed in the decade since the
war ended. By 1990, the paroxysm of violence that had torn Lebanon
since the mid-1970s had turned on itself, so badly that many
Lebanese were desperate to restore an ordinary sense of business
and life. So they welcomed the calm that Syrian control brought
them.
</P>
<P>
   Today, most visibly, the presence of armed militias in which
gunmen ruled has been ended, and that is no small thing. (They are
officially disarmed, except for Hezbollah in the South, although
much of the weaponry is just hidden away.) The remaining
Palestinians are disenfranchised, confined to their camps. The
ability of the Maronite Catholic elite to either dominate the
country or to establish an autonomous entity has been ended.
Perhaps most important for the future is the rise of the Shiite
Muslim movement Hezbollah, or Party of God, to power and
respectability. Politically, Syria calls all the shots now.
</P>
<P>
   But what has not changed is the strict division along religious
lines that defines _ and essentially undermines _ Lebanon as a
country.
</P>
<P>
   When modern Lebanon was formed in 1943 out of a French mandate
granted after World War I, power was apportioned by religion,
mainly to protect the Maronites; they were to hold the presidency,
with other offices apportioned to Sunni Moslems, Shites, Druse and
13 smaller sects.
</P>
<P>
   And that has always been the paradox of Lebanon: What has
enabled its people to survive and even prosper through unbelievably
difficult times, like the civil war, are the tight bonds of family,
village, clan and religion. But the same narrow loyalties prevent a
national social contract.
</P>
<P>
   The headquarters for the small band of foreign journalists
throughout those war years was the shabby, beloved Commodore Hotel,
presided over by its suave, impeccably-dressed manager, Fouad
Saleh, who could accomplish anything. The parrot at the bar
imitated incoming shellfire, Fat Tommy the cat slept wedged in the
warmth between the Associated Press and Reuters news wires, and the
telexes, magically, always worked. Guests checking in were asked,
``Shelling side or sniper side?''
</P>
<P>
   One night during the Israeli siege of Beirut in 1982, a
desperately needed truckload of bottled water materialized, bribed
through Israeli lines near the airport. ``You see, we are really
all Levantine together,'' smiled the man from the Democratic Front
for the Liberation of Palestine next to me at the bar.
</P>
<P>
   But in the final five years of the war, when erstwhile allies
turned on each other in a frenzy _ Shiites against Palestinians,
Hezbollah against its Shiite rival Amal, Christians against
Christians, the Lebanese army against Christians _ the Commodore
was destroyed in street fighting between the Druze and a Sunni
militia, the Murabitoun. A Druse gunman carried off the parrot to
an unknown fate.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Commodore has been rebuilt as a fancy Meridien, with a
Benihana Japanese steakhouse. Just off the lobby is a place called
the ``News Bar,'' with a carpet embroidered to imitate newspaper
front pages. When I looked in the other day, it was empty.
</P>
<P>
   Fouad Saleh died a few years back, I was told, and, because of
his mixed marriage, neither the Muslim nor the Christian cemetery
would accept his body. Fouad, the ultimate fixer, had been beaten
at last by Lebanon.

STOKING THE CAMPFIRE'S MAGIC AND OTHER TIPS FOR `LUSTY BOYS' 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Week in Review)  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the U.S. Supreme Court decided on June 28 that the Boy
Scouts could bar gay members, it agreed that opposition to
homosexuality was part of the organization's ``expressive
message.'' This message, the argument went, was right there in the
Scout Oath and Law, the guiding principles that generations of boys
have had to know by heart and regularly recite, raising their arms
in that familiar three-fingered salute and promising to be (among
many other things) ``clean'' and ``morally straight.''
</P>
<P>
   The dissenting justices in the 5-4 ruling were perplexed. ``It
is plain as the light of day that neither one of these principles,
`morally straight' and `clean,' says the slightest thing about
homosexuality,'' wrote Justice John Paul Stevens. ``Indeed, neither
term in the Boy Scouts' law and oath expresses any position
whatsoever on sexual matters.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyone looking for an explicit condemnation of homosexuality by
the Boy Scouts has little to go on. The statement posted on the Boy
Scouts' Web site after their court victory was a model of tactful
restraint:
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe an avowed homosexual is not a role model for the
values espoused in the Scout Oath and Law. Boy Scouting makes no
effort to discover the sexual orientation of any person. Scouting's
message is compromised when prospective leaders present themselves
as role models inconsistent with Boy Scouting's understanding of
the Scout Oath and Law. Scouting's record of inclusion is
impressive by any standard. However, we do ask all of our members
to do their best to live the Scout Oath and Law.''
</P>
<P>
   For slightly more stem-winding, plain-spoken views on scouting's
mission and message _ and on moral issues, sexual and otherwise _
the justices might have turned to an earlier source: the first Boy
Scout manual, published in 1910 by Ernest Thompson Seton, a
founding father of the Boy Scouts. Seton, an author and self-styled
naturalist, created the Woodcraft Indians, a precursor of the Boy
Scouts, and became the country's first chief scout.
</P>
<P>
   While ``Boy Scouts of America'' says not a word about
homosexuality, it has plenty of other things to say about primal
urges and manly passions.

   &UR; Degeneracy &LR;  is the word. To combat the system that has turned
such a large proportion of our robust, manly, self-reliant boyhood
into a lot of flat-chested cigarette smokers, with shaky nerves and
doubtful vitality, I began the Woodcraft movement in America.
Without saying as much, it aimed to counteract the evils attendant
on arena baseball, football, and racing, by substituting the
better, cleaner, saner pursuits of Woodcraft and Scouting.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) Getting together with the guys and some
brews and watching the game? Not very manly, in Seton's view. (END

</P>
<P>
   The personal interest in athletics has been largely superseded
by an interest in spectacular games, which, unfortunately, tend to
divide the nation into two groups _ the few overworked champions in
the arena, and the great crowd, content to do nothing but sit on
the benches and look on, while indulging their tastes for tobacco
and alcohol.

   What is a camp without a camp-fire? _ no camp at all, but a
chilly place in a landscape where some people happen to have some
things. ...
</P>
<P>
   Not in the steam radiator can we find the spell; not in the
water coil; not even in the gas-log: they do not reach the heart.
Only the ancient sacred fire of wood has power to touch and thrill
the chords of primitive remembrance.
</P>
<P>
   When men sit together at the campfire, they seem to shed all
modern form and poise, and hark back to the primitive _ to meet as
man and man _ to show the naked soul. Your camp-fire partner wins
your love, or hate, mostly your love; and having camped in peace
together, is a lasting bond of union, however wide your worlds may
be apart.
</P>
<P>
   The campfire, then, is the focal center of all primitive
brotherhood. We shall not fail to use its magic powers.

   The boy from 10 to 15, like the savage, is purely physical in
his ideals. I do not know that I ever met a boy that would not
rather be John L. Sullivan than Darwin or Tolstoy. Therefore, I
accept the fact, and seek to keep in view an ideal that is
physical, but also clean, manly, heroic, already familiar, and
leading with certainty to higher things.

   The clubroom must not be made cosey like a lady's boudoir, as
the boys must be able to romp in it occasionally, or play handball,
or ``Bang the bear,'' etc. So you want furniture that will pack
away into a corner, such as folding wooden chairs, small tables and
a cupboard in which to put away books, games, etc., when the romp
comes on.

</P>
<P>
   In this handbook I have touched upon many important items of a
boy's education, but there is scarcely one more important than that
of continence. The prudish mystery with which we have come to veil
this important question among the youth of both sexes is doing
incalculable harm. The very secrecy with which we withhold all
knowledge from the boy prompts him the more to take his own line
equally secretly, and, therefore, injuriously.
</P>
<P>
   I have never known a boy who was not the better for having the
matter put to him frankly and fully. For an instructor to let his
boys walk on this exceedingly thin ice without giving them a
warning word, owing to some prudish sentimentality, would be little
short of a crime.

<P>
   Everyone should read ``From Youth Into Manhood,'' by Winfield S.
Hall, M.D.; sexual hygiene for young men and older boys.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) Hall's book, which was intended for YMCA
members, grapples much more directly with the issue of sexuality,
though it doesn't even consider homosexuality among the options for
``lusty boys'': (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   The young man who holds before his mental vision an ideal of the
home he hopes to establish _ in which a pure wife reigns as queen,
sovereign of his life, and gently governs her brood of lusty boys
and fair girls _ cannot for a moment consider as a sane solution of
his sexual problem periodic visits to a lewd girl or woman, nor can
he expect to develop his powers physically or intellectually, if he
permits himself to contract that habit (masturbation) which, step
by step, undermines his virility. There is open to the young man
only one of these three alternatives, i.e., ``to lead the continent
life.''
</P>
<P>
   The continent life is a goal which every healthy young man
should strive to reach. ... The compensations of continence are
those that come from the assurance that the young man has of his
virility, of his worthiness to take the hand of a pure wife in
wedlock, and from the consciousness of his ability to establish and
maintain a home, and to protect this home against all dangers.

   When the U.S. Supreme Court decided on June 28 that the Boy
Scouts could bar gay members, it agreed that opposition to
homosexuality was part of the organization's ``expressive
message.'' This message, the argument went, was right there in the
Scout Oath and Law, the guiding principles that generations of boys
have had to know by heart and regularly recite, raising their arms
in that familiar three-fingered salute and promising to be (among
many other things) ``clean'' and ``morally straight.''
</P>
<P>
   The dissenting justices in the 5-4 ruling were perplexed. ``It
is plain as the light of day that neither one of these principles,
`morally straight' and `clean,' says the slightest thing about
homosexuality,'' wrote Justice John Paul Stevens. ``Indeed, neither
term in the Boy Scouts' law and oath expresses any position
whatsoever on sexual matters.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyone looking for an explicit condemnation of homosexuality by
the Boy Scouts has little to go on. The statement posted on the Boy
Scouts' Web site after their court victory was a model of tactful
restraint:
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe an avowed homosexual is not a role model for the
values espoused in the Scout Oath and Law. Boy Scouting makes no
effort to discover the sexual orientation of any person. Scouting's
message is compromised when prospective leaders present themselves
as role models inconsistent with Boy Scouting's understanding of
the Scout Oath and Law. Scouting's record of inclusion is
impressive by any standard. However, we do ask all of our members
to do their best to live the Scout Oath and Law.''
</P>
<P>
   For slightly more stem-winding, plain-spoken views on scouting's
mission and message _ and on moral issues, sexual and otherwise _
the justices might have turned to an earlier source: the first Boy
Scout manual, published in 1910 by Ernest Thompson Seton, a
founding father of the Boy Scouts. Seton, an author and self-styled
naturalist, created the Woodcraft Indians, a precursor of the Boy
Scouts, and became the country's first chief scout.
</P>
<P>
   While ``Boy Scouts of America'' says not a word about
homosexuality, it has plenty of other things to say about primal
urges and manly passions.

   &UR; Degeneracy &LR;  is the word. To combat the system that has turned
such a large proportion of our robust, manly, self-reliant boyhood
into a lot of flat-chested cigarette smokers, with shaky nerves and
doubtful vitality, I began the Woodcraft movement in America.
Without saying as much, it aimed to counteract the evils attendant
on arena baseball, football, and racing, by substituting the
better, cleaner, saner pursuits of Woodcraft and Scouting.

   The personal interest in athletics has been largely superseded
by an interest in spectacular games, which, unfortunately, tend to
divide the nation into two groups _ the few overworked champions in
the arena, and the great crowd, content to do nothing but sit on
the benches and look on, while indulging their tastes for tobacco
and alcohol.

   When men sit together at the campfire, they seem to shed all
modern form and poise, and hark back to the primitive _ to meet as

your love, or hate, mostly your love; and having camped in peace
together, is a lasting bond of union, however wide your worlds may
be apart.

   In this handbook I have touched upon many important items of a
boy's education, but there is scarcely one more important than that
of continence. The prudish mystery with which we have come to veil
this important question among the youth of both sexes is doing
incalculable harm. The very secrecy with which we withhold all
knowledge from the boy prompts him the more to take his own line
equally secretly, and, therefore, injuriously.
</P>
<P>
   I have never known a boy who was not the better for having the
matter put to him frankly and fully. For an instructor to let his
boys walk on this exceedingly thin ice without giving them a
warning word, owing to some prudish sentimentality, would be little
short of a crime.

   The young man who holds before his mental vision an ideal of the
home he hopes to establish _ in which a pure wife reigns as queen,
sovereign of his life, and gently governs her brood of lusty boys
and fair girls _ cannot for a moment consider as a sane solution of
his sexual problem periodic visits to a lewd girl or woman, nor can
he expect to develop his powers physically or intellectually, if he
permits himself to contract that habit (masturbation) which, step
by step, undermines his virility. There is open to the young man
only one of these three alternatives, i.e., ``to lead the continent
life.''
</P>
<P>
   The continent life is a goal which every healthy young man
should strive to reach. ... The compensations of continence are
those that come from the assurance that the young man has of his
virility, of his worthiness to take the hand of a pure wife in
wedlock, and from the consciousness of his ability to establish and
maintain a home, and to protect this home against all dangers.

FIVE YEARS LATER: THE BATTLE OF SREBRENICA IS NOW OVER THE TRUTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Week in Review)  
 By DAVID ROHDE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   For two years, thousands of bodies packed in white plastic bags
have been awaiting burial in central Bosnia, in a limbo that could
stand as a symbol of the uncertain fate of Bosnia itself _ and much
else in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Two thousand of the bags sat for most of those two years in two
tunnels behind the municipal morgue in Tuzla. Rats were allowed to
feast on bodies, according to aid workers.
</P>
<P>
   After a year and a half of planning, the bodies from the tunnels
and other makeshift morgues _ there are 4,700 bags in all that
contain either bodies or body parts _ were finally moved to a newly
built warehouse in April. Now a seven-year, $10 million project is
under way to come up with an exact total of bodies and and identify
the remains, but it needs more money.
</P>
<P>
   The bags contain bodies collected over the last five years from
mass graves and forests around the town of Srebrenica in eastern
Bosnia. That was the site of the worst single atrocity of the
Bosnian war, a series of ambushes and mass executions carried out
by Bosnian Serb soldiers that left 7,000 Bosnian Muslim men
missing.
</P>
<P>
   Finding, unearthing and storing the bodies has proved a tortuous
process that exemplifies the problems that have slowed peace
efforts in Bosnia _ corrupt local officials, a limited
international commitment and internecine political battles. And
where to bury the corpses has now become one more thorny issue for
the international mission in Bosnia to grapple with as it tries to
reconstruct a divided country without fully governing it.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with the bodies is that they are keys to how history
will be told. And all sides in the skirmishes that still haunt the
former Yugoslavia understand how important controlling history is
when it comes to controlling power.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, relatives of the missing have been campaigning
to finally begin building a memorial and interring the bodies in
individual graves in a field in the village of Potocari, near
Srebrenica, on this Tuesday, the fifth anniversary of the killings.
They want local Serbs to have to drive by tombstones every day _
row after row of tombstones. Only then, they say, will Serbs be
forced to reckon with the blood on their soldiers' hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Serbs must accept that this genocide happened,'' said
Hasan Nuhanovic, a survivor whose mother, father and brother are
among the missing. ``This grandiose memorial should be a
reminder,'' he said by telephone. ``If they can't accept that, I
don't see how we can live with them again.''
</P>
<P>
   Local Serb leaders, not surprisingly, have a counter-offer: to
bury the corpses on a hillside farther from view. Serb war veterans
go even farther, flatly denying that any killings took place and
warning of violence at a ceremony Muslim survivors plan to hold on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The unresolved fate of the bodies also points to the conflicted
nature of the Western mission in Bosnia. On one hand, war crimes
investigators try to exhume as many bodies and prosecute as many
war crimes suspects as possible. On the other, Western diplomats
and U.S. military officials try to avoid creating situations that
could prompt violence and American casualties.
</P>
<P>
   In that uncertain atmosphere, the bodies have become part of a
broader propaganda battle, being waged across the former
Yugoslavia, Europe and the United States. Aided by the Internet, a
revisionist interpretation of the war has begun to radiate out from
Belgrade, Yugoslavia; some American and European leftists, who a
year ago took exception to NATO's bombing of Kosovo, are now
backing Serb nationalist claims that Western governments and
journalists exaggerated Serb war crimes not only in Kosovo but in
Bosnia as well.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Srebrenica, the slow pace of efforts to recover
and count bodies has created an opening for denials of what
occurred five years ago. After Bosnian Muslims turned their heavy
weapons over to U.N. peacekeepers in exchange for having Srebrenica
declared a protected ``safe area'' in 1993, Dutch peacekeepers and
U.N. commanders did little to protect the town when Bosnian Serb
forces attacked in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   More than 7,000 men were reported missing to the International
Red Cross after the fall of the town. But because of a lack of
money, bureaucratic delays and a huge Serb effort to hide bodies by
moving and reburying them, only half of the known graves around the
town have yet been exhumed. To date, 1,866 bodies have been
recovered from mass graves, according to tribunal investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty remaining mass graves, believed to hold as many as 2,000
bodies, are to be exhumed by the end of 2001. But tribunal
investigators fear that intermittent funding could dry up again and
that a historic opportunity will be lost.
</P>
<P>
   Western diplomats agree that long-term reconciliation in Bosnia
hinges on an acceptance by average people that nationalists
committed crimes in their name, followed by a rejection of the
nationalists. They point to elections last spring that showed small
gains by moderates as a sign of progress. But they warn that
forcing Serbs to accept memorials now will not work, and could
increase support for nationalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to keep the issue alive but not expect that people
will admit to it immediately,'' said Alexandra Stiglmeyer,
spokesman for the international mission in Bosnia. ``Germans were
ready to admit to the crimes only when the Eichman trial began in
the sixties. In the fifties, people were denying it.''
</P>
<P>
   Stiglmeyer said the international community was committed to
building a memorial in Srebrenica, but the fifth anniversary was
not the time. Emotions are running high, she said, and nationalists
on both sides may look to provoke violence that could aid them in
national elections in November.
</P>
<P>
   Nuhanovic scoffed at that explanation and said immediately
building a memorial with ``thousands of graves shining in the sun''
is the only way to ensure that Serbs, the world and future
generations face what happened in Srebrenica.
</P>
<P>
   He said the latest promises from international officials echo
past assurances _ promises that led to 7,000 people going missing,
Serb nationalists flatly denying the killings, and rats being
allowed to gnaw on the corpses of men the world had vowed to
protect.

MOVIE HYPE: BE AFRAID, BE VERY AFRAID 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Week in Review)  
 By ELVIS MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Though ``The Perfect Storm'' is just now swamping theaters near
you, a still more awesome, irresistible, force of nature threatens
movie audiences not just this summer, but every summer. With
monsoon-like predictability, the fierce winds, towering waves and
torrential rains of movie hype roll in from California every year
at about this time.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since those legendary days, a long, long time ago in a
galaxy far, far away, when ``Jaws'' and ``Star Wars'' showed the
film industry a bold, new way to persuade kids to see films over
and over again during the summer, hype has become its own industry.
Those colossal promotional campaigns that studios create to sell
their films include the repetitive cover stories in glossy
magazines, newspaper and television coverage (including the E!
cable channel, the last letter in hype) and blanket advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Studios usually spend one and a half times the production budget
of a movie on publicity, and with the average summer picture
costing close $70,000,000, that's real money.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1975, the year in which ``Jaws'' ate the box office, the
number of summer releases has grown enormously, and the studios
have had to become more savvy about luring moviegoers into the
theaters. Today, hype can even be subtle, for hype. This usually
occurs toward the end of the summer, as it did with last year's
``The Sixth Sense.'' The trailers for that spare tale didn't give
away the surprise ending, and ``I see dead people'' became part of
the cultural landscape.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Blair Witch Project,'' which cost under $50,000 to make,
was hustled via a constantly evolving Internet campaign. Artisan,
the releasing studio, ingeniously saw that the Web could be used to
speak directly to an audience that is resistant to standard forms
of hype. Instead, they employed what could only be called e-hype,
and spent a ton doing so.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, however, subtlety is something summer moviegoers have to
do without. Relief, such as it is, generally comes from the
opposite direction, when a movie reaches such a peak of awfulness
as to become the Bummer of the Summer. It's the picture for which
the hype is so incessant that you feel beaten into attending. These
are the films that almost everybody goes to and no one seems to
like. The stench of stale air conditioning lends itself to the
depression that settles in as the picture starts. Play some of
these titles over in your mind as a kind of refresher course:
``Star Wars Episode One: The Phantom Menace''; ``Batman'';
``Armageddon''; ``Batman Forever''; ``Mission Impossible'';
``Lethal Weapons 2-4''; ``Batman and Robin''; ``Con Air''; ``The
Wild, Wild West.'' Perhaps that dull ache at the temples you felt
sitting through these films is now returning _ a final gift from
``Twister.''
</P>
<P>
   The observant can spot the telltale signs, the subtle warnings
of a high level of movie awfulness: constant, incomprehensible
action in the trailers; actors in independent films appearing in
movies whose latte budgets probably exceed the entire budget of,
say, ``Rushmore''; anything ``based upon'' a comic book character;
magazine articles entirely about a movie's ``dazzling'' special
effects.
</P>
<P>
   On occasion, something special comes along, something like
``Battlefield Earth,'' a picture that extends the boundaries of the
horrible in such significant fashion that the title should be added
to the synonyms for bad in the Oxford English Dictionary. Such
cathartic experiences, movies that bring the few members of the
audiences together, are, however, few and far between.
</P>
<P>
   The other contender for the Bummer title this summer, though
admittedly coming in a poor second to ``Battlefield Earth,'' is
``Mission: Impossible 2,'' which continues the tradition
established by the first one, a movie that still has people
scratching their heads in puzzlement. ``Gone in 60 Seconds'' is
vying for the title, too, and there are those who may even place
``Perfect Storm,'' with its emphasis on the world's deadliest water
park special effects in lieu of characterization, in this category.
</P>
<P>
   This summer may be the first in three years in which attendance
and box office figures started out a little down from the previous
year. Then the five-day Fourth of July weekend came along with a
slate of movies including ``Perfect Storm'' and ``Patriot,'' which
made the summer of 2000 competitive with previous years.
</P>
<P>
   So the hype is with us and working its magic, and the nation is
where it should be, in its seats, feet sticking to soda spilled on
the floor, looking up at Hollywood's big, bright vision of the
world. There is something reassuring about it all _ finding cool
refuge in the dog days, watching the bad movies the hucksters have
been ballyhooing for months.

and over again during the summer, hype has become its own industry.
Those colossal promotional campaigns that studios create to sell
their films include the repetitive cover stories in glossy
magazines, newspaper and television coverage (including the E!
cable channel, the last letter in hype) and blanket advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Studios usually spend one and a half times the production budget
of a movie on publicity, and with the average summer picture
costing close $70,000,000, that's real money.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1975, the year in which ``Jaws'' ate the box office, the
number of summer releases has grown enormously, and the studios
have had to become more savvy about luring moviegoers into the
theaters. Today, hype can even be subtle, for hype. This usually
occurs toward the end of the summer, as it did with last year's
``The Sixth Sense.'' The trailers for that spare tale didn't give
away the surprise ending, and ``I see dead people'' became part of
the cultural landscape.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Blair Witch Project,'' which cost under $50,000 to make,
was hustled via a constantly evolving Internet campaign. Artisan,
the releasing studio, ingeniously saw that the Web could be used to
speak directly to an audience that is resistant to standard forms
of hype. Instead, they employed what could only be called e-hype,
and spent a ton doing so.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, however, subtlety is something summer moviegoers have to
do without. Relief, such as it is, generally comes from the
opposite direction, when a movie reaches such a peak of awfulness
as to become the Bummer of the Summer. It's the picture for which
the hype is so incessant that you feel beaten into attending. These
are the films that almost everybody goes to and no one seems to
like. The stench of stale air conditioning lends itself to the
depression that settles in as the picture starts. Play some of
these titles over in your mind as a kind of refresher course:
``Star Wars Episode One: The Phantom Menace''; ``Batman'';
``Armageddon''; ``Batman Forever''; ``Mission Impossible'';
``Lethal Weapons 2-4''; ``Batman and Robin''; ``Con Air''; ``The
Wild, Wild West.'' Perhaps that dull ache at the temples you felt
sitting through these films is now returning _ a final gift from
``Twister.''
</P>
<P>
   The observant can spot the telltale signs, the subtle warnings
of a high level of movie awfulness: constant, incomprehensible
action in the trailers; actors in independent films appearing in
movies whose latte budgets probably exceed the entire budget of,
say, ``Rushmore''; anything ``based upon'' a comic book character;
magazine articles entirely about a movie's ``dazzling'' special
effects.
</P>
<P>
   On occasion, something special comes along, something like
``Battlefield Earth,'' a picture that extends the boundaries of the
horrible in such significant fashion that the title should be added
to the synonyms for bad in the Oxford English Dictionary. Such
cathartic experiences, movies that bring the few members of the
audiences together, are, however, few and far between.
</P>
<P>
   The other contender for the Bummer title this summer, though
admittedly coming in a poor second to ``Battlefield Earth,'' is
``Mission: Impossible 2,'' which continues the tradition
established by the first one, a movie that still has people
scratching their heads in puzzlement. ``Gone in 60 Seconds'' is
vying for the title, too, and there are those who may even place
``Perfect Storm,'' with its emphasis on the world's deadliest water
park special effects in lieu of characterization, in this category.
</P>
<P>
   This summer may be the first in three years in which attendance
and box office figures started out a little down from the previous
year. Then the five-day Fourth of July weekend came along with a
slate of movies including ``Perfect Storm'' and ``Patriot,'' which
made the summer of 2000 competitive with previous years.
</P>
<P>
   So the hype is with us and working its magic, and the nation is
where it should be, in its seats, feet sticking to soda spilled on
the floor, looking up at Hollywood's big, bright vision of the
world. There is something reassuring about it all _ finding cool
refuge in the dog days, watching the bad movies the hucksters have
been ballyhooing for months.

BANISHING THE DICKENSIAN FACTOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Week in Review)  
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In this era when the consumer is king, many Americans are
displaying noblesse oblige toward the millions of foreign workers
who make the goods that flood store shelves. High school students
have demonstrated at Disney's Mickey-filled emporiums over the
company's use of low-wage factories in China and Haiti. Nuns
concerned about child labor have distributed leaflets outside Gap
stores. At Duke and Georgetown, students have staged sit-ins to
protest conditions at factories producing apparel carrying their
college logos. And everyone seems to beat up on Nike.
</P>
<P>
   For years, these anti-sweatshop protests accomplished next to
nothing. Many manufacturers responded by simply saying they did not
control the overseas factories that they contracted with. Some
embarrassed designers adopted codes of conduct, which were often
ignored abroad. Before monitors visited, factory owners hid their
under-aged workers and ordered employees to say they worked 40-hour
weeks, not the more typical 75 hours.
</P>
<P>
   But as the anti-sweatshop movement continues to grow _ and grow
louder _ manufacturers have recently taken steps that just might
improve working conditions around the world. Companies see that
many consumers want to know that their clothing was not made under
Dickensian conditions. So for the first time, industry giants have
joined an ambitious effort, the Fair Labor Association, that has
adopted a code and called for large-scale overseas monitoring that
begins this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Nike, Reebok, Liz Claiborne, Philips Van Heusen and other
manufacturers have joined the association, a White House-backed
program that promises to inspect hundreds of factories yearly.
Currently only a factory or two is monitored each month. The
association's leaders say this latest effort, well financed and
international, should make a difference. Monitors, ranging from
accounting firms to union-friendly Jesuit advocates, will visit
factories to check that there is no child labor, that managers do
not sexually harass workers and that no one works more than 60
hours a week.
</P>
<P>
   The days of companies adopting a see-no-evil stance are over,
said Sam Brown, executive director of the association, which
includes several consumer and human rights groups. ``This effort
says for the first time, `You must know, you have to know about
conditions in every single factory, and you have to bear
responsibility,''' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   The association's plans call for monitoring 30 percent of its
members' 4,000 factories over the next three years, with 5 to 10
percent of each company's factories being monitored each subsequent
year. Some critics say the percentage is too small to uncover every
problem, but association members say monitoring, and requiring that
complaints about conditions be investigated, will greatly help.
</P>
<P>
   Many critics say the association and other monitoring efforts
will do little to improve the lives of Third World workers. They
fear that corporations may hide the monitors' findings from the
public, and that the accounting firms doing the monitoring will not
dig hard enough to find problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Fair Labor Association is just window-dressing,''
said Charles Kernaghan, director of the National Labor Committee, a
labor rights group. ``You don't have full disclosure of what's
found, and it doesn't require that factories pay a living wage. And
it allows companies to produce in China, a country that prohibits
independent trade unions.''
</P>
<P>
   Other monitoring efforts have sprouted because some groups think
the association is too lenient toward manufacturers while others
believe it is too harsh. Social Accountability International, an
offshoot of the nonprofit Council on Economic Priorities, has
persuaded Toys ``R'' Us, Avon Products and Eddie Bauer to push
their manufacturers to comply with minimum labor standards
developed by a group of companies, unions and nongovernment
organizations. Students from 56 universities including Brown and
Cornell recently formed the Workers Rights Consortium to work with
nongovernment organizations overseas to review conditions at
factories making T-shirts and other apparel carrying college logos.
</P>
<P>
   And the industry's main trade group, the American Apparel
Manufacturers Association, has also adopted a code of conduct.
Stung by criticisms, Nike, the Gap and others have hired their own
monitors, and many critics say these companies have improved labor
practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of the programs have achieved critical mass yet,'' said
Elliot Schrage, a Columbia University Business School professor who
advises companies on how to improve factory conditions, ``but the
principle that the conditions under which products are made is a
legitimate concern for consumers is now well established.''
</P>
<P>
   The word sweatshop has long been used to describe factories with
low wages and deplorable conditions, but whether a particular
factory is a sweatshop is often in the eye of the beholder. An
American or European may quickly conclude that a Chinese or
Vietnamese factory paying workers $2 a day is a sweatshop. But the
young women working there often say they earn far more than at
other local factories or in the farm villages they left behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is to make sure these young people, mostly women
a long way from home, are not abused,'' Brown said. ``Even if the
situation is better than where they were, that doesn't mean there
shouldn't be minimal standards of decency on how you treat
people.''
</P>
<P>
   The nation's largest apparel union, the Union of Needletrades,
Industrial and Textile Employees, argues that free trade has
encouraged American companies to move factories to countries with
the lowest wages and worst conditions. Hoping to slow this exodus
and help foreign workers, the union wants the World Trade
Organization to allow trade sanctions against countries that
perpetuate sweatshops by not enforcing their laws on minimum wage
and overtime. But the WTO has rejected such proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Monitoring, Brown said, is the best alternative for improving
factory conditions. ``It is the way to think about how you make
free trade into fair trade,'' he said. ``It's a way to ensure that
the goods are produced under conditions that don't shock the
conscience.''

OUT SPOTS, CATS AND BAD LINES 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Week in Review)  
 By JESSE McKINLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Short of dinner theater or being cast in a musical about tooth
decay, there are few terrors that hold more sway over theater folk
than the curse of ``Macbeth.'' Legend has it that the hex dates
from the first production in 1606, when the actor playing Lady
Macbeth died backstage, cursing the play.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, various productions of ``Macbeth'' have been waylaid
by death and disaster. Over the years, the myth has gained such
authority that many actors are loath to utter even the name of the
play, preferring instead to call it ``the Scottish play,'' or
occasionally ``the Scottish play about the guy who wants to be king
so bad he knocks off some other dudes and then watches his wife go
totally bonkers.'' Others refer to it merely as ``the Scottish play
I've never read.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently, the hex claimed yet another victim when the Broadway
production of ``Macbeth'' starring Kelsey Grammer of the hit
television series ``Frasier'' folded after only 13 performances.
That gave it the shortest run since the 1998 comedy ``More to
Love,'' a four-performance wonder that featured an actress in the
role of an electrical fuse. Just a day after Grammer's reviews came
out, the jinx struck the British actor Antony Sher, who was
starring in a production of the play in New Haven, Conn. He walked
offstage at the end of Act I but did not return. A throat infection
kept him out for several days.
</P>
<P>
   Of course the ``Macbeth'' curse is hardly the only superstition
hanging over the black-magic-laden world of the theater, a
profession in which open incantations of blood lust (``Break a
leg!'') are routine.
</P>
<P>
   The list of taboos is long: never whistle in the dressing room,
never open an umbrella onstage and never, never be cast as an
electrical fuse. So treacherous are these potential psychic land
mines that, in the name of public service, the following is a brief
rundown of some current and ancient omens plaguing the stage:
</P>
<P>
   Cats: According to ``A Brief Dictionary of American
Superstitions,'' by Vergilius Ferm (Philosophical Library, 1959),
it bodes ill if a cat walks across a stage during rehearsal. The
exception, of course, is if you invested in the musical ``Cats,''
Broadway's longest-running musical. In which case, bring on the
kitties.
</P>
<P>
   Chorus girls: If a chorus girl dances on spilled powder before a
performance, it can inspire good fortune. Or a bout of wheezing.
</P>
<P>
   Costumes: It is considered very bad luck to change costumes if
your first performance was a success. It is considered very bad
taste to never change it.
</P>
<P>
   Curtains: According to Ferm, yellow curtains are said to bring
bad luck to a new play. No reason is given, except for the obvious
garishness, of course.
</P>
<P>
   Death: A death in the audience is considered bad luck for the
production. It's particularly unfortunate for the poor theatergoer.
</P>
<P>
   Disney: Considered very good luck for investors; produced ``The
Lion King,'' a sellout for nearly three years; ``Aida,'' Broadway's
second-highest-grossing musical; and ``Beauty and the Beast,''
which is in its seventh year on Broadway. You do the math.
</P>
<P>
   Flowers: Artificial flowers are preferred over the real thing in
the theater, except by actresses, who have divorced men for less.
</P>
<P>
   The Gypsy Robe: One of Broadway's oldest traditions: a chorus
member from the last musical to open passes along a robe to the
most recently opened musical. Each cast embroiders a memento on it
before the robe goes to the next production. When all the space is
used up, a new one is begun and the old robe is retired to the
Museum of the City of New York; the chorus members, meanwhile,
retire to Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Horror Movies: ``Carrie: The Musical'' (1988) is widely
considered one of the greatest flops in Broadway history. The play
was a stunning display of both bad taste _ a big dance number
centered around a pig slaughter _ and money ($7 million, all lost).
Its director was Terry Hands, whose most recent credit was
``Macbeth,'' with Grammer.
</P>
<P>
   Knitting: Engaging in this handicraft onstage is taboo,
especially during any big dance scene.
</P>
<P>
   Peepholes: Once considered acceptable on Broadway, where actors
could sneak peeks at the audience. Accidentally banned in 1998 as
part of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's anti-sex campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Sales: According to the superstitions of theater managers, if
the first purchaser of tickets is young, the run will be short. If
the buyer is elderly, it means a long run. By this logic, and the
demographics of Broadway today, every show on Broadway would be a
hit.
</P>
<P>
   Talent Agents Having an agent is considered good luck. Not
having one is considered bad luck. Lately, being Grammer's agent is
considered particularly bad luck.

   WASHINGTON _ In this election season, helping the elderly pay
for their pills is a political no-brainer: Everybody's for it. The
fight is over how to do it. Republicans, not surprisingly, want
private insurers to run any prescription drug benefits plan.
Democrats, not surprisingly, want the government in control.
</P>
<P>
   But that classic liberal-conservative clash masks the real
issue: how much drugs will cost, and who will set their prices.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps no issue touches as many lives as the cost of
medication, which is why it is consuming the political landscape
this year. Last week, Vice President Al Gore attacked drug
manufacturers, accusing them of price gouging. The week before, the
House of Representatives approved a Republican-backed plan to give
subsidies to insurance companies that offer prescription coverage,
a concept favored by the drug makers.
</P>
<P>
   The furor is justified, economists and policy-makers say. ``It's
the part of the budget that is breaking the bank,'' said Dr. David
A. Kessler, who headed the Food and Drug Administration before
becoming dean of the Yale University School of Medicine. ``Ask any
hospital administrator, ask any HMO. Prescription drug prices is
the one sector that is out of control.''
</P>
<P>
   Prescription drugs are now the fastest-growing part of the
nation's health care bill. That is not so much because
manufacturers are raising prices for existing drugs, but because
patients are switching to newly approved medicines that cost more,
and more prescriptions are being written than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, Americans
spent $91 billion on prescription drugs; the total is expected to
reach $243 billion in 2008. The elderly bear a disproportionate
burden: They account for 13 percent of the population but more than
a third of drug expenditures.
</P>
<P>
   Yet any effort to bring down costs is fraught with unanswered
questions. To begin with, drug makers dance around the question of
how they set prices. The official explanation is that the cost of
medicine is justified by the high cost of research and development,
which the industry puts at $500 million per drug, a figure some say
is inflated.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, there is no one set price for drugs. Consumer
advocates often complain that Americans pay higher prices for their
prescriptions than patients anywhere else in the world. And that is
true _ if the patient pays the retail price, out of pocket. (That
is the case for nearly one-third of the elderly, who have health
insurance through Medicare but lack drug coverage.)
</P>
<P>
   But the truth is, few people buy retail in this business. Most
have insurance, and their health care providers typically negotiate
discounts with the drug manufacturers. The size of these discounts,
however, is a well-kept secret. The drug makers would like to keep
it that way, which is one reason they are working hard to defeat
any legislation that would put Medicare in charge of running a
benefits plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are totally paranoid about price controls, but I think
the thing that scares them more than anything is public disclosure
of what people actually pay for prescriptions,'' said Dr. Bruce C.
Vladeck, a former administrator of the Health Care Financing
Administration, which runs Medicare. ``They go to enormous lengths
not just to keep that information confidential, but to actually
obscure it.''
</P>
<P>
   A government-run drug benefit plan would change that. If private
insurers offered drug benefits, the pharmaceutical industry could
continue to negotiate behind closed doors. But Medicare would
publish what it pays for drugs, and the private sector would
undoubtedly demand similar discounts. And with every senior citizen
in the nation enrolled in the same Medicare drug plan, the
government's bargaining clout would increase exponentially.
</P>
<P>
   ``Medicare is the big gorilla,'' said Dr. Uwe Reinhardt, a
health care economist at Princeton University. ``But there is
another fear: If you go to bed with a gorilla, and the gorilla
shifts, you get squashed.''
</P>
<P>
   The shifting gorilla, of course, is Congress; the drug industry
fears lawmakers will agree to pay for a Medicare prescription drugs
benefit now, in times of surplus, and then cut back on
reimbursements when money grows scarce.
</P>
<P>
   That is precisely what has happened with the 35-year-old
Medicare program itself. In its early years, said Dr. Drew Altman,
president of the Kaiser Family Foundation, Medicare became ``the
largest single cash cow for doctors and hospitals around the
country.'' But amid concerns over rising health care costs in the
1990s, Medicare lowered reimbursements, and now health providers
are struggling.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts, including Altman, argue that even with the
cutbacks, doctors are better off with Medicare than without it.
Reinhardt calculates the same would be true of the drug makers: A
Medicare benefits plan might bring lower prices, he says, but the
industry would make up the difference in volume.
</P>
<P>
   But Alan F. Holmer, president of the Pharmaceutical Research and
Manufacturers of America, disagrees. The drug industry consistently
ranks as the most profitable on the list of Fortune 500 companies.
Yet Holmer warns that lower prices would ``put biomedical
innovation at risk'' by cutting into profits that the drug makers
need to plow back into research.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry could be profoundly different,'' said Holmer,
whose two children have cystic fibrosis and have benefited from new
treatments for that disease, he said. ``One of the most frightening
things is that if we were to proceed down that path, we would never
really know which cure we were denied.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; BC-PRESCRIPTION-DRUGS-ART-REVIEW-2NDTAKE-NYT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: were denied.'' &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In one sense, Holmer's industry is a victim of its own success.
``We have the best medical armamentarium in the world,'' said
Kessler. ``But what good is it if people can't afford it?''
</P>
<P>
   Because other countries have drug price controls, the
pharmaceutical industry earns most of its profits, and conducts
most of its basic research, in the United States. ``We Americans
fund the bulk of the research for the rest of the world,''
Reinhardt said, ``so everyone else can mooch.''
</P>
<P>
   And because prices are higher here, Americans use their
prescription drugs sparingly.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, drugs have become an essential part of American medical
care. ``I have some patients that are choosing between food and
travel to see their children or grandchildren'' or taking pills,
said Dr. Diane E. Meier, a geriatrician at Mount Sinai Medical
Center in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Many experts are doubtful that Congress will move on drug prices
this year. While the House Republican bill calls for private
insurers to offer drug benefits, the insurers themselves are
against it; they say that even with government subsidies, the plans
would be too costly to offer. At the same time, Republicans and
Democrats may not be able to bridge their ideological gap. In the
meantime, says Vladeck, the industry will continue to draw its line
in the sand. ``The United States is their safety valve in terms of
profits,'' he said. ``I think that adds intensity to their feelings
about this. They are running out of places where they can charge
whatever they want.''

AMERICA AND THE PARADOXES OF POWER 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Week in Review)  
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Ever since Israel and Egypt struck their peace deal
22 years ago, Camp David has symbolized U.S. influence: A
superpower brought a divided corner of the world to its own
mountaintop and reshaped it.
</P>
<P>
   It's no wonder that President Clinton chose to use the seclusion
of the Catoctin Mountains again, camping out last week with the
Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, and the Israeli prime minister,
Ehud Barak, in a grand experiment to determine if lightning can
strike twice in the same place.
</P>
<P>
   It may work, it may fizzle. But whatever the outcome, this
summit raises anew the overarching question dogging Bill Clinton,
his would-be successors and the Congress. Toward what ends should
America harness _ not for a few days in July, but day in and day
out _ the astounding economic, military, political and cultural
power it has accrued?
</P>
<P>
   Put another way, why is the country having so much trouble
establishing its international priorities? The truth is, hegemony's
not all it's cracked up to be. It seemed easier in the early 1990s,
after the Cold War had been won, but before the American economy
had begun its flight into the stratosphere. Twenty million new jobs
ago, making the world safe for U.S. exports, for freer and fairer
trade, was a rallying call that resounded far beyond the Chamber of
Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, as U.S. economic might has soared the confusion
about how to wield it has deepened. One day American power is about
expanding democracy, the next it is about a (short-lived) ``Clinton
Doctrine'' of humanitarian intervention, even in places where
America's national interests are remote. In the last two years the
emphasis has turned to new initiatives to combat old threats, from
nuclear proliferation to narco-terrorism, and to bestowing national
security threat status on new issues, such as cyber-crime, global
economic meltdown and AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   What unites this laundry list is that none of the items on it
will ever achieve the bumper-sticker simplicity of fighting
communism, the great national purpose for nearly half a century
after World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the nostalgia is for a single word that is decisive in
every issue that you face, like `containment' was, well that world
is gone,'' said Sandy Berger, the president's national security
adviser. ``Nobody said it would be easy to construct a foreign
policy for a global era.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus far the two leading presidential candidates, while eagerly
asserting their intention to make America's international agenda
more cohesive and effective, have shown little inclination to offer
bold answers to the basic question of what American power should be
for.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, both men have calculated, probably correctly, that
there is little political advantage to announcing grand new
architectures for foreign policy. Such pronouncements invite only
mockery now, and trouble later, when the trade-offs of
policy-making collide with the neat slogans of campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   But if the candidates want to sidestep the issue, history
suggests this may not be possible. As the Romans discovered long
ago, and the British not so long ago, the concentration of power in
a single nation invariably creates a balance-of-power reaction.
``It's a law of political physics,'' says Michael Beschloss, the
presidential historian, noting the ``intense American reaction
against British economic and military power,'' which lasted from
the Revolutionary War until World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Americans, however, tend not to be equally mindful of how their
own power is viewed around the world today. It is resented. So much
so, says Beschloss, that ``one of the most important questions
Americans should be asking the presidential candidates is, `How do
you plan to respond if Russia and Japan and China and Europe find
ways to frustrate American power?'''
</P>
<P>
   What sort of foreign policy agenda makes sense at this moment,
when U.S. power is unquestioned, but its authority is anything but?
The first step may be to recognize that the very fact of that power
can make it more, not less, difficult for the nation to act
unilaterally.
</P>
<P>
   It's also true that, while resistance to America's power is
growing, it is also inconsistent. Chinese students celebrate
Michael Jordan as they denounce U.S. imperialism; Europeans are not
about to give up Microsoft Windows (or McDonald's), despite their
recent obsession with U.S. electronic surveillance systems; and
Russian leaders happily take U.S.-backed aid even as they rail that
the International Monetary Fund is stuffing American-style
capitalism down their throats.
</P>
<P>
   Still, how they react is their business. As Richard N. Haass, a
Brookings Institution scholar and former official in the Bush
administration, noted recently, any ``effort to assert or expand
U.S. hegemony will fail. Such an action would lack domestic support
and stimulate international resistance, which in turn would make
the costs of hegemony all the greater and its benefits all the
smaller.''
</P>
<P>
   A second step is to recognize that even a superpower must focus
its resources. If AIDS and global warming, say, are regarded as
equivalent national security crises to reducing nuclear arms or
stabilizing Russia, then U.S. diplomacy will find its energies and
its influence dissipated.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; BC-U.S.-WORLD-POWER-REVIEW-2NDTAKE-NYT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; WASHINGTON: influence dissipated. &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The third step lies in recognizing that the inseparability of
economic and foreign policy is here to stay _ even if State
Department traditionalists and CIA covert operations types continue
to look at trade and globalization as ``low diplomacy'' compared
with the life-and-death struggles of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Clinton's lasting imprint on U.S. diplomacy may well be
his recognition that preserving the peace and creating a stable
global economic system are two sides of the same coin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had we not bailed out Mexico in 1995, I'm not sure we would
have been celebrating the emergence of democracy there last week,''
Berger argues. He may be overstating the case, but even Clinton's
harshest critics say that NAFTA, the administration's first major
international initiative, was primarily about assembling a
political alliance under the guise of a trade accord.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the battle over trade within the Democratic
party got so intense that the White House dropped its drive to
expand NAFTA to much of the rest of Latin America. The
administration allowed the need to placate labor unions to hinder
the United States from exercising its influence.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the U.S. is going to use its power over time it's got to be
committed and consistent,'' said Robert Zoellick, a former top
official under President Bush and now a top adviser to his son.
``The strategy the U.S. applied to Mexico needs to be expanded to
the Western Hemisphere at large.''
</P>
<P>
   Commitment also means following through on the boring stuff even
after it has fallen far off the front page. Clinton couldn't stop
talking about the need for a ``new economic architecture'' during
the Asian crisis. But as the worst effects faded, so did the talk
of lasting solutions.
</P>
<P>
   It was reminiscent of how Clinton focused like a laser on
opening Japan's markets in his first term, threatening sanctions if
American carmakers were not given access. Once the U.S. economy
took off, Clinton barely mentioned market opening. Yet American
cars are not exactly tying up traffic in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   A final requirement for a workable new approach to foreign
policy is that it factor in the erosion of national sovereignty _
America's and everybody else's.
</P>
<P>
   When the World Trade Organization rules that the United States
cannot subsidize exporters, or block fish from countries that fail
to protect sea turtles, someone screams, ``Who elected these
guys?'' The answer is that the United States did, when it pressed
harder than any nation to set global rules of behavior, in
everything from trade to war crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, as Washington chafes whenever it loses an
international dispute, the rest of the world believes the system is
rigged entirely to America's advantage.
</P>
<P>
   If for that reason only, to maintain its influence, America must
be seen to be sharing power, not hoarding it. And that will require
Washington to work in a more subtle and circumspect manner than
either Democrats or Republicans are going to like.

communism, the great national purpose for nearly half a century
after World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the nostalgia is for a single word that is decisive in
every issue that you face, like `containment' was, well that world
is gone,'' said Sandy Berger, the president's national security
adviser. ``Nobody said it would be easy to construct a foreign
policy for a global era.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus far the two leading presidential candidates, while eagerly
asserting their intention to make America's international agenda
more cohesive and effective, have shown little inclination to offer
bold answers to the basic question of what American power should be
for.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, both men have calculated, probably correctly, that
there is little political advantage to announcing grand new
architectures for foreign policy. Such pronouncements invite only
mockery now, and trouble later, when the trade-offs of
policy-making collide with the neat slogans of campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   But if the candidates want to sidestep the issue, history
suggests this may not be possible. As the Romans discovered long
ago, and the British not so long ago, the concentration of power in
a single nation invariably creates a balance-of-power reaction.
``It's a law of political physics,'' says Michael Beschloss, the
presidential historian, noting the ``intense American reaction
against British economic and military power,'' which lasted from
the Revolutionary War until World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Americans, however, tend not to be equally mindful of how their
own power is viewed around the world today. It is resented. So much
so, says Beschloss, that ``one of the most important questions
Americans should be asking the presidential candidates is, `How do
you plan to respond if Russia and Japan and China and Europe find
ways to frustrate American power?'''
</P>
<P>
   What sort of foreign policy agenda makes sense at this moment,
when U.S. power is unquestioned, but its authority is anything but?
The first step may be to recognize that the very fact of that power
can make it more, not less, difficult for the nation to act
unilaterally.
</P>
<P>
   It's also true that, while resistance to America's power is
growing, it is also inconsistent. Chinese students celebrate
Michael Jordan as they denounce U.S. imperialism; Europeans are not
about to give up Microsoft Windows (or McDonald's), despite their
recent obsession with U.S. electronic surveillance systems; and
Russian leaders happily take U.S.-backed aid even as they rail that
the International Monetary Fund is stuffing American-style
capitalism down their throats.
</P>
<P>
   Still, how they react is their business. As Richard N. Haass, a
Brookings Institution scholar and former official in the Bush
administration, noted recently, any ``effort to assert or expand
U.S. hegemony will fail. Such an action would lack domestic support
and stimulate international resistance, which in turn would make
the costs of hegemony all the greater and its benefits all the
smaller.''
</P>
<P>
   A second step is to recognize that even a superpower must focus
its resources. If AIDS and global warming, say, are regarded as
equivalent national security crises to reducing nuclear arms or
stabilizing Russia, then U.S. diplomacy will find its energies and
its influence dissipated.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; BC-U.S.-WORLD-POWER-REVIEW-2NDTAKE-NYT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; WASHINGTON: influence dissipated. &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The third step lies in recognizing that the inseparability of
economic and foreign policy is here to stay _ even if State
Department traditionalists and CIA covert operations types continue
to look at trade and globalization as ``low diplomacy'' compared
with the life-and-death struggles of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Clinton's lasting imprint on U.S. diplomacy may well be
his recognition that preserving the peace and creating a stable
global economic system are two sides of the same coin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had we not bailed out Mexico in 1995, I'm not sure we would
have been celebrating the emergence of democracy there last week,''
Berger argues. He may be overstating the case, but even Clinton's
harshest critics say that NAFTA, the administration's first major
international initiative, was primarily about assembling a
political alliance under the guise of a trade accord.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the battle over trade within the Democratic
party got so intense that the White House dropped its drive to
expand NAFTA to much of the rest of Latin America. The
administration allowed the need to placate labor unions to hinder
the United States from exercising its influence.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the U.S. is going to use its power over time it's got to be
committed and consistent,'' said Robert Zoellick, a former top
official under President Bush and now a top adviser to his son.
``The strategy the U.S. applied to Mexico needs to be expanded to
the Western Hemisphere at large.''
</P>
<P>
   Commitment also means following through on the boring stuff even
after it has fallen far off the front page. Clinton couldn't stop
talking about the need for a ``new economic architecture'' during
the Asian crisis. But as the worst effects faded, so did the talk
of lasting solutions.
</P>
<P>
   It was reminiscent of how Clinton focused like a laser on
opening Japan's markets in his first term, threatening sanctions if
American carmakers were not given access. Once the U.S. economy
took off, Clinton barely mentioned market opening. Yet American
cars are not exactly tying up traffic in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   A final requirement for a workable new approach to foreign
policy is that it factor in the erosion of national sovereignty _
America's and everybody else's.
</P>
<P>
   When the World Trade Organization rules that the United States
cannot subsidize exporters, or block fish from countries that fail
to protect sea turtles, someone screams, ``Who elected these
guys?'' The answer is that the United States did, when it pressed
harder than any nation to set global rules of behavior, in
everything from trade to war crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, as Washington chafes whenever it loses an
international dispute, the rest of the world believes the system is
rigged entirely to America's advantage.
</P>
<P>
   If for that reason only, to maintain its influence, America must
be seen to be sharing power, not hoarding it. And that will require
Washington to work in a more subtle and circumspect manner than
either Democrats or Republicans are going to like.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Colorado may force new religion-schools challenge
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In God Colorado's state board of education may trust, but not,
apparently, in the law.
</P>
<P>
   The board has voted 5-1 to encourage the state's schools to post
the ``In God we trust'' motto in their classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   This just days after the U.S. Supreme Court made it plain once
again, in a case barring student prayer over public address systems
at football games, that the Constitution won't brook any of the
various devices politicians have come up with to sneak religion
into public school classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   That principle has been imbedded in constitutional law since
1963 and the court has defended it against every dodge contrived to
subvert it, from pitches for nonsectarian prayer to efforts to
chase off biology with biblical creationism.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Colorado board is trying to bootleg religion into public
schools under cover of a phrase that has been on U.S. currency
since 1864.
</P>
<P>
   The board slyly argues that it has no religious intent but only
means to champion a national heritage. Wink-wink, nudge-nudge.
</P>
<P>
   Lower federal courts have endorsed the motto in its current,
limited uses, but the Supreme Court has never taken up the issue or
shown any keenness to.
</P>
<P>
   That could change now. The first Colorado district that posts
the motto is likely to draw a legal challenge and, ironically, by
trying to weasel the motto into classrooms, the Colorado board
could put even its use on currency into legal jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   And to what end?
</P>
<P>
   The board's chairman, Clair Orr, said, ``How long can we remain
a free nation if our youth do not have civic virtue and good moral
character...?''
</P>
<P>
   A fair question, implying a good point. But the nation got along
well enough before the declaration was made official by President
Dwight Eisenhower in 1956 and was wedged into the Pledge of
Allegiance. It literally passes through our hands ever day. If
exposure to it carried any big magic we would already be among the
most virtuous and moral of peoples, but from the evidence of our
prisons we may not be.
</P>
<P>
   There is an insistent, naive assumption that just by reciting
rote prayers or seeing the Ten Commandments on a wall or hearing
Christianity piped over a P.A., today's youth -- wrongly presumed
wastrel _ would be set aright.
</P>
<P>
   The faith in such nostrums is, in about equal parts, touching
and frustrating. You would think that Colorado of all places would
be skeptical. The school massacre, at Columbine, occurred in a
community and among a youth generally accounted churched beyond the
usual.
</P>
<P>
   The Colorado board might profitably pause to think about just
what example it is itself setting for the youth its members say
they are so worried about.
</P>
<P>
   The message of the board's resolution is that adults in a
position of public responsibility think that, instead of working
for the common good in ways faithful to law, it is OK for them to
finagle a way around the clear purpose of the law just to get their
way.
</P>
<P>
   And the civic virtue in that would be...?

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: What's the Rx for high drug prices?
 &HT;    For release July 12, 2000.
 &HT;    By HOWARD KLEINBERG
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you believe that either presidential candidate, Al Gore or
George W. Bush, has a medical prescription plan that has any chance
of traveling, even slightly as proposed, through the labyrinth of
the lobbyist-dominated Congress, then I have a bridge in Brooklyn I
want to sell you -- again.
</P>
<P>
   It makes for great listening from the stump and, I suppose, it
does position each candidate on the issue. But, don't expect the
winner to deliver; he won't, he can't. The system won't allow it.
</P>
<P>
   And I'm not so certain that I agree that the government should
be subsidizing the consumers for the outrageous prices charged for
their prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   Pharmaceutical companies don't want the federal government
establishing any kind of price controls, and they argue against it
by citing that any cutback in prices would affect their research
and development divisions, thereby slowing the pursuit of greater
life-saving compounds.
</P>
<P>
   In looking at quarterly earnings reports of the major
pharmaceuticals, I'm not certain they're pouring such a huge
percentage of their revenue into R&AMP;D. As an example, in the last
earnings report of Merck &AMP; Co., a total of $2.68 billion was spent
on R&AMP;D in the 12 months ending Dec. 31, 1999, against a total
revenue of $32.7 billion. At the same time, selling, general and
administrative expenses ran $5.2 billion, or almost twice that of
R&AMP;D.
</P>
<P>
   To understand more about the pharmaceuticals, you have to look
beyond our borders. In countries such as Canada and Mexico, the
drug companies are required to negotiate with those governments on
price controls. That's why the same drug is so much cheaper in
Canada than it is in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   An example cited recently was the cost for the breast-cancer
drug tamoxifen: a three-month supply in Vermont costs $390, just
$50 in adjacent Quebec.
</P>
<P>
   When the pharmaceutical companies are forced to adhere to
government restrictions elsewhere, they get even by charging U.S.
customers considerably more. What they don't get in big profits in
Canada, they get here _ we consumers, in a way, are subsidizing the
Canadian consumer.
</P>
<P>
   Each time I listen to pharmaceutical company representatives
fall back on their old ``we need the money for R&AMP;D so that we can
make your lives better in the future'' argument, I think of the
national magazines.
</P>
<P>
   When was the last time you picked up a national magazine and did
not find at least one three-page advertisement for a particular
drug? The first two are glitzy and in color and the third, a
micro-type explanation of the drug's constraints, dangers,
elements: May cause dizziness, nausea, dry mouth, wet mouth, high
blood pressure, low blood pressure, diarrhea, constipation...
</P>
<P>
   These advertisements cost a fortune (I assume they fall within
the ``selling, general and administrative'' segments of the drug
companies' budgets) and I've often wondered to what end.
</P>
<P>
   If I see an ad for Claritin in Time Magazine, so what? I can't
write a prescription. Yes, I can request it from my doctor, but
likely he's already been lobbied by the drug company's ``detail''
person (that's the industry name for it) and been given a supply to
hand out as samples prior to filling your prescription. If another
antihistamine product is favored by the doctor, he or she likely
will insist on that.
</P>
<P>
   (We won't dwell on what other perks are given doctors by the
drug companies.)
</P>
<P>
   While the huge advertising campaigns certainly plant the message
in the mind of the consumer, I see it as a double effort _ money
that could otherwise be spent on more R&AMP;D or, better yet, on
reducing costs to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The drug companies live in fear of price control, but if they
continue to siphon the life savings of American consumers while
adhering to price constraints elsewhere, then there is a legitimate
argument to rein them in here before we all go broke, or don't take
necessary medicine because of the cost.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, heady profit-demanding holders of pharmaceutical
stock, you have to buy prescription drugs yourselves _ if not now,
later.

DIVIDED HIGH COURT RENDERS INCONSISTENT RULINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 (EDITOR'S NOTE: Charles Levendosky, editorial page editor of the
Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune, has a national reputation for
commentary on the U.S. Constitution. His email address is
levendos(AT-sign)trib.com.) 
By CHARLES LEVENDOSKY

<TEXT>
<P>
   In the final week of its term, the U.S. Supreme Court released a
number of significant decisions that gives the public a peek into
the deep divisions within the court.
</P>
<P>
   On June 26, the high court ruled in Dickerson vs. U.S. that the
Miranda warnings outlined in its 1966 Miranda vs. Arizona decision
are ``concrete constitutional guidelines for law enforcement
agencies and courts to follow.''
</P>
<P>
   The question before the high court had been whether a law
concerning confessions passed by Congress two years after the 1966
Miranda decision would override the court's requirement that law
enforcement officials must read the Miranda warnings to those in
custody before interrogating them.
</P>
<P>
   The court emphasized that the Miranda warnings are a
constitutional rule to help enforce the Fifth Amendment's
prohibition that ``No person ... shall be compelled in any criminal
case to be a witness against himself.''
</P>
<P>
   The court further stated that ``Congress may not legislatively
supersede our decisions interpreting and applying the
Constitution.'' Therefore, the right to remain silent remains
intact as a constitutional principle.
</P>
<P>
   The 7-2 decision was written by Chief Justice William Rehnquist,
who has been a frequent critic of the Miranda decision and has
written a number of high court decisions that narrowed the
application of the Miranda warnings. He acknowledged the exceptions
the high court has made to Miranda, but asserts in the decision
simply that ``no constitutional rule is immutable.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Antonin Scalia wrote a stinging dissent, which Justice
Clarence Thomas joined, that accuses the high court of exercising
``immense and frightening antidemocratic power'' and ``judicial
arrogance'' that reaches beyond the bounds of the U.S.
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Scalia and Thomas would have Miranda warnings scattered to the
winds because they don't believe the high court's interpretation of
the Fifth Amendment can override the majority vote of Congress in
passing legislation to the contrary.
</P>
<P>
   Scalia expressed his dislike of the court's decision by making
an argument based upon separation of powers and the limited powers
of the federal courts; however, one should not be fooled by this
argument. In their dissent, both he and Thomas assert that the high
court cannot create rules of constitutional status that help
interpret and enforce fundamental rights found in the Constitution.
Basically, that assertion is pure nonsense.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court has created many constitutional rules on how
best to interpret a particular right. For instance, the high court
has in the past announced a rule on how to determine whether
government has violated the Establishment Clause and involved
itself impermissibly with religion (the Lemon rule); it also
announced a rule on how to determine whether printed material is
legally obscene or not (the Miller rule).
</P>
<P>
   And neither Scalia nor Thomas have been shy in telling Congress
it has overstepped its bounds in passing laws that oppose the
Supreme Court's interpretation of the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Both justices voted in the court majority that struck down civil
rights legislation passed by Congress that allows victims of
sexually motivated violence to sue their attackers in federal
court. In a May 15 decision (U.S. vs. Morrison) written by
Rehnquist, the high court said Congress had exceeded its powers
under the Commerce Clause and the Fourteenth Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   And Scalia and Thomas dissented in the June 28 Stenberg vs.
Carhart decision. The 5-4 majority on the court struck down
Nebraska's law that prohibits late-term abortions, even if the
health of the woman is at risk. Neither Scalia nor Thomas found the
preservation of the health of a pregnant woman convincing enough
reason to overrule Nebraska's law.
</P>
<P>
   In the Boy Scouts of America vs. Dale decision on June 28, the
high court ignored its own previous rulings regarding exclusion
based upon gender. Rehnquist delivered the opinion for the 5-4
majority which included Scalia and Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   The Boy Scouts of America doesn't want to be forced to admit
homosexuals into its membership. A New Jersey law prohibits
discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation in places of
public accommodation. The Supreme Court of New Jersey found that
the Boy Scouts violated the state's public accommodation law by
revoking Dale's membership based upon his avowed homosexuality. The
Boy Scouts of America appealed.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the U.S. Supreme Court forced the Jaycees to open
its national membership organization to women because it violated
the Minnesota Human Rights Act (Roberts vs. U.S. Jaycees, 1984). In
1987, a unanimous high court forced a Rotary Club to open its
membership to women (Board of Directors of Rotary International vs.
Rotary Club of Duarte) because it violated a California law that
prohibits businesses from discriminating based on gender.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, the high court forced the New York State Club
Association, Inc. to open its membership to women based upon a New
York City law that prohibits discrimination by clubs with more than
400 members.
</P>
<P>
   In each case, the court ruled that the organizations' right of
association must give way to the more compelling state interest
that prohibits gender discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   By what rationale did the high court distinguish the Boy Scouts
case from the other discrimination cases? It didn't.
</P>
<P>
   The court, instead, focused on the Boy Scouts of America's free
speech rights. Rehnquist wrote that ``a state requirement that the
Boy Scouts retain Dale as an assistant scoutmaster would
significantly burden the organization's right to oppose or disfavor
homosexual conduct. The state interests embodied in New Jersey's
public accommodations law do not justify such a severe intrusion on
the Boy Scouts' right to freedom of expressive association. That
being the case, we hold that the First Amendment prohibits the
State from imposing such a requirement through the application of
its public accommodation law.''
</P>
<P>
   The Boy Scouts of America contends that it teaches young boys
who are Scouts that homosexuality is immoral and, therefore, it
would violate its shared goals and values to admit homosexuals as
members.
</P>
<P>
   However, as Justice John Paul Stevens points out his dissent,
the Scoutmaster Handbook (1992) directs Scout leaders to refer all
questions about sexual matters to the boy's parents, religious
leader or school.
</P>
<P>
   And, indeed, until this case the Boy Scouts of America had made
no public statement about finding homosexuality immoral.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, this activist high court felt free to ignore its
past rulings and New Jersey's anti-discrimination law.
</P>
<P>
   This court, with its ultraconservative triad of Rehnquist,
Scalia and Thomas who are occasionally joined by Justices Sandra
Day O'Connor and Anthony Kennedy, has no center. Its decisions
bounce from case to case _ often depending upon the swing votes of
O'Connor and Kennedy _ so that in the same sphere of issues, the
court may rule one way on Tuesday and rule another way on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, the result of a divided court is a body of decisions
that are unclear in their meaning and intent. And that hurts
everyone _ the people, law enforcement officials, lower courts,
legislators and, again, the people.

 By RICHARD L. BERKE  
 c.2000 The New York Times Magazine  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite his dignified pose and his made-to-order double-breasted
suits, Warren Christopher goes virtually unnoticed as he makes his
way these days, always unescorted, to the offices of Democratic
governors, members of Congress and well-known party members no
longer in government. Discretion is what Christopher is about: in
his meetings with very important Democrats, aides know to leave the
room, and the conversations are off the record. No tape recorder.
No entourage. No small talk. Christopher, who is 74, has devoted
much of his career to ticklish sub rosa missions. He negotiated the
release of American hostages from Iran in 1981. He headed the
commission that recommended sweeping changes in the Los Angeles
Police Department after the beating of Rodney King. As President
Clinton's secretary of state, he drew up a plan for sending
American troops into the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Now Vice President Al Gore has dispatched Christopher on what
is, in its way, one of the most challenging assignments he has ever
taken on: to sort through the weakest Democratic field in modern
memory and find the few men or women who could be a next vice
president of the United States _ in short, to create the List.
Because there is a lack of obvious candidates, Christopher's task
is a far more formidable one than he faced eight years ago, when he
oversaw Clinton's search for those who might make a vice president.
Of course, that means Gore's ultimate choice is harder than
Clinton's was. And yet there may be no more consequential decision
for Gore: after what seem like interminable reinventions and
remakes, the vice president is still struggling to ignite his
campaign. It may be that the only way Gore can win in November is
if he successfully reintroduces himself at the party's convention
in Los Angeles next month. That can only happen if he picks the
right running mate.
</P>
<P>
   When he is face to face with prospects, or those suggesting
prospects, Christopher's routine is that of the efficient and
meticulous lawyer he is. Christopher takes copious notes as his
interviewee rattles on about the virtues of assorted prospects (or
subtly tries to sell him _ or herself). He may make monosyllabic
utterances here or there, but he betrays no hint of what he is
thinking. He tries not even to smile. If the interviewee is lucky,
the big question comes about a half-hour into the meeting. Usually
the subject is broached in a manner that could not be more
understated: If the vice president wanted to consider you further,
what would your reaction be? On occasion, he'll put it directly:
How about you?
</P>
<P>
   While Christopher would not discuss the specifics of how he is
drawing up the List, he did recently break his long-held silence
about his role and speak about how he did it eight years ago _ and
his method has not really changed. ``I didn't think I had to ask
everyone that question,'' he said, referring to the big one. ``But
there were some people who I'd like to know how they react to that
question.''
</P>
<P>
   Christopher insists that when he asks people whether they want
to be considered, it is not a throwaway question. ``I don't think I
asked that question simply to try to assuage egos or to make people
feel good,'' he said. ``It is unfortunate to give people false
expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a long way from identifying prospects to finding the right
match. Gore's presence on the ticket eight years ago did not, by
itself, win Clinton the White House. But it helped resurrect a
presidential nominee who, before the Gore announcement, was stuck
in the polls behind President Bush _ and in some surveys, was even
trailing Ross Perot. The tableau of Clinton and Gore and their
families standing side by side outside the governor's mansion in
Little Rock signaled to the country that this ticket was young and
vibrant _ and not wedded to the timeworn tradition that a running
mate's sole value is someone who can balance the ticket
geographically.
</P>
<P>
   Gore could use that kind of magic. But even were he to dare go
for a spine-tingling choice, the problem he faces is that there is
a dearth of spine-tingling choices. Republicans eagerly reel off a
host of governors and up-and-comers in Congress with compelling
biographies, from Gov. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania and Gov. Frank
Keating of Oklahoma to Sen. John McCain of Arizona and Rep. John
Kasich of Ohio to Elizabeth Dole. Ask Democrats their favorites,
and there is, almost always, a moment of silence. Then they end up
resurrecting the names of people who have been passed over before.
One close friend of Gore's, a figure in Democratic politics for
decades, is downright unsettled. ``Names come up that may be sound
but there are no home runs in the crowd. Who is out there who would
lead people to say, Al Gore strikes a home run? For the life of me,
I can't imagine who it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore disputes that there is no future Al Gore. ``There are
quite a number of people out there who are at least as ready for
the job as I was eight years ago,'' he told me recently. But then,
conceding that the next vice president might take some molding, he
went on to say, ``The question is how you grow into the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Eight years ago, when Christopher began his talent search for
Clinton, job-ready talent abounded: Gov. Mario Cuomo of New York,
Sen. Sam Nunn of Georgia, Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey. And
there was a centrist, international-minded Southern senator named
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   His name first made Christopher's VP list in April 1992. Clinton
was in Tallahassee for a campaign event at Florida A&AMP;M (students
there questioned his explanations for his experimentation with
marijuana and his Vietnam draft status), and at his hotel there one
morning he met secretly with Christopher and Mickey Kantor, the
campaign chairman, for a vice-presidential brainstorming session.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's closest aide, Bruce Lindsey, wandered in and out as
Clinton and company tossed out names and came up with a list of 38,
including 15 that were designated high priority. (Gore was on the
prime list from the start.) It was at that meeting that Clinton
first emphasized the importance of not being locked in to
traditional concerns about ticket balancing, as Michael Dukakis had
in picking Sen. Lloyd Bentsen four years earlier, when the campaign
boasted about a Boston-Austin axis. (A lot of good it did: Dukakis
lost Texas.)
</P>
<P>
   After the Florida meeting, Christopher dispatched a team of
lawyers to help prepare preliminary dossiers on the backgrounds of
each of the 38 contenders. The only one he did not meet with was
the prospect who was the most intriguing: Colin Powell, who at that
time had not yet let on that he was a Republican. That delicate
task went to Powell's friend, Vernon Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   When Christopher first interviewed Gore in late May 1992 at the
United Methodist Building in Washington, across the street from the
Supreme Court, Gore, then a senator, was putting the final touches
on his book ``Earth in the Balance.'' Discussing that meeting with
Gore, Christopher says he was ``impressed by his intellectual
equipment and his high personal standards.'' Others probably would
not have been intrigued if Gore showed them corrections he'd made
on the galleys, but Christopher was. And he says he appreciated,
too, that Gore did not immediately jump at the possibility of being
vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't a feigned disinterest,'' Christopher says. ``It was
simply, he said, that it 'would be a very serious subject for me,
and if the governor wants me to think about it seriously, I will.'
I was impressed.'' At that session, Gore, responding to
Christopher's usual query, suggested others who might be tapped as
Clinton's running mate. Gore says some of those same names are on
his list today. He would not name names, however, explaining,
``It's too radioactive right now.''
</P>
<P>
   After that initial meeting, Christopher reported back to Clinton
verbally, to avoid leaving a paper trail. In his understated way,
he was glowing, but he prefaced his comments by saying, ``You know,
Governor, this has to be your decision. But I had a good session
with him.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first week of June, Clinton narrowed the list to a
handful, and, as part of that process, Christopher asked contenders
if they were willing to complete a long questionnaire and undergo
an analysis of their financial affairs _ including tax returns _
and medical records.
</P>
<P>
   The one person who made the final short-list but did not want to
undergo that personal vetting was Mario Cuomo, who expressed his
concerns in a prickly telephone conversation with Christopher. ``He
felt that he had been adequately vetted by his running for office
in New York,'' Christopher says. In what sounds like a stinging
condemnation from someone as mannerly as Christopher, he adds, ``It
was a somewhat difficult telephone call.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore expressed no such qualms when Christopher tracked him down
in Rio, where he was attending an environmental conference. There
was one proviso: Gore asked for 24 hours to think over whether he
wanted to be a finalist. Some Clinton advisers wondered whether
Gore _ who long nursed presidential ambitions of his own _ was
playing too hard-to-get. Christopher, having seen people make
wrongheaded decisions when they were abroad, approved of his
prudence.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, of course, did not change his mind. He allowed his name to
be put forth, as did the four others on the list: Sen. Bob Graham
of Florida, Sen. Harris Wofford of Pennsylvania, Rep. Lee Hamilton
of Indiana and Sen. Bob Kerrey of Nebraska. Clinton met secretly
with each of these contenders, mostly at the Capital Hilton, a few
blocks from the White House.
</P>
<P>
   On June 30, Gore was spirited through a back door for what had
been planned as an hourlong session, the length allotted for all
the finalists. Clinton and Gore started talking at 10 p.m. and were
still chatting well past 1 a.m. They got so comfortable that
eventually they both stretched out on the floor, their backs
against two couches as they faced one another.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, Clinton kept his counsel, leaving even
Christopher sniffing for clues. But judging by the length of the
meeting, he figured Gore had shot to the top of Clinton's mental
list, or close to it. Gore had no doubt. Asked last month when he
knew the job was his, he replied, ``That night _ if I wanted it.''
</P>
<P>
   A little more than a week later, the Clintons and Gores
introduced themselves to the nation in Little Rock, the most
enduring scene of the 1992 campaign. And one that Gore desperately
wants to recreate.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Gore how he will pick a suitable partner, and he provides a
response that makes the process sound so utterly logical _ and so
easy. ``There is one criterion that overshadows all the others by
far,'' he says, ``and that is, who has the clear ability to become
president on a moment's notice should that need ever arise?''
</P>
<P>
   There is a great deal beyond that one criterion, as Gore well
knows _ there is the whole equation of pluses and minuses that is
any politician's life, and another equation of costs and benefits
that a choice might bring to a presidential ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard Durbin of Illinois is probably the favorite of his
Democratic colleagues in the Senate, and he is a skilled politician
who could help Gore carry his must-win state. But Gore has a decent
shot at Illinois anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri, the Democratic leader, is a
time-tested politician who is popular with labor and could help
carry a vitally important state. But he is the ultimate Washington
insider _ and what he really wants is to win back the House so he
can be speaker.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts may be closest to the Gore
model: he has an impressive biography and he is agile on the stump.
But the last place Gore needs help is the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Few of those most widely discussed would bring to Gore something
Gore brought to Clinton in 1992: a sense of flair and the future.
Voters back then could instantly envision Gore running for
president in eight years. Many of the current prospects will be
well into their 60s and may seem too old to run in 2008. Gore is
now 52. But eight years hence, Graham will be 72; Gov. Jim Hunt of
North Carolina, 71; Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, 75; and
Gephardt, 67. There are appealing prospects in their late 40s, but
they are virtually unknown nationally: Gov. Tom Vilsack of Iowa,
Sen. John Edwards of North Carolina and Sen. Russell Feingold of
Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   A close Gore aide was mulling the choices _ or lack thereof _
one recent night when he came up with the only combination that
sounded imaginative, and familiar. ``Could we pick Clinton?'' he
asks. (The answer: the Constitution does not prevent a president
from being elected vice president.)
</P>
<P>
   Part of the quandary is that there is no one who solves all of
Gore's needs. He wants someone to zip up his persona. But after
eight years in Clinton's shadow, he does not want someone with so
much zip that the person will overshadow him. He wants a combative
partisan who can fearlessly run down Bush in the campaign. But he
wants someone who, as vice president, would not make waves or be a
threat. He wants someone who can help him carry a battleground
state. But he does not want to be accused of picking someone for
purely political reasons. He wants someone no one is thinking of to
provide some electricity at the convention. But he does not want
someone who is so untested that he or she falls flat off the
political stage.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves Gore searching for, well, another Gore. Bill Daley,
in an interview just before he was named Gore's campaign chairman,
said two of his choices would be Clinton appointees: Robert Rubin,
the former treasury secretary, and Bill Richardson, the energy
secretary. (That was before anyone knew Richardson would have to
answer for sky-high gas prices as well as for the disappearance of
nuclear secrets at the Los Alamos weapons lab.)
</P>
<P>
   Daley also mentioned the former Senate Democratic leader George
Mitchell, and his successor, Tom Daschle of South Dakota. The only
relatively young, attractive prospect that Daley or anyone talks
about is Sen. Evan Bayh of Indiana, who is 44. But he has the
misfortune of seeming like a young Gore clone. They are both sons
of senators; they both attended the same Washington prep school.
Moreover, Bayh falls into the uninspired category of ``safe
choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Another consideration is that when it comes time for Gore to
announce his choice _ probably in mid-August just before the
Democratic convention _ Bush will have already made his pick at the
Republican convention. So if Bush picks a woman, for example, Gore
may feel compelled to as well. The nightmare scenario in the vice
president's camp is that Bush, with more choices, will pick such an
attention-grabber as his No. 2 that Gore will be especially hard
pressed to come up with someone dynamic.
</P>
<P>
   Gore insists that he's not interested in springing a splashy
surprise. That may be because he really doesn't think it matters _
or because there are no splashy candidates and he is trying to
lower expectations. ``I don't think the drama has more than
transitory value,'' he says. ``It needs to feel right.''
</P>
<P>
   So what is Gore to do? He needs someone with whom, most of all,
he is comfortable, or as Christopher put it, ``Chemistry weighs
very heavily.'' The last thing voters want to see is an awkward Al
Gore standing beside an awkward running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was not ready to talk in any kind of detail about his
choices or his way of arriving at them. What he did seem eager to
do was convey that he was relaxed about the process. At the
conclusion of our interview, Gore had a question for me. ``How old
are you?'' he asked. ``Older than 35?'' When I told him I pass the
Constitutional threshold for the vice presidency, he said, ``Pretty
dramatic, don't you think?'' Yes, a dramatically colossal mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' the vice president said, ``could you explain that to
Warren Christopher?''

 c.2000 The New York Times Magazine  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ask a baseball pitcher why so many home runs are hit these days
and you will hear an impassioned speech from a member of an
oppressed minority. You will hear how umpires are calling a
fist-size strike zone, architects are designing ballparks that
couldn't hold a Crackerjack box, the mounds are lower and, of
course, the baseball is different _ smoother, denser, more
slippery.
</P>
<P>
   Ask an infielder, an outfielder or any player except a pitcher
about the inordinate increase in home runs and a royal smirk often
precedes the response. You are informed the hitters are stronger
than they used to be, train daily and capitalize on modern
technology like watching videotape between at-bats to find a
pitcher's weaknesses.
</P>
<P>
   These conflicting views on the home run explosion underscore the
hard, immutable boundary that exists between the two sides. The
social dynamic of all teams breaks down along certain lines _
Christian players pray before games, Latinos are drawn together by
a common language _ but no division is more powerful than the one
between pitchers and everybody else.
</P>
<P>
   The players themselves, all of them, acknowledge the split, and
offer pop-psychological theories. ``It's the difference between
left-brained and right-brained people,'' says Phil Garner, a former
infielder who now manages the Detroit Tigers. ``Pitchers are more
esoteric, thinkers, artsy-craftsy type guys _ they're the
sculptors, we're the hammer-and-nail guys.'' Tom Glavine, the
Atlanta pitcher, says, through a jesting smile, that hitters ``are
intimidated by our intelligence and our perspective on the game.''
</P>
<P>
   In the best of circumstances, these differences are fodder for
clubhouse gags. But they can be the source of real conflict,
particularly in an era when pitchers, even good ones, are getting
pounded and their roles are becoming ever more compartmentalized.
Increasingly, it's a hitter's game, not just on the field but off.
</P>
<P>
   Pitchers and hitters start out the same. In Little League and
right on through college, the best players usually pitch and then
play shortstop when they're not on the mound. It's not really until
the minor leagues that the responsibilities of pitchers and
everybody else diverge _ position players must take the field every
day and push through the grueling season.
</P>
<P>
   Relievers are segregated in the bullpen, getting the call when
needed, and the starters grow accustomed to playing only one out of
five games, at most. The rhythms of the jobs lead to entirely
different lifestyles. Take a head count in the hotel bar at last
call, and chances are the majority of ballplayers will be pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   The Toronto left-hander (and former Yankee) David Wells takes
full advantage of his schedule and makes no secret of the fact that
he likes to go drinking and stay out late. His old manager with
Detroit, Sparky Anderson, had a standing arrangement with Wells;
out of every five days, the left-hander owed the team two _ the day
he was pitching and the one before.
</P>
<P>
   Merv Rettenmund had a long career as an outfielder, including
some years with the Orioles, before becoming a hitting coach. ``We
had pitchers in Baltimore _ I'm not going to name them _ but let's
just say that the first couple of days after they pitched, they
were under the weather,'' Rettenmund says. ``And a position player
can't be like that. You have to grind it, day in and day out.''
</P>
<P>
   When Davey Johnson managed the Mets in the late 1980s, he was
particularly sensitive to the influence that pitchers had on their
other teammates. Johnson would take Howard Johnson and Lenny
Dykstra aside and suggest that maybe it wasn't such a good idea to
go out after games with Ron Darling or Bob Ojeda. It's a standing
joke in baseball circles that position players cannot keep up with
pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the bar scene isn't exactly what it used to be.
Nowadays, some pitchers turn in early _ so they can make their tee
times. On any given club, it's a sure bet that the best golfers are
pitchers. While everyday players think of life on the road almost
entirely in terms of airports, hotels and stadiums, many pitchers
can recite a list of the best golf courses in every big-league
city. Atlanta's famed starting rotation, anchored by Tom Glavine
and Greg Maddux, is renowned for its obsession with golf. They play
all season long _ the only good excuse for missing it is if you
have to pitch that day. On their days off, a lot of starting
pitchers have to show up only 90 minutes before a game, and they're
usually the first to duck out after the game. Even when they're in
the clubhouse together, position players and pitchers tend to stick
to their own kind.
</P>
<P>
   Because of their looser schedule, pitchers are less affected by
the day-to-day conformity of the clubhouse and can get away more
easily with strange, even freakish behavior. Take, for example,
Fritz Peterson and Mike Kekich, who were Yankee teammates back in
1973. In one of the more memorable off-the-field scandals of
baseball history, Peterson and Kekich essentially swapped their
lives _ wives, kids, dogs, the works. It's no coincidence that the
first tell-all books that pierced the veil of clubhouse
confidentiality _ Jim Brosnan's ``Long Season'' and Jim Bouton's
``Ball Four'' _ were written by pitchers. They simply had more time
to observe and reflect on their teammates and take notes.
</P>
<P>
   When they take the field together, pitchers and the rest of
their teammates bury their differences. Or at least they try to.
Inevitably, there is second-guessing. Glavine says he will see a
teammate swing at and miss a hittable pitch _ the type of pitch
Glavine couldn't get away with _ and he will wonder, for an
instant, ``Why couldn't he hit that?'' Similarly, Paul O'Neill,
standing in right field, gets impatient when he watches a pitcher
struggle with his control. ``It looks so easy from out there,''
O'Neill says. ``That's the first thing they tell you in Little
League _ everything starts with throwing the ball over the plate.''
</P>
<P>
   More intense conflict arises when the opposing pitcher hits a
batter or aggressively throws inside. With a few notable
exceptions, like Pedro Martinez of the Red Sox, pitchers have lost
the battle for the inside half of the strike zone. Hitters are more
sensitive than ever about being brushed back or struck by a pitch.
There is a very simple code that governs how a pitcher is supposed
to react when one of his own teammates is hit _ he is supposed to
drill one of the other team's hitters with a fastball aimed at the
backside. If a pitcher fails to retaliate, clubhouse friction is
inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, in a game against Seattle, Yankee hitters were
repeatedly hit or brushed back, and the left-hander Andy Pettitte
didn't respond. There was so much tension that a team meeting was
called the next day. According to David Cone, the most divisive
issue between pitchers and hitters is the intimidation factor. ``If
there's no retaliation or sense of protection, or disagreement
about what needs to be done, that's a major problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The flip side of this is that hitters are infuriated when one of
their own pitchers instigates a bean-ball war purely out of
personal frustration. While with the Baltimore Orioles two years
ago, Armando Benitez allowed a pivotal home run against the Yankees
and then on the very next pitch drilled Tino Martinez. A nasty
brawl ensued, which was not surprising. What was surprising was
that while blows were being exchanged, some Orioles players were
actually apologizing to the Yankees on the field about what Benitez
had done.
</P>
<P>
   On the day they're scheduled to start, pitchers get a lot of
leeway from their teammates. This selfishness, however, is not
supposed to spill over onto the field. Earlier in his career, the
Dodgers' Kevin Brown reacted furiously whenever something went
wrong, stomping around the mound if an infielder misplayed a
grounder or if he allowed a cheap hit. After a poor outing, he'd
often tear up the clubhouse. As dominant as Brown could be on the
mound _ and former teammates in Texas and Baltimore were awed by
his talent _ many couldn't stand playing with him.
</P>
<P>
   Because their roles are inherently part time, pitchers are
rarely named captain, or assume much of a leadership position. A
team leader ``has to be a guy who is in the heat every day,'' says
Rettenmund. ``He's one of the guys who's going to fail a lot and
help everybody else deal with that. If you have a pitcher who's a
team leader, it's not a healthy situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Most pitchers, in fact, have to be very careful about what they
say. Early in 1996, when the Orioles were playing poorly, the
pitcher Mike Mussina sharply criticized the team's performance. The
next day, Ripken beckoned Mussina to shortstop during batting
practice and, as Ripken practiced fielding grounders, he suggested
it was a bad idea for Mussina to speak in this way for two reasons
_ team conflicts should be kept private, and Mussina is not a
position player.
</P>
<P>
   For these reasons, few pitchers graduate into the managerial
ranks. The conventional wisdom is that ex-pitchers will have
trouble gaining the respect of their everyday players. A handful
are successful: Larry Dierker has managed the Houston Astros to
division titles the last three years. More typical is the case of
the former pitcher Phil Regan, who lasted just one year as the
Orioles' manager, in 1995. When he ripped them in team meetings,
some veterans used to flash double-L finger signs to each other:
Little League.
</P>
<P>
   When ex-hitters become managers, some, like Lou Piniella of
Seattle, never develop an understanding for pitchers. Hitters like
Ken Griffey Jr. and Edgar Martinez have responded to his intensity.
Pitchers have not. Piniella ``is the manager who hates pitchers,''
says Jeff Nelson, a Yankees reliever who used to pitch for Seattle.
``It's not hard to understand why that is.''
</P>
<P>
   Piniella was a great hitter for 18 seasons; his professional
responsibility was to loathe pitchers. How could he just shut that
off? ``He just doesn't have patience,'' Nelson says. ``He doesn't
understand pitchers. He tells you, 'Throw the ball over the plate.'
You feel like saying: 'Is that what I'm supposed to do? I didn't
know that. I thought I was supposed to come out here and walk
everyone.'''
</P>
<P>
   Ted Williams, the Hall of Fame slugger, briefly managed the
Washington Senators but was never much of a success, in part
because he just couldn't handle a pitching staff. His theory was
that his pitchers should throw sliders, because that was the pitch
that gave him the most trouble when he was a player. So the
Senators unloaded one of their best starters, Joe Coleman, because
he didn't throw sliders, and Coleman went on to have several good
seasons for Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   As a manager, Pete Rose had similar problems relating to
pitchers, although at least he knew enough not to meddle too much.
When Jim Kaat was hired as the pitching coach for the Cincinnati
Reds, Rose was blunt, Kaat recalls: ``He told me: 'I don't know
anything about pitching. I know about hitting. You take care of the
pitching.'''
</P>
<P>
   The gulf between pitchers and position players is part of the
reason so many managers are ex-catchers _ they can deal with both
sides. They are everyday players, but they are heavily invested in
the fate of the pitchers. They can tolerate their idiosyncrasies.
Over the last four years, just five managers have taken their teams
to the World Series; four of them were catchers at least part of
their careers: Joe Torre, Bobby Cox of Atlanta, Bruce Bochy of San
Diego and Jim Leyland of Florida. ``Catchers have to have empathy
for pitchers,'' Cone says. ``They have no choice.''

 (ART ADV: Two color photos of Joan Kennedy are available by calling
William Gonzalez at 212-499-3355.) 
 By SALLY JACOBS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe Magazine  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In her seventh decade, Joan Kennedy, forever memorialized in the
history books and curled newspaper clippings as the drunk ex-wife
of U.S. Sen. Edward M. ``Ted'' Kennedy, seems at last to have come
into her own. Single for nearly 20 years, she has a vast network of
friends and a jammed social schedule. Apparently sober for nine
years, she has completed the course work toward a second master's
degree in education and intends to teach music in the public
schools ``when I get old.''
</P>
<P>
   A regular at the Arch Street Worker's Chapel downtown _ chosen
in part, she confesses, because ``it's near Filene's Basement'' _
she partakes in an eclectic variety of spiritual retreats and
counsels other women in Alcoholics Anonymous.
</P>
<P>
   There have been resurrections before, it is true, heralded by
bold headlines proclaiming her sobriety, her launching of a new
life. But each time she has fallen, Kennedy has picked herself up.
And she has been standing tall for a long time now.
</P>
<P>
   Joan Kennedy is not young anymore. She is the mother of three
and the grandmother of four, a doting, warm-and-fuzzy kind of
grandmother who hides Easter eggs and plays ``Ring Around the
Rosie'' on the piano. And all the purple eye shadow and high-heeled
black leather boots do not quite dispel a certain tiredness. If age
comes hard to a former model _ one dubbed ``The Dish'' by her
brother-in-law Jack _ it has also brought for Kennedy a certain
peace and sense of self that had long eluded her.
</P>
<P>
   It is a self curiously rooted in being a Kennedy. Nearly two
decades after her divorce, Kennedy, 63, is an integral member of
the clan, her place perhaps more certain now than it has been in
the past. Keenly aware of the potency of her name, she lends it
generously to a host of public causes and is a familiar figure on
the benefit circuit. But while Kennedy is deeply proud of the
family name, she does not abide by all the family rules. She talks
openly. She expresses deep feeling. She cries. Kennedy has never
publicly criticized her former husband and seems more bemused by
the family's failings than angry. She does not live in secret
anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such a relief now to be free,'' declares Kennedy. ``So
much of my married life was about keeping secrets and pretending
that I was doing great and was happy. I don't have to do that
anymore. It's such a relief to be free. To be a genuine person.''
</P>
<P>
   Joan Kennedy is largely recognized for who she was in the past,
but her life is vastly different now than it once was. Watching
Kennedy power-walk along the Charles River in her jaunty blue Ryder
Club cap and stylish black leather jacket or hoisting bulky weights
with her slender legs, it is hard to remember the bad old days.
</P>
<P>
   But once upon a time, Kennedy told family secrets, and the
family was not happy. It was 40 years ago, and Joan Kennedy was the
family's luscious new showpiece in Washington, D.C. She was also a
chatty one and happily revealed to reporters that Jackie Kennedy
wore wigs. And that Jack Kennedy was unable to pick up his children
because of his bad back. The family's press operatives bore down
upon Joan Kennedy swiftly, and she quickly learned to suppress her
instinctive candor and coquettish sense of humor. In the shadow of
the hard-driving Kennedy clan, as well as her husband's notorious
womanizing, Joan Kennedy withdrew and found comfort in a vodka
bottle.
</P>
<P>
   Through decades that delivered her three miscarriages, the loss
of her eldest son's leg to cancer, and a grinding post-divorce
loneliness, her drinking worsened. Three times she was arrested for
drunken driving, to explosions of publicity. The last time was in
1991, when she was found weaving along Interstate 93 In Quincy in
her blue Buick with an open vodka bottle at her side.
</P>
<P>
   Before self-help groups like AA were in vogue, Kennedy's
drinking was treated as a shameful condition, and she became
further isolated within the family. One afternoon in the late
1970s, according to ``The Kennedy Women,'' by Laurence Leamer, Ted
Kennedy led a reporter outside the couple's Squaw Island home on
Cape Cod to meet his wife. There, Joan Kennedy lay dead drunk in
the back seat of a car. In 1977, she fled the couple's McLean, Va.,
home and headed to Boston, leaving her children _ then aged 17, 15,
and 11 _ behind. The Kennedys did not divorce for five more years,
but Joan Kennedy had decided to fight back.
</P>
<P>
   ``If she hadn't changed her life, if she hadn't left Ted, she
wouldn't be the person she is today,'' says Candy McMurrey, Joan
Kennedy's sister, who lives in Houston. ``She would be dead. Dead
from drinking and the sadness.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston seemed a curious place for her to land. Joan Bennett
Kennedy, after all, had grown up in New York and raised her
children in Washington, D.C. But Joan and Ted had lived in Boston
briefly after they were married, and Joan had a number of friends
in the area. It had a substantial arts and music community. That it
was the throbbing heart of Kennedy country was oddly comforting.
</P>
<P>
   She has lived in the same spacious Back Bay condominium with its
black-and-white-striped awning and sweeping view of the Charles
River for two decades. The apartment was originally a meeting place
for Ted and his political allies, and Joan Kennedy got it as part
of her 1982 divorce settlement, which reportedly also included $4
million and the house on Squaw Island in Hyannis Port. She has
lived alone except for several years when Patrick, her youngest son
and now a Rhode Island congressman, lived with her in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   She will not talk much about Ted, who keeps a home on
Marlborough Street just five blocks away, and she agreed to an
interview only on the condition that neither he nor their past
together be discussed. Some of the old secrets, at least, she still
keeps. Nor will Ted Kennedy talk about her.
</P>
<P>
   Alcohol is also a subject Joan Kennedy does not want to discuss,
particularly the arrests for drunken driving, which she wryly
refers to as ``my famous one-nighters.'' But she does, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't had a drink now for nine years, and after that
amount of time, people start to forget,'' says Kennedy, ``So, I'd
rather not bring it up and have people say, 'Ohhh, Joan. Oh, yeah.
She's the alcoholic.'''
</P>
<P>
   Her new identity is one that springs from many sources. An
accomplished pianist and author of a family guide to classical
music, Kennedy is known for her narration with the Boston Pops and
is a keen supporter of both symphony and opera. From 1995 to 1999,
she served as the chairwoman of the Boston Cultural Council, which
distributes state money to local nonprofits.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy is an overseer at both Children's Hospital and the New
England Conservatory, a member of the Lesley College Corp., where
she received a master's degree in education. An active supporter of
the Pine Street Inn, she has shown up unannounced in the women's
wing to play the piano on several occasions, including one
Christmas Day. She was recently appointed to the board of the
President's Advisory Committee on the Arts of the John F. Kennedy
Center for the Performing Arts.
</P>
<P>
   Her desk is thick with invitations to benefits and musical
events. Although she attends many, she has two categorical
priorities: fighting cancer and retardation. ``Retardation, because
it's the Kennedy thing,'' she says. ``Cancer, because of Teddy
Jr.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy is, clearly, proud of her life. While the pain of her
past has not left, ``it is not what drives her anymore. She has
moved on,'' says Pamela Humphrey, a friend who lives two blocks
away. ``She has rediscovered who she is.''
</P>
<P>
   As her son Patrick, 32, for whom she campaigns regularly,
describes it: ``I think her experience of being kind of isolated
and put into a one- dimensional role as my father's wife obviously
was very debilitating for her. Now, I think she has found ways to
express herself in areas that are of interest to her, and she has
gotten happier, particularly over the past 10 years. She has
perspective over what happened to her. She has survived.''
</P>
<P>
   The first time she fell in love, she fell fast. At 21, she was a
young woman of striking beauty and poise, easily one of the most
popular students at Manhattanville College in Purchase, N.Y. Reared
in a prominent Catholic family in nearby Bronxville, she had spent
summers appearing in television ads for Revlon and Coca-Cola. And
so, when a young law student named Ted Kennedy came to campus one
afternoon in 1957 to dedicate a new building _ several Kennedy
women had attended the school _ his sister Jean Smith plucked Joan
Bennett from the crowd and introduced her to her brother. They were
married the following year.
</P>
<P>
   The first several years were happy ones, flush with John F.
Kennedy's presidency and the birth of their first two children. But
Ted Kennedy's sexual wanderings, coupled with the Kennedy family's
fierce ambition, began to gnaw at Joan Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Press accounts at the time invariably used the words ``fragile''
or ``vulnerable'' to describe her. ``Oh, it made me mad,'' she
says. ``They would all write about how vulnerable I was, and
everybody felt sorry for me, because I was in a marriage that
wasn't good. If they only knew that I was so strong. I was stronger
than anyone else just to be able to survive. It was very hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Family members also balk at the term. Eunice Shriver, the
Kennedy sister to whom Joan is perhaps closest, says, ``If fragile
means somebody who can't cope, well, Joan coped. I think she had a
life that was very demanding of her. Sometimes she had real
problems in those days. I think she never gave up. She consistently
tried to improve and overcome her problems, and eventually she did.
So that is not a person who is fragile.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the obvious pain of those years, Kennedy does not seem
bitter and, by most accounts, including her own, now has a cordial
relationship with her former husband. Nor does Joan Kennedy, whose
own mother had a drinking problem, seem to blame the senator for
her drinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in public life, and I just had to keep everything to
myself,'' Kennedy says. ``Things I knew. I couldn't even tell my
girlfriends. ... Now that I'm well, I look back and think: How the
h-e-1-1 did I make it through.''
</P>
<P>
   And then it got worse. On a hot July night in 1969, Ted Kennedy
drove off a bridge on the island of Chappaquiddick with a young
woman named Mary Jo Kopechne sitting beside him. Kopechne drowned.
Kennedy swam to shore. But his first call was not to his wife,
according to Leamer's book, but to the blond, voluptuous model who
was his girlfriend, Helga Wagner.
</P>
<P>
   Joan Kennedy, then pregnant, played the devoted wife, clinging
to her husband's arm through the funeral and beyond. But Kennedy,
who suffered her third miscarriage the following month, knew her
marriage was a sham. After Chappaquiddick, she told Leamer, ``It
became worse. For a few months everyone had to put on this show,
and then I just didn't care anymore. I just saw no future. That's
when I truly became an alcoholic.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1970s were the hardest years. In 1973, Teddy Jr., then 12,
was diagnosed with cancer and had to have his right leg removed
above the knee. The following year, Joan Kennedy was charged with
drunken driving, and her license was suspended for six months.
Although public opinion had long been sympathetic to her, both
Washington social circles and the press were growing tired of her
behavior. And Kennedy knew it. ``It was time I started taking care
of myself in order for my children to be happy,'' she says. ``I
needed to get myself out of a bad situation.''
</P>
<P>
   For Kennedy, moving to Boston meant more than learning to live
on her own. For a woman who had been swaddled in privilege her
entire life, who at one time commanded a French chef, a maid, a
nanny, and a social secretary, it meant learning to take care of
herself.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy had a powerful entree into Boston's tight social circles
because of her name. That Ted Kennedy's 1980 presidential campaign
had foundered badly seemed only to add to her appeal. But when
conversations about divorce got under way in earnest after the
campaign, Joan Kennedy found herself looking into the void.
</P>
<P>
   ``If she were no longer a Kennedy, who would she be?'' recalls
close friend Cathy Beatty, who lives nearby and is married to Paul
Beatty, one of Ted Kennedy's former Harvard roommates.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a terrible time. Terrible,'' says Muffie Cabot, 65, a
friend for 40 years who was social secretary to the Reagan White
House in the early 1980s. ``But Joan is very disciplined. She kept
at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gradually, her achievements became her own, not just those
linked to her famous last name. Although both her sons believe
Kennedy has put drinking behind her, they also know how hard it has
been. ``She has made tremendous strides in addressing the fears and
insecurity she's had in her life,'' says Ted Jr., 38, a lawyer in
New Haven. ``I think she has really come a long, long way, but,
clearly, it's a lifelong struggle.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Edmund Molis, a neurologist who dated Joan Kennedy in the
mid-1990s, says that Kennedy drank several times while they were
together. Molis, 45, whose license was temporarily suspended in
1992 after he admitted to being a drug addict, says that sometimes
when he went to take Kennedy to the AA meetings they attended
together, ``she would be plastered. Dead drunk. She's in complete
denial about her drinking.'' But Molis says they broke up for other
reasons.
</P>
<P>
   When Ted Kennedy announced in 1992 that he was going to remarry,
many in Joan Kennedy's circle kept a close eye on their friend. The
old demon insecurities lurked. At 38, Victoria Reggie was
attractive and an accomplished attorney. Joan Kennedy worried to
her friends whether she would be included in Kennedy gatherings.
Would she still be a member of the family?
</P>
<P>
   She is. Eunice Shriver, for one, sees her twice a week in the
summer. But there have been some bumps. After the wedding, the
family rhythms shifted. Joan stopped going to the family home in
Virginia for Christmas, and also stopped going to Thanksgiving
dinner at the compound, at least for a while. But two years ago,
Ted Kennedy asked his daughter to see if her mother would join them
at the compound, and now she does.
</P>
<P>
   The children say Reggie and their mother have a mutual respect.
``Vickie is very cognizant of treating my mother with due
respect,'' says Ted Jr. ``She realizes that my mother deserves
something.''
</P>
<P>
   From the perspective of the causes she chooses to endorse, Joan
Kennedy is widely admired. Part of it is that her name adds luster
to the guest list and helps bring in donations. But at some places,
such as Children's Hospital or the Pine Street Inn, just having her
show up is one of the greatest gifts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The women were delighted that someone of her stature would
come spend time with them,'' says Pine Street Inn president Lynda
Downie. ``Her life experience really resonates with them. It makes
them believe that they, too, can move on. That there is hope.''
</P>
<P>
   It is, in a way, a very Kennedy thing to do, as some see it. Ah,
the Kennedy thing. It's always there, hovering over Joan Kennedy's
life like a morning mist draped over Nantucket Sound. Joan Kennedy
shrugs at the notion that she has become the best of them. The best
of what? Who are the Kennedys, anyway? Joan Bennett thinks she
knows, and she has a secret to tell.
</P>
<P>
   It is about her home on Squaw Island, the house she battled to
get from her husband in their divorce. If you look across the creek
that separates the island from the mainland, you can just see a
pair of old clapboard houses. Once upon a time, they were owned not
by Kennedys but by Bennetts, Joan's grandfather and his two
brothers. They bought the property in 1901, nearly 30 years before
the Kennedys came to town. In fact, Bennetts had come to America in
the 1660s, hundreds of years before Kennedys even set foot on
American soil. Joan Kennedy never told her husband that. But when
they divorced, she hung the Bennett family genealogy right in a
front room of the house, for all to see.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those Kennedys,'' says Joan Kennedy with a smile. ``They're
really newcomers. They're immigrants.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   This being my last Word &AMP; Image column, I dare to imagine what
will become of the news business. What will the newspaper of the
future look like? Does it even have a future?
</P>
<P>
   The answer, with apologies to the White House, is that it all
depends on what your meaning of newspaper is. And of news. And of
paper. If you think a newspaper must always involve an imprint of
inks on costly pulp that is processed from Canadian trees, trucked
into urban factories and trucked out again to ever more widely
dispersed readers, then its prospects are dim indeed. There is no
feature of that paper product that will not soon be replicated and
improved by digital technologies.
</P>
<P>
   A Daily Digital can be delivered to you faster, cheaper and in
much more versatile and desirable forms than any Truck Times. You
could download it anywhere and read it on a portable tablet the
size of a magazine. Or you could print out as much as you like on
electronic sheets that feel like paper but can be endlessly reused
in your home computer. Nothing magical about these forms; the
technology is at hand.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there is little that a paper journal does for you that a
Web journal could not do better. A good old newspaper brings you
both headlines and articles that are relevant to your life and
citizenship, news that is instructive or interesting or both, plus
diversions, opinions and advertisements that you either seek out or
discover by browsing. The paper is portable, easily scannable and,
with effort, preservable. Moreover, it forms a community of readers
whose shared experience of it enhances their interests and
conversations.
</P>
<P>
   A Daily Digital could do all that _ faster and cheaper. It would
also have infinite cyberspace for readers who want elaboration and
illustration of any news item, including vivid videos and
recordings. It would facilitate both rapid searching and extensive
research and allow easy filing and retrieval of all articles. And
it would let readers range far beyond the prix fixe menu of any
single group of editorial chefs. News on the Web can be ordered a
la carte, from a thousand kitchens.
</P>
<P>
   Without much effort, you can already consume a news stew that
takes the foreign news from The Times, politics from The Washington
Post, sports from USA Today, business from The Wall Street Journal
and the opinions of every columnist in America. You can program
this Daily Composite so that the desired features are packaged with
your local weather report, TV and movie schedules and Help Wanted
ads.
</P>
<P>
   Or you can have the mix prepared by Web editors who keep a
record of your interests, down to the stocks you own and the
baseball teams you follow. And as you cruise the Web, you will be
pursued by electronic spies that then surmise your interests and
those of like-minded people to tempt you with a customized package
of articles and advertising.
</P>
<P>
   As for community, the Daily Digital will instantly propel you
into as many circles as you wish, with instant e-mail and chat
rooms to debate public issues or share shopping experiences,
recipes and gardening tips.
</P>
<P>
   So when will you get The Nirvana News? Alas, not until the Web
worshipers quit their rhapsodizing about ``free'' digital news and
figure out a way to pay for its production. The Web has so far
supplanted only the newspaper's trucks. It has not produced very
good reporter robots or electronic editors. Nor has it figured out
how to pay the costly humans needed to gather, interpret, write and
package information in the coming world.
</P>
<P>
   News that analyzes events and investigates all aspects of life
is an expensive, handmade commodity. For the moment, the Web is
getting it free of charge from the old ink media that are searching
for ways to adapt to the new technology. Indeed, the Web is
temporarily enriching newspapers with the self-promotions of
dot-com companies. But electronic commerce will inevitably siphon
off much of the advertising that has been supporting news gatherers
without reinvesting that revenue in sophisticated journalism.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the economics of newspapering are not easily
replicated on the Web. Newspapers draw three-fourths of their
income from advertising and most derive about half of that from
classified ads _ the very ads for real estate, jobs and cars that
will be the first to depart for the Internet and flourish there
without being married to news content. General advertising will
also migrate to Web sites that resemble shopping catalogs or
television entertainments, sites that lack any journalistic
purpose.
</P>
<P>
   An enterprising electronic newspaper, therefore, will have to
depend much more heavily than its printed forebears on revenue from
readers. It may try to charge admission, perhaps pennies per page
on a ``pay as you read'' basis if it can compete with the free
headline services that will proliferate on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   The Daily Digital will surely seek income by collecting fees for
reprints from its archives or for searches of reference works and
other databases. Popular news sites will not only address groups of
readers with ``personalized'' advertising but also seek to earn
commissions for turning readers into customers for other merchants.
</P>
<P>
   It is far from certain, however, that these forms of income will
support the costs of producing a sophisticated news report.
Television provides a scary example of what can happen to news
gathering when a technological shift diverts the revenues of print.
Although billions of advertising dollars migrated to TV from
newspapers and magazines, only a fraction _ indeed, a still
declining fraction _ of that money has been devoted to the pursuit
and analysis of important news.
</P>
<P>
   On local TV, a mere handful of reporters and producers pretend
to cover events that newspapers traditionally covered with
hundreds. And the number of network correspondents covering
national and foreign affairs has dwindled to a precious few.
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt that the Web is a much more efficient
distributor of information than the two-ton truck. Newspapers must
adapt to digital technologies or die. The foreseeable techniques of
presenting news are dazzling, but they do not yet point to a
reliable stream of income to pay for the harvesting of news. The
oft-heard promise of ``free news'' is an oxymoron. Americans will
get the journalism they pay for.

&HT;     DEER GLUT SPELLS TROUBLE FOR SUBURBS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By RON STRAIT  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ White-tailed deer, by human standards, are
unreasonable, obnoxious creatures.
</P>
<P>
   You can't talk politely to deer and explain, kindly and gently,
that to be sociable they must curb some of their appetites _
appetites that go beyond nibbling weeds and extend to munching
expensive landscape plants and completing uncounted acts of
procreation.
</P>
<P>
   Where too many deer and too many humans come together, social
problems arise. To a point, deer become domesticated and humans go
wild.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Jim Trotter. He understands the misunderstandings that arise
between deer and humans.
</P>
<P>
   Trotter is chairman of the deer committee for Fair Oaks Ranch, a
5,000-acre community of 5,000 residents on Interstate 10 between
San Antonio and Boerne.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that the South Texas ranch also has 2,500
resident deer. The deer are eating themselves into valuable
shrubbery and out of a welcome with many of the community's human
residents. As the deer population grows, the number of disgruntled
residents goes up, so the Fair Oaks Ranch deer committee was formed
to look for solutions.
</P>
<P>
   What really got the ball rolling in earnest last week was the
situation at Lakeway, a 5,000-acre community on the shores of Lake
Travis west of Austin. Lakeway has suffered for several years with
a deer population approaching 3,000 animals.
</P>
<P>
   In June, desperate city officials resolved: Shoot the deer.
</P>
<P>
   The vote to bring in hired guns was not the first option to be
considered, but the deer-human conflict factor was too much for
leaders to take. Taxpayers demanded an option that would work.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998 the city's sanitation crews removed about 700 deer
carcasses in Lakeway, most resulting from collisions with vehicles.
Officials estimate that the total vehicular damages were about $1
million.
</P>
<P>
   While concerned voices had stopped short of talking politely to
the deer, the kind-and-gentle crowd did have a say early on. The
city spent about $65,000 trapping and hauling away 650 deer. Some
died in transit.
</P>
<P>
   However, back at Lakeway, those deer appetites kicked in. The
deer population recovered quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Lakeway and Fair Oaks Ranch are not alone in the deer problem.
Texas and many other states are saturated with deer, and surplus
deer have no place to go. By law, a deer cannot be transported to
another place unless that area is short of deer. Few, if any, such
places exist.
</P>
<P>
   And that leaves Trotter, as well as Lakeway and other locales,
in a hard spot: too many deer, more on the way and no place to put
them.
</P>
<P>
   The solution for the suburban deer glut is simple but messy. In
the Fair Oaks Ranch case, get the population to a reasonable number
(500 deer or so) and keep it there through prescribed harvesting
(quota killing).
</P>
<P>
   However, solving the Texas deer glut won't be pretty or cheap,
regardless of method. Using Fair Oaks Ranch as an example:
</P>
<P>
   _ Shooting deer and processing the meat for human consumption
costs about $250 per animal. Cutting the deer population by 1,250
would cost more than $300,000. (Cutting it to 500 would cost
$500,000.)
</P>
<P>
   _ If permitted, transferring 1,250 deer would be cheaper
($125,000) but not nearly as humane as a quick, painless death.
(About 25 percent of the deer that survive a long trailer ride die
within 90 days of the transplant.)
</P>
<P>
   _ Deer birth control doesn't work.
</P>
<P>
   _ High-fencing 5,000 acres would cost a minimum of $150,000 _ if
all the red tape could be hashed out. A high fence might slow the
influx of new deer, but it wouldn't do anything about the 2,500
animals left proliferating inside.
</P>
<P>
   The well-fed, protected animals would remain sexually active,
and the population of 2,500 deer would grow _ until it crashes.
</P>
<P>
   One solution might be for state officials to eliminate bag
limits on does so that hunters could thin rural populations and
suburban deer would have somewhere to be sent.
</P>
<P>
   In the wild or in the suburbs, the only way to consistently
control the deer population remains a timely, continuing harvest of
surplus animals, especially does.
</P>
<P>
   In confined spaces such as Fair Oaks Ranch and Lakeway, that
means hired exterminators and/or high fences and higher costs.
Those are some human solutions.
</P>
<P>
   Nature's way of solving such problems isn't nearly as pretty.

&HT;     THE MANY FACES OF RALPH FIENNES 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By LOUIS B. PARKS  
 &HT;     c.2000 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ Ralph Fiennes craves challenges.
</P>
<P>
   Since his Oscar-nominated supporting role as a brutal,
conflicted Nazi in ``Schindler's List,'' he has tackled: a morally
conflicted game show contestant pressured into cheating in ``Quiz
Show''; a pusher of addictive emotional experiences in the
futuristic ``Strange Days''; his best-actor-nominated role of a
romantic, corrupt man dying encased in bandages in ``The English
Patient''; a foppish, tormented minister with a gambling problem in
``Oscar and Lucinda.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet even Fiennes says his work in ``Sunshine,'' an epic of a
century in the history of a Hungarian Jewish family, is the most
challenging he's faced.
</P>
<P>
   Fiennes has three roles, each directly related to the others but
different, in Sunshine.
</P>
<P>
   First, there is Ignatz Sonnenschein (Hungarian for Sunshine), a
young judge so eager to advance in the empire that he changes his
Jewish name to Sors.
</P>
<P>
   Years later in the story, Fiennes reappears as Ignatz's son,
Adam, who overcomes anti-Jewish prejudice to become his country's
fencing champion.
</P>
<P>
   Following World War II, when Adam's son Ivan returns to the
family to become _ for a while _ a Communist avenger, that, too, is
Fiennes.
</P>
<P>
   It's a bravura performance that was complicated by overlapping
shooting schedules and complex costume and makeup changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no words to describe it, really,'' said Rosemary
Harris, who co-stars with Fiennes. ``I don't know another actor who
could have done (this) with the commitment he gave to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ralph was able to just pour his emotions out without any
trouble - and let you pour yours out. His lack of conceit and pride
and how he kept all the threads (of the story straight). ''Fiennes
had seen `Sunshine' six times before last fall's premiere screening
at the Toronto Film Festival, but he was thrilled to see it again
with the festival audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was wonderful,'' Fiennes said the following morning in a
Toronto hotel. ``I love the film. I think it's an extraordinary
film.''
</P>
<P>
   Fiennes knew going in that with his parts dominating the
three-hour film and three distinct characters to learn (and
sometimes to play on the same day), it would be a grueling shoot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an amazing journey through the lives of three
generations of this family,'' he said. ``I wanted to do it
immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   Like ``Dr. Zhivago,'' ``Sunshine'' uses a family saga to put a
personal face on history.
</P>
<P>
   Directed and co-written by Istvan Szabo, the director of Colonel
Redl and Mephisto, the film covers roughly 1870 to the present,
taking the middle-class Sonnenschein/Sors family through Hungary's
monarchy, two world wars, communism, a military dictatorship, the
Nazi influence and a shaky democracy.
</P>
<P>
   In each period the family faces new problems. Fiennes'
characters respond differently because each has a different
personality. But Fiennes' playing them all gives the story
continuity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one actor, I think, gives it a continuum, an arch all the
way through,'' said Fiennes, who took a lower-than-usual salary
because he wanted to do the role and work with Szabo. ``If you had
three different actors, you might as well have done three different
films.''
</P>
<P>
   While wanting each role to be distinctive, Fiennes was
determined to keep the personalities subtle and not exaggerate them
to create obvious oddities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would not work if you tried too hard to be different _ if
you tried to go too far in terms of physicality or makeup, so that
the audience would be alienated by the effort you were making to be
different,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, when asked what his characters share, Fiennes took a long
pause before answering.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what to say to that,'' he said, then continued
reluctantly.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, they're all men who are a bit unsure of who they are.
They're struggling to assert their sense of identity in different
ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Fiennes, 37, seems much more at home playing a part than talking
about it. In Toronto, dressed in a flannel shirt over a casual
dress shirt, tan slacks and leather loafers, he seemed far more at
ease being interviewed than he was a few years ago. But he still
looked like he'd rather be back in Hungary than talk about himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I have become more comfortable,'' he said. ``The kind of
questions you get asked you're not asked every day. It often throws
me. And I have felt a little invaded. I don't know what to say.''
</P>
<P>
   He has found personal questions especially threatening.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I've been oversensitive, sometimes, about it. Maybe.''
</P>
<P>
   Fiennes prefers to stay out of the limelight, seeing it as a
disadvantage for an actor to become more well-known than his roles.
</P>
<P>
   One thing hasn't changed about Fiennes in interviews: Like many
British actors with a lot of stage experience, he refuses to be
pretentious about the art of acting or mysterious about the
process.
</P>
<P>
   Suggest that an actor might learn something about himself from
the roles he plays, and he looks like he just bit into a lemon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, you can,'' he said. ``But I mean, I don't think acting's
a therapy.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of it's just playing. It's only an extension of the simple
childhood instinct to put on dress-up clothes and just play.
Cowboys and Indians.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're talking about it like it's some kind of therapy. I
can't approach a piece of work like that. I see a part; I see a
story; I pretend to be this person.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not thinking, like, does it make me feel more myself? In
fact, I think it's not good for actors to analyze what they do too
much. The actors I admire are very practical in their approach.
Someone like Judi Dench just gets on, does it and goes home. There
isn't a churning over or internal `is this part affecting me?'
</P>
<P>
   ``It's quite nice to escape into a part sometimes, because you
have a beginning, middle and an end. Life's much more confusing:
The script (or real life) is being written as you go along.''

&HT;     BUSH'S VP PICK WILL REVEAL MORE THAN A NAME 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By CRAGG HINES  
 &HT;     c.2000 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Does George W. Bush have the courage to select Gov.
Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania as his vice presidential running mate? It
may be Bush's toughest call of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   As Colin Powell _ definitively and disappointingly _ has ruled
himself out of the running, Ridge emerges head and shoulders above
the remaining Republican field, with the exception of a couple of
dark horses including Sen. Richard Lugar of Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   Ridge's political calculus is almost too good to be true _ a
Republican Roman Catholic who supports some abortion rights, a
Vietnam-era veteran who actually fought in Southeast Asia and a
working-class guy with Washington experience (U.S. House,
1983-1995) who comes from the heart of the most important
electoral-vote belt.
</P>
<P>
   The catch is, of course, the part about ``some abortion
rights.'' Ridge opposes government funding for abortions, backs
waiting periods, supports required parental consent for abortions
for minors and draws the line at so-called partial-birth abortions,
but he supports the broad principle of Roe vs. Wade.
</P>
<P>
   To hard-line, anti-abortion Republicans this is apostasy, and
some of them are threatening to bolt if Ridge is on the ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Bolt and do what? Stay home or vote for Pat Buchanan so it will
be easier for Al Gore to add at least four more years to the
current Democratic run in the White House? These Shiite Republicans
give sanctimony a bad name.
</P>
<P>
   One problem is that the anti-abortion folks have never been
convinced that the Bush men, despite their current vows of
faithfulness to the cause, are true believers. They recall that
former President Bush was once a poster boy for Planned Parenthood
and that his about-face on the issue came in the dark of night
after Ronald Reagan tapped him as running mate in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   The former president sometimes likes to be a bit revisionist on
this point, so let's briefly restate the record. As he was battling
Reagan for the Republican nomination in 1980, the elder Bush
expressed his personal opposition to abortion but supported the
1973 Supreme Court decision legalizing the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I happen to think it was right,'' the elder Bush told Rolling
Stone in an interview published in the March 20, 1980, edition.
This meant the future president had about the same position as
Teddy Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the Bush women, who with winks, nods and obscure
hand signals have let it be known that they just may have a
different view from the boys on abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Late last year, Barbara Bush, the governor's sainted mother,
went so far as to say in an ABC News interview that abortion should
not be addressed in the national Republican platform at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Listen to your mama,'' urged Republicans for Choice in ads
that have fallen on deaf ears at the Governor's Mansion in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   To add an openly somewhat pro-choice Ridge to this possibly
irresolute mix would have the Phyllis Schlaflys of the world
ranting in double time.
</P>
<P>
   There's no question that the anti-abortion forces could make a
lot of noise at the Republican National Convention. But if George
W. Bush cannot face them down and turn their frothing to his
advantage, then he's a poorer politician than his reputation would
indicate.
</P>
<P>
   What better sign could Bush offer to the moderates and
independents who, if they vote, are likely to decide this national
race?
</P>
<P>
   Bush would maintain his own opposition to abortion, no matter
how troglodytic, but also demonstrate he is not a captive of the
narrow, single-issue lobby that has dominated Republican
intra-party affairs for two decades.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's high command may have convinced the Texas governor that
he's already solid enough with these key middle-road voters that
there's no need to risk ticking off the abortion opponents _ and
that anyway they can paint Al Gore into a liberal corner in
September and October.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush brass may be arguing for some pale, supposedly safe
ultra-clone of Bush, specifically Gov. Frank Keating of Oklahoma.
He's also Roman Catholic but anti-abortion, so, unlike Ridge, he
won't get his bishop's knickers in a twist.
</P>
<P>
   History shows that the selection is not likely to have much
effect on the outcome of the presidential race, so George W. Bush
can pick anyone he wants as a running mate. But Bush will be
telling us a lot when he does.

&HT;     WHEN WORKERS ARE EMPOWERED 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By L.M. SIXEL

<P>
   HOUSTON _ Too many times retailers don't give enough thought to
their sales force.
</P>
<P>
   They give them drug tests, put aprons on them and send them out
to ``help'' the customers.
</P>
<P>
   So it was encouraging to talk to a couple of retailers who have
thought about the importance of good pay, good training and
treating people well.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Executive Officer Garrett Boone and President Kip Tindell
were in north Houston recently to open their newest Container
Store.
</P>
<P>
   The owners figure one great person is three times as productive
as a good person. So they try to keep the stars. No one earns less
than $10 an hour, and the average full-time employee earns in the
$30,000s, plus receives an array of benefits the owners describe as
``good but not as good as Microsoft.'' Some sales employees - and
this is without commissions - earn up to $50,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Employees also receive a minimum of 185 hours of training the
first year. The retail industry average is eight hours.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for the extensive training? The products are
difficult to sell, said Tindell, flashing a Nalgene bottle. The
small bottle is $1.99, twice what you'd pay at a drugstore. But it
doesn't leak, even in pressurized situations.
</P>
<P>
   When employees spot customers looking at the bottles and tell
them about its non-leaking virtues, 95 percent of customers buy it,
he said. But that human contact is critical.
</P>
<P>
   The good pay, training and empowerment have keep turnover
relatively low at 15 to 25 percent a year, compared with the
industry figure of close to 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The owners of the 21-store Dallas-based chain also believe in
sharing information. At every store they pass out figures on sales
totals vs.
</P>
<P>
   sales goals on a daily, weekly, monthly and annual basis - and
how the figures compare with last year's.
</P>
<P>
   No other retailers do that, Boone said. They may tell employees
how their store is stacking up from the year before, but they are
``scared to death'' to give out such sensitive information for the
entire chain.
</P>
<P>
   But Boone found that his 2,200 employees get a companywide
perspective when they can examine sales data and compare amount of
purchases per customer across the chain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're wide-eyed radicals about this,'' Tindell said. Without
the information, employees get tunnel vision, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the information falls into the wrong hands. About 15
copycat stores have popped up, Tindell said, and he suspects that
some of the information that the Container Store shares with
employees - expansion plans, new product considerations and legal
issues - has made its way to competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Even Boone and Tindell have a limit on openness. Tindell put his
foot down when asked how much the privately held chain earned last
year.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to its openness, the Container Store uses on-the-job
training to help create conscientious employees. Several times a
year, employees are sent to other stores to work a week or two.
</P>
<P>
   It's a good way of exchanging ideas. Houston employees who go to
Fort Worth for a week, for example, give employees at the chain's
lowest-performing store (``every day in Houston is Fort Worth's
best Saturday'') great ideas, Boone said.
</P>
<P>
   You'd be hard-pressed to find another retailer that flies its
clerks and warehouse employees around the country and puts them up
in hotels so they can work in another store, said Tindell.
</P>
<P>
   I returned to the north Houston Container Store several days
after interviewing the bosses to ask employees how they felt about
working there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all managers here,'' said Jeff Greenwood, recalling a
day when a customer from League City called after returning home to
complain that one of the items she purchased hadn't made it home
with her.
</P>
<P>
   Greenwood, a sales associate, shipped another one to her -
without getting permission first.
</P>
<P>
   It's a liberating feeling, he said, to work for a company that
lets him solve problems as they come up. A lot of companies won't
even allow you to make a return, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another employee, Will Richardson, used a word I don't hear
often when someone other than the CEO describes his job. Richardson
used ``we'' when he talked about the Container Store, as in: ``We
try to give customers a lot of individual attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe if more employees used ``we'' instead of ``them,''
shopping would be more pleasurable and fulfilling.

&HT;     MARVEL AGE OF MOVIES MAY BE DAWNING 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By BRUCE WESTBROOK  
 &HT;     c.2000 Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Since writer Stan Lee launched a comics revolution in the '60s
while exhorting fans to ``Face front!,'' Marvel has dominated a
market in which superheroes rule.
</P>
<P>
   But even as it leaped tall buildings beyond its rivals, Marvel
never could turn its comics icons into film stars as big as rival
DC's Superman or Batman.
</P>
<P>
   With the release of X-Men, that could change. As hype-loving Lee
might say, the Marvel age of movies could be upon us, and, for all
True Believers, ``X'' could mark the spot.
</P>
<P>
   But not so fast. Though X-Men titles are Marvel's top sellers,
and fans anxiously await the release of the film this week, those
same fans have reason to be wary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fans have been talking about an X-Men movie for years, and yet
many have expected it to be awful,'' said John Simons, co-owner of
Midnight Comics in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's skeptical because of Marvel's track record
onscreen,'' said Michael Steenbergen, manager of Bedrock City Comic
Co., also in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``But at the same time, everybody wants to see it.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because the cast and the trailers look so good. Despite
their concerns, X-fans have hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're buzzing about this one,'' Simons said. ``The fans know
about Marvel's record in movies, but this one looks like it could
turn that around.''
</P>
<P>
   Created in 1963 by Lee and artist Jack Kirby, the X-Men are
among the first superheroes of the so-called ``Marvel Age of
Comics,'' as Lee zealously dubbed it. Two years earlier, he and
Kirby launched the Fantastic Four, a book that continues to this
day. Yet the FF's only screen appearance was a '90s movie so cheap
and dismal it was never released.
</P>
<P>
   For TV or direct-to-video release, Marvel's Captain America,
Doctor Strange and the Punisher also fell victim to poor concepts
and cheap execution.
</P>
<P>
   The line has had some TV success in live-action (The Incredible
Hulk) and cartoons (Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends). Its Blade
comic, while not a major title, also sparked a modest hit movie.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing from Marvel has come close to the megamillions DC
has earned with its films based on Batman and Superman.
</P>
<P>
   That's why X-fans are anxious, concerned and fiercely protective
_ and why early looks at X-Men have stirred heated debate along
with fresh hope.
</P>
<P>
   Take the uniforms. Instead of the comics' colorful threads, the
movie's X-team will wear simple black-leather duds emblazoned with
tastefully tiny Xs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some fans have complained about the new uniforms, which tone
down the long-underwear style of most superheroes in comic books,''
Steenbergen said.
</P>
<P>
   But longtime X-Men writer Chris Claremont understands that a
film ``can't slavishly reproduce what's on the page. It must
translate for a medium with sound and movement.''
</P>
<P>
   Chief translator for the $75 million film from Fox is director
Bryan Singer (The Usual Suspects). But looming more largely behind
Marvel's push in Hollywood is Avi Arad, CEO and president of Marvel
Studios, the company's film and TV division.
</P>
<P>
   The uniform change was crucial, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided to go with a style of uniform that's not as
outlandish as you have in comics or animation,'' Arad said. ``We
still maintain the sci-fi aspect of comics while giving it a
realistic dignity.''
</P>
<P>
   Claremont agrees. From what he's seen, the filmmakers made the
right choices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides, these uniforms look a lot more comfortable than
Michael Keaton's outfit did in Batman,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In other ways, X-Men closely follows the characters and story
lines Claremont developed while writing X-Men comics in the '70s
and '80s. (He recently returned to X-writer duties.)Like the
comics, X-Men has a team of young adventurers under the guidance of
Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart), also known as
``Professor X.''
</P>
<P>
   Xavier's ``students'' have varied superpowers, but they all stem
from the same thing: genetic mutation.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Spider-Man, who developed the ability to climb walls
after being bitten by a radioactive spider, or the Fantastic Four,
who turned invisible or elastic after being bombarded by space
rays, the X-Men can pass through walls or command lightning because
they're a new form of humans who have special powers at birth.
</P>
<P>
   Claremont seized on this distinction to make the X-Men outcasts,
applying racial prejudices of the '60s and McCarthyism of the '50s
to the X-Men's world.
</P>
<P>
   It's a world in which all mutants - good or evil - are
mistrusted by society at large and a senator (Bruce Davison in the
film) can make hay with a hate campaign.
</P>
<P>
   That makes the X-Men a melodramatic metaphor for the price of
intolerance. They strive mightily to protect humanity from sinister
forces _ such as belligerent mutant Magneto (Ian McKellen) _ even
while humans scorn them.
</P>
<P>
   Xavier's team has had many members over the years, but in the
film its chief heroes include: Storm (Halle Berry), who can control
weather; Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), the most popular X-Man, who has
long claws and fast-healing powers; Rogue (Anna Paquin), who
absorbs powers; Cyclops (James Marsden), who can wield force blasts
from his eyes; Jean Grey, first known as Marvel Girl (Famke
Janssen), who blends telekinesis with telepathy, Xavier's chief
strength.
</P>
<P>
   Led by master of magnetism Magneto, their opponents include
shape-shifter Mystique (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos), big-hopping Toad
(Ray Park) and ferocious Sabretooth (Tyler Mane).
</P>
<P>
   Claremont likes that cast, but he once had others in mind. While
waiting long years for an X-movie, he envisioned Robert Duvall as
Xavier and Bob Hoskins as Wolverine.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that was 15 years ago,'' he said. ``Everybody gets older _
unlike in the comics.''
</P>
<P>
   True. Xavier, Cyclops and Grey have hardly aged since they first
appeared in '63. (Teammates Beast, Iceman and Angel didn't make the
movie team.)Yet in a way, they almost died.
</P>
<P>
   As characters, the X-Men disappeared for years. The original
book lasted just 66 issues, then became dormant. Old stories were
merely reprinted.
</P>
<P>
   That changed in 1975, when Claremont launched a new X-team
combining several original members with newcomers such as Storm and
Wolverine.
</P>
<P>
   Those new X-Men mutated into huge sensations, spawning spinoff
books and maintaining top-seller status even as Marvel slid into
bankruptcy (due to noncomics investments) in 1996. (It's since
recovered.)
</P>
<P>
   Recent X comics have included the X-Men, the Uncanny X-Men,
X-Force, Mutant X, X-Man, Generation X, books based on Wolverine,
Bishop, Cable and many miniseries, including three prequels to the
film.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to mention older spinoffs such as the New Mutants,
Power Pack and Alpha Flight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people complain there are too many titles to keep up
with,'' Simons said. ``Even so, it's amazing how the X-Men are able
to support an entire line of comics.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that other superheroes of New York-based Marvel will be
neglected in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Arad, based in Los Angeles, is wheeling and dealing with many
studios to put an entire slate of Marvel movies and series on
screens big and small.
</P>
<P>
   Next up will be Spider-Man, to be directed by Sam Raimi
(Darkman). It's being cast now for release in November 2001.
</P>
<P>
   (Freddie Prinze Jr. and Tobey McGuire are among candidates to
play Peter Parker, aka Spider-Man.)Next will come The Fantastic
Four, The Incredible Hulk, Blade II, The Silver Surfer, Iron Man,
Morbius, Ghost Rider and others. Two X-sequels could also arise;
the cast already is signed.
</P>
<P>
   But first things first _ and Arad thinks X-Men is a good place
to start.
</P>
<P>
   ``X-Men will be a very good jump-start for all of those
projects,'' he said. ``Fans will see a movie that takes the
characters seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Why the sudden push toward Marvel movie mania? Three letters:
CGI.
</P>
<P>
   Computer-generated images are crucial in depicting the Marvel
universe, Arad said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They allow you to build incredible backgrounds, as you saw in
The Phantom Menace, and to show incredible powers. This will be a
golden age for sci-fi type pictures in stylized worlds.''
</P>
<P>
   He said a Spider-Man movie ``would have been a disaster six or
seven years ago. Many things just weren't doable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, with CGI, you'll see things in X-Men that you couldn't do
a few years ago. We're very excited.''
</P>
<P>
   One boost for Marvel's movie fortunes is the fact that many of
today's filmmakers grew up on its comics.
</P>
<P>
   Directors such as Raimi, James Cameron and Christopher Columbus
are big fans. Cameron tried for years to spin a Spider-Man flick
until Raimi got the nod.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes comics don't get much respect,'' Arad said. ``But
these filmmakers respect them as a form of storytelling.''
</P>
<P>
   So does Kelley Hall, who teaches courses on comics and society
at DePauw University in Greencastle, Ind. Hall has read a
novelization of X-Men and feels it has ``a good sense of capturing
the comics' social themes.''
</P>
<P>
   She cites the AIDS issue as an example.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the '80s people wanted gays to be registered as a
protection from AIDS. That kind of thing comes up in the movie with
the idea of registering mutants.''
</P>
<P>
   ``From a mutant perspective, the idea is, `We were born this
way. We can't control it. It's the way we are, and you shouldn't
discriminate against us based on a genetic mutation.' ''Claremont
feels social issues account for the books' popularity among their
core audience: teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The X-Men are outcasts, and feeling like an outcast is what
every teen-ager goes through,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Such relevance separated Marvel from DC when Lee launched
Marvel's new brand of humanized heroes in the '60s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fundamental difference between Marvel and DC was: Superman
and Batman occasionally played at being Clark Kent and Bruce Wayne,
while Peter Parker was an ordinary guy who had this night job as
Spider-Man _ which was really cool, but didn't make him any less
the nerd in school,'' Claremont said. ``It was something every teen
could empathize with.''
</P>
<P>
   Having read the X-Men script and been an adviser for the film,
Claremont is certain it will maintain his outcast sensibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's also an A-list movie with Oscar winners before and behind
the camera. It's got as good of an ensemble as you can ask for.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give me a film with Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart facing
off, and I'm in heaven. I'm there.''
</P>
<P>
   And ``X'' marks the spot.

<P>
   Winter's run-up in fuel prices served as an unmistakable
reminder that there's no constitutional guarantee to cheap and
plentiful oil. Though America's pump prices probably won't reach
the European levels of $4 to $5 a gallon anytime soon, it's
unlikely we'll return to the era of $1-a-gallon gasoline, either.
</P>
<P>
   That may be bad news for drivers, but it's giving new momentum
to a groundbreaking program dubbed the Partnership for a New
Generation of Vehicles, or PNGV. President Clinton threw down the
gauntlet for this industry-government consortium seven years ago,
when he called on the Big Three automakers to triple the mileage of
the typical U.S. family sedan. Even with a federal commitment of
about $200 million a year, much of it in the form of research
programs at Sandia National Laboratories and the nation's other
government research labs, it was immediately obvious that the
president had issued a tough challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Coming under increasing public and government pressure,
automakers around the world have been struggling to improve fuel
economy. In Europe, the industry's goal is to bring to market
vehicles that can get the equivalent of 78 mpg. But the first
products to meet that target, such as the 3.0-liter Volkswagen
Lupo, are small, stripped and expensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want us to produce moonshot technology at down-to-earth
prices,'' says DaimlerChrysler president Jim Holden. ``Consumers
won't accept any car that doesn't meet their expectations for
utility, for performance, for roominess and for affordability.''
</P>
<P>
   So a central tenet of PNGV, also known as the ``supercar''
program, has been to deliver ``3X'' mileage without any sacrifice.
The program's Holy Grail is an 80-mpg car the size of the popular
Ford Taurus that's also safe, clean and affordable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite frankly, a lot of us doubted this partnership would
work,'' admits General Motors vice chairman Harry Pearce. ``Well,
it has worked, and extremely well.''
</P>
<P>
   The proof is in the form of three new PNGV prototype vehicles,
the GM Precept, the Ford Prodigy and DaimierChrysler's Dodge ESX3.
Don't go looking for them at your local dealer, at least not yet.
Their production is still years away. But in the very near future,
bits and pieces of all of this technology should show up on more
mundane vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The PNGV is a ``precompetitive'' program. In lay terms, that
means industry and government researchers worked to develop basic,
common goals and guidelines, but once they chose the fundamentals
most likely to meet the 3X goal, it was up to each automaker to
design a buildable prototype. In the initial process, the partners
explored a vast array of technologies, with a concerted focus on
advanced powertrains. They looked at everything from the Sterling
engine to direct-injection gasoline engines. In the end, a hybrid
solution won out. All three PNGV prototypes are driven by a
combination of diesel and electric power. But in other critical
areas, they show surprisingly divergent strategies.
</P>
<P>
   GM PRECEPT
</P>
<P>
   General Motors' Precept is arguably the most advanced of the
three supercars. Precept mates a 1.3-liter direct-injection diesel
with two electric motors, one on each axle. It's the only ``heavy''
hybrid, meaning it can run on diesel power, electric or a
combination of the two.
</P>
<P>
   Approximately two-thirds of the time during urban driving
conditions, Precept is powered solely by its 35-kilowatt lithium
polymer battery pack. The electric motors also serve as ``electric
superchargers,'' increasing performance on takeoff, or when pulling
a heavy fuel load. Unlike GM's EV1 battery car, you don't need to
plug Precept into an electric outlet. The diesel engine can serve
as a charger, and additional power is recaptured by the motor
during regenerative braking.
</P>
<P>
   GM bills Precept's body as the most aerodynamic ever designed.
To cheat the wind, the diesel engine is mounted in the car's tail.
Precept even replaces conventional sideview mirrors with ``lipstick
cameras'' _ the captured images are viewed on two dashboard-mounted
displays. The chassis and body make extensive use of lightweight
aluminum, magnesium, composites and titanium, helping hold total
weight to 2,618 pounds, half that of many SUVs, and two-thirds the
weight of the target Taurus.
</P>
<P>
   FORD PRODIGY
</P>
<P>
   The Ford Prodigy is also highly aerodynamic. And it makes use of
aluminum and other lightweight materials. Unlike GM's supercar,
Prodigy is a ``light'' hybrid in which the diesel engine always
drives the car. There's only a single, 47-hp electric motor, which
assists the 1.2-liter direct-injection diesel during takeoff and
hard acceleration. But that combination lets Prodigy get by with an
engine that's half the size that you'd expect in a more
conventional sedan.
</P>
<P>
   Ford predicts that, like Precept, Prodigy will get at least 80
mpg under normal driving conditions. (Actually, both get a bit
better economy using diesel, but that figure has been converted to
equivalent gasoline mileage, in keeping with PNGV's original goal.)
</P>
<P>
   DODGE ESX3
</P>
<P>
   ESX3 is the third in a series of high-mileage prototypes
developed by Chrysler Corp., now DaimlerChrysler AG. It's the most
conventional looking of the three PNGV prototypes, and the
roomiest. At 72 mpg, it's the only one falling short of PNGV's
mileage target, but, ironically, that may make it the most
realistic of the three supercars.
</P>
<P>
   ESX3 is another light hybrid, using lithium-ion batteries to
provide energy for short bursts of acceleration. And the electric
motor allows for so-called Start/Stop operation. At a red light or
when idling in heavy traffic, the diesel engine shuts off. When
it's time to move again, a tap on the accelerator pedal
automatically starts the engine, with the electric motor acting as
the starter.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler engineers opted to avoid costly aluminum and
magnesium. ESX3's body consists of a dozen pieces of
injection-molded plastic, similar to the material used for soda pop
bottles. The prototype sports a glossy paint job, but it could also
have a semimatte finish, with the color molded in. That would
eliminate the need for a paint shop, reducing production costs.
</P>
<P>
   Engineers worked hard to keep costs under control. Instead of
the GM Precept's side-mounted cameras, ESX3 uses a lower-priced
prism system, much like that of a submarine periscope. At volumes
of 80,000 units a year, it would still cost $7,500 more to build an
ESX3 than a midsize Chrysler Concorde. But the penalty on the
original ESX was $60,000 and on the ESX2, it was $15,000, so the
trend is right.
</P>
<P>
   While Ford and GM wouldn't set down figures, observers suggest
Prodigy and Precept would likely cost several times more than a
conventional sedan, unless and until the automakers can achieve
major breakthroughs in such things as assembly techniques and
battery-manufacturing methods.
</P>
<P>
   While the technology is falling into place, PNGV's big challenge
remains. The recent run-up in oil prices has added $25 to $50 a
month to the typical family's fuel bill. That makes motorists more
interested in economy, but, even so, the equation is lopsided.
</P>
<P>
   Tripling the mileage of the average American family sedan would
save about 371 gallons of fuel annually. Even at $2 a gallon, that
would barely be $750 in savings a year. So the cost gap needs to
get a lot closer, though a proposed $3,000 federal tax credit for
high-mileage cars would help.
</P>
<P>
   There's another challenge facing PNGV. The three vehicles all
meet current Tier I emissions standards, but not the toughened Tier
II rules soon to go into effect. Diesel particulates, linked by
some research to lung cancer, pose an especially tough challenge.
Improved emissions devices are under development, but they would
require at least a tenfold reduction in the amount of sulfur
currently found in American diesel fuels, which can run upward of
500 parts per million. The Environmental Protection Agency is
expected to set new diesel fuel standards later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the current hurdles, bits and pieces of the PNGV
technology could begin showing up at your local dealer in just a
couple years, hints DaimlerChrysler's Holden. One of the first
examples could be in a modified version of the German-American
automaker's Dodge Durango sport utility vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Dubbed a ``through-the-road hybrid,'' it would replace its
gas-hungry V8 with a more miserly V6. That engine drives the rear
wheels, while an electric motor drives the front axle. Able to
generate 175 hp in short bursts, a prototype actually achieves
better 0-to-60-mph times than a conventional Durango with Dodge's
big 5.9-liter V8, but it gets 20 percent better fuel economy.
</P>
<P>
   The domestic automakers aren't the only ones looking at hybrids
for big gains in fuel economy. Toyota put the world's first
dual-powertrain automobile, the still not EPA-rated Prius, into
production more than a year ago. A U.S. version is due to debut
this year. And last fall, Honda unveiled the Insight, rated by the
EPA at 65 combined mpg.
</P>
<P>
   But both have their drawbacks. Prius is far smaller and more
expensive than a conventional family sedan, and Insight is only a
two-seater, limiting its potential market in the United States to
an estimated 4,000 a year. Both automakers hint they have more
mainstream models under development.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line, GM's Pearce emphasized, is that new technology
will come to market. ``The vehicles of the future will be as
different from today's vehicles as the first automobile was from
the horse and buggy.''

 (ART ADV: A photo of Dawn Meekhof and Stephen Jefferts with the F-1
clock is available on Newscom or by calling William Gonzalez at

 By JIM WILSON 
 c.2000 Hearst Communications Inc.   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's hard to suppress a smile when you are introduced to Dawn
Meekhof. Her pretty alabaster face is painted crimson with skier's
sunburn. It seems that the builder of the world's most accurate
clock lost track of time on the slopes near her Boulder, Colo.,
laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   The clock in our heads is a notoriously bad timepiece. It runs
too fast on vacations, too slow in traffic jams and stops entirely
in dentist chairs. On the job, Meekhof and her colleague Stephen
Jefferts deal with a more objective measure of time.
</P>
<P>
   The two National Institute of Standards and Technology
physicists have spent the last four years building the world's most
precise clock. Known as NIST F-1, it is accurate to 1 second in 20
million years. Around Christmas time F-1 became the new standard
for defining Coordinated Universal Time.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting on a vibration-isolating lab bench, F-1 looks more like
a science experiment than a clock. There isn't a pendulum or main
spring in sight. What you do see are lots of lasers.
</P>
<P>
   One set acts as a refrigerant and chills to nearly absolute zero
the cesium atoms that F-1 uses to calculate time. A second set of
lasers forms a sort of Ping-Pong paddle that sets them in motion.
The remaining laser is used to measure the changes that take place
within these atoms as they travel through a tube filled with
microwave energy. Using this complex apparatus, Meekhof and
Jefferts can calculate the length of a second more precisely than
ever before.
</P>
<P>
   The operation of the F-1 clock is a marvel. First, a gas
containing atoms of cesium is introduced into a vacuum microwave
cavity that is housed in a silver stovepipe-like structure. When
the cavity is filled with gas, a half dozen laser beams placed at
right angles to each other are then directed at the center of the
chamber.
</P>
<P>
   Tuned to the infrared range, the laser light is invisible to the
eye. Nevertheless, it exerts sufficient pressure to limit the
motion of the atoms. Motion is heat. With the pressure of the laser
light limiting their motion, the atoms very quickly cool to within
a few millionths of a degree of absolute zero, -459.7 degrees
Fahrenheit, the point at which motion stops.
</P>
<P>
   Two vertically aimed lasers _ the Ping-Pong paddle, so to speak
_ set the frigid cesium ball in play by providing just enough
energy to send it moving slowly up the cavity. Like a rock tossed
into the air, the ball of cesium atoms feels the tug of gravity and
falls back through the cavity. Because this trajectory resembles
the movement of water in a fountain, F-1 is called a fountain
clock.
</P>
<P>
   The accuracy of F-1 is tied to the length of time the cesium
atoms remain in free fall. In F-1 the trip covers 6 feet and lasts
about 1 second. During this comparatively long period of time,
Meekhof and her colleagues slice a second with unprecedented
precision. ``The more time we have, the more accurately we can
measure the frequency of the cesium atoms,'' explains Meekhof.
</P>
<P>
   Frequency is the rate at which a phenomenon repeats. The
frequency source for the first nonsolar timepieces, water clocks,
was a steady drip into a catch basin. The more water that
collected, the more time had passed.
</P>
<P>
   Monks in the Middle Ages adapted this scheme to create the first
alarm clock so they could rise for their pre-dawn prayers. Pendulum
clocks became the height of accurate time in 1655 and remained the
standard through the 1940s. Within a decade they were replaced by
quartz oscillators, like those now used in digital wristwatches,
and then came the first atomic clocks.
</P>
<P>
   Like the first atomic clocks, F-1 takes advantage of a
phenomenon known as resonance. Every element has characteristic
frequencies at which it absorbs and emits electromagnetic
radiation. These ``resonant'' frequencies are inherently stable
over time.
</P>
<P>
   In 1967 the world's timekeepers met in France for the Conference
Generale des Poids et Mesures and agreed to establish the basic
unit of time _ the second _ as equal to 9,192,631,770 vibrations of
a cesium-133 atom.
</P>
<P>
   During their brief trip in F-1's vacuum chamber, the chilled
cesium atoms are bombarded with microwave energy. ``Depending on
the frequency of the microwave signal, the atomic state of the
atoms might or might not be altered,'' says Meekhof.
</P>
<P>
   At the finish line, another laser is directed at the cesium
atoms. Only those whose atomic states have been altered by the
microwaves emit light. The photons or tiny packets of light are
then measured by a detector.
</P>
<P>
   ``This procedure is repeated many times while the microwave
energy in the cavity is tuned to different frequencies. Eventually,
a microwave frequency is achieved that alters the states of most of
the cesium atoms and maximizes their fluorescence,'' Meekhof
explains. ``This frequency is the natural resonance frequency for
the cesium atom. F-1's cooler and slower atoms allow more time for
the microwaves to interrogate the atoms and determine their
characteristic frequency, thus providing a more sharply defined
signal.''
</P>
<P>
   Although F-1 sets the standard for time, it does not run
continuously. Instead, it operates about one week per month and is
used to calibrate the timepieces that generate the timing signals
that NIST transmits throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
   High-accuracy timekeeping is becoming increasingly important.
Electrical power utilities need split-second timing to maintain the
stability of their distribution systems and locate faults after
lightning storms.
</P>
<P>
   Long-baseline interferometry, which astronomers use to make
highly accurate observations of distant objects, needs extremely
accurate atomic reference clocks. Some global positioning satellite
applications require timing to within 100-billionths of a second.
</P>
<P>
   You don't need to be a scientist or engineer to take advantage
of the precision of F-1. The signals are out there for anyone to
use. To set your wristwatch to the world's most accurate timepiece,
tune a shortwave radio to 2.5, 5, 10, 15 or 20 megahertz and listen
for the tone. Or, you can synchronize the clock in your computer
with F-1 via the Internet. NIST's Time and Frequency Division
provides free software at www.bldrdoc.gov.

 (ART ADV: A photo of C. Loring Brace measuring a skull is available
on Newscom or by calling William Gonzalez at 212-499-3355.) 
 By JIM WILSON 
 c.2000 Hearst Communications Inc.
<TEXT>
<P>
   America is a nation of immigrants. My daughters are a delightful
mix of French, Scot, Irish and Norwegian, with a splash of genes
from the countries that once formed Austria-Hungary.
</P>
<P>
   When their first relatives arrived on these shores _ just in
time to fight on the wrong side in the American Revolution _ this
land had long been inhabited. In school, my daughters were taught
that the earliest ``native'' Americans, the Clovis people, came to
this country sometime about 11,500 years ago. They were said to
have traveled from Siberia across the land bridge that then
connected the Asian land mass with what is now Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   However, your youngsters may soon be telling you a different
story about how this nation was settled. In this revised version of
America's earliest history, the first settlers were a far more
diverse lot who moved about more than we suspected. This new, more
complex picture of the peopling of America comes from two
converging lines of research that couldn't seem to be farther apart
_ measuring skulls and analyzing grammar.
</P>
<P>
   C. Loring Brace, an anthropologist at the University of
Michigan, has made a career out of analyzing skulls from around the
world. In a recent seminar at the annual meeting of the American
Association for the Advancement of Science in Washington, D.C., he
said his work had confirmed a complex origin for today's American
Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Brace and his colleagues performed two dozen measurements on
each of thousands of ancient and newer skulls. Then, they mapped
the similarities among groups. Their analysis shows that the
descendants of the first humans to enter the New World _ including
natives of Mexico, Peru and the southern United States _ have no
obvious ties to any Asian groups. ``The 'native' inhabitants of the
Western Hemisphere are not all minor variants of the same people,''
he says.
</P>
<P>
   This idea runs so contrary to prevailing wisdom that Brace, a
strong advocate of the diversity proposition, plans to press
forward with his investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The diversity of the original settlers is not quite as great as
that of the 18th, 19th and early 20th centuries when waves of
European, Asian and (unwilling) African immigrants arrived on
American shores. However, the first Americans did have more
far-flung origins than were ever suspected.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Brace's studies have revealed that the Blackfoot,
Iroquois, and other tribes from Minnesota, Michigan, Ontario and
Massachusetts descended from the Jomon, a prehistoric people of
Japan. The Inuit in the far north and tribal groups who once lived
down the Eastern seaboard into Florida appear to be a later branch
from the trunk of the Jomon family tree, he says. The
Athabaskan-speaking people from the Yukon and northwestern Canada,
who spread as far south as Arizona and northern Mexico, appear to
trace their origins to China.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their craniofacial configuration allies them more closely to
the living Chinese than to any other population in either
hemisphere,'' says Brace.
</P>
<P>
   To identify the ultimate origins of these peoples, Brace hopes
to use new samples from sites in Mongolia that have been silently
biding their time in museums in the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``These samples represent the remaining large block of the world
not currently covered in any detail by the University of Michigan
Museum of Anthropology craniofacial database,'' says a university
spokesman. Their addition could provide a fuller picture of our
country's earliest inhabitants. ``We hope that new samples from
Novosibirsk, Moscow and Saint Petersburg, which we've recently been
given permission to measure, will illuminate their origins,'' says
Brace.
</P>
<P>
   One of the reasons Brace's work is being taken so seriously is
that it has been more or less verified.
</P>
<P>
   Johanna Nichols, a professor of Slavic languages and literature
at the University of California at Berkeley, has reached a
conclusion similar to Brace's by way of an entirely different
approach. While Brace has analyzed the most substantial bits of our
past, Nichols has focused on the most ephemeral _ language.
</P>
<P>
   She says that new linguistic evidence from indigenous languages
throughout the New World strongly suggests that humans have been in
the Americas since as early as 40,000 BCE. She says that it is only
along the West Coast that languages appear to have come from
immigrants who arrived after the ice age, 14,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Nichols also has some radical ideas about the direction in which
the country was settled. Breaking with the traditional view of
migrations, she says that the interior of North America was
colonized not directly from Siberia but almost entirely from the
south. Even the Athabaskan language family, now centered in
northern Canada and Alaska, is more likely to have moved up from
the south than to have entered directly from Siberia.
</P>
<P>
   To bolster her argument for an early settlement date, Nichols
points to findings from the Monte Verde site in southern Chile. It
has been dated at 12,500 years old, which means the area was
occupied during the last ice age. And, the Monte Verde people would
have needed at least 6,500 years to travel from Alaska to Chile.
Yet that only takes us back to about 19,000 years ago. Here is
where her study of language diversity provides the rest of the
explanation for the 40,000 BCE settlement date. Her research
suggests a very high degree of language diversity, and that, says
Nichols, is something that happens only with time. She maintains
that the approximately 150 distinct Native American language
families we know of today must have required at least 35,000 years
to develop.
</P>
<P>
   However, beneath this diversity there are deep linguistic
similarities that link across the Pacific Ocean. ``From the Sierra
and the Andes mountains all the way to the Atlantic, American
languages share distinctive features,'' says Nichols. ``They share
grammatical features that are rare elsewhere, which gives the
hemisphere a distinctive signature.''
</P>
<P>
   One of these features is a pronoun system with ``n'' in the
words for ``I'' and ``we'' and ``m'' in the words for ``you.'' It
is found on both the American Pacific coast and the south Asian
coast.
</P>
<P>
   As to the question of where it all began, that is something we
may never know. Nichols says that the language similarities
``indicate a common history of a people so ancient that we cannot
hope to trace their linguistic descent.'' So it would appear no
matter how deeply we delve into our past, America always was a land
of immigrants. Some just arrived a bit earlier than others.

   DRUGS HAVE A SLIPPERY FUTURE
</P>
<P>
   Dusting large molecules with the nanotech equivalent of slippery
talc will make it possible to ``slide'' drugs into the blood and
the brain. Cornell University researchers are developing a
microscopic polymeric sphere that could be impregnated with drugs
and then injected into the body where it would slowly release them.
</P>
<P>
   The silicates cause the larger polymer chains that control drug
release to slide about. ``We have demonstrated that the transport
of small molecules can be controlled and changed,'' says Cornell's
Emmanuel P. Giannelis. ``The next step is to incorporate active
agents and watch how they are being released,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   RESETTING BIOLOGICAL CLOCKS
</P>
<P>
   Cloning could be the key to resetting the biological clock and
reversing the effects of Parkinson's, Alzheimer's and other
age-related diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually all types of body cells, except reproductive cells,
contain an aging clock. It consists of a strand of DNA on the end
of all chromosomes. These ends are called telomeres. Every time a
cell divides, some of this tail is used up. When it runs out, the
cell ceases dividing and it dies.
</P>
<P>
   Advanced Cell Technologies of Worcester, Mass., says it has
cloned human stem cells whose DNA clocks have been reset. Since
stem cells can grow up to become different types of cells, experts
familiar with ACT's work say youthful clones could be used to
replace aging organs.
</P>
<P>
   SCALPEL SEEKS CANCER CELLS
</P>
<P>
   For physicians removing cancerous brain tumors, knowing when to
stop cutting is as important as knowing where to cut. Remove too
much tissue and the patient may be left disabled.
</P>
<P>
   A new rapid-reading diagnostic system developed at Sandia
National Laboratory in Albuquerque, N.M., will shut off laser
scalpels when they come near healthy cells.
</P>
<P>
   The tiny laser directs a vertical laser beam on individual cells
as they are pushed into a small cavity by a micropump. Cancerous
cells stand out because they contain more protein.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment the smart scalpel is strictly experimental.
</P>
<P>
   LASER-ASSISTED MACHINING
</P>
<P>
   Small lots of precision ceramic parts could be made for half
their current cost with a new laser-heating technique. As the part
is machined, the laser heats the ceramic to about 1,800 degrees to
make it softer and more ductile.
</P>
<P>
   The trick is to precisely control the strength of the laser so
that it heats only a tiny portion of material, says Yung C. Shin,
the Purdue University professor who developed the technique. The
soft, red-hot ceramic is then removed with a cubic boron-nitride
cutting tool that digs into a small layer of the heated area.
</P>
<P>
   ``We heat a very small, shallow layer of the surface, and then
we remove it immediately so that the inteirior is not damaged by
heat,'' Shin explains. ``We are trying to understand what we call
the thermomechanical behavior of ceramics. It's a very challenging
issue.'' The technique could be commercialized within a year.
</P>
<P>
   NEW LIFE FOR SUPER CUBS
</P>
<P>
   Despite being out of production, the Piper Super Cub remains one
of America's favorite planes. The informal count is about 12,000.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Budde wants to keep the Cubs flying forever. His company,
AirFrames Inc., (www.supercubs.com) has begun manufacturing
replacement fuselages. Selling for $10,250, they feature
all-chromemoly tubes and fittings, improved door mechanisms, an
extended baggage area and shoulder harness attachment tubes, among
other improvements.
</P>
<P>
   ``About half the orders are from people building new planes,''
he says. ``Our fuselage is acceptable to the FAA and can receive a
standard airworthiness certificate.''
</P>
<P>
   EXPERTS DISCOUNT ALLEN LIFE
</P>
<P>
   Alien life is more likely to resemble the stuff you scrub off
the tiles in your shower than Klingons, Wookies or Romulans, say
University of Washington scientists. After extensively examining
the oldest
</P>
<P>
   Earth fossils, paleontologist Peter Ward and astronomer Donald
Brownlee have concluded the odds of intelligent life developing are
so unfavorable that Earth may actually be unique.
</P>
<P>
   Their argument, detailed in their book ``Rare Earth,'' suggests
that life as we know it is the product of a series of factors,
among them:
</P>
<P>
   1) Sufficient mass to create enough gravity to anchor an
atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   2) A stable orbit.
</P>
<P>
   3) Plate tectonics that act as a sort of atmospheric thermostat,
build land masses and enhance biotic diversity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Earth is a very charmed planet,'' says Brownlee. ``We know of
no other body that is remotely like earth.''

 &HT;    GENETIC ENGINEERING ELIMINATES CRIPPLING PLANT TOXIN
 &HT;    For release Sunday, July 16.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A small dryland pea that often saves the world's
poorest people from starvation _ and then leaves thousands
paralyzed for life _ has been genetically changed to eliminate its
crippling trait.
</P>
<P>
   Tough enough to withstand droughts that kill practically all
other crops, the plant offers a devilish choice to millions of poor
farmers and their families during drought-induced famine. If they
eat it, they may not starve. Yet with every meal, they know that
some will be left permanently crippled.
</P>
<P>
   Known by several names, including grasspea and chickling pea, it
is grown primarily for livestock feed.
</P>
<P>
   A grasspea nerve poison, which apparently does not affect farm
animals, is believed responsible for more than 100,000 cases of
paralysis, especially in Ethiopia, India and Pakistan. Eating
grasspea can lead to retardation and death in young children.
</P>
<P>
   Plant breeders at an international research station in Syria
used a type of genetic manipulation known as ``somoclonal
variation'' to reduce the plant's production of the nerve toxin to
safe levels.
</P>
<P>
   Seeds of the new plant _ still tough, still nutritious and,
according to one scientist, still ``quite delicious'' _ are being
distributed to farmers in several countries in the hope that as
they grow the new strains and save seed, it will rapidly displace
its toxic predecessor. Because the new strains do not readily cross
with existing grasspeas, researchers are not concerned that the
harmful trait will reappear.
</P>
<P>
   Development of the safe grasspea came at the end of a 15-year
search by plant breeders at the International Center for
Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA) in Aleppo, Syria.
</P>
<P>
   The center is part of an international plant breeding network
that is funded by the United Nations, the World Bank and several
national foreign aid agencies, including the U.S. Agency for
International Development.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 3.7 million acres of grasspea, which has grass-like
stems and leaves but is a legume just like soybeans and black-eyed
peas, are grown around the world, said John H. Dodds, assistant
director general of ICARDA. The crop's popularity as livestock
forage results from its ability to produce up to 1,000 pounds of
the small peas per acre during years when total rainfall is less
than eight inches. That is too little moisture to keep most crops
alive, to say nothing of productive.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows why sustained human consumption of grasspea leaves
some persons crippled and others unaffected or why victims are most
often men and boys, Dodds said.
</P>
<P>
   However, in the middle 1980s, scientists at ICARDA began
searching seed banks for a strain of the pea that did not produce
harmful levels of the poison. Several thousand varieties were
tested and all were found toxic, Dodds said.
</P>
<P>
   At about the same time, some plant geneticists were becoming
interested in somoclonal variation, a technique that enables plant
breeders to ``trap'' naturally occurring mutations that ordinarily
would not survive from one generation of plants to the next.
</P>
<P>
   ICARDA decided to try the technique to find a nontoxic grasspea.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of cell cultures, each involving only a few cells taken
from grasspea leaves, stems, husks and other non-seed parts of the
plant, were placed in special laboratory media and grown into
mature plants.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, mutations that occur in non-seed tissues are not
passed to subsequent generations. However, when mature plants are
produced as ``clones'' of a few individual cells, they can carry
the mutations with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been no foreign DNA introduced with this
technique,'' explained Elizabeth Earle, a professor of plant
breeding at Cornell University. ``You get the spontaneous variation
arising from the tissue culture, and in some case the variations
are heritable.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they've managed to (eliminate the grasspea toxin with
somoclonal variation), then that's a nice accomplishment,'' she
added.
</P>
<P>
   The process, a sort of poor person's genetic engineering, does
not require the expensive _ and often controversial _ biochemical
gene transplantation techniques involved in production of so-called
``genetically modified organisms.'' Rather, it involves years of
hit-or-miss examinations of the cell culture progeny to determine
if the desired trait spontaneously arose in any of the cloned
plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``We screened tens of thousands of these cloned plants and,
bingo, we found some of them that don't have the toxin or have
very, very low levels of the toxin,'' said Dodds.
</P>
<P>
   Seeds from those plants pass the desirable traits to succeeding
generations.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Rose, executive director of Future Harvest, a non-profit
organization devoted to encouraging food and environmental
research, said the research ``demonstrates the critical importance
of international agricultural partnerships to find solutions to the
dilemmas of hunger in developing countries.''
</P>
<P>
   Dodds said ICARDA is now working with national governments and
nonprofit organizations to distribute the new seed to a handful of
farmers in each of thousands of villages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who's been eating grasspea probably has an income of
less than a dollar a day, he said. ``These are not farmers who go
out and buy commercial seed. They get their seed by saving seed
each year.''
</P>
<P>
   But in one respect, he said, they are like all farmers all over
the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they see their neighbors growing something that is better
than what they have, they're going to get ahold of it,'' he said.
``They are going to buy it from the other farmer or they are going
to steal it or whatever, but they're going to get ahold of it.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that ``seed tracer experiments'' show that when 10 or 15
subsistence farmers are given an improved seed variety one year,
150 to 200 farmers in the same community will be planting that seed
the following year.
</P>
<P>
   ``After that,'' he said, ``it's off and running.''

&HT;     PARTIES FOR THE PEOPLE

   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ROB MORSE  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In this, the summer of our disconnectedness, Al
Gore and George W. Bush would do well to keep their eyes on Arianna
Huffington. She knows how to find the spotlight at a political
convention. Her position outside the convention halls, near the
anarchists and turtle huggers, doesn't bode well for the major
presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   When I first met Huffington, it was at the 1994 California
Republican Convention, when she was the model of the dutiful
political wife while her then-husband Michael Huffington
self-financed a $50 million run against Democratic Sen. Dianne
Feinstein.
</P>
<P>
   Michael was dull, while Arianna was anything but. When I asked
her why she wasn't running for office herself, she waved her hand
at the polyester-clad Republicans from Orange County and said, ``I
don't know any of these people.''
</P>
<P>
   By the 1996 Republican National Convention, everyone knew
Arianna on a first-name basis. She had become an inside outsider, a
syndicated columnist and comedic TV commentator paired with Al
Franken. She was at all the best parties.
</P>
<P>
   This year, we can count on Arianna not only being at the best
parties, but she'll be throwing better conventions than the
Republicans and Democrats, called ``shadow conventions.''
</P>
<P>
   Arianna knows where the action is, and it'll be outside the
convention halls in Philadelphia and Los Angeles. That's where real
issues, and not just applause lines, will come up.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know why organizers use the word ``shadow,'' because the
TV lights will be on those conventions. The likes of Sen. John
McCain (and, gee, maybe even Warren Beatty) will be talking about
real issues like poverty, the drug war and campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   The whole world might be watching, especially if windows and
heads are broken during demonstrations by anti-corporate activists
and well-organized anarchists.
</P>
<P>
   You know the whole world won't be watching the carefully staged
coronations of Gore and Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is acting so royal that he isn't even showing up until the
third day of the Republican Convention. His acceptance speech is
reportedly in its fifth draft even though it won't be given until
Aug. 3.
</P>
<P>
   That's how spontaneous political conventions are. Well, I guess
it takes time to get a speech down to easily pronounceable
one-syllable words.
</P>
<P>
   Give me a guy in a turtle suit over George W. any old time.
</P>
<P>
   The groups planning protests of the conventions have disavowed
violence. That includes Huffington and her shadow conventioneers,
as if anyone can imagine her trashing a Starbucks. She said that
her group did share with other protesters ``a sense of being shut
out of the system.''
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to believe that this socialite, syndicated columnist
and TV personality is shut out of anything. But all the best people
are shut out. To be in, you have to donate big bucks to sleep in
the Lincoln Bedroom, and that's beyond tacky.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities in Los Angeles and Philadelphia want to shut the
protesters as far out of the Democratic and Republican conventions
as possible. Cops have been preparing for war in the streets.
</P>
<P>
   All this bodes well for the media, which would love to have some
action on the order of Chicago '68 or Seattle '99. A good riot
could get higher ratings than ``Survivor.'' Bush and Gore will get
killed by the nation's collective remote.
</P>
<P>
   As it is, the networks are squeezing convention coverage into
half times of pre-season football games.
</P>
<P>
   The public tunes out of politics for good reason. They have been
shut out, focus-grouped and polled senseless. They've been fed
nonsense and lies, and as Ralph Nader says, there is essentially
one party, the Republicrats, governed by corporate contributors.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the people in the streets of Philadelphia and Los
Angeles will come for one issue, whether it's saving forests,
saving American jobs, saving Mumia or saving American democracy
from big money.
</P>
<P>
   At least they have beliefs. Inside the conventions, people come
to speak pap for power. Also, they get to wear really stupid hats.
</P>
<P>
   We have two parties committed to spending our money on schemes
to stop imaginary space-borne threats from Third World countries,
funding a war in Colombia because of our own problems with drugs,
and maintaining an economy that tends to divide the nation into
gated communities and ghettos.
</P>
<P>
   And the candidates are spending their time tuning their
wardrobes and images. George W. is going to be the first nominee in
history to deliver his acceptance speech without a podium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of such earth-shattering decisions are legends and memories
made,'' wrote Arianna Huffington in a recent column about Bush, who
had described himself as ``a good decider.''
</P>
<P>
   No grammar, no brains, no podium. The only thing missing is no
clothes, but that would liven things up too much.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder people would rather watch yuppies eat rat meat on a
desert island than watch a convention.

 &HT;    LONG-AWAITED INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION SET FOR BLAST-OFF
 &HT;    EDS: The launch will have taken place Wednesday by the time
readers get their papers. Therefore, this set-up story should run
on Tuesday.
 &HT;    By MARGARET COKER
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Rejecting last-minute evidence of potential safety
risks, the United States and Russia on Wednesday are scheduled to
launch the key module of the controversial International Space
Station, hoping to jump-start the 16-year-old project that would
allow humans to permanently live and work in space.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian-made Zvezda module is to lift off at 12:56 a.m.
Eastern Daylight Time _ more than two years behind the original
schedule _ at the Russian space agency's Baikonur launch site in
Kazakhstan to its new home orbiting Earth. Once aloft, it will
serve as the living quarters for crew and visitors at the space
station (ISS).
</P>
<P>
   Tension had built over the weekend about lingering technical
problems associated with the Russian Proton booster rocket, the
workhorse of Moscow's space program.
</P>
<P>
   According to Russian space officials, a July 5 test launch for
the Zvezda module nearly ended in disaster due to a sudden drop in
pressure in the fuel tank just before the second stage engine broke
off of the main rocket seconds after leaving the Earth.
</P>
<P>
   The Proton boosters exploded twice last year shortly after
take-off, once in July 1999 and once in October, during attempts by
the Russians to launch vessels unrelated to the space station
program.
</P>
<P>
   Those explosions caused a temporary suspension of all Russian
space launches _ as well as a great deal of sweat from NASA, which
has waited 27 months for the Russians to complete their assignment
so that work could commence at the ISS.
</P>
<P>
   The ISS has been described variously as either the most complex
and costly construction project ever attempted or NASA's biggest
boondoggle. Its price tag has jumped from $8 billion when President
Ronald Reagan proposed the plan in 1984 to upwards of $100 billion
today.
</P>
<P>
   Criticized for these lengthy delays and rising costs, NASA and
the Russian space agency were under enormous pressure to make
Wednesday's launch a success.
</P>
<P>
   Both agencies brushed aside the risk associated with the Proton,
and revelations made Friday that serious glitches occurred during
the test launch.
</P>
<P>
   The Proton was the rocket used to launch Zvezda, a silver-shaped
box the size of a large tour bus that cost an estimated $350
million to design and develop.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the 1999 explosions, both of which were
attributed to problems with the Proton engine, the United States
spent millions of dollars to help the Russian space agency check
and upgrade the rocket's propulsion systems.
</P>
<P>
   NASA spokesman Carlos Fontenot said Friday the U.S. agency did
not believe the July 5 test uncovered new problems serious enough
to delay the Zvezda launch any longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Russians have given us no information to cause a reason
for delay. We will proceed as planned,'' Fontenot said.
</P>
<P>
   Unmanned segments of the ISS _ a venture grouping Russia, the
United States, Europe, Japan and Canada _ have orbited Earth since
late 1998.
</P>
<P>
   More than 350 feet in length and weighing more than a million
pounds, the ISS will be four times larger than Russia's Mir space
station and, like Mir, visible to the naked eye from Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Also like Mir, the Russian-built portions of the ISS will be
sporting advertisements from various multinational corporations.
Along side of the Zvezda module is painted a 9-by-9-foot ad for
Pizza Hut covered by a special film so that the design and
lettering can withstand the heat of the launch and wear and tear of
space.
</P>
<P>
   The ad reportedly cost $1 million, and the proceeds will go to
Russia's space agency and aeronautic companies.
</P>
<P>
   Full assembly of the ISS will require more than 80 Russian and
American launches and 1,900 hours of spacewalks over the next seven
years.
</P>
<P>
   Zvezda will reach the space station by late July. In the next
few months, four supply flights _ two by the Russians and two by
the U.S. space shuttle _ will make the station ready to receive its
first three-man crew, comprised of both Americans and Russians, in
late October.

phone (preferably with call waiting) and laptop computer (with
extra batteries) _ makes it clear that many people really want to
be tied in knots. The latest form of one-upsmanship is the

night? I only slept THREE!'' By Joanne Kaufman.

   BAGELS HAVE BECOME AS AMERICAN AS APPLE PIE
</P>
<P>
   BAGELS-LIFEBEAT _ Once the domain of New York Jews, bagels have
infiltrated MacDonald's and Dunkin' Donuts _ which means they've
arrived. According to the American Bagel Association, 1,500 new
bagel establishments opened during 1996, bringing the total to over
4,500 nationwide. Why the rise of a loopy-looking loaf? It's true
that without butter or cream cheese, they're low-fat, but (who eats
them without butter or cream cheese?) One professor speculates that
maybe bagels have become popular because ``You can eat them with
one hand and while walking. No utensils are needed.'' Or maybe it
had something to do with ``Seinfeld.'' By Eve Glicksman.

   YOUR TICKET TO AMUSEMENT PARK SAFETY
</P>
<P>
   AMUSEMENT-PARK-DANGER-LIFEBEAT _ The number of injuries linked
to accidents at amusement parks, carnivals and county fairs is
rising. In 1998, about 9,200 people were treated in emergency rooms
for ride-related injuries, a 25 percent jump from 1994.
Unfortunately, even the kiddie rides are potentially dangerous.
It's shocking but true: No federally regulated inspection programs
exist for amusement parks, inspection laws vary from state to state
and even from county to county and some states (including Missouri,
the District of Columbia and Utah) require no inspection programs
at all. Parents must be proactive in keeping their children safe.

   AGING BOOMERS CAN PREVENT ARTHRITIS
</P>
<P>
   OSTEOARTHRITIS-HEALTH-LIFEBEAT _ Osteoarthritis, characterized
by painful, stiff joints, is the most common form of arthritis and
the leading cause of disability in the United States. Currently, it
affects 21 million people. With baby boomers moving into their
forties and fifties, this number is likely to go up. However,
experts claim that osteoarthritis is not a normal consequence of
aging and can be prevented and treated. The earlier the problem is
addressed, the better the outcome is likely to be. By Ken McAlpine.

<TEXT>
<P>
   A few months back, with considerable fanfare, Time Inc. started
a magazine called Real Simple, aimed, in the words of its founding
editor, Susan Wyland, at ``helping you simplify every aspect of
your life, your home, food, money, clothes, health, looks, work,
family and holidays.''
</P>
<P>
   Real Simple has had, let us say, a real hard time since it was
launched. Critics complained that it was hard to tell
advertisements from content, that it was unfocused, that it was too
much like ``Martha Stewart Living.'' Last month, Wyland resigned.
</P>
<P>
   But I suspect that the real problem with Real Simple has nothing
to do with the editor. I suspect that the real problem is that no
one in its potential market is remotely interested in reducing
stress and detangling life.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, yes, that's what we all say we're after. But the evidence _
starting with the growing number of people who refuse to leave home
without a beeper, Palm Pilot, cell phone (preferably with call
waiting) and laptop computer (with extra batteries) _ makes it
clear that we really want to be tied in knots.
</P>
<P>
   And not just knots: bigger knots than the next guy's. Your
colleagues are type A personalities? Well, you'll accept nothing
less than type AA. Call it stress envy.
</P>
<P>
   If status in the greedy 1980s was conferred on the basis of how
much you had, and in the busy '90s on the basis of how much you had
to do, then in 2000 it is awarded on the basis of how hassled you
are about what you have and what you have to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stress has become the badge of honor of the millennium,'' said
Arlene Kagle, a psychologist who practices in Manhattan and in
Dutchess County, N.Y. ``It's almost as if we're not allowed to
enjoy what we're doing anymore. We're annoyed by what we're doing,
as if our lives are getting in the way of something that's more
important.''
</P>
<P>
   We lost the idea of the Sabbath as a day of rest long ago. Now
we have lost evenings, nights and weekends as well: we're too busy
banking online or buying clothes off the Internet. Then we complain
_ that is to say, brag _ that we're just so wound up and tense we
can barely sleep: four hours a night at most, and don't be getting
me jealous by insisting that you get only three.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thinking goes that you're only important and successful if
more people can speak to you than you can deal with,'' said Allen
Adamson, the managing director of Landor, a corporate consultancy
in Manhattan. ``Who wants to meet with someone who, when you ask
what time he's available, says, `I can see you any time this
afternoon'? Lawyers and investment bankers are the most
competitive. They'll say: `You think you're stressed? Well, let me
tell you about my day.'''
</P>
<P>
   Even though he is neither a lawyer nor an investment banker _
actually he's president of the League of American Theater Owners
and Producers _ Jed Bernstein would like you to know about his
crazy, action-packed day, but he doesn't want to do the talking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although I might take pride in the fact that I'm putting in my
time and working the long hours, it would be embarrassing for me to
say so,'' he said. ``It would feel like a point of weakness to say
that my status is tied up in the fact that I worked a 19-hour day
when you worked only a 16-hour day. And that in itself becomes
stressful: how to get the word out without being the one to tell
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein is rare in his discretion. The only thing stressed
people dependably have time to talk about is how stressed they are
_ and what they don't have time for: sex, vacations or a meal with
you.
</P>
<P>
   ``A low-level executive friend of mine said, `I'd love to have
dinner, but I'm so overwhelmed that I can't even think about
scheduling it until the middle of July,''' said Marc Simone, a New
York radio and cable television host. ``And I said, `Call me in the
middle of July.' An hour later the chairman of the board of the
same company called and said: `What are you doing tonight? Let's
have dinner.'''
</P>
<P>
   Most people have never been around anyone as important as that
board chairman, Simone said, ``so they have this soap opera version
of it'': entourages, dashing about, phones ringing like Playskool
toys. Such people tend to lard their conversations with adverbs.
They aren't just stressed; they're very stressed, they're terribly
stressed. ``They'll say: `I'm never home,''' Simone said. ```I'm
never there. You'll never get me.''' So they'll give you a cell
phone number, and they don't realize that all they sound like is a
bookie or a drug dealer. They honestly think if they met Jack
Welch, he'd say, `Oh, I'm never home _ I'll give you my cell phone
number.'''
</P>
<P>
   What has me concerned is what I think of as trickle-down stress.
Last week, as I was putting my 6-year-old daughter to bed, she
said: ``I don't think I can sleep tonight, Mommy. I have such a day
tomorrow. First I have show and tell, then the boys from St.
David's school are coming to visit my class, then I have my
knitting class after school, and then at night we're going to the
ballet.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a tiny pause before she brightened and said proudly,
``I think my day is going to be even harder than yours.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeah? We'll just see about that, cookie.

<TEXT>
<P>
   There's nothing more American than Mom, apple pie... and bagels?
</P>
<P>
   Brought to this country by Eastern European Jewish immigrants in
the 19th century, the bagel has ascended the ranks to fast food
stardom. Once the domain of New York Jews, the rolls-with-holes
have infiltrated MacDonald's and Dunkin' Donuts _ which means
they've arrived. According to the American Bagel Association, 1,500
new bagel establishments opened during 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Call it the bagelization of America. But why the rise of a
loopy-looking loaf? Bagels are low-fat, but once you add cream
cheese or butter, the calorie advantage plummets.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Segall, professor of nutrition and food sciences at
Drexel University in Philadelphia, attributes the bagel's boom to
its having all the elements of a successful snack food:
ready-to-go, easily portable, no refrigeration required. Also
important, ``You can eat them with one hand and while walking. No
utensils are needed.''
</P>
<P>
   Timing is everything, too. Bagels would not have caught on
before World War II when Jews were not as well accepted in the
United States, Segall says. The popularity of ``Seinfeld'' likely
didn't hurt the chances of a Jewish food becoming cool either.
That, and studies like the one conducted at Indiana's Ball State
University, which showed that bagels offered the same carbohydrate
benefits to athletes as pricier energy bars.
</P>
<P>
   However you slice it, the bagel has become a hot property that
crosses ethnic lines. Dough giants like Einstein Bros./Noah,
Bruegger's and Manhattan Bagel Company are everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   What started as a plain ring-shaped roll topped by poppy seeds
or flavored with onion, however, has turned into a carnival of
flavors that appall traditional diehards. Cinnamon raisin bagels
maybe, but pumpkin, sun-dried tomato, chocolate chip or
jalepeno-cheddar bagels? If you really want to raise ethnic
hackles, chew on a Hawaiian bagel with pineapple and Canadian bacon
_ blatantly nonkosher _ or an orange and black bagel made for
Halloween, a Christian holiday.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionalists complain, too, that bagel-makers are not
remaining true to the age-old recipe where the dough is boiled for
several minutes before baking. Eliminating this step produces a
less chewy center and a crust that isn't crisp. The typical
American bagel is soft like bread compared to the denser Eastern
European original. Purists maintain that a good bagel needs no
toasting or frivolous toppings either. Nix the strawberry cream
cheese or pizza bagels.
</P>
<P>
   The bagel's origin has been linked in conflicting stories to
Hungarian, Russian, Austrian and Polish Jews. That is, of course,
assuming you disregard persistent rumors that Norwegians invented
the bagel because they couldn't get anyone to buy smoked lox.
</P>
<P>
   The first recorded mention of bagels was in Krakow in 1610,
where a Polish community regulation decreed that ``beygls'' (a
Yiddish word) be given as gifts to all women giving birth. The
circular-shaped bread was seen as representing the continuation of
life and the boundlessness of the universe ... and therefore a
ticket to luck and happiness.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, beygl became 'beigel' after the first wave
of immigrants, and eventually 'bagel' in 1932. Another popular
story about bagel beginnings is that a Jewish baker in Vienna
wanted to thank the king of Poland for saving Austria from a
Turkish invasion. In 1683, legend has it, he created a hard roll in
the shape of a riding stirrup _ 'beugel' in Austrian _ to
commemorate the monarch's favorite pastime.
</P>
<P>
   Lender's Bagel Bakery, founded in Connecticut in 1927 by Polish
immigrant Harry Lender, is significant because it was the first
U.S. bagelry outside New York. Sons Murray and Marvin Lender
subsequently figured out how to freeze the doughy treats that
launched the bagel's export to other parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Let the French eat their cake and baguettes; Americans have
chosen bagels. Between 1992 and 1997, bagel consumption rose by 65
percent in the United States. Even emergency room physicians have
been affected by the trend. Picture a legion of half-awake people
in pajamas racing in with bloody hands, the result of trying to
slice their morning bagel.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Landers responded to the new wave of injuries four years ago
by devoting a column to bagel-slicing safety. (Hint: start
horizontally and end vertically).
</P>
<P>
   As to the bagel's expanding market potential, check your pet
food aisle for the latest: rawhide bagels. Could liver and gravy
bagels be far behind?

<TEXT>
<P>
   The number of injuries linked to accidents at amusement parks,
carnivals and county fairs is rising. In 1998, about 9,200 people
were treated in emergency rooms for ride-related injuries, a 25
percent jump from 1994. Unfortunately, even the kiddie rides are
potentially dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   It's shocking but true: No federally regulated inspection
programs exist for amusement parks, inspection laws vary from state
to state and even from county to county and some states (including
Missouri, the District of Columbia and Utah) require no inspection
programs at all.
</P>
<P>
   As a parent, you must be proactive in keeping your child safe.
Always follow these savvy steps before letting your child board any
ride:
</P>
<P>
   1. Perform your own inspection. If you can't visit the park
before taking the entire family, closely examine the appearance of
the rides as soon as you arrive, says Mark Mooney, assistant chief
of inspections for the Massachusetts Department of Public Safety.
``If a ride doesn't have fresh paint or has torn seats or
significantly rusty parts, you can bet that the more detailed
components are not kept up,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   2. Explain to your child the concept of ``inappropriate
behavior.'' Risk-taking behavior is the No. 1 cause of all
accidents that occur at parks, says Dr. Richard Brown, an
orthopedic researcher and amusement park safety consultant in
Huntington Beach, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Rider negligence has turned into such a serious concern that 17
states now have enforced rider responsibility legislation, which
places full responsibility for any accidents that may occur with
the rider (or, in the case of a child, with the rider's parents).
</P>
<P>
   ``Children have to understand that misbehavior can result in an
accident,'' says Brown. Review safety rules before you get to the
park, not when your child is inside, overwhelmed by all the
activity. Explain that she must listen to the operator, keep her
hands and legs inside the vehicle at all times, never move the
safety harness, never rock a ride and never stand while a ride is
moving or exit before she is told to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Before each ride, explain which motions and sensations she can
expect and what is expected of her.
</P>
<P>
   3. Observe the ride operator. Watch a round of the ride before
you let your child on it _ and walk away if you don't see the
operator keeping a close eye on the children. Also, ``if the ride
operator is not helpful with your questions, you should consider
not having your child go on that ride,'' advises Steven Elliott, a
certified ride inspector from the National Association of Amusement
Ride Safety Officials in Madison, Wis.
</P>
<P>
   4. Obey the height restrictions. Even if your child comes very
close to meeting the height requirement, never try to convince the
operator that he should be allowed to ride. ``The height
requirement ensures that a child has the muscle and postural
control to ride safely,'' says Brown. Even if your child meets the
requirement, it doesn't mean he can handle the ride. Watch for the
reactions of the younger children exiting the ride. If they seem
comfortable and happy, then your son may enjoy it, too.
</P>
<P>
   5. Try to join your young child on the ride. If a ride can
accommodate adults as well as children, it's a good idea to
accompany your child, even if she fits comfortably into a safety
harness, says Mooney. With an older child, use your discretion. If
she wants to ride alone, ask your child to tell you exactly what
she is _ and isn't _ supposed to do when she's on the ride.
</P>
<P>
   6. Pick age-approptiate rides. Avoid putting very young children
on rides: ``I don't recommend placing a baby on any amusement
ride,'' says Mooney. ``A child's neck and back muscles may not be
developed enough to sustain the coaster movement.''
</P>
<P>
   Mooney suggests that toddlers start out on the merry-go-round or
``elephant'' rides, those that circle slowly a few feet above the
ground. Accompany your child on the merry-go-round, standing on the
inside of the horse to support him. Avoid reaching out to touch
your child from afar; he may try to reach back.
</P>
<P>
   When he's eager to move on, kiddie coasters are a good next
step. Once he has comfortably mastered those, he can try tame
attractions like the ferris wheel or teacups and gradually work his
way up to the bigger roller coasters.
</P>
<P>
   Never encourage your child to board a ride if he seems
apprehensive, even if he sees other kids his age enjoying the ride.
``Children can panic, try to get out, and may become injured as a
result,'' says Elliott.
</P>
<P>
   7. Never ignore the health restrictions. A ride operator cannot
necessarily tell whether a child has a health risk (such as asthma
or a heart condition), so it's up to you to heed all posted
warnings. And never assume that the park is exaggerating any
dangers: Children with minor heart problems or asthma may be at
greater risk riding the same attractions that millions of healthy
children have enjoyed without any problem.
</P>
<P>
   8. Don't let your child ride with a stranger. Your child may
know he shouldn't rock the ferris wheel, but does the rider next to
him? ``If there's only one spot left to fill in a car when it's our
turn, we just tell the operator we want to stay together,'' says
Sandra Ingemi of North Brookfield, Mass., mother of Jacquelyn, 7,
and John, 4. ``The people who've been waiting are more than happy
to go ahead of us.''
</P>
<P>
   9. Research your state's inspection program. Go to the Consumer
Product Safety Commission's on-line directory at
www.cpsc.gov/cpsepub/pubs/amuse.html. Scroll down to the Table of
Contents and click on Detailed Information for inspection policies
and contact information. If you have concerns about a particular
facility, call your state's inspection department and ask to see
the park's injury reporting records.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT ABOUT WATER PARKS?
</P>
<P>
   A facility that shares a public water supply poses three
potential safety problems:
</P>
<P>
   Chlorine: Chlorine levels tend to vary throughout the day, so
you want to be sure the park monitors them closely. Too little
chlorine in the water invites unwanted bacteria, while too much can
lead to skin irritations. If the park you choose does not post
chlorine levels, ask the manager to see them.
</P>
<P>
   Cryptosporidium: This microscopic parasite, excreted in the
feces of infected humans, is highly resistant to the levels of
chlorine in pools. One becomes infected after swallowing
contaminated water; symptoms include diarrhea, fever and vomiting.
The parasite has recently caused numerous outbreaks in swimming
pools and water parks. To help prevent the infection, be sure the
park requires that all diapered children wear leakproof plastic
swim diapers and that diapers are changed only in designated areas
away from the pool. Also, teach your child never to swallow from
any body of water; offer lots of bathroom breaks; and don't use a
pool if you or your child has had diarrhea within the last two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Water safety: Since water attractions are not always well
supervised, you must be vigilant about watching your child _
regardless of how many lifeguards or employees are present, what
skills your child has or how shallow the water is.
</P>

 &UR; World rights &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features
<P>
   Odd that in an age when the most innocuous health detail
(``Study shows that corn kernels get caught between your teeth'')
quickly flares into a global conflagration (``World Health
Organization Moves to Ban Summer Barbecues''), that something so
widespread has been almost universally ignored.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, it is a little strange,'' says Dr. John Klippel. ``Part
of the problem may be that people think there's very little that
can be done about it _ that it's just aches and pains they'll have
to live with. It would be nice if people paid more attention to
what is a very common problem, especially since it's a problem that
they can do something about.''
</P>
<P>
   Medical Director of the Arthritis Foundation, Klippel is
intimately familiar with osteoarthritis. He knows that it is the
most common form of arthritis and the leading cause of disability
in the United States, affecting 21 million people. He knows that
arthritis experts have predicted that within the next 20 years,
59.4 million Americans will have some form of arthritis, a hefty
increase in which osteoarthritis may play a leading role. He knows
that baby boomers, now moving into their 40s and 50s (which is when
the signs of osteoarthritis start showing up), are front-running
candidates, and for reasons you might not expect.
</P>
<P>
   He knows this doesn't have to be so.
</P>
<P>
   ``Osteoarthritis is not a normal consequence of aging,'' states
Klippel. ``Everyone has the right to have healthy, pain-free joints
forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Undue joint stiffness in the morning when you wake up
(osteoarthritis almost always shows up in the weight-bearing joints
_ knees, hips, back; it rarely affects the wrists, elbows or
ankles) or sit for a long time? Grating noises when you move your
knee? Pain in your outer hip or inner thigh? This advice might be
for you.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not something you want to ignore,'' says Klippel.
``The earlier you address osteoarthritis, the greater the
likelihood you're going to have a good outcome with the disease.''
</P>
<P>
   Understanding (and a trip to the doctor for diagnosis) being the
first step, here are the osteoarthritis crib notes.
</P>
<P>
   Osteoarthritis occurs when the cartilage in your joints breaks
down. Your cartilage, in its heyday, is a firm, rubbery material
that covers the end of bones, cushioning shock and providing a
smooth, gliding surface the bones can move across. Unfortunately,
these tiny buffers are subject to more than their share of abuse.
</P>
<P>
   It's true that the degeneration of cartilage can be hereditary,
a genetic defect causing the cartilage to wear away more easily.
Skeletal defects (bow legs or knock knees), or an adjacent diseased
bone can cause cartilage to deteriorate, too, and cartilage also
inevitably wears away as we age.
</P>
<P>
   But it's also true that the main reason osteoarthritis is so
common is that never before has the American cartiliginous system
been subject to so much stress. To put it bluntly, many of us are
too fat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in an epidemic of obesity right now,'' says Dr. Thomas
Namey, a rheumatologist, professor and chief of sports medicine at
the University of Tennessee Medical Center in Knoxville. ``If
you're heavy, you're loading your joints unnecessarily, and that's
very clearly a major cause of osteoarthritis ''
</P>
<P>
   No real surprise, for overweight folks the best way to address
osteoarthritis is to lose weight, and the best way to do that is
through diet and exercise. Unfortunately, when your joints ache,
movement is not your first inclination.
</P>
<P>
   ``The natural tendency when people start experiencing the aches
and pains of osteoarthritis is to head for the couch,'' says
Klippel. ``Which is the worst thing they can do.''
</P>
<P>
   There are two reasons for this. First, it's difficult to lose
weight sitting still. Second, exercise helps slow the progression
of osteoarthritis (there is no cure, though there is some promising
research _ more on that in a minute) and ease the aches by
enhancing flexibility and strengthening the supporting muscles in
the joints. In fact, exercise and the use of pain relievers
(acetaminophen, aspirin and various prescriptions) are the two
simple, and in most cases effective tools used to combat the
problem. Very few osteoarthritis patients ever need surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Right about now, folks who are diligent about exercising and
diet are experiencing the warm glow of smugness. I'm not fat. I'm
not old. I'm not interested.
</P>
<P>
   Well, osteoarthritis isn't as simple as that. The plumping of
America isn't the only reason osteoarthritis is becoming rapidly
more common. (On the conservative end, Klippel predicts a 20
percent increase in the next decade; more radical types predict a
near epidemic). Nor does it explain why a 30-year-old snowboarder
has ostearthritic knees that would make residents at the Happy
Acres Retirement Home wince.
</P>
<P>
   What's happening is simple. As active Americans move to new
heights of participation (and risk), the number of joint injuries
is skyrocketing, and injury to a joint often leads to
osteoarthritis. You may be 20 and a poster child for ESPN2, but if
you've had surgery to repair cartilage in ligaments in both knees
you may be headed down the same path as someone twice your age and
weight.
</P>
<P>
   And even if active sorts aren't falling off their mountain bikes
or wrenching their knees on the ski slopes, they may, with good
intentions, be grinding toward osteoarthritis anyhow. Researchers
aren't certain of the tie-in, but there's reason to believe the
stresses of some sports may wear cartilage away faster than others,
so leading to osteoarthritis.
</P>
<P>
   Both Klippel and Namey are quick to point out that no one is
discouraging exercise. Exercise is a must _ not only for warding
off or managing osteoarthritis, but for your health. But they also
believe that the wise application of exercise now can help you
avoid osteoarthritis later.
</P>
<P>
   ``We encourage exercise,'' says Klippel. ``But you need to pay a
little bit of attention to making sure that exercise is sensible.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of this is plain common sense. If you weigh 280 pounds,
running 10 miles a day is probably not for you (``How many large
human beings do you see running at 70?'' asks Namey). Twist and
turn sports _ tennis, ice skating, skiing _ also pose a risk.
Basketball causes more joint injuries than skiing, snowboarding and
in-line skating combined. (Because their joints have more natural
range of motion, women are more susceptible to joint injury than
men.)
</P>
<P>
   It may not sound sexy, but if you're in your 20s, 30s or 40s,
anything you can do now to spare your joints injury and undue
impact may help you to prevent osteoarthritis later.
</P>
<P>
   ``Especially as we age, I think we need to focus more on
low-impact sports,'' says Namey. ``Swimmers and cyclists don't get
osteoarthritis.''
</P>
<P>
   Swimming, cycling, walking, yoga, tai chi (these two are great
because they also increase balance and coordination), weight
lifting with machines (which control your movements vs. free
weights, where improper technique can lead to joint injury), are
fine exercises all. At the gym, says Namey, the stair stepper,
cross-country ski machine and exercise bike put less strain on your
knees than the treadmill. Seemingly small nuances can make a
difference, too. A bad fit in running shoes can throw off joint
alignment and lead to injury.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best things you can do _ whether you already have
osteoarthritis, or are hoping to avoid it _ is to strengthen the
muscles that support the joints. Stronger muscles around the joint
help keep it stable. Studies have shown that folks with weak
quadriceps (thigh) muscles are more likely to develop
osteoarthritis of the knee. If they already have osteoarthritis
there, weak quads greatly increase the odds it will get worse
faster.
</P>
<P>
   This makes weight training a great idea, especially as we move
into middle age.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we turn about 50, we really start loosing muscle mass,
especially in the legs,'' says Klippel.
</P>
<P>
   It's not all black and white either. Klippel was once an avid
marathon runner, for which he doesn't apologize. Certainly the
pounding may have upped his odds of getting osteoarthritis, but the
strong quad muscles he developed through running may explain why,
in his mid-50s, he doesn't have osteoarthritis in his knees.
</P>
<P>
   Klippel still runs some, but these days he spends more time
biking, swimming, kayaking, playing tennis and lifting weights _
mixing different sports is a great way to spread stresses around,
plus it's more fun.
</P>
<P>
   Wise exercise and a sound diet aren't the only tools available
when it comes to managing osteoarthritis, though at the moment they
are the most tried and true. Research indicates that the
antioxidant vitamins _ C, E and beta carotene _ may play a
protective role for osteoarthritis. Just take the recommended daily
allowance, says Klippel. And Namey doesn't discount the possibility
that glucosamine, an over-the-counter nutritional supplement, might
help. Recent studies indicate it may actually help maintain and
repair damaged cartilage. There are other exciting whiffs of a
possible cure.
</P>
<P>
   Currently under way, a major clinical trial is looking at
doxycycline, a promising and inexpensive ($10-$20 a month)
antibiotic that may stop the progression of osteoarthritis.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly it's puzzling that osteoarthritis is still so
universally ignored. As Namey says, ``Nothing makes you realize you
have osteoarthritis more than the inability to do the things you
like.''

PLAN TO RETIRE AT 56 IS DUBIOUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. In addition to my 401(k) contributions, I add $6,000 a year
to my taxable investment accounts. I currently have assets totaling
$727,000, but plan to purchase a home next year for approximately
$300,000. What securities do you recommend liquidating to purchase
the home? Or should I take out a 10-year mortgage? If I retire at
56, I will need to live off savings until I can withdraw from my
401(k) at 59 1/2. Should I change my fund allocations?
</P>
<P>
   R.B., Stoughton, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The plan seems pretty dubious to me. Let's assume you decide
to make a $200,000 down payment on your home, leaving you with
$527,000. After a decade of growth with the contributions you
outline, you would have $1,372,674. Of this, $408,451 would be in
taxable accounts _ which should be sufficient to supply your needs
until you can draw on the 401(k) accumulation. (In both of these
projections, I used a 7 percent projected annual return from
investments, based on your predilection for money market and other
fixed-income investments.)
</P>
<P>
   Now, after subtracting your savings, you have a current income
of $95,500 (not counting whatever bonuses you may earn). If
inflation averages 3.5 percent for the next decade, you will need
$134,712 to buy the goods and services $95,500 buys today.
Disregarding which pool you used to supply the funds, your
$1,372,674 total accumulation would be inadequate to long support a
sequence of withdrawals at a $134,712 level; for example, if your
portfolio earned the same 7 percent, you would run out of money in
less than 18 years _ at the tender age of 74. And that doesn't even
begin focusing on the effect of post-retirement inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Now, of course, there are some things you can do to improve the
situation. Most obvious is to adjust your portfolio so that you
have a heavier stock exposure and a much lighter commitment to
money markets and bonds. Second, if you resolved to add all or most
of your bonuses to the retirement pool, obviously the picture would
be brighter. Third, if you treat your savings as a percentage of
income, increasing the level as your income rises, that would be
another improvement. And fourth, most people find that they require
less money in retirement than they did in their working years, so
you might be able to reduce your retirement budget to less than the
equivalent of $95,500 in today's money.
</P>
<P>
   Let's get to some specifics. First, to make a $200,000 down
payment on your home, I suggest you sell your entire position in
government-backed bonds, taking the $16,000 loss on the
transaction. You could then sell about $16,000 worth of your
Perkinelmer stock, with the capital loss from the bonds more or
less offsetting your gains from the stock sale. (In all likelihood,
you could sell more than $16,000 worth of Perkinelmer with no tax
consequence, but I can't calculate it without knowing your tax
basis on those shares.)
</P>
<P>
   If you took a $100,000 mortgage, your payment would be about
$1,200, plus taxes (a calculation that assumes a 7.8 percent
interest rate). Since that figure is probably close to what you are
paying in rent, the change from renter to homeowner should be more
or less a wash. (But you probably shouldn't deduct the amount of
your mortgage payment from your cost of living at age 56, since
property tax increases over the course of that decade would come
fairly close to the reduced housing expense once the mortgage is
paid off.)
</P>
<P>
   As for your investment vehicles, you have $418,000, or more than
57 percent of your total portfolio, in fixed-income investments. If
you followed my suggestion about financing your home purchase, you
would have $230,000, or 43.6 percent of a $527,000 portfolio on the
fixed-income side. But if you decided to retain only your $75,000
money-market position, which I deem to be emergency savings, as a
fixed-income investment, that side of the portfolio would be
reduced to 14.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   If you made this move, you could probably boost your expectation
of long-term total returns to 9 percent or a bit higher. This would
improve the situation, providing a balance (on paper, of course) or
$1,642,407 at age 56. Since that's still not enough to prudently
finance a solid retirement, you can fairly confidently assume the
higher risk that goes with stock holdings _ the longer you plan to
hold stocks, the less the risk factor should bother you.
</P>
<P>
   Although it has nothing to do with eligibility to withdraw funds
from your 401(k) account, I made some projections based on
retirement at age 59 1/2, which seems more plausible. By then, with
a 9 percent earnings assumption, you would accumulate $2,337,868.
At that stage with the same 3.5 percent inflation you would need
$151,949 to provide the equivalent of a current $95,500 lifestyle.
Quite by coincidence, if your projected savings pool were then in a
fixed-income portfolio yielding 6.5 percent, it would bring you
$151,961. Send me the extra $13 (just kidding).
</P>
<P>
   Of course that would leave you no protection against inflation.
But if you added some of your bonuses to your retirement savings
and increased the dollar value of your savings to maintain the same
savings percentage as your income rises, you should have
considerably more than that $2.3 million, and that money could be
left in growth securities to protect you from future inflation.
Moreover, 6.5 years later you would have the kick added by both
Social Security and that pension. And finally, since you would then
have sufficient funds to last you many years, you would not have to
worry if you were depleting your accumulation during your 80s or
90s.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Am I amassing too much in my 401(k) plans? Should I take some
money I save and put it in a Roth IRA? I am recently married and
have no kids, but I have earmarked the $120,000 in common stocks
and the Massachusetts Investors fund to supplement my husband's
salary in three to four years when I stay home with the children we
plan to have.
</P>
<P>
   S.N., Portland, Ore. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't think you are saving too much, especially in view of
the fact you anticipate a gap in your working years to raise
children _ a practice I view as a wonderful investment in your
family, even if it slows down your retirement savings. In three
years, presuming ongoing contributions at current levels and 10
percent portfolio earnings, you would have about $241,622, and
during your years off you can presume that the internal growth of
your 401(k) accounts will keep you on track. (In that calculation,
I used your total portfolio summary, rather than the values listed
above, which were calculated from current prices; the actual
projection would be higher, since your portfolio has improved since
your letter was written.)
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, I'd like to see you and your husband with some
emergency savings. But you could view the other investments as
fulfilling that need, and your current 401(k) with its 100 percent
employer match is simply too good a deal to pass up. So I would
continue with your current contributions to your 401(k).
</P>
<P>
   (I don't know if you and your husband keep your finances
separate. If you don't mind mingling your money, and if your
employer would continue matches if you made larger contributions to
the 401(k) account, it would make sense to increase your
contributions and for your husband to decrease his by the same
amount, thus leaving the two of you with the same joint take-home
pay, but with more money going into the retirement accounts.)
</P>
<P>
   I do suggest one change. All of the money in your other
investments is in stocks and a stock fund. Since you plan to call
on this money in three to four years, financial specialists would
view this as short-term money. It is unwise to leave money that's
to be used for a short-term purpose in long-term investments such
as stocks.
</P>
<P>
   I suggest that, with a view to the tax implications, you begin
winding down that portfolio. If the tax implications aren't
onerous, I'd sell the entire portfolio now, putting the proceeds in
a two-year CD. But if you have significant capital gains in that
portfolio, you might be better off selling about a third this year,
another third next year, and the remainder the following year, thus
spreading out the tax liability.
</P>
<P>
   While the employer match to your 401(k) makes the Roth IRA
alternative unattractive in your case, that option may be a good
one for your husband, whose employer makes no 401(k) match. You'll
have to look over your total tax situation to decide whether the
future benefits of a Roth IRA outweigh the cost of adding $2,000 a
year to your taxable income. For most people of your ages, the Roth
comes out on top. If you do make that move, you will want to invest
the Roth money in the most aggressive securities with which you are
comfortable; since the accumulation in a Roth IRA will eventually
come out tax-free, that's where you want your holdings with the
greatest potential for gain.

SITES FOR WOMEN MIX FINANCIAL WISDOM, DASH OF FUN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DOLORES KONG  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Who wants to marry a millionaire? Become one yourself.
</P>
<P>
   That's one of the underlying messages emerging from a growing
number of Internet sites focusing on women and personal finance.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than being just another Web destination for shopping and
spending money, these sites are teaching women how to get their
finances in order and build wealth.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last several months, three personal finance sites
specifically for women were launched: www.financialfinesse.com,
www.MsMoney.com and www.wfn.com (for Women's Financial Network).
</P>
<P>
   And two months ago, the site for the Mutual Fund Education
Alliance, www.mfea.com, unveiled a women's section, while many of
the general women's sites have had pages on money for a while.
</P>
<P>
   There's even a women's personal finance site with attitude _
www.cassandrasrevenge.com, named after the prophet in Greek
mythology who was cursed by Apollo to always be correct but not
believed. The site's motto: ``Personal finance without all the
high-fiving and group showers.''
</P>
<P>
   These sites appear poised to take advantage of what various
industry surveys have found: that women are making up a growing
proportion of Internet users and online traders, anywhere between
40 to 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   And women are probably ready to take advantage of these personal
finance sites, too, considering the various statistics that show
women are more likely to earn less than men, to outlive men, and to
live in poverty than men (especially in retirement or after being
divorced or widowed).
</P>
<P>
   For example, women earned only 76 percent of what men earned in
1999; they live seven years longer than men on average, to age 79;
and the median income for elderly women is just over $8,000,
according to federal statistics.
</P>
<P>
   But girls also want to have fun. So in addition to tackling the
serious money issues, some of these personal-finance sites include
the kind of lighthearted features you might find in a women's
lifestyle magazine, such as a money personality analysis and
horoscopes.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, what's missing or hard to find on many of these
sites are such things as daily stock market news and the ability to
check stock quotes or monitor your portfolio. That makes the sites
less useful for the woman who's a savvy investor already, or who
plans to be one someday.
</P>
<P>
   Hopefully the omission is not a result of stereotypes _ that
women are afraid of math, or that they dislike thinking about
making money.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's an acknowledgment that the stereotypically male way
of keeping track of minute-by-minute ticks in stock prices, as if
they were sports scores, goes counter to the philosophy of
investing for the long term.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a review of some of the personal finance sites focusing
on women:
</P>
<P>
   --www.financialfinesse.com: Run by a company that began by
providing financial seminars to women in corporate and other
settings and by hosting a radio show, this Web site provides
information for investors of all levels, and dozens of financial
calculators. One of the neat features is a list of ``street scams''
to watch out for, in such areas as annuities, insurance, and
work-at-home schemes. And in the spirit of investing to become a
millionaire yourself, rather than having to marry one, the site
features a ``millionaire calculator'' that shows how much you'd
need to invest on a monthly basis, based on your time horizon, tax
bracket, and estimated rate of return. (For example, you'd need to
invest only $85 a month for 40 years, presuming a 12 percent annual
rate of return in a tax-deferred account such as a 401(k).) But
while Financial Finesse prides itself on offering ``the only
unbiased, online financial resource for women,'' its Web site
heavily promotes the company's financial seminars _ regularly $75,
or $45 if you register with its ``community center'' _ as well as
the company's network of certified financial planners.
</P>
<P>
   --www.MsMoney.com: This Web site got a boost when first lady
Hillary Clinton was on hand in March for the launch, during a
meeting of the San Francisco-based Women's Technology Cluster, one
of the site's funders. Subtitled ``Secure Your Financial Future,''
the site features sections on planning for such life events as
marriage, divorce, starting your own business, or retirement.
There's a host of financial calculators here, too, as well as
sections on retiring rich, banking online, and investing basics.
MsMoney.com says it ``helps women take control of their financial
health through selected partnerships with content and services
providers, financial experts, and book authors.'' Signing up for a
free membership allows you to participate in live chats with
experts, and gets you a subscription to a monthly newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   --www.wfn.com: Financial expert Suze Orman hosted the launch of
this Web site in March, with the help of former US representative
Pat Schroeder and other notable women. This is one of the few sites
where you can get a stock quote easily and manage your portfolio,
from the finances page. Free membership enables you to access all
of your bank, brokerage, and other online accounts in one place, as
well as pay your bills online, although there may be nominal
charges for some of those services. The site also features a WFN
Advisor Network for women who need investment, financial planning,

   --www.cassandrasrevenge.com: Written with wit, this site by
finance writer Ellen McGirt was the most fun to read of all those
reviewed, as long as you like her persona. While the site has good
basic information on investing, and prominently features the
ability to check a stock price or how the market's doing, it has
less comprehensive information than some of the other sites
reviewed. But what the site lacks in comprehensiveness, McGirt more
than makes up for with attitude. For instance, the feature on the
day's money news is headlined ``The Daily Blather'' (although it
was a few days out of date during this review). McGirt, who also
writes for America Online, promises a real-time portfolio tracker
soon for the site.

   &UR;  &LR; OK, people, let's turn off the cell phones. It's summer. It's
hot. It's vacation time, and God knows we could use the break
because a lot of us have been cranky since March.
</P>
<P>
   Hit that red key with authority, throw the thing into a drawer,
along with the laptop and the beeper, and head for the beach
unencumbered by technology. Last one to unplug is a rotten egg!
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't,'' says public relations kahuna George Regan, calling
from a golf course on the Cape. ``It's an addiction. It's like
being on a drug. I've been doing this since I was 24. I was Kevin
White's press secretary.''
</P>
<P>
   Gloria Larson, partner at Foley, Hoag &AMP; Eliot, is just as bad.
``I've been fighting it, but so far have made no inroads. On a
picture-perfect day on St. Bart's I was on a four-hour conference
call. I'd take a book to the beach and around noon I'd say, `Oh
it's time to escape the noonday sun.' Then I'd go back to the room
and return 18 phone calls. It's a personality problem. It's on a
DNA chip.''
</P>
<P>
   Pat Moscaritolo, president and chief executive of the Greater
Boston Convention &AMP; Visitors Bureau, sets no example of
uncontrolled joie de vivre for the tourists, either. He takes his
laptop and cell phone wherever he goes so he can check in with the
office to find out what he's missing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the rule today, not the exception,'' he says. ``If you're
in business, your clients expect you to keep in touch. And you can,
because with e-mail you can check in 24 hours a day no matter what
continent you're on.''
</P>
<P>
   Is this efficiency or an update of Dante? Maybe it's time to
find a nice cave and move in for a couple of weeks. Pack nothing
that blinks or beeps. Send no pigeons to the office. Live on the
edge _ give up CNBC.
</P>
<P>
   Not likely, says Moscaritolo _ if there were a cave experience
it would probably be tied to a business trip because vacations are
often ``add ons'' today, afterthoughts following a convention or
other work-related travel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing the re-engineering of life,'' he says. ``In the
1950s, the factories closed up and the family piled in the station
wagon for vacation. Today, Mom comes to Boston for a medical
meeting and extends her stay a few days so that Dad and the kids
can fly up to do the museums. Later in the summer, Dad attends a
telecommunications meeting in another city and Mom flies up with
the kids for a few days. It's very hard to get everyone on the same
page for a vacation. The kids are busy, too, with their schedules
and don't want to go away.''
</P>
<P>
   So, buckle little Johnny firmly into his car seat and tell him
he's going to have fun at the cottage on the lake or else. How bad
could it be, once he stops screaming for his soccer team?
</P>
<P>
   How much would the economy suffer if America blew the whistle on
work the way the French do in August? What if we as a nation
decided to bring back that unfettered ``can't be reached until
after Labor Day'' vacation?
</P>
<P>
   ``All the cardiologists would go broke,'' says David Porter, who
runs Baystate Financial Services in Boston. When he goes on an
11-day baseball park tour with his son this summer, he will check
his e-mail every night and carry his cell phone. ``I can call
anywhere in the country with no roaming charges.'' Porter, who has
a house in Maine, has also installed a phone line at his dock.
</P>
<P>
   ``The electronics drive this,'' he says. ``People want instant
access to things.''
</P>
<P>
   Do we, really, or did progress simply drop on our heads? Are we
more like the sorcerer's apprentice than we would like to admit?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's insecurity,'' says one businessman of his compulsion to
stay connected. ``It's nervousness.''
</P>
<P>
   We could all take a page from Paul Guzzi, president and chief
executive of the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce, who has
attained the serenity of the Buddha when it comes to getting away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know whether it's age or mellowing or just having
confidence in other people, but I feel no need to stay in touch,''
he says. ``If there's an emergency, people know how to contact me.
This is a very different attitude for me than in my past work
lives.''
</P>
<P>
   The man gets the golden inner tube award. And he says he knows
other executives who think the same way. Here's hoping they start a
movement _ as long as nobody has to use a cell phone to do it.

BOOK ADDS ANOTHER CHAPTER TO GIULIANI'S TRAVAILS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The bad tidings just get deeper and darker for Mayor
Rudolph W. Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Three months ago, he was a favorite in the nation's hottest US
Senate race, which _ had he won _ could have placed him on track to
the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Now, his friends and foes wonder whether Giuliani, a Republican,
has a political future at all.
</P>
<P>
   The latest splash _ a new book that paints his late father as a
Mafia thug and challenges his own claims about his accomplishments
as mayor _ intensifies the riptide.
</P>
<P>
   There was the quadruple-whammy of May _ in which he announced he
had prostate cancer, revealed he had a mistress, saw his wife tell
reporters that their marriage had been destroyed by his earlier
fling with a City Hall aide, and finally withdrew from his Senate
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Before that, his insensitive handling of the police killing of
Patrick Dorismond _ coming on top of his tepid response to the
police killing of Amadou Diallo _ tainted his crime-fighting
legacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't wish the year he's had on anyone,'' said George
Arzt, a Democratic political consultant.
</P>
<P>
   The new round of scrutiny set off by the book _ ``Rudy! An
Investigative Biography of Rudolph Giuliani,'' by Village Voice
reporter Wayne Barrett, due to hit stores this week _ comes as the
mayor appears to be less powerful and prominent than at any time in
his six years in City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Koch, who was voted out of office in 1989 after three
terms as mayor and knows what final days are like, said Friday,
``People, when dealing with a lame duck, have no problem stepping
on his webbed feet. They don't fear retaliation.''
</P>
<P>
   When Giuliani leaves office at the end of next year, he will be
the first New York mayor to be forced out by a 1995 law that limits
all elected city officials to two terms.
</P>
<P>
   A well-known politician, one of Barrett's sources for the book,
said, ``So many people spoke out because they fear the mayor less
as his administration spirals to an end.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mayor was a very intimidating figure,'' he added. The
lashings against him now are due, in part, to the ``pent-up
irritation at the fearful hold he had, where no one could say
anything without triggering his wrath.''
</P>
<P>
   Many times, Giuliani has fired employees, held back city
contracts, or threatened reprisals when someone was caught
criticizing him or stealing too much of the limelight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keep in mind, this is a guy who says he's seen `The Godfather'
something like 80 times,'' one former political insider said. ``He
learned from that movie. He's governed through respect and fear.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, just as his secrets are spilling out and his days of power
are numbered, the fear is starting to subside.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, as Giuliani was getting ready to give a speech in
the Riverdale section of the Bronx, his staff called an Italian
restaurant in the neighborhood to make dinner reservations for his
entourage _ about 20 people.
</P>
<P>
   The restaurant's owner, Charles LaPresto, refused the request,
saying he found the mayor ``morally objectionable.''
</P>
<P>
   A Manhattan lawyer, whose clients have experienced Giuliani's
wrath, laughed when he read about it in the Daily News. ``Six
months ago,'' he said, ``this poor guy would have been up to his
eyeballs with city health inspectors, tax auditors, cops who won't
answer his call for help if he's robbed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't have refused the mayor,'' he said before he paused.
``If this guy gets away with it, maybe we all can.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, even now, most of Giuliani's critics will
talk about him only on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Norman Siegel, the head of the New York Civil Liberties Union
and a persistent thorn to Giuliani, said of the mayor, ``He's not
as dominating, not as visible as he used to be, he's less of an
imposing figure.''
</P>
<P>
   However, he added, ``I've had people in the past who were
unprepared to sign their names to a letter criticizing the mayor,
fearful that funding for their organizations might get cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people,'' Siegel said, ``are still afraid to sign their
names.''
</P>
<P>
   Arzt agreed: ``If you're asking if it's time to write his
political epitaph, the answer is `No.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Many political insiders _ Democrats and Republicans _ also doubt
Barrett's book will have much long-term impact on Giuliani's image
or future.
</P>
<P>
   Still, two prominent Republicans said the revelations might have
hurt had Giuliani stayed in the Senate race. He would have had to
answer the charges rather than brush them aside.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue wouldn't be that he had mob relatives,'' one insider
said. ``It would be the hypocrisy that the fact highlights.''
</P>
<P>
   Some saw hypocrisy in the mayor's response last week to
Barrett's disclosure about the Mafia past of his father, Harold.
``My father died 19 years ago,'' Giuliani said, ``and the details
of his life died with him.''
</P>
<P>
   One Republican adviser gasped, ``I couldn't believe he said
that, given the Dorismond situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Dorismond, an unarmed security guard, was killed in March by an
undercover police officer who mistook him for a drug dealer.
Giuliani's popularity tumbled when, instead of apologizing, he
released court-sealed records from more than a decade ago showing
that Dorismond had committed a crime as a teenager.
</P>
<P>
   Even the New York Post, normally a strong Giuliani supporter,
criticized the mayor. A cartoon Thursday shows Giuliani standing in
front of two tombstones _ his father's and Dorismond's _ and
saying, ``Do yuh mind Patrick, I'm trying to talk to my dad!! As I
was saying Pop, the details of your life died with you.''

ENERGY CRISIS? THERE'S ANGER TO SPARE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Everybody seems to agree that something must be done about the
fuel crisis, but what?
</P>
<P>
   Beg the OPEC countries to squeeze out a few billion more
barrels? Dig deep under the ocean floor for new sources of oil?
</P>
<P>
   These are stopgap solutions. The world supply of oil won't last
forever. The long-term answer lies in exploiting as many energy
sources as possible _ solar power, wind power, water power, steam
power, nuclear power, crystal power, Power Bars, the power to cloud
men's minds _ as well as certain hitherto little-considered power
sources, such as anger.
</P>
<P>
   Anger. Why not?
</P>
<P>
   It may sound crazy, but people probably said the same about
hydro power when it was first proposed, and look at the Hoover Dam.
</P>
<P>
   Every minute of every day, we, as a nation, generate massive
amounts of anger. Where does it go? Anybody who's studied
elementary physics knows all that energy doesn't just disappear. It
wafts around in the atmosphere, looking for trouble. Why not find a
way to harness its power for good instead of evil? And save money,
besides.
</P>
<P>
   Already teams of researchers are working quietly, as quietly as
possible given the circumstances, to find ways of using the power
of anger.
</P>
<P>
   It's the perfect energy source. It's cheap, convenient, and
environmentally sound.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, it's renewable. No matter what happens, we never
seem to run out of anger.
</P>
<P>
   Of course anger isn't always safe _ or clean. It's often
dangerous and messy, but every power source has its drawbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Converting anger to usable energy presents problems, not all of
them technological. Researchers have found some potential power
sources unwilling to cooperate. They understandably fear they'll
spontaneously combust, or that their brain waves will be twisted by
the powers of darkness, or that crop circles will appear on their
lawns and they'll end up on the cover of The Weekly World News, or
featured on ``Unexplained Mysteries.''
</P>
<P>
   Recent experiments involving guests on ``The Ricki Lake Show''
generated uneven results. Researchers found that some of these
subjects weren't really angry at all, but were faking it to get on
TV and embarrass their families. However, a minority of guests who
were genuinely mad generated enough energy to power a Belgian
waffle iron for almost three minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, some likely energy sources have turned nasty when
approached, frightening researchers, and frustrating them, too,
because they hate to see so much potential power going to waste.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for science, there's plenty of anger in the air just
about everyplace these days. At ATMs. In supermarkets. In doctors'
offices. Remember your last visit to the dermatologist? The anger
generated by you and all the other patients stuck there for hours
in the waiting room could have fueled a bus trip to Hartford and
back.
</P>
<P>
   With gasoline prices so high, there are lots of angry drivers on
the road, even more than usual. One team of scientists is working
on the high-priority project of converting road rage into energy to
fuel automobiles. Every driver soon could be his or her own power
source, lending new meaning to the term ``human dynamo.''
</P>
<P>
   These researchers have been a little reluctant to test their
findings on highways because they have yet to find a way to store
accumulated anger energy. With no way to store power, drivers would
need to be in a constant fit to get their cars to move. But isn't
that the way it works now?

DRIVING MR. ALBERT 
By Michael Paterniti. 
Dial Press. 224 pp. $18.95. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a reassuring illusion to believe that we know where we're
going and what will happen along the way. But who has not
encountered the Big Event, the unplanned occurrence that forever
changed our little plans and schemes?
</P>
<P>
   It became like that for every thinking person when, in 1905, a
flash of insight led Albert Einstein to the Theory of Relativity.
We thought we understood the universe, and then we saw we didn't.
It must have been like that for Einstein himself, too. He can't
have awakened that day and decided that he would revolutionize the
accepted tenets of physical existence. It just came, and his life
was different forever.
</P>
<P>
   It might also have been like that for Michael Paterniti, the
young Maine writer who has produced ``Driving Mr. Albert.'' It is
hard to imagine that his life's plan listed the day he would hear
about a guy who owned Einstein's brain, find him through incredible
happenstance, learn after befriending him that he had business out
West, offer to drive him and his cargo, and then write a book about
the trek.
</P>
<P>
   But that is what happened, and as with Einstein's theory _ sort
of, though only in a relative way _ we are all beneficiaries.
``Driving Mr. Albert'' is entertaining, absurd, real, weird, deep,
informative, silly, and slightly overdone. Above all, though, in a
world in which it seems that all the good ideas have been taken, it
is singular.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of this tale is the inscrutable Dr. Thomas Stoltz
Harvey, the 84-year-old keeper of the brain. The doctor doesn't
talk very much, and often is unresponsive when he does. Once when
given an A or B choice, for example, his answer is, ``Oh sure, that
would be nice.'' Given a second chance, the reply is ``Way-ell,
read good.'' He comes across as a genial enigma who leaves plenty
of space in between his lines that Paterniti seeks to fill, not
always credibly, with his own suppositions.
</P>
<P>
   When Paterniti found him, Harvey was working an extruding
machine in a plastics factory. But in 1955, Harvey was chief
pathologist at Princeton (N.J.) Hospital, where Einstein had gone
to die. Harvey was a last-minute substitution to do the autopsy, a
change that would alter his life forever.
</P>
<P>
   When Harvey came to the great thinker's brain, he removed it
almost on a whim and took it home, intending to study it for clues
to Einstein's genius. Ownership of the organ became a public issue,
and Harvey eventually lost his job _ though not the brain _ over
it. As the years passed, no studies resulted, and eventually,
Harvey melted back into obscurity.
</P>
<P>
   It's all part of the enigma: If there were no studies done, did
Harvey just have some ghoulish curiosity, or what? Paterniti leaves
it to readers to decide Harvey's motivation, and answers will vary.
But it seems safe to suggest that Harvey will be judged more
lightly than Dr. Henry Abrams, Einstein's ophthalmologist, who
removed Einstein's eyes. ``They were part of the brain, too, and I
wanted a keepsake,'' he told Paterniti.
</P>
<P>
   It's an outrageous comment that would seem too over the top if
it weren't true, a sensation the recurs throughout ``Driving Mr.
Albert.'' Another example of it is how Paterniti became a part of
the story. He thought the tale of someone having Einstein's brain
was just an urban myth, and he was telling it as such to his
landlord one day when the fellow said, ``Yeah, the guy with the
brain lives next to William in Lawrence, Kan.''
</P>
<P>
   What are the chances of that, paying rent to a guy who knew the
guy who lived near the guy? Infinitesimal, right? But it gets
better: What are the chances that the ``William'' of the story is
William Burroughs, the Beat writer? Outrageous, and yet routine.
</P>
<P>
   Such juicy details are a writer's dream, but ``Driving Mr.
Albert'' is more than a rote retelling. Each of Paterniti's choices
for layovers along the route brings with it new hilarity, or
frivolity, or oddity. Their visit with Burroughs, for example, is
worthwhile just for this Burroughs line, addressed to Harvey:
``What keeps the old alive, Dr. Senegal, is that we learn to be
evil.''
</P>
<P>
   While piloting their rented Buick Skylark, Paterniti never loses
sight of the basic absurdity of driving cross-country with a brain
in the back. He has to suppress the persistent impulse to blurt out
_ in drive-throughs, for example _ ``We have Einstein's brains in
the trunk!''
</P>
<P>
   When they arrive in Las Vegas (can you say ``Rain Man''?), he
feels the need to mingle, but takes it on the chin when he leads
with the brain: ``I'm traveling with the doctor who owns Einstein's
brain, and we're going to California to give it to Einstein's
daughter,'' he tells an elderly couple, who flee the table in the
next instant. It's ``weirdly empowering,'' Paterniti writes, ``this
sudden ability to repel people.'' Before long, he's been barred
from the casino.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a relationship that grows over months, Harvey never
appears to think of Paterniti as more than his chauffeur. Paterniti
has seen the brain only once, in a dingy safe-house, but on the
trip, Harvey deflects Paterniti's entreaties to get a better look.
At first it's just rankling, but it becomes maddening when he
returns from their first moments apart, a short break to do laundry
at the New Mexico home of Paterniti's best friends, and learns that
Harvey had shown it to them!
</P>
<P>
   ``Driving Mr. Albert'' has few jangling pieces, but one of them
is Paterniti's love story, which is either overblown or poorly
established. More than once, he voices the fear that his wife,
writer Sara Corbett, won't be there when he gets back. But even
upon rereading the setup, there seems to be no reason for the worry
beyond an attempt at melodrama. Even so, his cleverness shines
when, at the end of a phone call in which he and Corbett haven't
particularly connected, he vivifies a phrase one hears all the
time: ``Please hang up and try again.'' Much of his play with the
language is similarly successful, though when he calls Einstein
``the original cosmic slacker,'' it's hard to understand what he's
talking about.
</P>
<P>
   Paterniti relates early on that this won't be his first grand
sojourn; he has up and left everything behind more than once, a
habit that may explain his fears for his relationship. What it
certainly explains is his keen awareness of the transformative
nature of travel, ``those moments in transit when you ride in the
bubble of your own thoughts.''
</P>
<P>
   Those transformations, of course, come in all sizes, often
commensurate with the reach of the trek, whether it is an 11-day
sprint across America or our traversesthrough the universe.

KNOWING YOUR CREDIT SCORE

<TEXT>
<P>
   For decades, credit scores have been a key factor in determining
whether Americans can borrow money, rent apartments, find
insurance, and, in some cases, land jobs. Still, the three-digit
numbers are little known and even less understood by the millions
whose lives they affect.
</P>
<P>
   That could be about to change.
</P>
<P>
   Fair, Isaac &AMP; Co., the California firm that invented credit
scoring 40 years ago and continues to dominate the industry, plans
to offer individual scores online by the end of the summer.
Already, Fair, Isaac has begun lifting the veil that kept secret
not only the scores themselves, but how they are calculated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can only say it's about time,'' said Keith Gumbinger, vice
president of HSH Associates, a research firm in Butler, N.J. ``A
scoring model that doesn't allow people to have some idea of how
they're being viewed is inherently anti-consumer.''
</P>
<P>
   As recently as five weeks ago, Fair, Isaac defended its
secretive system _ which ranks each person's creditworthiness on a
scale from 300 to 900 _ as necessary to keep consumers honest.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the point is to create a single number that
represents how likely people are to repay their debts. If people
know how the scoring works, they might change their behavior just
long enough to increase the number, borrow money, and then return
to their old ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``Credit scores have proven to be a reliable indicator of
borrower behavior,'' said Gail Hayes, president of DeWolfe
Mortgage, in Lexington, Mass. ``It's possible that would change if
you make the scores available (to the public), although I don't
think it's likely.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, it became increasingly clear in recent months that
Fair, Isaac had little choice but to spill the beans.
</P>
<P>
   In February, the company threatened to cut off Internet broker
E-Loan unless it stopped giving mortgage shoppers their credit
scores. Fair, Isaac said the practice violated its contract with
credit bureaus, which allows people to receive their scores only
after they have applied for a loan and only from the lender to
which they applied.
</P>
<P>
   When E-Loan acquiesced after a three-month fight, critics of
Fair, Isaac's covert scoring process came out of the woodwork.
</P>
<P>
   The California Senate passed a bill requiring the release of
credit scores to the public. Several members of Congress suggested
similar legislation on the federal level, and consumer groups
stepped up their drumbeat of protests against secret scores.
</P>
<P>
   Even some of Fair, Isaac's competitors jumped on the bandwagon.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago-based Trans Union Corp., for example, unveiled plans to
create its own credit-scoring system, sell individual scores, and
make the numbers available on its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   And both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the quasi-governmental
agencies that together underwrite more than two-thirds of the
mortgages nationwide, made their computer programs open to the
public for the first time. Fannie Mae said it would stop using
Fair, Isaac's numbers altogether in its automated lending system.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were in danger of becoming irrelevant,'' Gumbinger said
of Fair, Isaac. ``So they made a rational business decision to
reverse course and go after the direct-to-consumer market.''
</P>
<P>
   On June 8, the company made the criteria behind its scores
public for the first time, with an explanation of how much weight
each factor carries. (The details are available online at
www.fairisaac.com.)
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman Craig Watts said Fair, Isaac plans to launch the
second phase of the public rollout later this month. At that point,
people who have been given their credit scores by a lender can
visit the Fair, Isaac Web site, plug in the score (along with
``reason codes'' that explain low scores), and receive an
explanation of what the number means and how to improve it over
time.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to create a separate Web site that would allow
people to type in their name and Social Security number, and then
receive their credit score on the spot. But that requires the
creation of a new, secure, site, and renegotiation of Fair, Isaac's
contracts with lenders and credit bureaus.
</P>
<P>
   Watts said no firm timetable has been set for that final stage
of the rollout, although ``we'd like to get it up and running by
late summer.'' He also said the company hasn't decided if it will
charge $8.50 per score, as credit bureaus do for their reports, but
it won't be a free service.
</P>
<P>
   Fair, Isaac's change of heart over public disclosure is notable
because, despite the recent brouhaha, its scores are still widely
used. The scores have become more prevalent in recent years, in
fact, as companies look for a quicker and easier way to gauge
personal responsibility and trustworthiness than reading through
multipage credit histories.
</P>
<P>
   Fair, Isaac claims its numbers are used in 75 percent of
mortgage-lending decisions nationwide. Insurance companies and
landlords also routinely take a look at them, and some employers
check them during the hiring process.
</P>
<P>
   How much, though, will knowing your credit score change things?
</P>
<P>
   ``A high score is still a high score, and a low score is still a
low score,'' said Hayes, of DeWolfe Mortgage. ``People with higher
scores are going to get better deals, whether they know it or
not.''
</P>
<P>
   Another limitation is the fact that the same credit score means
different things to different people.
</P>
<P>
   In general, the higher your score the better. A score of 620,
though, might not be high enough to secure a bank's lowest interest
rate on a loan, even though it was enough to get you past the
credit check on a job application or apartment rental. Different
banks, too, are likely to look at a 620 very differently.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Gumbinger, of HSH Associates, said knowing the number can
tip the balance of power during a negotiation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Knowing your score when you pick up the phone allows you to go
from mortgage lender to mortgage lender, for example, saying `I'm a
620 and the last guy offered me such and such,' '' Gumbinger said.
``You find out if they can beat it, and you go to the next name on
the list.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom O'Connor would be happy to do exactly that. A civil engineer
with a Boston firm, O'Connor said he would love to know his credit
score before he jumps into the housing market this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've gone to two different brokers to see what I can afford,
and been given totally different numbers,'' O'Connor said. ``I
would definitely be interested in getting information that would
let me shop around easier, and compare apples to apples.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Ellis Smith, publisher of the ``Privacy Journal,'' said
the public release of credit scores would also shed light on the
quirks of the scoring system and make it harder for lenders to turn
down people just because they're low-income or from low-income
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``This appears to be part of a trend toward giving people more
access to information about themselves,'' Smith said. ``If so, it
has to be a good thing.''

<P>
   Time is the biggest enemy of most consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Most people want to find the right credit card or the best
long-distance provider, but because of the time it takes to do the
research they often end up staying with their existing company or
going with the intriguing offer that comes in the mail.
</P>
<P>
   Three Web sites _ Lowermybills.com of Los Angeles,
Omnichoice.com of Wayne, Pa., and GetConnected.com of Boston _ are
among many trying to make choosing a service provider easy, or at
least easier.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Essential.com of Burlington or Servisense of Newton,
which actually sell a stable of services to customers and bill them
directly, these three companies serve strictly as information
intermediaries. They attempt to give you the information you need
to make a wise choice.
</P>
<P>
   Lowermybills is the most ambitious, enlisting other Web sites
such as E-Loan and energyguide.com to provide information in more
than 10 categories, ranging from electricity to credit cards.
Omnichoice and GetConnected have a slightly narrower reach,
focusing primarily on telecommunications services.
</P>
<P>
   The three companies have different philosophies. Lowermybills
asks visitors to its site few questions about their usage patterns
and tends to provide a generic, edited list of solutions to any
query. Ask about high-speed Internet access, for example, and
Lowermybills gives you seven service options from three companies.
All of the companies provided digital subscriber line, or DSL,
service. None offered cable modems.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not really interested in all of the companies out
there,'' said chief executive Matthew Coffin. ``People only want up
to about six choices. Anything beyond that is seen as an
annoyance.''
</P>
<P>
   Omnichoice tries to customize its answers for each customer. It
asks users to answer questions that narrow the range of options and
then ranks the answers one through 10. ``We give you an answer, not
a bunch of options,'' said Tom Borger, chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   GetConnected's philosophy seems to be a blend of what
Lowermybills and Omnichoice do. It lets the user decide whether he
wants a large unedited list of options or a smaller list whittled
down to fit certain preferences.
</P>
<P>
   All of the sites would be useful to people who are moving, who
are dissatisfied with their current providers, who are thinking
about buying a cellular phone and want to explore their options, or
who just want to see if there's a better deal out there for long
distance.
</P>
<P>
   For example, I'm looking for a credit card with no annual fee
that maximizes rewards. Lowermybills turned me on to the American
Express platinum cash rebate card, which offers 2 percent cash back
when you carry a balance and 1.5 percent when you don't. Not bad.
</P>
<P>
   But I also discovered that some of these sites are prisoners of
their own business models. They have to be national in scope to
bring in a large volume of customers, but going national sometimes
means being out of touch locally.
</P>
<P>
   Lowermybills, for example, offers an auto insurance category
through Insweb.com that allows users to shop for the best deal. In
Massachusetts, however, all rates are set by state regulators and
the only pricing variable is the size of good-driver or group
discounts.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Lowermybills/Insweb site doesn't analyze the various
discounts. With only two participating Massachusetts auto insurers,
the site is practically useless to Bay State residents. (To its
credit, the site didn't pretend it was useful but it did make me
spend 15 minutes filling out forms only to be told I couldn't be
helped.)
</P>
<P>
   All three sites make their money when consumers go through them
to sign up with one of the providers. Each Web site insists its
information is unbiased, offering information on service providers
even if the provider isn't paying the Web site a referral fee. ``If
it's out there, we want to offer it,'' said Adam Mersky, a
spokesman for GetConnected.
</P>
<P>
   But you have to wonder sometimes. Neither Omnichoice nor
Lowermybills listed AT&AMP;T, formerly MediaOne, as a high-speed
Internet service option in Massachusetts. Tell that to the
company's thousands of customers in this area. (Both companies told
me they plan to add MediaOne in the future.)
</P>
<P>
   The sites also seem to have a hard time taking into account
issues beyond price. How do you evaluate a company's reputation for
service and reliability? How do you factor in the convenience and
cost savings of bundling many services together with one provider?
</P>
<P>
   Of the three sites I reviewed, I preferred Omnichoice's
approach. But I felt GetConnected did the best overall job.
GetConnected seemed to offer the most comprehensive information and
offered other helpful extras as well. It had a feature on bundled
services and even let users rate service providers so other
visitors to the Web site could get a sense of reliability.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Odds &AMP; Ends
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Driving, movies. The American Automobile Association had two
interesting items in its July newsletter to members. One item
reported that the average cost of driving a car is now 49.1 cents
per mile, up 2.1 cents from last year, primarily because of higher
fuel prices and rising new vehicle depreciation and finance costs.
The newsletter also offered members discounted movie ticket
packets: $24 gets you four tickets to a Showcase Cinema and $21
gets you four tickets to a General Cinema. At the new Fenway
General Cinema, where adult tickets cost $9, the discount amounts
to $15.
</P>
<P>
   Item pricing. Last week's column on the item-pricing debate
generated responses across the lot. Some readers passed along the
names of other retailers that don't item price (Wal-Mart); others
suggested alternative approaches (bar code readers every 20 feet);
and some suggested government shouldn't be involved at all. Bill
Beasley, who used to live in Michigan, said he didn't sense great
support for item-pricing there, despite the attorney general's
claims to the contrary. By the way, the Michigan attorney general
last week called OfficeMax the worst-ever violator of the state's
item-pricing law and prepared to sue.

IN MEXICO, THE CHANGE IS JUST BEGINNING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD CHACON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Anyone who thinks last Sunday's historic elections
were only about presidential politics should try telling that to
Guadalupe Gutierrez Cantu.
</P>
<P>
   The 42-year-old housewife spent nearly a half-hour on Wednesday
afternoon arguing with a sales clerk at a Mexico City department
store. Her complaint: That her credit card was being wrongly
rejected by the store's computers.
</P>
<P>
   Gutierrez wouldn't give up. She insisted the problem was with
the store's system, not her card, and lectured a manager on the
basics of customer service. Finally, he checked with her bank. She
was right.
</P>
<P>
   When asked by a stranger who witnessed the scene whom she voted
for for president, Gutierrez answered Vicente Fox, the conservative
opposition candidate whose victory last week ousted the ruling
party for the first time in more than seven decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the way he talks and he doesn't put up with any
games,'' Gutierrez said. ``Mexicans are tired of being told what's
good and bad. We're ready to have more control over our own
lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to Mexico 2000. This country of traditions, rituals, and
authoritarian governments is giving way to a new attitude that
demands accountability, responsiveness, and, above all, change.
Last week's historic vote was perhaps the most dramatic expression
that Mexicans no longer want to be told what to do by their
government. But banks, churches, telephone companies, cable TV
operators, and car dealers had better take notice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an extremely liberating feeling, like a great weight has
been lifted from our chest,'' said Homero Aridjis, the renowned
Mexican poet. ``There is a new sense of control and it's the kind
of revolution that will be felt throughout the society.''
</P>
<P>
   To Aridjis and other of his countrymen, Mexico's electoral
revolt at the ballot box was driven by a collective shame over the
condition of the country and a frustration with the oligarchy of
elite, closely related families that for years has controlled the
ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mexico is a country that moves slowly to act,'' the poet
added. ``It took us 300 years to revolt against Spain, another 100
before we overthrew a dictator in the Mexican Revolution, and
another 70 years before we stood up against the PRI. This time it
was a rebellion by the middle class.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week's revolt was stunning for its complete rejection of
the PRI, which not only lost its first presidential race ever, but
also lost its majority in both houses of Congress, was badly beaten
in the Mexico City mayor's race, and beaten as well in two
gubernatorial contests.
</P>
<P>
   But the victory by Fox's National Action Party, or PAN, may be
less about partisanship than the results suggest, said Roderic Ai
Camp, a Mexico specialist at Claremont McKenna College in
California, and it could provide a key lesson for the candidates in
this year's US presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   The PAN is Mexico's second largest political party, with a core
of roughly 20 percent of Mexico's 59 million voters. Fox's campaign
received 42 percent of votes, meaning that most of his support came
from the PRI and other party members.
</P>
<P>
   ``This says that you can join a political movement instead of a
party and change results, even presidents,'' Camp said. ``It'll
change the way people look at participating in politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Since its creation in 1929 as an alliance of competing factions
from the Mexican Revolution, the PRI has dictated nearly every
facet of Mexican life. It tried to shut out the Roman Catholic
Church. Through its control of government, it created petroleum,
telephone, and banking monopolies that predetermined prices for
customers. And it demanded votes rather than court them.
</P>
<P>
   The first signs of modern civil unrest against this rigid system
appeared in 1968, when hundreds of students protested against
President Gustavo Diaz Ordaz just before the opening of the Olympic
Games in Mexico City. The government killed hundreds of protesters
in a massacre that is still remembered annually.
</P>
<P>
   A more recent episode of widespread unhappiness with the PRI
government, as noted by Susan Eckstein, Boston University
sociologist and Mexico specialist, was the massive 1985 earthquake
that killed thousands in the capital. Government delays in
reconstructing damaged homes left scores of angry families
homeless.
</P>
<P>
   ``The victims refused to listen to the government and formed
their own groups that demanded they listen to their demands for
more low-income housing,'' said Eckstein, an author who has written
on social movements in Latin America. ``People realize they are no
longer dependents of the party or the government or any other
institution that doesn't respond to their needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Other factors have also contributed to building the new Mexico,
but none more important than information. The country's two main
television networks, Televisa and Azteca, compete fiercely against
each other daily to uncover government mistakes or neglect.
</P>
<P>
   Talk radio has flooded Mexican airwaves. Mexico's newspapers,
once safely in the pocket of government officials, are much more
aggressive today. And the Internet now allows quick access to
everything, from the indigenous Zapatista rebels in Chiapas state
to government statistics that once took months to wrestle away from
stingy bureaucrats.
</P>
<P>
   Businesses have also changed for the more demanding Mexican
customer. Banks now lure new customers with promotions for new cars
or computers. There are now as many Wal-Marts, Price Clubs, and
Sam's in Mexico City as there are in some US cities. And telephone
service, which was privatized about 20 years ago, offers clients a
choice in long distance and cellular companies.
</P>
<P>
   Not everything is perfect. Credit remains both hard to get and
prohibitively expensive _ with annual interest rates on a credit
card around 30 percent _ for most residents. And Mexico's
overpriced gasoline still comes from a state-run monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   And, for all its new attitudes and promise of a new,
customer-oriented society, Mexico remains a traditional and
conservative country, one that takes change at its own pace, even
with a charismatic, boot-wearing, straight-talking rancher and
former Coca-Cola executive leading the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the same values about families and work, but now we
have choices, especially in our government,'' said Aridjis, the
poet. ``And now we'll demand accountability and attention, not just
from our president but from everyone else in Mexico.''

NEW, TELEGENIC PRESENCE GIVES CONSERVATIVES HOPE IN CANADA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. JOHN'S, Newfoundland _ Canada's conservative movement, long
dismissed as toothless, is suddenly flashing sharp fangs with the
emergence of a vigorous, telegenic, and articulate new leader at
the helm of what may prove to be Canada's first formidable modern
political party of the right.
</P>
<P>
   Stockwell Day, 49, the former provincial treasurer of Alberta,
who until six months ago was a virtual unknown outside of his home
province, scored an upset victory Saturday to win control of the
Canadian Alliance, the fledgling party that already is the second
most powerful in Canada _ after the governing Liberal Party _ since
it inherited the parliamentary seats of the defunct Reform Party.
</P>
<P>
   With the emergence of a conservative leader attractive enough to
capture significant numbers of votes across Canada, not just in the
right-leaning western provinces, the country appears headed for its
most bruising political showdown in years. Day will challenge Prime
Minister Jean Chretien, a 66-year-old Quebecer, in national
elections expected to be called this fall or early next spring.
</P>
<P>
   Chretien's allies wasted no time Sunday casting the upstart as a
Bible-thumping, gay-bashing, ``American-style'' right-winger. Day
makes no secret of his deep Christian faith, but the ``homophobic''
tag _ much ballyhooed in the media _ seems to be based entirely on
his rather mild opposition to gay marriage, which is hardly a
burning issue in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Strangely, perhaps, Day's muscular good looks have made the
long-married, strait-laced father of three a popular pinup for
homosexual men. According to press reports, photos of Day in
tight-fitting martial arts garb _ he is a fitness zealot _ are all
the rage in gay bars and gyms across Canada, with no irony
intended.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, because of his charisma and ability to communicate,
many analysts compare Day to former prime minister Pierre Elliott
Trudeau, although there is no similarity in their politics.
</P>
<P>
   Day is a fiscal conservative who wants to slash government
expenditures in a country where a national health system, generous
European-style welfare programs and other social spending mean that
Canadians fork out far more in taxes than their neighbors in the
United States. He also wants to beef up the country's
disintegrating military forces and toughen the criminal code.
</P>
<P>
   ``My message has been consistent,'' Day said. ``Tax reform for
families, individuals, and business. Increased health funding, and
resources to the armed forces. Fix the criminal justice system.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Canadian media have reported almost obsessively on Day's
reservations about gay marriage and his religious objections to
abortion (he has stated repeatedly that he has no interest in
making abortion, legal in Canada, into a political issue). Fairly
typical of the news coverage was last week's issue of Maclean's,
the country's leading newsmagazine, which ran a photograph of Day
on the cover under the big headline, ``How Scary?''
</P>
<P>
   The second paragraph in the article stated, ``There's something,
well, vaguely American about him. He owns a .38 handgun.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Day's charisma and physical vigor make him a formidable
threat to Chretien. The prime minister has held power since 1993
and has said repeatedly that he will seek a third term, despite
public opinion surveys showing that Canadians are growing weary of
his competent but noticeably uninspired leadership and the fact
that many powerful figures within the Liberal Party are urging
Chretien to step aside in favor of a younger candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional wisdom has it that a serious conservative like Day
has no chance of winning a national election in Canada, a country
whose citizens seem to think that big government social spending,
high taxes, and light criminal penalties prove that their country
is more compassionate and enlightened than the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But, until a few weeks ago, conventional wisdom also held that
an obscure provincial treasurer from Alberta's Bible Belt had no
chance of defeating Preston Manning, 58, the prairie populist who
more or less singlehandedly created both the Canadian Alliance and
its predecessor party, the Western-based Reform Party.
</P>
<P>
   Although Manning is deeply respected within conservative
circles, his squeaky voice and preachy manner made him unpalatable
to many voters, especially in the crucial province of Ontario,
which holds 103 of the 301 seats in the House of Commons.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, alliance members seem to have acted with their heads
instead of their hearts, defying predictions and ousting Manning in
favor of the younger candidate because Day seems truly capable of
winning votes across Canada, rather than just whining about Liberal
Party dominance.
</P>
<P>
   ``He comes across as an approachable, sincere kind of person,''
said Thomas Flanagan, a professor of politics at the University of
Calgary. ``It doen't hurt that he's telegenic with a young, fresh
face.''

   COPENHAGEN _ Pushing 70, Ed Thigpen can still play a mean set of
drums.
</P>
<P>
   Which is no surprise, given that he once backed Ella Fitzgerald,
and that he was part of a trio that included Oscar Peterson on
piano and Ray Brown on bass.
</P>
<P>
   Like many aging jazzmen, Thigpen is a gentleman, a dignified
ambassador for his music. But when people here notice his accent
and remark that he is an American, Thigpen gently corrects them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I consider myself an international,'' the courtly drummer said
while sipping spring water at the Copenhagen JazzHouse between
sets.
</P>
<P>
   Thigpen has made Europe in general, and Denmark in particular,
his home for almost 30 years. Europe is a common choice for jazz
artists who say the music is appreciated more outside their _ and
jazz's _ homeland in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``The US denies itself its own heritage,'' Thigpen said.
</P>
<P>
   For black jazz artists, in particular, Europe offers a more
tolerant venue. But race is only one part of the equation. Respect,
says Thigpen, is key. So is the quality of life.
</P>
<P>
   Thigpen admires the socialism of West European democracies such
as Denmark, where people fork over roughly half of their income to
pay for a generous welfare system that dramatically narrows the gap
between rich and poor, and that ensures decent housing, education,
and health care for all.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're more civilized over here,'' Thigpen said, shrugging.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for example, the way Carlsberg, the biggest brewer in
Denmark, underwrites the arts. Carlsberg Breweries, which also owns
the other big beer here, Tuborg, donates about $21 million annually
to Danish arts and sciences. An arm of the brewery, the New
Carlsberg Foundation, donates about $7 million to visual arts each
year.
</P>
<P>
   Carlsberg not only sponsors the annual jazz festival here,
Tuborg also subsidizes the JazzHouse to showcase jazz throughout
the year.
</P>
<P>
   It was poignantly ironic that last week, Ed Thigpen and his band
played a tribute at the JazzHouse to Ernie Wilkins, a St. Louis
native and jazzman who lived, played and recently died in
Copenhagen. Like the legendary Miles Davis, Wilkins hailed from the
home of the King of Beers in America, but while Anheuser-Busch, the
brewers of Budweiser, dwarfs Carlsberg in profits, it doesn't
support jazz like the Danish brewers do, Thigpen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``American business looks at the arts differently than
Europeans, and that's one reason you see jazz supported more over
here, not just by business, but by the government, too,'' Thigpen
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Danish parliament has voted to fund more jazz venues and to
provide more support for existing ones, like JazzHouse. JazzHouse
managers say the club is secure at least for another three years
thanks to the government support.
</P>
<P>
   Danish jazz fans say government support, combined with business
philanthropy, is essential. Annette Flicker, a Dane who is married
to an American lawyer, said Copenhagen's jazz scene in the 1960s
and 1970s rivaled any other spot in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gordon Dexter played here, Kenny Drew. We had a place called
Jazzhouse Montmartre, and Stan Getz started it,'' said Flicker, 56.
</P>
<P>
   But in the 1980s, the once-flourishing jazz scene withered, and
many clubs closed. Now only a handful, like the upscale JazzHouse
and the down-and-dirty La Fontaine, provide a nightly fix for jazz
addicts such as Jens Esmann, 54.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't what it used to be, but on a night like tonight, when
you can see the great Ed Thigpen, no one's complaining.''
</P>
<P>
   Flicker said Danish jazz fans have a special place in their
heart for Thigpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ed moved here about 30 years ago and married a Danish girl.
Not long after, she died, and he was left to bring up the kids
alone. A lot of jazz fans feared that Ed would go back to America
to raise his kids, but he didn't. He stayed here. And he's much
loved for that, and for his music,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   As if on cue, Ed Thigpen called his Danish band on stage and
invoked the name of that gentle man from St. Louis named Ernie
Wilkins.
</P>
<P>
   ``God rest his soul,'' Thigpen said.
</P>
<P>
   And then the band began to wail.

VESSELS OF A PAINFUL PAST 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Darnell Williams won't be among the millions of
spectators gathered around Boston Harbor this week to view the
colorful Tall Ships.
</P>
<P>
   Williams will boycott the event because, when he looks at the
great vessels, he doesn't see majesty; he sees haunting icons of
the slave trade. When the trade reached its peak, an armada of
sailing ships plied the Atlantic Ocean bound for the Americas, with
human cargo chained below deck.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a person of conscience, you look at these ships and it
forces you to think'' of the tens of millions who died during the
Middle Passage, said Williams, who heads the NAACP's Springfield,
Mass. chapter. ``These ships drum up negative images of how our
people arrived in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams is not alone in his opposition to Sail Boston 2000, the
11-day spectacle featuring 134 ships from 92 countries and expected
to attract 3 million visitors to the city. Dozens of New England
blacks interviewed in recent weeks by the Globe have also expressed
similar discomfort with the celebration.
</P>
<P>
   But those sentiments are by no means unanimous. Richard Neuman
of Harvard University's W.E.B Du Bois Research Institute says that
while he understands how the ships could symbolize slavery to some
blacks, to others, they represent a ``little-known, strong heritage
of free black sailors to whom the ships have become a memorial.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Johnson Jr., a professor of Africana Studies at the
University of Massachussetts at Boston, agrees with Neuman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at the Tall Ships from the perspective of those
African-Americans who engaged in maritime occupations,'' said
Johnson, pointing out the accomplishments of Louis Temple, a New
Bedford blacksmith who invented the toggle harpoon. ``This issue is
not black and white, although I can certainly understand the
sensitivity to the Tall Ships by some.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee Charlton, president of the New Bedford NAACP, and Sail
Boston 2000 organizers are quick to point out that all of the ships
featured in this year's festivities were built after 1940, more
than 100 years after the transport of slaves to the United States
ended.
</P>
<P>
   But don't tell that to George Lindsey, 67, a retired
schoolteacher who lives in Boston. He is angered by what he says
the ships represent.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is purely a symbolic issue for me,'' he said. ``When it
comes to black folks, there's a lack of sensitivity for our history
and culture. We're still dealing with the fallout from slavery and
these ships are just horrible, horrible, reminders.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Carolyn Richardson, 28, of Boston. ``It's appropriate that
as a society we become aware of the issues that offend people,''
she said. ``It's not a matter of being politically correct. It's
about being respectful. If there are some blacks who find the ships
offensive, I think they shouldn't sail.''
</P>
<P>
   That kind of comment frustrates Sail Boston 2000 officials.
After scattered protests during the Tall Ships celebration in 1992,
organizers said they made a concerted effort to reach out to
minorities. More than half of this year's vendors at commemoration
events are operated by minorities, and a minority-owned
communications firm has been hired to spread the word about the
Tall Ships in neighborhoods largely populated by black and Latino
residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sail Boston is proud to boast the inclusion of all minority
groups in all aspects of the Sail Boston 2000 experience,'' said a
statement by Dusty Rhodes, president of Sail Boston 2000. ``As the
majority of the events involved in Sail Boston 2000 are free, Sail
Boston welcomes people of all socioeconomic backgrounds to
experience the glory of the Tall Ships.''
</P>
<P>
   But Colette Phillips, who was hired to help publicize the event
throughout the minority community, said that she is aware that a
``perception problem'' exists among many blacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand the concerns,'' she said. ``But we're trying to
get people to realize that this is a multicultural event. It's
bigger than any one of us, and the goal here is to celebrate global
diversity.''
</P>
<P>
   But to Charlton, opposition to this year's festivities makes no
sense. He's an admirer of the Tall Ships and watched them sail into
Boston in 1992 during the 500th anniversary commemoration of
Christopher Columbus's voyage across the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, Tall Ships was a means of commerce, so some were used to
transport slaves. But I don't know how you could be opposed to all
Tall Ships because of that fact,'' he said. ``Hitler supported the
Volkswagen, and I happen to love the car. Does that make me a
supporter of Hitler? Of course not.''
</P>
<P>
   Other blacks said that the time spent protesting the Tall Ships'
arrival, could be better utilized rallying for other causes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can understand wanting to take down the Confederate flag in
South Carolina, but I don't understand how you can knock the whole
Tall Ship industry,'' said John Bynoe, who heads the Massachusetts
Prince Hall Grand Lodge, the largest black Masonic group in the
country.``I personally think the ships are beautiful. The issue of
slavery has never crossed my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who will not be attending the Tall Ships festivities said
that they will take time to educate their children about the evils
of slavery in America.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that when the average black person thinks
of the Fourth of July or these other freedom celebrations, it's not
a time for us to celebrate,'' said Williams. ``It is more a
recognition of a period of dehumanization and degradation.''

EVANGELICALS UNDERGO A PRAGMATIC CONVERSION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID M. SHRIBMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Republicans converge on Philadelphia this month
to begin their quadrennial national convention _ and a quadrennial
debate over whether religious conservatives are too powerful, too
extreme, and too visible a part of the GOP coalition.
</P>
<P>
   This year the debate may be over before it begins. And the
answers will be: no, no, and no.
</P>
<P>
   The convention that will nominate as the party's presidential
candidate Governor George W. Bush of Texas _ who speaks openly of
his dramatic personal religious experience _ will include more
evangelical delegates than the conventions that nominated his
father for president in 1988 and for vice president in 1980 and
1984.
</P>
<P>
   And yet the likelihood that the party will be rent by disputes
over abortion is far slimmer; the chance that the GOP will give the
Democrats an opportunity to paint their rivals as ``extremists'' is
far smaller; and the probability that the phrase ``culture wars'' _
the two words echoed ominously throughout the Houston convention,
perhaps destroying President Bush's chances for reelection in 1992
_ will be heard is near zero.
</P>
<P>
   The explanation is not simply that this is, to choose another
phrase redolent of the Bush years, a ``kinder, gentler'' generation
of religious conservatives. Evangelicals have changed, to be sure,
but so have the party and the country.
</P>
<P>
   The Philadelphia Republicans will care about abortion _ not a
syllable of the party's traditional language will be changed when
the first platform draft is circulated _ but they will care more
about winning the election.
</P>
<P>
   ``The evangelicals you will see on television at the Republican
convention will be, above all, pragmatists,'' says James Guth, the
Furman University specialist on religious conservatives. ``These
are political people. . . . The kind of evangelicals who became
Bush delegates, even in a place like South Carolina, are the kind
who know how to run in elections and to win elections.''
</P>
<P>
   For Republicans _ who have watched a Democratic president retain
high approval ratings despite repeated bungles and worse, and then,
even more galling, saw him capitalize on such GOP issues as
overhauling welfare and balancing the budget _ the Clinton years
have been difficult enough. But for religious conservatives, these
years have been downright wretched. They watched the president
survive a personal scandal that was an affront to the values _
personal integrity, the sanctity of marriage _ that they hold
dearest.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, religious conservatives are confident enough in the
antiabortion-rights convictions of Governor Bush that they are
willing to keep in the background in Philadelphia. For their part,
the dwindling band of GOP moderates who support abortion rights are
willing to hold their tongues in the hope that Bush will end
Democratic control of the White House and, once installed as
president, will not assume an aggressive antiabortion posture.
</P>
<P>
   So far the tacit pact of silence has held. The two Republican
platform hearings, held far from the madding crowd in Dayton, Ohio,
and Billings, Mont., have been almost serene compared with sessions
held four years ago in San Diego. Religious conservatives have even
signaled to Bush that they would not rebel if he chose a running
mate like Governor Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania, who supports some
abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   This pact of tolerance _ a word that presidential candidate Bob
Dole tried to insert into the GOP platform four years ago before
backing away _ comes as political scientists gain new insights into
the role and political behavior of religious conservatives in
American elections.
</P>
<P>
   These findings, based on voter interviews and surveys, show that
religious conservatives are at once more prominent a part of the
Republican coalition and less out of synch with mainstream American
values than politial professionals once believed.
</P>
<P>
   A study undertaken this spring by the Survey Research Center at
the University of Akron, for example, shows that no group of
Americans _ not even Mormons, traditionally regarded as the most
Republican religious group in the country _ favors Bush more than
do orthodox white evangelicals. That group, according to the
center's Survey of Religion and Politics, chooses Bush over Vice
President Al Gore, himself a Southern Baptist, by a margin of 77
percent to 23. Roman Catholics, by contrast, split almost evenly,
with Jews (a far smaller segment of the population) favoring Gore
by a 72-28 margin.
</P>
<P>
   These evangelical voters were far more likely to have supported
the president's impeachment than any other group, were much more
supportive of independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr _ and,
tellingly, take a far less rosy view of the president's performance
on the economy than any other group. (``Religion,'' Guth explains,
``shapes how people look at other issues, including the economy.'')
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, a separate new study, based on 2,600
interviews, shows that evangelical voters are far different from
the stereotypes _ and far more like the rest of the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears that most non-evangelicals have little more to fear
from the majority of ordinary evangelicals than being thought of as
spiritually or morally mistaken, and thus prayed for, shown a life
of good example, and occasionally offered a word about one's
relationship to God,'' Christian Smith, a sociologist at the
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, writes in ``Christian
America? What Evangelicals Really Want,'' published in April.
``These may be things that non-evangelicals would prefer to do
without. But they are hardly views and practices that threaten
civil American pluralism and democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   In truth, evangelicals have always been an important part of
American politics, and throughout most of the last century fit
comfortably inside the Democrats' coalition; three-quarters of the
evangelicals in the House in 1953 were Democrats, although today
the same percentage are Republicans. Indeed, in the 1930s and
1940s, the vast majority of rank-and-file evangelicals were
Democrats because, as George Washington University historian Leo P.
Ribuffo puts it, ``They were poor, Southern Democrats _ or both.''
</P>
<P>
   The nature of the evangelical movement is always changing. There
was a great religious revival during and after World War II; the
percentage of Americans who said they belonged to a church
increased from 49 percent of the population in 1940 to 69 percent
in 1960. The evangelicals of the late 20th century, fortified in
numbers by the Cold War and the appearance of leaders such as the
Reverend Billy Graham, moved sharply to the right as a result of
the upheaval brought on by the protests of the civil rights and
antiwar movements, a number of US Supreme Court decisions that
undermined the prominence of religion in American life and schools,
the sexual revolution, and the feminist movement.
</P>
<P>
   By 1972, a year before the Roe v. Wade decision establishing
abortion rights, the Republican presidential candidate, Richard M.
Nixon, won 80 percent of the evangelical vote.
</P>
<P>
   By the Ronald Reagan years, evangelicals were firmly within the
GOP tent _ and their prominence began to worry some Republican
strategists who believed religious conservatives put a face of
intolerance on the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   That notion has been largely absent in this election year.
</P>
<P>
   One reason surely is that the concerns of religious
conservatives _ personal and public morality, the crisis of the
family, entertainment values _ no longer seem out of the
mainstream; listen carefully to Democrats running for the House and
the Senate this year and to Gore, who speaks openly about religion,
and it is clear that the language of religious conservatives has
become the language of all politicians.
</P>
<P>
   But it isn't only the Democrats who have changed. Religious
conservatives have changed, too. Tune in to the floor action at the
GOP convention and look for the evangelicals. They'll be
everywhere. But you'll hardly notice them.

SMALL TOWN REMAINS COOL ON PRESIDENTIAL CHOICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By YVONNE ABRAHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEBSTER GROVES, Mo. _ They're pretty good at picking presidents
around here. And they're none too happy with the choice they face
this year.
</P>
<P>
   This quaint community, a mostly middle-class suburb 15 miles
southwest of St. Louis, is in the middle of America, geographically
and ideologically. It is also a bellwether: As Webster Groves goes,
so goes St. Louis County. As St. Louis County goes, so goes
Missouri. And as Missouri has gone, so has the nation in all but
two presidential elections in the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   It is the kind of place where elections are won and lost, a
place where either presidential candidate can hope to win. And so
far this year, the news from Webster Groves isn't especially
pleasant for Al Gore or George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   People here are lamenting the slim pickings. Few are smitten by
Vice President Gore, the presumptive Democratic nominee, or the
Texas governor, his likely Republican opponent, although Bush seems
to have gained some local advantage by being the fresher face on
the national political scene. Phrases like ``lesser of two evils''
and ``least offensive'' are sprinkled into conversations about how
folks may vote. Party loyalists still seem inclined to line up,
although without joy, behind the standard-bearers. But swing
voters, and there are many, often seem at a loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep wishing that Bush seemed more intelligent and Al Gore
seemed like more of a leader,'' said Barbara Martin Smith, 55, an
artist and independent-minded voter who lives in the neighborhood
where her father and grandfather grew up. ``I'm not pleased with
either of them, and I don't know who I'd vote for if I had to
choose between them. And that's disturbing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the two parties aren't that different, and the
candidates aren't much of a choice,'' said restaurateur Tom Clary,
43.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that people here are cynical about politicians. They've
gotten excited about candidates in the past _ choosing Ronald
Reagan by landslide margins in 1980 and 1984, and giving Bill
Clinton a solid win in 1992 (although a less ringing reelection
vote in 1996).
</P>
<P>
   Nor are they distracted from the current race by other concerns.
Times are good here, as with the middle class in much of the
country. The stores and restaurants on Lockwood Avenue and Big Bend
Boulevard are thriving, houses are being renovated or rebuilt.
</P>
<P>
   And voters here, unlike many of their peers across the nation,
are paying attention. Voter turnout is historically high, civic
involvement sacrosanct. The desire to participate is rooted in a
sense of place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I get much more mail from my constituents than the
average state rep receives,'' said Emmy McClelland, a Republican
legislator whose district includes the town. ``And they're not just
little postcards with signatures. It's very thoughtful letters.''
</P>
<P>
   When folks ask the what-school-did-you-go-to question here, they
mean high school, not college. Children in this town of 25,000 can
live as simply as their parents did. Bicycles lie unlocked under
huge trees outside flag-festooned Victorian houses. Each year,
crowds line the streets for the grand Fourth of July parade, where
prizes are given for best lawn decoration and float. (This year's
theme was ``your favorite decade.'') Summer means candy bars from
Straub's and afternoon pilgrimages to Hogoboom's for sno-cones. The
whole place has the feel of a Saturday Evening Post cover.
</P>
<P>
   Houses here may cost $70,000 for a modest one-floor brick
cottage, or $2 million for a big Victorian with a long driveway.
Most residents have white-collar jobs in management, technology, or
the professions. About 10 percent have service industry jobs. The
average annual salary was about $58,000, according to the 1990
census, a figure that Mayor Gerry Welch said would probably jump
with this year's survey.
</P>
<P>
   About 10 percent of the city's population is African-American.
Hispanic and Asian residents each make up less than 1 percent of
the town's population. Politics, not population, shifts in Webster
Groves.
</P>
<P>
   Residents have been following the news closely enough to know of
Bush's defense of executions in Texas, and of renewed calls for
investigations into Gore's 1996 campaign fund-raising. They know of
Bush's plan to allow workers to invest a percentage of their Social
Security payroll taxes in the stock market, and of his admiration
for Supreme Court Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas. Some
know of Gore's concern for the environment and of his plan to
include prescription benefits in Medicare coverage.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, it's not what the candidates are offering, or even
who they are that animates these voters. It's who Bush and Gore are
not. Few of the residents interviewed at the end of June said they
would cast a vote for either candidate on his own merits. Plenty
said they'd be voting against Gore or against Bush, and, in what is
perhaps bad news for Gore, against Clinton. That would seem to give
Bush the edge in Webster Groves, but largely by default. (Some of
those who despised what the Clinton administration had become
allowed that either candidate would be an improvement).
</P>
<P>
   ``My biggest problem is, they're all really rich white men. I
fear this is just a big fun power thing for them,'' said Bill
Reyland, 33, a musician who said he was concerned about the
candidates' views on abortion, gun control, education, and their
plans for providing for people as they get older.
</P>
<P>
   Reyland said, ``Bush is very aggressive, and that's a good
attitude. He seems like a tough guy who won't take anything from
anybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore's not convincing at all,'' Reyland said. ``He doesn't
seem to have any enthusiasm for it. It's not that `Gore is a boring
person thing.' He doesn't seem to be making the hard sell. Bush is
out there with his fist in the air.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Reyland's indecision, that comment was one of the
strongest in Bush's favor of two dozen lengthy interviews in the
town. More typical was John Streeter, a retired Air Force pilot,
who was far more vehement in his contempt for Gore than his
cautious approbation of Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Gore is a liar who has no integrity and is
poll-driven. And that about takes care of it. He would do anything
to be elected,'' said Streeter, 71, who typically votes Republican
although he said he may have voted for Harry Truman, a fellow
Missourian, in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see any negatives on Bush's side,'' Streeter said.
``He seems to be straightforward. He has a nice personality, and I
haven't heard anything negative about him, so I'd say he has more
integrity than Gore.'' When pushed, he added that he liked Bush
because he had experience as a governor, ``whereas Gore has never
governed anything or done anything other than be a senator and vice
president in a horrible administration.''
</P>
<P>
   At the O. T. Hodges Chili Parlor, where a group of retired and
semiretired men meet each weekday morning for eggs, and merciless,
indiscriminate ribbing, it was the same story. Some of them are
unreconstructed liberals, some are devout Republicans, and some,
like retired sporting goods store owner and current school sports
coach Lee Keefer, swing back and forth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a Republican, but I voted for Clinton. Twice. That's how .
. . stupid I am,'' said Keefer, 67. ``I won't go for Gore.
Basically, I'm not that much in favor of either man, but Bush could
do a better job.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore is ``a coattail man!'' said Bill Wright, who once owned a
machine tool company, and said he had always voted Republican,
except, maybe, in 1948. (His breakfast companions guffawed,
incredulous, at that.) Wright said he'd be for Bush, for sure.
</P>
<P>
   Among stalwart Democrats, Gore engendered similarly
underwhelming endorsements. Joseph Beck, 55, a voice coach who said
Clinton and Gore had handled the economy ``magnificently,'' said he
would definitely vote for Gore, but added that the vice president
``doesn't seem to lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``On a visceral basis, Bush seems like a leader,'' Beck said.
``Though he still hasn't gotten rid of that smirk.''
</P>
<P>
   Sally Beck, his wife, was far less ambivalent although not
enthusiastic, about the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore has been a consistent person, and he seems decent,'' she
said. ``What you see is what you get.''
</P>
<P>
   Sally Beck's view of Gore seems, on the basis of several days of
interviews, unusually positive in Webster Groves. Even in the
town's African-American community, which is usually staunchly
Democratic, there was little enthusiasm for Gore. It was all about
keeping Bush out of the White House.
</P>
<P>
   In barber Lee Moss's Hair Salon, there's been a lot of talk
lately of the recent execution of Gary Graham, an African-American
and the latest to face execution in Texas, where Bush governs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like Mr. Bush, and I don't like his stand on the death
penalty,'' said Moss, 58. ``The death penalty always is, if you
have money, you have ways to escape it. Only the poor people get
the death penalty.''
</P>
<P>
   So, Moss said, he and most of his customers would go for Gore,
although he added that many of his younger customers are more
affluent and oblivious to racial history than are voters of his
generation. In the current election, he said, the votes of blacks
should not be taken for granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``African-Americans take Gore because . . . basically, people
like Clinton, regardless of what he did, and Al Gore is on his
coattails,'' Moss said.
</P>
<P>
   For Otha Lee Davis, 55, owner of Lee's BBQ Plus, even such faint
praise for the vice president didn't come easily.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a registered Democrat, but I really haven't decided yet,''
said Davis, who is African-American. ``I'm not necessarily a big
fan of either guy. Gore doesn't strike me as presidential. Bush, I
kinda think he's been forced on the people. He's not thinking, `I
can help America.' He's saying, `I can help Bush.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, too, was insincere, Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Several voters waxed nostalgic for such charismatic characters
as John F. Kennedy, the young Clinton's idol, and a more recent
contender.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five months ago, I already had my mind made up,'' said Judy
Casanova, a 55-year-old realtor. ``I would have voted for John
McCain hands down.''
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona senator might have lost Missouri's primary to Bush
on March 7 by a whopping 23 percentage points, but some of the
Webster Groves residents interviewed, including two stalwart
Democrats, said he was their kind of candidate.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who lost to Bush in Webster Groves by fewer than 70
votes, isn't in the running anymore. Instead, voters here in
America's middle feel they must choose between two men for whom
they feel no strong allegiance.
</P>
<P>
   As Davis, the owner of Lee's BBQ Plus put it: ``At (election)
time, I'm gonna have to go for the lesser of two evils.''

 HELPING OTHERS QUIT THE MEDICAL FIELD  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE BARNARD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ For at least one doctor-turned-entrepreneur,
physicians' career angst has become a business opportunity in
itself.
</P>
<P>
   As a psychiatric resident at Beth Israel Hospital, Gigi Hirsch
counseled doctors who felt stuck in the wrong career. Then she
realized she was one of them. She left medical practice in 1997 to
found MD IntelliNet, a company that specializes in what she has
dubbed ``physician human capital.''
</P>
<P>
   Running the firm out of her Brookline home, Hirsch, 45, links
doctors with jobs outside traditional physician roles and advises
companies on how to market new products and technologies to
doctors.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first hung out my shingle, some physicians who came to
see me gave me fake names,'' she said in an interview at Zaftigs,
the Harvard Street hangout that serves as her auxiliary office.
``They're not used to talking about career problems. They don't
want to be seen as `not coping well.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Managed care is not the root cause of many doctors'
dissatisfaction, she said. Rather, it has ``brought a lot of career
issues out of the closet'' by destroying the promise of delayed
gratification in the form of money, status and respect.
</P>
<P>
   Many disillusioned doctors stick with the profession, she said,
because their identity is tied to the ``Dr.'' title, or because the
average medical school graduate owes $80,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to be treated by a doctor who doesn't want to
be a doctor,'' Hirsch said. ``It's kind of an ugly thing and no one
wants to talk about this.''
</P>
<P>
   Unsatisfied doctors are more likely to be targeted by
malpractice suits and to file expensive disability claims, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   While there are growing opportunities for doctors in other
fields, it can be surprisingly hard for them to get hired, she
said. Many find networking distasteful, thinking their credentials
speak for themselves. And worse, doctors have an awful reputation
in the business world: arrogant, headstrong, demanding.
</P>
<P>
   But if they do it right, she said, they can ``leverage'' their
medical skills to get relatively high-level jobs in their new
field.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Silverstein, 45, still uses his analytical skills to
``diagnose'' problems, but at Boston Consulting Group, his patients
are now companies, not people. And Rod Altman, a former emergency
room doctor, said his new job in a venture capital firm _ dividing
finite capital among competing start-up proposals _ reminds him a
lot of triage.
</P>
<P>
   Those two got business degrees to move out of medicine, but one
of Hirsch's clients, Ilene Cohen, 44, took a more unusual route:
She taught herself HTML, the Web-design programming language, took
a programming course at Boston University, and was hired by a
medical software company. What she lacked in experience, she made
up for by knowing what doctors would look for in a program.
</P>
<P>
   Hirsch, who has consulted for 1,600 physicians since 1992, also
advises doctors on how to get into part-time activities such as
lecturing, patient advocacy, starting a business, and advising drug
companies. Avoiding conflicts of interest is up to the individual,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   As for her own business venture, Hirsch declined to say whether
it was profitable. ``It's growing,'' she said.

 FRUSTRATION FORCING MANY IN MEDICINE TO SEEK NEW FIELDS  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE BARNARD AND KATHRYN TONG  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ilene Cohen designs software. David Chung founded an Internet
start-up. Rod Altman helps pick investments for a venture capital
company. Gigi Hirsch is a career consultant, and Stephen Sherwin
runs a $33 million biotechnology firm.
</P>
<P>
   Their workdays, incomes, ages, and aspirations may differ, but
they have one thing in common: They're all doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Frustration over managed care _ coupled with exploding
opportunities in Internet ventures, medical technology, biotech,
and finance _ is spurring more and more physicians to try careers
in other fields, doctors and medical organizations say.
</P>
<P>
   Some go looking for autonomy, creativity, status, and financial
reward, the hallmarks that once attracted them to the medical
profession but now seem to be ebbing away. Others sense the
excitement in new high-tech fields and want to be a part of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were many people walking around in health care who
couldn't wait to get out,'' said Altman, 37. He recently left a
gritty Chicago-area emergency room for a high-rise office
overlooking the Charles River in Boston, where he sifts through
business proposals from health care start-ups. ``I get up every
morning and can't wait to get to work. Can't wait.''
</P>
<P>
   For doctors who slogged their way through costly medical
schools, exhausting residencies, and years of clinical practice,
such career moves were once practically unheard of. And they are
still accompanied by a great deal of soul-searching. Cohen, 44, who
left internal medicine last year and now designs software for
cardiology tests, likened the switch to ``leaving the priesthood.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet a recent survey of 300 doctors over age 50 found that 10
percent were planning to seek jobs outside clinical practice,
according to Merritt, Hawkins &AMP; Associates, a national physician
headhunting firm. Of physicians who planned to stop working with
patients or to retire, 48 percent cited managed care as a
significant reason. That trend is making it harder for hospitals to
recruit top specialists, said company spokesman Phil Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a small but growing number of young doctors are
postponing, skipping or curtailing residency training _ or leaving
just after residency _ to start businesses, join Internet start-ups
or work as consultants.
</P>
<P>
   Companies, in turn, are taking a new look at doctors as a pool
of intellectual capital: In the last five years, McKinsey &AMP; Co. and
the Boston Consulting Group have begun recruiting at medical
schools nationwide. Hirsch quit psychiatry to found a company that
helps such firms locate and hire physicians.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps surprisingly, these trends are meeting little resistance
or concern from the established medical community, which seems to
view them as a sign that doctors and educators are adapting to the
changing health care landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Some doctors even believe that the profession's current troubles
are weeding out people who went into medicine for status and
wealth, and leaving only those who are genuinely interested in
helping patients.
</P>
<P>
   Boston-area physicians who changed careers disputed that, saying
they acted partly out of disillusionment. They found they had less
time for patients, did more grunt work, and got less intellectual
stimulation out of following treatment recipes that increasingly
are written by insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Society in many ways has devalued medical practice,'' said
Mark Goldberg, 40, a former radiologist at Massachusetts General
Hospital. He is now vice president of Parexel International Corp.,
a Waltham, Mass. firm that applies computer imaging to medical
research. Twenty years ago, he said, the ideal role model was a
physician; now it's Bill Gates.
</P>
<P>
   Ali Binazir, 28, horrified his parents when, fresh out of
medical school and more than $80,000 in debt, he decided to get a
job in the burgeoning Internet economy. ``The prospect of spending
another four years in residency at subhuman wages and being treated
like chattel didn't appeal to me,'' he said. ``They say there's a
pot of gold at the end _ I don't see it.''
</P>
<P>
   Complaints about managed care and the lure of the new economy
are being blamed for three straight years of declining medical
school applications, according to the Association of American
Medical Colleges. Applications declined 6 percent in 1999, to
38,534.
</P>
<P>
   But the 14 doctors interviewed by the Globe about their flight
from medical practice also cited more subtle reasons for their
moves. Many said they believed they could have a broader impact on
health care outside traditional patient care.
</P>
<P>
   ``We as physicians never got to make any macro decisions. We
never got to decide what was in the basket of goods and services
that could be delivered to patients,'' said Altman, who worked 10
years as an emergency room doctor and now evaluates health care
business plans for TVM Techno Venture Management in Cambridge,
Mass.
</P>
<P>
   He added that he took a small pay cut to make the switch, and
noted that while venture capital could be more lucrative in the
long run than medicine, it is also riskier.
</P>
<P>
   Younger doctors in particular see no contradiction in weaving
business into their careers, and do not view themselves as
abandoning medicine. Traditional nonclinical paths, such as working
for drug companies, no longer have the stigma they once had, said
John Lacey, a spokesman for Harvard Medical School.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-eight of the country's 125 medical schools offered joint
MD-MBA programs in 1998, with 143 students enrolled _ up from 16
programs with 78 students the year before. MBA programs for
established physicians have multiplied in the last decade from one
or two to around a dozen.
</P>
<P>
   As for the new, high-tech medical fields, the Stanford
University School of Medicine actively encourages students to
explore them and to become entrepreneurs. This fall it will begin
giving credit for rotations at private firms, such as biotechnology
and medical instrument companies.
</P>
<P>
   Of Stanford's 89 MD graduates this year, two joined consulting
firms, three headed to business school and one to a medical device
firm. Those numbers are expected to increase next year, said senior
associate dean Phyllis Gardner, who herself took time out from
medicine to work at a start-up.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Shen, 27, has taken time off from his Stanford medical
schooling to get an engineering degree and help design a device for
treating strokes. He plans to get an MBA as well and become ``a
bridge between physicians and engineers.'' Working in medicine full
time, he said, he wouldn't have time envision new devices; yet his
medical education will be indispensable to understanding what
devices are needed.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, David Chung, 29, founded Beansprout.net, a Web site
for pediatricians and parents, during his pediatrics residency at
Children's Hospital. He now plans to practice in Brockton three
days a week and work two days a week at Beansprout. He said that at
any given time in his residency program, a half-dozen young doctors
were working on side business ventures, even as they covered
overnight shifts in the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Hospitals, meanwhile, are not alarmed at the trend, said Debra
Weinstein, who oversees residency programs at MGH and Brigham and
Women's Hospital in Boston. She defined residency's mission as
``training people to be leaders in a variety of medical fields.''
As an example, she pointed to Richard Peters, a former MGH resident
who cofounded MedNav.com to make Internet networks for hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   People were not always so understanding. Stephen Sherwin, CEO of
Cell Genesys, a California biotech company that researches cancer
vaccines, graduated from Harvard Medical School in 1974. His
interest in research led him first to the National Cancer
Institute, then to a private firm where he felt he could take a
more active role in directing drug research. Few of his colleagues
identified with his choice. In 1984, a 10th reunion booklet listed
him as an ``industrial physician,'' a moniker that conjured up ``an
unfortunate soul doing worker's comp physicals,'' Sherwin said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he was able to do research without begging for grants,
as well as profit from getting into biotech on the ground floor.
His first company went from 150 employees to 1,500. Later Sherwin
helped create Cell Genesys, which recently raised $250 million by
selling shares in a spinoff called Abgenix. That is a staggering
amount of capital for researching new cancer cures, he said: ``In
some ways it's just another way of being a doctor.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Solit, 33, might not have put it quite that strongly
when he joined the consulting giant McKinsey &AMP; Co. shortly after
completing a residency at Thomas Jefferson University in
Philadelphia. But he did dream that a financial job would allow him
to help the medical industry negotiate the difficulties of managed
care.
</P>
<P>
   Reality so far has been more complicated: After consulting for
several drug companies and one managed-care organization, he said,
``I've done nothing that would directly impact the physician
dilemma.'' One problem, he said, is doctors' adversarial attitude
toward managed care.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Cheryl Tessler, 29, also an MD, went to McKinsey for a
different reason: She did not want to enter a 90-hour-per-week
residency while caring for an infant daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Ilene Cohen, too, was thinking of her personal life when she
gave up a beloved internal medicine practice at Mount Auburn
Hospital in Cambridge to design software for Bard Electrophysiology
in Lowell, Mass. She traded a maple-furnished office for a cubicle
at half the pay. But every day, she takes her lunch to a picnic
table _ something she almost never had time for in 12 years of
practice. The other day, she even played table tennis with
colleagues. ``I could not believe this was happening to me,'' she
said. ``I have entered another universe.''

NOT YOUR ORDINARY MIDEAST SUMMIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- Inevitably, President Clinton finds himself this
week between Barak and a hard place.
</P>
<P>
   This is not your typical Middle East summit. Expectations should
always be beside the point in this age of hype, but they are
unusually so this week in Maryland's Catoctin Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Much more unusually, sticking points in negotiating positions
about the endgame between the Palestinians and the Israelis are
also beside the point. The basic outlines of the peace that is
possible at Camp David are not a secret. Hammering out details
would not cause any mature negotiator to break a sweat.Instead,
this is going to be a summit about will: who wants peace, who wants
a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   This is also going to be a summit about the consequences of
failure. The American role will be to get Ehud Barak and Yasser
Arafat focused on what they can reasonably expect if this more bold
than desperate gamble flops.
</P>
<P>
   The presemt moment has been coming ever since the Israeli prime
minister was elected after he appealed for a mandate to make peace.
In another sense it has been coming every since Barak's predecessor
and mentor, the late Yitzhak Rabin, decided to break through the
diplomatic impasses and reach an interim arrangement with Arafat
seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Rabin is said to have made a point to Barak at that
time that Barak made to close associates following his own
election: Now we are going to find out if the Palestinians really
want to stop the strife.
</P>
<P>
   That is not posture; it is truth. The courage shown by Rabin in
Oslo and by Barak in office has nearly eliminated doubt about
Israel's willingness to negotiate a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   The question now is whether the Palestinians can match this
courage. The reason the tea leaves are not auspicious this weekend
is that Arafat resisted coming here. Behind his assertion that the
preparations had not been thorough enough lies the question of
whether he and his supporters have the will to make the same
courageous move toward the Israelis that the Israelis have made
toward them. With the will, ways already exist to deal with
refugees, water, land, settlements, even Jerusalem; without the
will, the details won't matter.
</P>
<P>
   Facing death, Syria's President Hafez Assad was unable to reach
beyond his past. He dumped his mess into the lap of his unprepared
son.
</P>
<P>
   Now in shaky health himself, Arafat faces a similar choice, with
the important difference that having begun genuine diplomacy in the
1990s, he knew that a moment like the present loomed.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's task this week will be primarily to describe
in detail the wrong road that may lie ahead.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a mystery. Stalemate, like failure to convene the
summit and permit continued drift, would call Arafat's bluff in
setting a deadline roughly 60 days hence, after which he would
unilaterally declare statehood on existing lands. If that were to
happen, Israel would almost certainly retaliate by formally
annexing land containing Jewish settlements on the West Bank,
setting the stage for a substantial escalation in tension and
probably violence.
</P>
<P>
   For both sides, it would be a hideous future. For the
Palestinians, there would be sovereignty over a ``nation'' that
would be crippled economically, impotent militarily, and bereft of
any hope of assistance, and US support for the Palestinian cause
would all but collapse. For Israel, there would be no end to the
costs of occupation and strife. And for Barak, his government
crumbling from the defection of coalition partners, a probably
shotgun marriage with the opposition Likud Party would strip him of
his mandate to take bold steps for peace.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's message will be that the future could be this bad, if
not worse. In their heads, both sides understand, but the US hope
is that detailed exposure to a post-failure world will change
hearts.
</P>
<P>
   Especially Arafat's. The days of holding out in the expectation
of more US pressure on Israel are over. However impatient his
people are, failure to negotiate this month will lead to even more
deprivation, this time with no end in sight.
</P>
<P>
   Against that certainty, he can grasp the opportunity, for
example, for sovereignty over 90 percent of the West Bank, or hold
out for the pre-1967 war borders forever without prospect of
success. He can maintain effective control in the Arab
neighborhoods of East Jerusalem and establish a capitol in the
adjacent neighborhood of Abu Dis, or he can hold out for all of
East Jerusalem, without prospect of success.
</P>
<P>
   Given the grim outlook, it goes without saying that Clinton was
correct in going for broke this summer. It was unavoidable.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has already gone for broke. It is now time to find out if
the Palestinians have a similar ability to see beyond the prison
walls of the status quo and take a similar risk. Israel is less
interested in Arafat's detailed ideas on a final deal than in
finding out at last if he is willing to make one.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The unlikely pairing of the golden-tongued,
bilingual former politician and a media-shy, monolingual Hollywood
agent has been a happy marriage for shareholders of the nation's
most powerful Spanish-language communications company.
</P>
<P>

   ``He has an uncanny ability to package ideas eloquently and to
convince people it's the right thing to do,'' said Adolfo Aguilar,
president of San Antonio advertising agency Creative Civilizations.
</P>
<P>
   Univision first turned a profit in 1996, the year it went public
and four years after A. Jerrold Perenchio bought it. Since Cisneros
joined the company in 1997, the price of its stock has jumped more
than fivefold. Stock values nearly tripled in 1999 alone.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers point to evidence of the company's savvy: Teens like
its programs better than MTV, young men choose it over ESPN, and
more Americans get their news from Univision than from CNN.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts view Univision as the country's second-fastest growing
media company, second only to America Online/Time Warner, though
the much smaller Spanish-language broadcast company is seldom
mentioned in the same breath.
</P>
<P>
   They see the Hispanic market as an unexploited dragon capable of
breathing fire when fully awakened.
</P>
<P>
   The fastest-growing minority in the United States, Hispanics are
expected to account for one in five Americans by 2005. Although
their per-capita income is about $10,000 lower than the $39,900
national average, by 2010 their buying power is expected to more
than double to $940 billion.
</P>
<P>
   And Hispanics are famously brand-loyal, making Univision's 92
percent hold on Spanish-language television viewers all the more
lucrative. Cisneros earned a $1 million bonus to sign on at
Univision in 1997 and is now a multimillionaire.
</P>
<P>
   Last year at Univision, he earned $4.5 million, including a base
salary of $600,000, plus $600,000 in bonuses and $3.3 million from
the sale of stock options.
</P>
<P>
   He can cash in additional stock options for about $5.2 million,
according to a proxy statement filed with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   As the Big Four networks struggle to stay relevant, Los
Angeles-based Univision enjoys a virtual lock on Spanish-language
television. It plays a critical role in shaping the identity and
opinions of viewers scattered across this nation and from different
countries of origin, with news and entertainment programs that
inform viewers about Cubans in Miami, Puerto Ricans in New York,
and Salvadorans in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Some have suggested that in this position, Cisneros has a
greater ability to craft public opinion that in any of his
political posts. But of course Univision is foremost a business,
and Cisneros' primary job is to ensure that stock prices and
revenues rise, said America Rodriguez, a professor of
communications at the University of Texas and author of the book
``Making Latino News: Race, Language, Class.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying he's not interested in promoting ethnic
identity. I think that's not his primary job,'' Rodriguez said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investors love companies that are leaders in their field,''
said Gordon Hodge, a California-based analyst with Thomas Weisel
Partners. ``From that standpoint, Univision has been a terrific
investment.''
</P>
<P>
   Behind the charismatic Cisneros is Perenchio, Univision's
chairman and the owner of almost 20 percent of the company's
shares. He is an Italian-American who seldom, if ever, consents to
interviews, and has been known to penalize top executives who do.
</P>
<P>
   Both Cisneros and Perenchio declined, through a New York
publicist, to be interviewed for this story.
</P>
<P>
   Perenchio, a hard-charging, prototypical Hollywood agent of the
type popularized in the movie ``Jerry Maguire,'' once promoted
Muhammad Ali, and was an early player in pay-per-view television.
He's one of California's largest political donors, a man with no
clear political stripe who stays in the shadows _ a ``ghost'' in
the words of Maria del Pilar Marrero, the political editor at La
Opinion, Los Angeles' largest Spanish-language newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts agree that Univision's dominance dates to a smart
deal Perenchio struck when he bought the company in 1992, sealing
an agreement for first dibs in the United States for programs from
Mexico TV giant Televisa and Venezuela's Venevision until 2017.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime you can produce for pesos and sell for dollars you're
going to make money,'' said Felix Gutierrez, now director of the
Freedom Forum in San Francisco. Gutierrez is a former academic who
studied Univision's predecessor in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Univision's advertising sales could reach the $1 billion mark
this year.
</P>
<P>
   And the gap between Univision's revenue and what it could earn
if its revenue equated with its audience share is estimated at $1
billion. Advertisers are famously reluctant to pay as much to
Spanish-language media as they are for English-language ads.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts see fertile terrain for growth, saying that the
disparity can't last forever.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over time, we believe that gap can close,'' said Paul Sweeney,
a New York-based analyst for Credit Suisse First Boston. ``I'm not
sure over what time.''
</P>
<P>
   Hodge said advertisers' negative perceptions about
Spanish-language media are already being overcome, though, citing
the example of Hispanic Broadcasting, a Dallas-based radio station.
</P>
<P>
   In Miami, Hispanic Broadcasting's radio station now commands
higher advertising rates than English-language stations, Hodge
said.
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros' prominence helped when he personally called on top
advertisers to demand parity for Spanish-language television ads.
</P>
<P>
   ``Henry Cisneros has done a great job of getting in front of the
key U.S. companies and really telling this story _ the Hispanic
story,'' said Jessica Reif, a New York-based analyst for Merrill
Lynch. ``While Univision management has gotten in through sort of
normal channels, Henry has gotten in through the chairman or CEO
level.''
</P>
<P>
   Hodge called Cisneros ``a terrific ambassador for Univision, but
also for Hispanic advertising'' with connections to Fortune 500
companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been able to access some of these decision-makers and
convince them to at least look at the facts,'' Hodge said.
</P>
<P>
   The company raised advertising rates about 33 percent last year,
and most advertisers paid up.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a bold, a very bold step,'' said Adolfo Aguilar,
president of Creative Civilization, and past president of the
Association of Hispanic Advertising Agencies. ``It demonstrated we
must stand up for what is right and we must charge what is fair.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While Wall Street has applauded the Perenchio-Cisneros marriage,
it is a study in opposites.
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros was the top-ranking Hispanic in the Democratic Party
when he went to work for Perenchio. (Cisneros's political career
hit a snag when he pleaded guilty in federal court to one
misdemeanor count of failing to report payments he made to a former
mistress during questioning by FBI agents who were conducting a
background check into his nomination to the Cabinet.)
</P>
<P>
   Perenchio donated heavily to former California Gov. Pete Wilson,
a Republican who backed a measure seen as anti-immigrant. On the
other hand, he was the largest donor for the campaign to defeat
Proposition 227, an initiative aimed at eliminating bilingual
education in California.
</P>
<P>
   The company's policy is to talk about stars and shows, but not
issues.
</P>
<P>
   So when Perenchio tapped the country's most visible Hispanic to
be Univision's public face, he demanded that Cisneros, like other
top executives, stay out of the news.
</P>
<P>
   Perenchio previously has enforced his no-comment mandate, firing
one employee who gave an interview, and fining network President
Ray Rodriguez $25,000 for a similar offense, according to the Wall
Street Journal.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, teased by talk that Cisneros was house-hunting in San
Antonio, supporters have lobbied him to help re-energize the
state's Democratic Party, perhaps by running for governor or
senator. And Cisneros was on the wish list to head the beleaguered
Los Angeles school system, but stated that he was not a candidate.

GROVER CLEVELAND: HALF-FORGOTTEN, HONEST TO THE CORE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID M. SHRIBMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
AN HONEST PRESIDENT 
The Life and Presidencies of Grover Cleveland 
By H. Paul Jeffers. Avon. 384 pp. $27. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He is the only president to serve two non-consecutive terms. He
is the first president to be married in the White House, and the
father of the first child to be born there. He is the only Democrat
to be elected president between James Buchanan, who served before
the Civil War, and Woodrow Wilson, who brought the United States
into World War I.
</P>
<P>
   Grover Cleveland is the forgotten two-term American president.
The other two-full-termers _ George Washington, Thomas Jefferson,
James Madison, James Monroe, Andrew Jackson, Ulysses S. Grant,
Wilson, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Dwight Eisenhower, Ronald Reagan,
and, nearing the finish, Bill Clinton _ are vivid characters, each
a part of American folklore, each a part of American memory. But
Cleveland remains unknown, remembered if at all as the father of
Baby Ruth, the presidential daughter who lent her name to a candy
bar. (Even that is misunderstood; most contemporary Americans
believe the confection was named for a certain home-run titan.)
</P>
<P>
   Now H. Paul Jeffers, a Vermont native and prolific writer, has
taken on the task of presenting a 19th-century president to a
21st-century audience. It is an ambitious, audacious task _ this is
an era when few Americans know the identity of their own
representative on Capitol Hill _ but it is a worthy one, too.
Grover, we hardly knew ye. We hardly knew ye existed.
</P>
<P>
   But Cleveland was a giant in his time, and not only
metaphorically. He was, to be sure, large and imposing, casting a
big shadow over New York state and the United States for more than
a decade. He was also something of a boy wonder. He was a dutiful,
slightly iconoclastic mayor of Buffalo who in less than a year in
office found himself nominated for, and elected, governor and then,
about 15 minutes later (actually about two years) was elected
president. Clinton's rise to the presidency (a term as attorney
general, four elections as governor) was leisurely by comparison.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffers's volume is called ``An Honest President,'' and that
title lends an antiquarian feel to the book, as honest presidents
have not exactly been a dime a dozen in recent decades. No matter.
Grover Cleveland was an honest man, which is why he rose so fast.
He first attracted attention as a stand-up mayor who took on the
schemers on the Common Council, then teamed up with Republican
Theodore Roosevelt to battle appalling conditions in the
cigar-making industry, and finally took on Tammany leader John
Kelly. On the day he was elected governor, Cleveland wrote his
brother that he regarded election as ``a business engagement
between the people of the State and myself, in which the obligation
of my side is to perform the duties assigned me with an eye single
to the interest of my employers.'' We could do worse. We have.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland's honesty is best portrayed in the (dreaded and
gloomy) area of the private conduct of public figures. This is a
topic with which contemporary readers have some sad familiarity.
The truth in Cleveland's case is that he fathered a child out of
wedlock. When his friend Charles W. Goodyear asked him what the
Democratic Party should say about the matter, Cleveland issued a
telegram with six words for the ages: WHATEVER YOU DO, TELL THE
TRUTH.
</P>
<P>
   Full stop.
</P>
<P>
   Only it didn't stop there. (It never does.) The election of 1884
was probably the most sordid of all time. The Republican cry was
simple: ``Ma! Ma! Where's My Pa?'' The Democratic response,
targeted at the GOP nominee: ``Blaine, Blaine, James G. Blaine, the
continental liar from the State of Maine.'' In this mudfest,
Cleveland prevailed, but not before the Republicans, with an eye
toward the reformers and Roman Catholics in the Democratic
coalition, described their rivals as the party of ``rum, Romanism,
and rebellion.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland was an outsider like few others; until he was elected
president he had never so much as set a foot in Washington. He
shied away from patronage and even retained some Republican
officeholders. He wrote a scathing letter to a fellow Democratic
politician who pushed to win a federal job for an obviously corrupt
party worker: ``The idea that this administration, pledged to give
the people better officers and engaged in a hand-to-hand fight with
the bad elements of both parties, should be betrayed by those who
ought to be worthy of implicit trust, is atrocious, and such
treason to the people and to the party ought to be punished by
imprisonment.''
</P>
<P>
   And in an inaugural address he delivered from memory _ imagine
the next president trying that! _ Cleveland declared: ``The people
demand reform in the administration of the government, and the
application of business principles to public affairs.''
</P>
<P>
   Things did not always go so well in the White House. Cleveland
bungled in his effort to repeal the Bland-Allison Act, which
required Washington to buy and coin as much silver as possible, by
failing to pressure his Democratic congressional allies. Generally
a reformer, he lobbied for and signed legislation in 1887 to create
the Interstate Commerce Commission. But his first term had a black
mark: He supported legislation restricting the movement of Chinese
into the United States, saying that blending races was ``unwise,
impolitic, and injurious to both nations.'' Cleveland did not
campaign in the 1888 election and was defeated by William Henry
Harrison. ``Well,'' Cleveland said, ``it's all up.'' Not so fast.
The Clevelands returned four years later, just in time for a deep
recession, growing economic tension, and labor strife that flared
in the bloody Pullman strike. Cleveland was honest, but he was not
lucky.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffers is an amiable tour guide throughout the ups and downs of
Cleveland's public career, and his biography is pleasant,
easygoing, and engaging, though not especially challenging _ either
to the reader or to Cleveland himself. The constant reference to
Cleveland simply as ``Grover'' undermines the authority of the
volume; no serious modern biographer, for example, would constantly
refer to President Kennedy as ``Jack.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Jeffers has performed a public service in retrieving
Cleveland from the remainder pile of presidents. In his first
presidential campaign, Joseph Pulitzer's New York World provided
four reasons for supporting Cleveland: ``1. He is an honest man. 2.
He is an honest man. 3. He is an honest man. 4. He is an honest
man.'' He was, for those four reasons, an unusual man, too.

DANCING IN THE DARK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK FEENEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Millions of people know the names Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly.
How many recognize the name Harold Nicholas?
</P>
<P>
   Yet as Astaire and Kelly knew perfectly well, Nicholas, who died
Monday in New York at 79, was every bit their artistic peer. That
so few people today recognize his name, or that of his brother and
dance partner, Fayard, is because of a very old and very familiar
story: great American talent having careers deformed, deferred, or
denied because of race.
</P>
<P>
   Compared to many black entertainers of their era, the Nicholas
Brothers fared well. They worked steadily, both here and abroad.
Revered within the dance world, they were frequently feted over the
past two decades. Their reputation extended far enough into the
culture at large that the Kennedy Center included them among its
select roster of honorees in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   What makes their case special is the near-stupefying disparity
between the level of their abilities and the level of recognition
those abilities earned them. On screen, they were not allowed to
speak or sing (this even though Harold Nicholas was a vocalist
talented enough that Harold Arlen chose him to introduce ``Come
Rain or Come Shine''). Until their last film together, ``The
Pirate,'' when they got to dance with Kelly, they weren't even
allowed to appear on camera with anyone white.
</P>
<P>
   The brothers debuted as a team in 1930 and during the next 20
years performed in more than a dozen films and made countless stage
appearances. Their physiology-mocking, gravity-defying act blended
jazz, tap, acrobatics, ballet, and sheer, stunning showmanship to
create what was surely the most electrifying attraction American
dance has known.
</P>
<P>
   Mikhail Baryshnikov called the brothers ``the most amazing
dancers I have ever seen.'' George Balanchine, who cast them in two
Broadway musicals in the 1930s, spoke with pride of having worked
with ``the great Nicholas Brothers.'' Astaire considered their
``Jumpin' Jive'' sequence from ``Stormy Weather'' the greatest of
all movie dance numbers.
</P>
<P>
   It's a commonplace that Astaire and Kelly are two of American
culture's most glorious ornaments. What's less often remarked upon
is that a considerable part of their genius was an ability to
bridge Old World and New. Astaire was born ``Austerlitz'' (the name
of a great victory for Napoleon as well as for Terpsichore), and
his sister married an English lord. As for Kelly, his best-known
role was as ``An American in Paris,'' after all, and he owed much
of his early success to the patent Irishness of his dark good looks
and sunny charm.
</P>
<P>
   The artistry of Astaire and Kelly was only a few (dance) steps
away from that of their European forebears. The artistry of the
Nicholas Brothers was unthinkable anywhere but in America. No one
elsewhere had ever danced like this: wild yet controlled, eruptive
yet graceful, kinetic yet fluid, gymnastic yet musical. There is no
clearer demonstration that ``dance,'' ``leap,'' ``slide,''
``flip,'' and ``split'' began as verbs, not nouns, than Harold
Nicholas and his brother in motion. And in that motion the
phenomenal velocity of 20th-century America found matchless
flesh-and-blood expression.
</P>
<P>
   The sheer energy of the Nicholas Brothers gives their numbers a
contemporary feel that the passage of six decades has not dimmed.
They seem as up to the minute as Allen Iverson (who in fact looks a
little like Harold in his prime) slashing his way to the basket or
the daring, jerky steps of hip-hop.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps this is what makes the brothers' career such a poignant
example of what prejudice can do. To see a film of John Bubbles or
Bill Robinson dancing, to hear a recording of Paul Robeson singing,
is to visit not just another era but another world. The injustices
visited upon them seem as abstract to us, as alien, as their
performing styles. Precisely because the Nicholas Brothers' work
manages somehow to seem of our own time, what they suffered feels
all the more shocking.
</P>
<P>
   To see the Nicholas Brothers on screen is as thrilling an
experience as film has to offer. Does that sound like an
exaggeration? Go rent ``Stormy Weather'' or ``The Pirate'' _ or
even ``Sun Valley Serenade'' or ``Orchestra Wives'' _ fast-forward
to their scene and see for yourself. Yet precisely because what
they did reminds us of what racism prevented them from doing
further, to see them dance is also among the most heartbreaking
experiences film has to offer.
</P>
<P>
   As long as people move their bodies to music, what the Nicholas
Brothers did will provide a unique joy and exhilaration. As long as
people's hearts are moved by injustice, what was done to Harold and
Fayard Nicholas will also provide a lesson, one no less chastening
for being anything but unique.

NO. 1 WITH A BULLET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (First of two parts.)
</P>
<P>
   In the liner notes to his excellent new box set ``Love, God,
Murder,'' Johnny Cash writes, ``The first murder recorded in the
history of man was when Cain killed his brother Abel. No doubt
people wrote and sang songs about it, and we've been doing it ever
since.'' Cash should know. He dedicates an entire disc _ 16 songs _
to those who kill, such as the doomed narrator of his classic
``Folsom Prison Blues,'' who famously intones, ``I shot a man in
Reno, just to watch him die.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 50 years after Cash first sang that chilling line, we
remain fascinated by music with a body count. One need look no
further than the album that has ruled the top of the Billboard
charts for more than a month: ``The Marshall Mathers LP.'' In five
weeks, Eminem's latest CD has sold 5 million copies, despite _ or
perhaps because of _ blood-drenched lyrics in which he murders his
mother, his wife, and just about anyone else who crosses his
twisted path.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all the controversy, Eminem (who is scheduled to perform
at the Worcester Centrum Centre July 20 and 21, when the ``Up in
Smoke'' tour, also featuring Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, and Ice Cube,
rolls into town) is hardly the first artist to make music _ and
money _ spinning various tales of homicidal mayhem.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he's merely the latest practitioner in a long tradition
that includes just about every singer and/or songwriter of the past
century _ from Kurt Weill's ``Mack the Knife'' and Cole Porter's
``Miss Otis Regrets'' to Bob Marley's ``I Shot the Sheriff'' and
the Beatles ``Maxwell's Silver Hammer.'' As old as folk songs and
as recent as Macy Gray's ``I've Committed Murder,'' the taking of a
life has always been a source of musical inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Violence has a long history in music in general, and in
American music in particular,'' said Christopher John Farley,
senior writer and music critic for Time. ``You can go back to
Robert Johnson in the 1930s, and he has songs about shooting and
murdering people. It's part of the American tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   In a nation born out of revolution, murder is as much a part of
our psyche as are the bursting bombs and red glare of the rockets
in the national anthem. If violence is our unspoken fetish, then
murder is the money shot. It titillates us as much as it repels us,
and with every outrage there's a vicarious thrill.
</P>
<P>
   And since most of us will probably never murder anyone, the
heady rush of the forbidden, if only in song, is too seductive for
most to resist. As Cash puts it, ``We, the people, put ourselves in
the shoes of the singer. We want to feel his pain, his loneliness.
We want to be part of that rebellion.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's wish fulfillment. Don't you wish you could just take
somebody out and not have to pay the price for it?'' said Dan
Epstein, author of ``20th Century Pop Culture.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Forever a fascination &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``People have been killing each other forever, and have been
singing about it for nearly as long,'' he said. ``And there's
always been a part of us that been fascinated with death and
murder.''
</P>
<P>
   But to hear some folks talk about it, you would think rap
artists, some of whom color their rhymes with blood-soaked images
of kill-or-be-killed street life, were the first to set murder to
music. But the morbid subject is as old as some of the great
operas, and folk songs such as ``Stagger Lee,'' made famous by
Lloyd Price.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could probably trace it back to old Celtic folk ballads of
the 1700s and 1800s, where there were lots of murders with people
getting their heads chopped off,'' said David Browne, Entertainment
Weekly music critic. ``It's just a classic tradition in music, and
some of these old songs can be pretty grisly, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Murder was a staple in such cheesy '70s pop songs as Vicki
Lawrence's ``The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia,'' Cher's
``Dark Lady,'' and R. Dean Taylor's ``Indiana Wants Me.'' There
have been songs of murder by such artists as the Grateful Dead,
Neil Young, Guns N' Roses, Queen, Dwight Yoakam, Nick Cave (who had
an album called ``Murder Ballads''), D'Angelo _ you can pretty much
pick a genre, and find songs littered with bodies.
</P>
<P>
   But it's been a long bloody journey from the plainspeak of
shooting a man to the slam poetry of bustin' a cap in someone's
head. Comparing, say, the woman who shoots her cheating lover in
``Frankie and Johnny,'' written in 1870, to Eminem cutting his
wife's throat (complete with gurgling sound effects) on ``Kim,'' is
like comparing the genteel Brewster sisters poisoning lonely old
men in ``Arsenic and Old Lace'' with the sociopathic title
character of ``Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer.''
</P>
<P>
   But what's also changed, some say, is the personal nature, with
their ripped-from-the-evening-news authenticity, of some of today's
murder songs. It's one thing to hear Cash coldly sing about
shooting his woman in ``Delia's Gone,'' when you know that offstage
he's married to June Carter; it's quite another to hear Eminem rap
about murdering his wife, Kim, when everyone knows he's in a
volatile marriage with a woman named Kim.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's different about violence in music is that _ unlike,
say, violence in movies, or violence in books, where it seems the
author is commenting on violence _ in music when you hear the
singer's voice and hear him saying these things, one immediately
associates the artists themselves with the actual story,'' Farley
said. ``That's why people get excited when Eminem raps about
killing his wife. If he'd written a book about it, and changed the
name in a Philip Roth-ian kind of way, we'd probably say, `Oh, it's
just a novel, it's fine by us.' But since music has more of a
connection to the artist, it alarms us more.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
When trouble becomes you &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Further exacerbating the outrage is the tendency of some of
today's hip-hop stars to get into real-life trouble with the law.
In the past year, such artists as Jay-Z, DMX, Black Rob, and Mr.
Slim Shady himself, Eminem, have all faced legal problems stemming
from weapons and/or assault charges. With hip-hop's all-important
``keep it real'' edict, some artists seem to be practicing too hard
what they preach.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always got the sense back then that Johnny Cash was
singing in the voice of some kind of character,'' Browne said.
``But even though Eminem adopts the Slim Shady character, you don't
necessarily feel that he's playing a role. You could never picture
Garth Brooks or the Dixie Chicks'' _ both of whom had their own
murder songs with ``The Thunder Rolls'' and ``Goodbye Earl,''
respectively _ ``actually killing somebody, but Eminem and some
other rappers make you feel they really could.''
</P>
<P>
   Farley also pointed out that, save for Eminem, all of today's
hardcore rappers are black males, which adds the element of racial
discomfort to the mix in discussions about violence and music.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's still a basic fear of black culture in American
society. Blacks are still viewed as `the other,' and things which
are intimately connected to the core of our culture are viewed with
fear by the larger culture,'' he said. ``So when people like DMX or
Jay-Z have lyrics with violence in them, they're taken more
seriously because there's a fear of that type of person in American
society to begin with.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Britney Spears sings a song about murder, no one's going to
take her seriously,'' Farley said. ``The Dixie Chicks singing about
murdering someone did cause a certain amount of controversy, but I
ain't afraid of the Dixie Chicks, and I doubt most people are. But
it's different when it's DMX just because he's a man with black
skin instead of three cute blond white girls _ although DMX is a
short guy who really isn't much more fearsome than the Dixie
Chicks.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Degrees of murder &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If public perceptions of artists' intentions are not created
equal, neither are all murder songs. Yes, songs like ``Goodbye
Earl,'' Aerosmith's ``Janie's Got a Gun,'' and Eve's ``Love Is
Blind'' all highlight killing. But each concerns a victim of
violence _ or someone seeking vengeance _ finally striking back at
abusers. Here, murder seems almost justifiable, the final act of a
desperate person driven to extremes by years of brutalization.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are songs like Bruce Springsteen's grim ``Nebraska,''
inspired by Charles Starkweather's killing spree in the 1950s.
Though the killer expresses no remorse for his crimes, he's about
to be executed. His misdeeds do not go unpunished, and the
punishment is as harsh and irreversible as his crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in many of today's murder songs, there is a general lack of
contrition or consequence. In most of Cash's murder songs, his
killers are commenting on their misdeeds from a prison cell, and
often from death row.
</P>
<P>
   In his own essay about Cash, filmmaker Quentin Tarantino _ whose
films including ``Reservoir Dogs'' and ``Pulp Fiction'' have
sparked their own debates about violence in pop culture _ comments
that Cash's songs ``rarely take place during the high times.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a man faces a rope or 99 years in a cage for the choices
he made, when he tells the story of those choices,'' Tarantino
writes, ``he tells it not with bravado, but with an overwhelming
sense of regret.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A song like `Folsom Prison Blues' with the ultimate badass
line _ `I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die _ at the same
time has the next line, `When I hear that lonely whistle, I hang my
head and cry.' There's an immediate sense that he has (messed) up
his life completely by being the ultimate badass,'' Dan Epstein
said. ``That's the sort of thing that's missing from Eminem's
oeuvre; there's no sense of regret, no reference to how if he kills
somebody, he'll have to pay a legal or karmic price for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's completely over-the-top sensationalism,'' he said. ``It's
like `The Texas Chain Saw Massacre' _ this is violence, there is no
moral, there's nothing else going on here except it's designed to
get a rise out of you.''
</P>
<P>
   Which, for better and mostly worst, is exactly what Eminem does.
The rapper himself has admitted numerous times that his shtick is
ticking people off by saying the most outrageous, reprehensible
things. Having pushed the envelope so far on just his second major
release _ what's left after you've murdered your wife and mother? _
one wonders where he, and his inevitable musical progeny, will go
next.
</P>
<P>
   But even if Eminem decided to flip the script, and use his
considerable talents in a less brutal, predictable way, there will
always be someone else somewhere crafting a lyric, weaving a
melody, looping a beat, and capturing one of our oldest, darkest
impulse in song.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always going to be somebody who's going to try to push
it to the next level somehow, because they know it's going to
sell,'' Epstein said. ``Unfortunately, this is part of our legacy
as humans _ we kill each other. But because we also have an
artistic bent, we sing about it as well.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
NEXT WEEK: Murder isn't the only violent topic in today's music. A
new generation of bands is finding fans with songs about anger and
outrage.

GLOBE COLUMNIST JACOBY SUSPENDED 4 MONTHS FOR `MISCONDUCT' 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (e and k coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Boston Globe suspended editorial page columnist Jeff Jacoby
for four months without pay Friday after concluding that his July 3
column on the fate of the signers of the Declaration of
Independence constituted ``serious journalistic misconduct.''
</P>
<P>
   Editorial page editor Renee Loth, who determined Jacoby's
punishment along with publisher Richard H. Gilman, stopped short of
calling his action ``plagiarism.'' But the paper found that his
July 3 column was based on accounts that have appeared ``in other
publications and books and on Web sites for years'' and failed to
alert readers to those other sources, according to a Globe
statement released Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot look the other way if any of our columnists,
reporters, or writers borrow without attribution from the works of
others, even in an attempt to improve upon it,'' said Gilman in the
statement. ``The Globe will not equivocate in abiding by the
highest journalistic standards and ethics.''
</P>
<P>
   In a brief interview Friday, Jacoby, who carved out a niche as
the conservative voice on the Globe op-ed page, said, ``I've got 6
1/2 years of columns behind me at The Boston Globe, and I invite
anybody to judge my integrity and the care that I take in my work
from the body of work I've produced.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been aware from the outset that I have to be extremely
aware of my column,'' he added, noting that his politics are at
odds with the paper's more liberal opinion pages.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the suspension seemed harsh, Loth said, ``it was a
serious violation of the relationship between the Globe and its
readers. . . . We considered mitigating factors as well as the blow
this is to the Globe's credibility, and we came up with a balanced
response that's proportionate.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacoby becomes the third prominent Globe columnist to face major
sanctions in the past two years. In June 1998, award-winning Metro
columnist Patricia Smith resigned after admitting to fabricating
some characters and quotations. Two months later, veteran Metro
columnist Mike Barnicle resigned after being unable to verify facts
in a 1995 column. At the time, he was under suspension for a column
that contained jokes from George Carlin's book ``BrainDroppings.''
</P>
<P>
   One mitigating factor in Jacoby's favor was an e-mail he
circulated on July 2 containing his July 3 column. It included an
introduction stating the column ``is not a mere rewrite of an
anonymous piece that has been making the rounds on the Internet,''
but an attempt to correct errors in that piece. That e-mail, which
was received by Boston Phoenix media critic Dan Kennedy among
others, suggests Jacoby was not simply trying to replicate the
original story, but to improve upon it.
</P>
<P>
   However, Loth said Jacoby's practice of circulating his column
before publication without Globe permission was factored into his
punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Globe ombudsman Jack Thomas said that as of Friday he had
received more than 125 e-mails and calls concerning Jacoby's July 3
column.
</P>
<P>
   In a response to readers questioning the origin of the piece,
Jacoby wrote in a message now posted on Jim Romenesko's MediaNews
(www.poynter.org) Web site that ``knowing that previous treatments
of the lives-of-the-signers theme contained mistakes and
exaggerations, I tried to take pains not to repeat anything untrue.
. . . In retrospect, I wish I had noted in the column that I am
only the latest in a long line to write about the fate of the
signers.''

WASHINGTON'S TITLE SHOT, SPIELBERG'S DVD THRILLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW RELEASES: ``The Hurricane'' (DVD) _ Denzel Washington
deserved the Oscar for best actor for his performance as Rubin
``Hurricane'' Carter, the boxer unjustly imprisoned for a multiple
homicide. The problem is that the film misses out on the mental and
physical toughness Carter developed in order to survive, as well as
the abominable conditions of the prison where he remade himself.
They reached too hard to make Carter's wrenching story palatable to
a large audience instead of digging deeper and harder into his fall
and subsequent resurrection.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jaws'' (DVD) _ Steven Spielberg's terrifying tale of shark
attacks is given new life in the spectacular DVD edition of the
1975 film. John Williams's finest score and a grizzled performance
by Robert Shaw make this a great film that retains its thrills.
</P>
<P>

   GATHERING NO MOSS: The Rolling Stones' ``Gimme Shelter,'' the
1970 documentary by directors Albert and David Maysles and
Charlotte Zwerin, will be rereleased next month for the art market.
Peter Becker, president of Criterion, says the company returned to
the original 16mm elements and painstakingly struck a new print for
the limited theatrical run. The original score, featuring
``Satisfaction'' and a bevy of other Stones hits, was remixed using
Dolby noise reduction. Following the theatrical release, sometime
in the fall, it will be sold by Criterion and Home Vision on DVD.
The home version will include unreleased performances from the
concert that were cut from the original film, including Santana
performing ``Evil Ways.''

</P>
<P>
   ``GUNS'' AND BETTER: ``The Guns of Navarone'' was nominated for
seven Oscars, including best picture, after its 1961 release. The
film is about the exploits of a handful of saboteurs who have to
destroy giant guns the Nazis have emplaced on a Greek island.
Gregory Peck, David Niven, and Anthony Quinn head an impressive
cast. The DVD includes a documentary with fresh interviews with
director J. Lee Thompson, who replaced Alexander Mackendrick within
a fortnight of beginning production, and comments by Peck, Quinn,
and others. Thompson explains that the spectacular storm sequence
was filmed indoors on a London sound stage. The score by Dimitri
Tiomkin sounds even better on the new disc.

   CHINA-U.S.-FLIGHTS (Washington) _ The long rivalry between New
York and Chicago has a new front: the Transportation Department is
expected to decide this summer which city will become the take-off
point for a lucrative set of new flights to China. The decision has
added importance because of the increase in travel that is expected
follow China's likely entrance into the World Trade Organization.
Doing New York's bidding is Delta Air Lines, which wants to fly to
Beijing from JFK. Delta executives argue that New York's size and
economic importance so outweigh Chicago's as to make the decision
an easy one. American Airlines, which would fly from O'Hare to
Shanghai, responds that Chicago's location trumps demographics.
This contest, however, comes with a twist: Chicago and New York

   MISSILE-DEFENSE (Washington) _ Supporters of the proposed
National Missile Defense program argue that the system's
embarrassing test failure last weekend wasn't caused by any
fundamental flaw in the weapon. The Pentagon says the test flopped
because the booster rocket _ a Minuteman missile refurbished by
Lockheed Martin Corp. _ failed to jettison its cargo, a ``kill
vehicle'' that was to have homed in on a dummy warhead in outer
space. Sen. John Kyl, R-Ariz, called the test ``disappointing,''
but added that ``the primary failure had to do with a technology
that is not a new technology, that is, separating a booster from
its payload. There is nothing about this latest test that would be
definitive about not proceeding with National Missile Defense.'' By
ERIC ROSENBERG.

America on Saturday. It was the wonderful sound of children _ and

lives up to its high expectations. How does J. K. Rowling do it?
It's no mystery. It's magic. By MARIANNE MEANS

   ``If it smells, put a lid on it,'' goes an old Japanese proverb.
But it is the wrong prescription for the 30-odd lawsuits that have
been lodged in California against Japanese companies such as
Mitsubishi and Mitsui on behalf of many Asians and some Allied
prisoners of war who were forced into slave labor during the Second
World War. For moral, and commercial reasons, Japan should
compensate the victims of its sordid history _ and quickly. &QL;

   The task is vast. Last October Abdurrahman Wahid won the
presidency of one of the world's largest countries, spread across
17,000 islands and with numerous ethnic groups. After a 30-year
dictatorship, Indonesia was rife with corruption. On top of all
that, the country's first democratically elected president
inherited a collapsing economy. Oh, and did we mention that
President Wahid _ affectionately known as Gus Dur _ is half-blind
and weakened by a near-fatal stroke two years ago? All of which
makes it scarcely surprising that Wahid is finding it hard to get
his country moving firmly in a better direction. Yet patience in
Indonesia is running out. Some of the explanation doubtless lies in
unreasonable expectations of this saintly Muslim cleric. Much,
however, is his own fault. &QL;

   (UNDATED) _ Americans used to bowl in leagues. Now they bowl
alone. In New London, Conn., they bowl alone while watching giant
television screens, thus further reducing their changes of forming
meaningful social connections. For Harvard political scientist
Robert Putnam, bowling alone is an extended metaphor for much that
ails both modern America and modern Americans. In his ambitious new
book, ``Bowling Alone,'' he argues that while America has recently
witnessed record growth in physical and human capital, its stock of
``social capital'' _ informal social connectedness and formal civic
engagement _ has fallen dangerously low. &QL;

   (UNDATED) _ Americans used to bowl in leagues. Now they bowl
alone. In New London, Conn., they bowl alone while watching giant
television screens, thus further reducing their changes of forming
meaningful social connections. For Harvard political scientist
Robert Putnam, bowling alone is an extended metaphor for much that
ails both modern America and modern Americans. In his ambitious new
book, ``Bowling Alone,'' he argues that while America has recently
witnessed record growth in physical and human capital, its stock of
``social capital'' _ informal social connectedness and formal civic
engagement _ has fallen dangerously low. &QL;

&HT;     WHEN JET LAG IS A BLESSING 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JOHN FLINN  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONOLULU _ Sometimes jet lag can be your friend. Recently, on
the first morning of a trip to Hawaii, I was wide awake by 4:30
a.m. From the balcony of my Waikiki hotel I could see tiki torches
still flickering along the beach and the pink light of dawn
creeping up behind Diamond Head.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to go back to sleep, I tossed on some clothes and went
for a walk along the beach. I'd expected it to be deserted at this
hour, but it was full of Hawaiian fishermen _ white-haired old men
and teen-agers with elaborate, swirling Polynesian tattoos on their
backs.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are you fishing for?'' I asked a young man.
</P>
<P>
   ``Opakapaka and uku,'' I think he said, using the Hawaiian names
for pink snapper and gray snapper. (I could have gotten it wrong;
the unfamiliar words flew past me.)
</P>
<P>
   ``What about the humuhumunukunukuapua'a?'' I asked. When one
goes to the trouble of committing the name of Hawaii's official
state fish to memory, one works it into the conversation at every
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, brah,'' said the man with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   As the sky lightened I stood and watched the fishermen, who have
been feeding their families from this spot for generations. In a
few hours this same stretch of sand would be festooned with beach
towels, boogie boards and basting tourists, but for the moment it
belonged to the Hawaiians. It was the same piece of real estate,
but at dawn it was an entirely different place.
</P>
<P>
   Long ago I learned that this is, without a doubt, the most
rewarding time of day for sightseeing. In even the most heavily
touristed places on Earth _ and Waikiki is certainly among them _
the cities, villages and beaches are the dominion of the locals
before 8 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   In the hours just after dawn, fruit and vegetable markets spring
to life in market squares and plazas. Old women dressed in black
shuffle out of bakeries with loaves the size of Louisville
Sluggers. By 9 a.m., when eager tourists spill out of their hotels,
it's all over.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, in the Tuscan hill town of San Gimignano, I went out
for a run at dawn. The narrow streets were nearly deserted, and in
the less-visited ``back side'' of the town I came up behind a
garbage truck making its rounds. A strange sound came from the
back, and as I got closer I realized it was one of the garbage men
singing an aria. He grinned broadly and gestured for me to jump
right in and sing along, but all I could do was shrug, smile back
and move on.
</P>
<P>
   By 9 a.m. San Gimignano would be invaded by a convoy of tour
buses, and the town would be transformed once again from a place
where people lived, worked and sang into a tourist attraction.
</P>
<P>
   In Bangkok, the famed floating markets are full of boats selling
cabbage and chiles at 7 a.m.; two hours later, the produce is gone
and the boats re-stock with Fanta soft drinks, counterfeit Rolex
watches and other staples of the tourist trade.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours after arriving in the Thai capital, I went out for a
jet-lagged walk at dawn. The infernal tuk-tuk taxis were silent and
the air was blessedly cool and sweetly scented. Within hours, I
knew, the rising pollution would make my eyes water and the air
would be so hot and humid you'd think you could grab a handful and
wring it out.
</P>
<P>
   I was headed to a 7-Eleven to buy a cup of coffee, and my walk
took me down Patpong Road, Bangkok's notorious red-light district.
(Visitors are often startled to discover that Patpong is located
right in the center of the city; there's a Pizza Hut at one end and
the 7-Eleven I was looking for at the other.)
</P>
<P>
   The last of the drunken tourists had staggered back to their
hotels, and bar girls in streaked catwoman makeup were sitting on
the curb, enjoying a few moments in the cool, fresh air before
heading home to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   For all the wantonness of the sex clubs, it was a surprisingly
sweet scene. As bouncers swept broken glass from bar fights out
into the street, the girls were massaging each other's necks,
braiding each others' hair and giggling over stories. Several were
gathered around a newspaper; as far as I could tell, one was
attempting to teach the others to read.
</P>
<P>
   Two young monks in orange robes came down the street, carrying
their alms bowls. They stopped and chatted with the bar girls.
There was much smiling and laughter; they seemed to know each
other. It was almost impossible to reconcile the scene with
Patpong's lurid nighttime action. Same real estate, different
place.

<P>
   For once, hyperbole is appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   In confounding pollsters and pundits by choosing Vicente Fox as
their next president last Sunday, Mexicans did far more than change
their government. They ended seven decades of rule by the
Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), put a whole era in
Mexico's history behind them and turned their country into a real
democracy at last.
</P>
<P>
   All that is to be celebrated, but so too is the peaceful manner
of the PRI's defeat.
</P>
<P>
   It was always far more than a political party. It was a system
of government and of social organization which had its roots in
every corner of Mexican life. After slowly withering for the past
two decades, one-party rule is now dead.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in Mexico's history, one regime has given way
to another without large-scale bloodshed. For that, and for
overseeing the essential final stage of that process, much credit
goes to President Ernesto Zedillo.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did he create an independent electoral authority, which
ensured that last Sunday's vote was the cleanest ever in Mexico,
passing any reasonable test of freedom and fairness. His swift
acknowledgment on election night of Fox's victory also avoided any
possibility that lingering uncertainty might lead to violence.
</P>
<P>
   It helped, too, that Fox won by a clear margin of some seven
percentage points. That was a personal triumph: his stubborn
campaigning and charisma drew support from far beyond his own
conservative National Action Party (PAN).
</P>
<P>
   Both the victor and his voters carry messages about the deeper
meaning of Mexico's election.
</P>
<P>
   Fox is in many ways an untypical Mexican politician. Of
immigrant descent (with an Irish grandfather and a Spanish mother),
he is a Jesuit-educated Catholic, a man who in a different country
would be a Christian Democrat, but who has built bridges to the
left with some populist touches.
</P>
<P>
   He is also a rugged individualist, a businessman whose career
has included a stint running Coca-Cola's Mexican operation. Those
who voted for Fox were disproportionately young, urban and
better-educated.
</P>
<P>
   In a real sense, therefore, his victory personifies the dynamic,
emerging Mexico being molded by the North American Free-Trade
Agreement (NAFTA) _ a Mexico which, for all its social problems and
inequalities, is now less suspicious of the free market and of the
United States than it has been in the recent past.
</P>
<P>
   But this was a vote, too, against the PRI. Despite the reforms
of the past three presidents, and despite Zedillo's success in
restoring economic growth after the peso's collapse in 1994-95,
average real incomes in Mexico are still below their 1982 level,
and inequality, corruption and crime have flourished.
</P>
<P>
   Fox now carries a heavy burden of expectations _ not least
because, under the PRI, Mexico made kings of its presidents for
their six-year terms (and nobodies thereafter).
</P>
<P>
   In office, he will command enormous powers of patronage. He
should resist the temptation to use them, and instead devolve power
away from the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   That means, for example, turning Mexican federalism from fiction
to fact by fulfilling his promise to give more power to the states
and to municipal governments, though without creating new fiscal
burdens.
</P>
<P>
   Fox this week promised to make tackling corruption his priority.
That is needed and welcome, but reform of the PRI state should mean
more than that. It means turning a venal bureaucracy into a
professional civil service, instilling a new ethos of independence
into a politicized judiciary, and drumming both professionalism and
integrity into corrupt and incompetent police forces.
</P>
<P>
   The new president faces other challenges, too. Sustaining
economic growth, especially given the likelihood of a slowdown in
the United States, which takes 90 percent of Mexico's exports, will
require further reform _ urgently so in the energy sector, which
remains a state monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   During the campaign, Fox backed away from earlier plans to
privatize Pemex, the state oil company. But, rightly, he wants to
end its monopoly, and to open up the electricity market too.
</P>
<P>
   The third challenge lies in turning the state into an instrument
of social progress. Mexico needs to spend more, but more wisely, on
education and health. That means raising taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Past governments have depended too much on milking Pemex. But
the most effective tax reform would involve abolishing VAT
exemptions, such as those on food. This would hit the poor hard;
they will need help.
</P>
<P>
   Fourth, many Mexicans who might otherwise be sympathetic to Fox
are scared by his social conservatism, his opposition to abortion
and his party's clerical roots. He needs to reassure them that he
will not be illiberal in such matters.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his clear mandate for change, Fox faces some big
handicaps. Unlike his predecessors, he did not win a majority of
the votes cast. And although the PAN has displaced the PRI as the
largest party in Congress, it lacks an overall majority.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the PRI still controls many state governments. Fox
could face sabotage from officials who fear they might suffer in a
clean-up.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, more than most parties, the PRI may find that its
traditional strength will be sapped by opposition. And by
signalling his intention to form a government of national unity, in
which he may include individuals from all parties, Fox is doing
more than send a message of continuity to the markets.
</P>
<P>
   He may be trying to redraw Mexico's political map. Fox's
election thus promises many welcome changes. But there are some
risks. One lies in the fact that Fox is not due to take office
until Dec. 1. That five-month gap is a legacy of the old system,
and it has often bred turbulence.
</P>
<P>
   Encouragingly, Fox and Zedillo have both pledged to do
everything they can to ensure a smooth handover. Even so, Mexico's
democratic era will start not a moment too soon. &QL;

<P>
   ``If it smells, put a lid on it,'' goes an old Japanese proverb.
But it is the wrong prescription for the 30-odd lawsuits that have
been lodged in California against Japanese companies such as
Mitsubishi and Mitsui on behalf of many Asians and some Allied
prisoners of war who were forced into slave labor during the Second
World War.
</P>
<P>
   The response of both the government and the companies to all
such claims has been to point to the 1951 San Francisco peace
treaty. Besides waiving ``all reparation claims of the Allied
Powers, other claims of the Allied Powers and their nationals''
against Japan, the treaty empowered the allies to seize Japanese
property to pay reparations to former servicemen.
</P>
<P>
   By 1952, America had seized $90 million of Japanese assets and
paid some of it to former prisoners of war.
</P>
<P>
   Germany made no such settlement after its defeat, says Japan, so
the $5.2 billion fund organized by its government last year to
compensate wartime slave laborers is not a precedent.
</P>
<P>
   This hard-line defense has fended off lawsuits in Japan itself.
But it may not work in California.
</P>
<P>
   As German firms have found to their cost, there is now a
well-organized lobby with political clout in America. The shameless
theatrics of Edward Fagan, the American lawyer who championed the
reparation claims against the German companies, look ominous.
</P>
<P>
   Fagan launched his class-action suit against the Japanese
companies on the anniversary of Pearl Harbor in December. There is
certainly an unappealing whiff of blackmail about these latest
suits.
</P>
<P>
   Yet a quick settlement of them is in all likelihood in Japan's
commercial interests. Otherwise the hostility that has begun to
build in America, where Japanese exporters sell so many goods,
could do serious damage.
</P>
<P>
   A settlement would also be morally right, despite the passing of
time. The surviving laborers, especially the many who were not
POWs, have a strong case for compensation from somebody: the
question is who.
</P>
<P>
   To land the bill on today's shareholders seems capricious. In
many cases, the companies and their managers changed when Japan's
prewar zaibatsu were broken up. And it is hard to argue that
today's shareholders have reaped huge benefits from uncompensated
slave labor.
</P>
<P>
   The underlying perpetrator of these and other crimes was the
then government; it is right that its successor should settle
claims today, although companies might be invited to make voluntary
contributions to any settlement fund.
</P>
<P>
   There is another good argument for such a government-organized
settlement. Demands for reparations are becoming entangled with the
whole question of Japan's war guilt and contrition.
</P>
<P>
   One bill before America's House of Representatives demands,
along with reparations, an apology from Japan for its war actions;
California's state government has also asked for an ``unambiguous
apology.''
</P>
<P>
   Exasperated Japanese officials maintain that the country has
already satisfied foreigners wanting apologies. But the wording of
these apologies suggests that the government is still seeking a
compromise with those in Japan who are struggling to come to terms
with the facts of Japanese history.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, a stream of senior Japanese politicians has
found it necessary to deny colonial brutality in Korea, the rape of
Nanking in China or the ill-effects of Japanese expansion in Asia.
The current prime minister, Yoshiro Mori, has himself wondered
aloud in parliament whether Japan really launched a war of
aggression against its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   It is no wonder that allied prisoners of war, Asian slave
laborers, ``comfort women'' and other victims should still be
seeking justice. A government-sponsored settlement would be a
welcome sign that Japan is at last coming to terms with its past. &QL;

TIME'S RUNNING OUT FOR INDONESIA'S FIRST DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT

<P>
   The task is vast. Last October Abdurrahman Wahid was given the
presidency of one of the world's largest countries, spread across
17,000 islands and with numerous ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
   Run as a dictatorship for more than 30 years, Indonesia was rife
with corruption, desperately short of honest judges and policemen,
and full of groups with the money, the arms and the influence to
cause trouble.
</P>
<P>
   On top of all that, the country's first democratically elected
president inherited an economy crippled by a collapsing currency,
collapsing banks and companies collapsing under their debts.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and by the way, President Wahid is half-blind and was
weakened by a near-fatal stroke two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   All of which makes it scarcely surprising that Gus Dur, as
President Wahid is affectionately known, is finding it hard to get
his country moving firmly in a better direction.
</P>
<P>
   Separatist and interreligious violence refuses to die down,
especially in Aceh and the Moluccas, where this week a state of
emergency had to be declared. Gus Dur has even let it be known that
he blames some members of the ``political elite'' for inciting some
of the violence.
</P>
<P>
   Economic growth has begun to sputter back into life, but the
improvement is too recent, fragile and small to have yet made much
difference to the lives of ordinary Indonesians.
</P>
<P>
   Corruption remains a festering sore. No senior people from the
old dictatorial regime of President Suharto have yet been found
guilty or even brought to court. This week bombs were found in the
offices of the attorney-general, Marzuki Darusman, the man leading
the anti-corruption investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Gus Dur needs to be given time to get a grip on all this; a
country in this sort of condition cannot be changed overnight. Yet
the patience of other politicians, of the media, even of his own
supporters is running out.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the explanation doubtless lies in unreasonable
expectations of the magic that this saintly Muslim cleric could
provide. Some lies in the ambitions of political rivals who would
be happy to profit from his failure.
</P>
<P>
   Much, however, is his own fault. In recent months, he has done
little to earn the patience even of his sympathizers, and much to
infuriate them.
</P>
<P>
   In the next few weeks, President Wahid will face a series of
political tests. He has been called before parliament to explain
his abrupt dismissal earlier this year of two economics ministers.
</P>
<P>
   And in August a meeting of the full parliament, designated as a
constitutional assembly, will meet to hear his report on the state
of the nation and to decide, as it is empowered to do, whether to
allow him to continue as president.
</P>
<P>
   He will probably survive these tests, but on sufferance. He
would greatly strengthen his position, both before and after the
assembly meets, if he were to do two things.
</P>
<P>
   The first sounds simple: reshuffle his cabinet, particularly the
economic portfolios. The Jakarta rumor mill has it that this has
already been made possible by a deal between the main power brokers
in the government _ his vice-president, Megawati Sukarnoputri, and
Akbar Tandjung, who heads Golkar, part of the governing coalition.
</P>
<P>
   President Wahid has had to govern with a cabinet largely imposed
on him by his coalition partners. Now, they want to give him a
freer hand, which is welcome, though it comes with a sting: if he
now fails, all the fault can be laid at his door.
</P>
<P>
   Even Amien Rais, a rabble-rouser who will chair the August
assembly and is one of the president's fiercest critics, appears to
accept that, after this reshuffle, Wahid should be given a further
year.
</P>
<P>
   Gus Dur needs to exploit this opportunity. He is a famously
wily, ambiguous character who likes to get his way by dividing, or
baffling, his opponents. This has worked well in his efforts to
gain control of the armed forces. But it is proving disastrous in
economic matters.
</P>
<P>
   He has set up a series of councils of advisers to act as a
parallel source of thinking to the ministries, but has left even
the councils baffled as to who is in charge of what. The ministers
are either inadequate, or undermined by the councils and the
president, or both.
</P>
<P>
   A vigorous reshuffle, bringing in new economics ministers who
are competent and who clearly have the president's backing, offers
the only chance for a new start that could stabilize the currency,
privatize the piles of nationalized assets, and clear a huge
backlog of disputed corporate debts.
</P>
<P>
   The second thing that Gus Dur must do concerns corruption. Even
if the task of reestablishing the rule of law is vast, he must show
businesses and the public at large that his government is moving
decisively in the right direction.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest obstacles to that is the perception _ so far
justified _ that nothing much has changed from the bad old days of
Suharto. The powerful still act with impunity and use bribes or
muscles to get their way.
</P>
<P>
   President Wahid needs rapidly to show that this is going to
change, by bringing one of the most notoriously corrupt to court,
and thence to prison. Ex-President Suharto himself would be a fine
place to start, but failing that one of his family would do.
</P>
<P>
   In his wily way, President Wahid knows full well the power of a
demonstrative act. He cannot fight every battle simultaneously. But
he needs to make some impressive moves and achieve some more
victories.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, in a year from now, Gus Dur will be out of office.
And the alternatives are far from promising. &QL;

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ Americans may come to look back on 2000 as a
decisive political year. The reason will not be the election of
President Gore or President Bush, but the election of President
Fox.
</P>
<P>
   The victory of Vicente Fox in Mexico seems like a vindication of
Americans' belief in the possibility of worldwide political
progress.
</P>
<P>
   It would be too much to say that the man who persuaded Mexicans
to drink Coca-Cola has now got them to swallow another American
export, since democracy is neither specifically American, nor a
fizzy consumable _ and there is always a chance that the vanquished
PRI may return.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Fox's victory is another big stride away from autocracy,
following the victories of opposition parties in South Korea and
Taiwan in the past three years and the spread of democracy
throughout Latin America and Eastern Europe in the past two
decades.
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, this week's election marks the moment when the
worldwide trend towards greater democratization washed back over
the Rio Grande.
</P>
<P>
   There are around 20 million Mexicans in America, making it
easily the most important mother country for immigrants. Mexicans
are also the fastest growing group of new American citizens,
accounting for a fifth of the total. As a result, their country is
becoming a touchstone of sorts for the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Fostering relations with Mexico has become a way for American
politicians to display their credentials as people mindful of
America's future as a multi-ethnic nation.
</P>
<P>
   When Gray Davis became governor of California he invited so many
Mexican politicians to his inauguration that people joked it would
have been more convenient to hold the ceremony in Tijuana.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's election came one day after the moment when whites
officially became a minority in California. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (75-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 300) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Nothing represents the growing domestic significance of Mexico
better than the family history of the Bushes.
</P>
<P>
   Prescott Bush, a senator from Connecticut, epitomized the
Waspish traditions of the Eastern Seaboard. George Bush began the
drift to the Southwest by moving to Texas.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush, with his halting Spanish, won 49 percent of the
Latino vote on reelection as governor of Texas partly by reaching
out towards Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   His nephew, George P. Bush, whose mother is Mexican and who
speaks fluent Spanish, represents the next stage. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,050) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Mexico's significance in American domestic politics
has grown over many years. That has nothing to do with Fox. But his
triumph owes much to one vital event in that process.
</P>
<P>
   It was, in part, a vote for the North American Free-Trade
Agreement (NAFTA) and, by extension, it is a vindication of the
strategy of successive American presidents of seeking to influence
foreign countries' behavior by opening up their markets to trade.
</P>
<P>
   That trade tends to promote freedom is often doubted _ most
recently at the time of the congressional vote to grant permanent
normal trade relations to China this June.
</P>
<P>
   Trade liberalization is obviously not a sufficient condition for
democracy, since there are free-trading autocracies. But as the
Mexican vote suggests, trade and freedom are disposed to go
together.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a case in which the political elite chose to open up to
trade against their own narrow self-interest. Once trade
liberalization is achieved, political liberalization can be kept at
bay only at an ever-higher cost.
</P>
<P>
   Though the parallels between Mexico and China should not be
pressed far, it is worth remembering that 25 years before Mexico
signed NAFTA, it had a Tiananmen Square massacre of its own.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968 the president ordered his troops to open fire on
students protesting in Mexico City. Hundreds died. And though
Mexico's authoritarian history is not nearly as long as China's,
its habits of government antedate even the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's victory makes it that much harder to argue that any
country's political traditions or habits of thought leave it
invulnerable to economic liberalization. For the Chinese Communist
Party, too, this was an important election.
</P>
<P>
   This is all very satisfactory for the United States. But not
entirely so. Some consequences of this week's election will be
uncomfortable for America, however desirable for Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the American relationship with its southern neighbor
has been a partnership of unequals, with Mexico the prickly,
reluctant supplicant, America the condescending benefactor.
</P>
<P>
   This had advantages for the United States. It could negotiate
bilateral deals with the Mexican president with the expectation
that they would be implemented in full, without any subsequent
revisions. NAFTA is a good example.
</P>
<P>
   That will change. In a democratic Mexico, the new president will
be more constrained by his local constituencies and Washington will
find it harder to get its way. Relations with Mexico will become
negotiations of political equals _ more like those with Germany (on
a good day) or France (on a bad one).
</P>
<P>
   In the long term, this must mean rethinking American policy
towards its southern neighbor. The two countries now talk past one
another. America wants to discuss drugs and illegal immigration.
Mexico wants to discuss legal migration, poverty, foreign
investment and trade flows.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps one day the two will be able to have a rational
discussion about immigration. Perhaps one day the border between
the two will be as airy and open as that with Canada.
</P>
<P>
   This would be no bad thing. But the impact will be a balance of
gains and losses, not an unalloyed benefit.
</P>
<P>
   The transformation of Mexico into a real democracy may even
subtly change how Americans see their place in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must always remember,'' said John McCain earlier this year,
``that America is a beacon of hope and freedom.'' This notion _
that America is engaged in a battle for democracy _ runs deep. It
plays a vital role in maintaining the domestic constituency for the
country's continued engagement in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's election, which leaves the United States as just one part
of a North American democracy that stretches from the Arctic Circle
to well below the Tropic of Cancer, is another victory in that
crusade.
</P>
<P>
   Yet paradoxically, this crusade's growing success may make it
harder to keep alive the idea that America is a special beacon. For
how can you do that as more and more countries get lights of their
own? &QL;

invulnerable to economic liberalization. For the Chinese Communist
Party, too, this was an important election.
</P>
<P>
   This is all very satisfactory for the United States. But not
entirely so. Some consequences of this week's election will be
uncomfortable for America, however desirable for Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the American relationship with its southern neighbor
has been a partnership of unequals, with Mexico the prickly,
reluctant supplicant, America the condescending benefactor.
</P>
<P>
   This had advantages for the United States. It could negotiate
bilateral deals with the Mexican president with the expectation
that they would be implemented in full, without any subsequent
revisions. NAFTA is a good example.
</P>
<P>
   That will change. In a democratic Mexico, the new president will
be more constrained by his local constituencies and Washington will
find it harder to get its way. Relations with Mexico will become
negotiations of political equals _ more like those with Germany (on
a good day) or France (on a bad one).
</P>
<P>
   In the long term, this must mean rethinking American policy
towards its southern neighbor. The two countries now talk past one
another. America wants to discuss drugs and illegal immigration.
Mexico wants to discuss legal migration, poverty, foreign
investment and trade flows.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps one day the two will be able to have a rational
discussion about immigration. Perhaps one day the border between
the two will be as airy and open as that with Canada.
</P>
<P>
   This would be no bad thing. But the impact will be a balance of
gains and losses, not an unalloyed benefit.
</P>
<P>
   The transformation of Mexico into a real democracy may even
subtly change how Americans see their place in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must always remember,'' said John McCain earlier this year,
``that America is a beacon of hope and freedom.'' This notion _
that America is engaged in a battle for democracy _ runs deep. It
plays a vital role in maintaining the domestic constituency for the
country's continued engagement in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's election, which leaves the United States as just one part
of a North American democracy that stretches from the Arctic Circle
to well below the Tropic of Cancer, is another victory in that
crusade.
</P>
<P>
   Yet paradoxically, this crusade's growing success may make it
harder to keep alive the idea that America is a special beacon. For
how can you do that as more and more countries get lights of their
own? &QL;

   NEW YORK _ America's 400 teaching hospitals may not immediately
resemble ``Tom Brown's Schooldays,'' but for young resident
doctors, life at a 19th-century English public school might seem
familiar.
</P>
<P>
   As new boys (and girls), young trainee doctors are expected to
work until they drop, often completing 100-hour weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Once they have qualified, the Flashmans then go on to inflict
the same dire regime on the next generation of young doctors,
telling them that, yes, it will be good for them too.
</P>
<P>
   Being one of America's 100,000 medical interns or residents is
certainly a hard life. Lack of sleep is the most common complaint.
But there are others.
</P>
<P>
   A survey published in the Journal of the American Medical
Association in 1998 found that 93 percent of trainee doctors
experienced at least one incident of mistreatment by a teacher, and
more than half reported episodes of being belittled or humiliated
by more senior physicians.
</P>
<P>
   Around 70 percent of the trainees reported seeing colleagues
working in an impaired condition, most often caused by lack of
sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Young surgeons seem particularly exposed to overwork and
harassment. Last year, the National Labor Relations Board
overturned an earlier ruling that prevented American trainee
doctors at private hospitals from joining trade unions. (Residents
have been allowed to join unions at public hospitals for some time,
but more than 90 percent of them learn their trade at private
hospitals.)
</P>
<P>
   The original ruling, handed down in 1976, officially classified
medical residents as ``students'' rather than ``employees.'' Now
they are free to organize themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The Association of American Medical Colleges, which opposed the
NLRB decision, worries that the threat of strikes or binding
arbitration will undermine the educational mission of hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan Cohen, the AAMC's president, calls binding arbitration an
``abhorrent idea'' that would violate the trust between student and
teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Some studies, such as one conducted in 1988 by surgeons at the
Medical College of Wisconsin, have come up with the implausible
conclusion that sleep loss had no apparent effect on their
trainees' cognitive performance.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps no one should be surprised. Surgeons, the most brutal
taskmasters by most measures, are predisposed against finding fault
with the system.
</P>
<P>
   The medical establishment still holds most of the trump cards.
Senior physicians have enormous power over a trainee's future
career. But pressure for change may be mounting.
</P>
<P>
   Medical residents are complaining that a longstanding New York
state law limiting their hours to a mere 80 hours a week has been
ineffective, and the state health department has repeatedly fined
hospitals for violations.
</P>
<P>
   Around 400 residents at two private New York hospitals recently
voted to join the Committee of Interns and Residents, a union
affiliated with the Service Employees International Union which
already represents 10,000 people (mostly from public hospitals).
</P>
<P>
   According to Michael Phelan, CIR's organizing director, the
response of residents in the private sector to the NLRB decision
has been ``phenomenal.''
</P>
<P>
   The union has gained nearly 1,000 new members since the NLRB
ruling, and the number of inquiries received by the union from
interested doctors has tripled. All this could lead to increased
leverage for the union movement in America's teaching hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Patients might gain if unionization occurs. At a public forum
last year, hundreds of New York medical residents confessed that
fatigue had led to close calls.
</P>
<P>
   A Veterans Affairs Medical Center study back in 1991 found that
changing work schedules to give doctors more rest resulted in 29
percent fewer errors to do with medication.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, staff costs for hospitals would rise if trainees
worked shorter hours. But the Veterans study also showed that
gentler schedules could cut the amount of time patients spend in
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, a small chink opened up in the medical establishment's
armor. The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education,
which oversees the training of American doctors, cited nearly one
in three of the programs it reviews for violating existing
standards for working hours.
</P>
<P>
   Surgical programs came in for a particular pasting, with more
than half the pediatric surgery programs exceeding the maximum
allowable hours on duty.
</P>
<P>
   The CIR smells a rat: it thinks the new enforcement efforts
might be a Flashman-like ploy to reduce the appeal of unions. But
most young doctors will be grateful for respite of any sort. &QL;

 FRUSTRATION FORCING MANY IN MEDICINE TO SEEK NEW FIELDS  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE BARNARD AND KATHRYN TONG  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ilene Cohen designs software. David Chung founded an Internet
start-up. Rod Altman helps pick investments for a venture capital
company. Gigi Hirsch is a career consultant, and Stephen Sherwin
runs a $33 million biotechnology firm.
</P>
<P>
   Their workdays, incomes, ages, and aspirations may differ, but
they have one thing in common: They're all doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Frustration over managed care _ coupled with exploding
opportunities in Internet ventures, medical technology, biotech,
and finance _ is spurring more and more physicians to try careers
in other fields, doctors and medical organizations say.
</P>
<P>
   Some go looking for autonomy, creativity, status, and financial
reward, the hallmarks that once attracted them to the medical
profession but now seem to be ebbing away. Others sense the
excitement in new high-tech fields and want to be a part of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were many people walking around in health care who
couldn't wait to get out,'' said Altman, 37. He recently left a
gritty Chicago-area emergency room for a high-rise office
overlooking the Charles River in Boston, where he sifts through
business proposals from health care start-ups. ``I get up every
morning and can't wait to get to work. Can't wait.''
</P>
<P>
   For doctors who slogged their way through costy medical
schools, exhausting residencies, and years of clinical practice,
such career moves were once practically unheard of. And they are
still accompanied by a great deal of soul-searching. Cohen, 44, who
left internal medicine last year and now designs software for
cardiology tests, likened the switch to ``leaving the priesthood.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet a recent survey of 300 doctors over age 50 found that 10
percent were planning to seek jobs outside clinical practice,
according to Merritt, Hawkins &AMP; Associates, a national physician
headhunting firm. Of physicians who planned to stop working with
patients or to retire, 48 percent cited managed care as a
significant reason. That trend is making it harder for hospitals to
recruit top specialists, said company spokesman Phil Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a small but growing number of young doctors are
postponing, skipping or curtailing residency training _ or leaving
just after residency _ to start businesses, join Internet start-ups
or work as consultants.
</P>
<P>
   Companies, in turn, are taking a new look at doctors as a pool
of intellectual capital: In the last five years, McKinsey &AMP; Co. and
the Boston Consulting Group have begun recruiting at medical
schools nationwide. Hirsch quit psychiatry to found a company that
helps such firms locate and hire physicians.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps surprisingly, these trends are meeting little resistance
or concern from the established medical community, which seems to
view them as a sign that doctors and educators are adapting to the
changing health care landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Some doctors even believe that the profession's current troubles
are weeding out people who went into medicine for status and
wealth, and leaving only those who are genuinely interested in
helping patients.
</P>
<P>
   Boston-area physicians who changed careers disputed that, saying
they acted partly out of disillusionment. They found they had less
time for patients, did more grunt work, and got less intellectual
stimulation out of following treatment recipes that increasingly
are written by insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Society in many ways has devalued medical practice,'' said
Mark Goldberg, 40, a former radiologist at Massachusetts General
Hospital. He is now vice president of Parexel International Corp.,
a Waltham, Mass. firm that applies computer imaging to medical
research. Twenty years ago, he said, the ideal role model was a
physician; now it's Bill Gates.
</P>
<P>
   Ali Binazir, 28, horrified his parents when, fresh out of
medical school and more than $80,000 in debt, he decided to get a
job in the burgeoning Internet economy. ``The prospect of spending
another four years in residency at subhuman wages and being treated
like chattel didn't appeal to me,'' he said. ``They say there's a
pot of gold at the end _ I don't see it.''
</P>
<P>
   Complaints about managed care and the lure of the new economy
are being blamed for three straight years of declining medical
school applications, according to the Association of American
Medical Colleges. Applications declined 6 percent in 1999, to
38,534.
</P>
<P>
   But the 14 doctors interviewed by the Globe about their flight
from medical practice also cited more subtle reasons for their
moves. Many said they believed they could have a broader impact on
health care outside traditional patient care.
</P>
<P>
   ``We as physicians never got to make any macro decisions. We
never got to decide what was in the basket of goods and services
that could be delivered to patients,'' said Altman, who worked 10
years as an emergency room doctor and now evaluates health care
business plans for TVM Techno Venture Management in Cambridge,
Mass.
</P>
<P>
   He added that he took a small pay cut to make the switch, and
noted that while venture capital could be more lucrative in the
long run than medicine, it is also riskier.
</P>
<P>
   Younger doctors in particular see no contradiction in weaving
business into their careers, and do not view themselves as
abandoning medicine. Traditional nonclinical paths, such as working
for drug companies, no longer have the stigma they once had, said
John Lacey, a spokesman for Harvard Medical School.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-eight of the country's 125 medical schools offered joint
MD-MBA programs in 1998, with 143 students enrolled _ up from 16
programs with 78 students the year before. MBA programs for
established physicians have multiplied in the last decade from one
or two to around a dozen.
</P>
<P>
   As for the new, high-tech medical fields, the Stanford
University School of Medicine actively encourages students to
explore them and to become entrepreneurs. This fall it will begin
giving credit for rotations at private firms, such as biotechnology
and medical instrument companies.
</P>
<P>
   Of Stanford's 89 MD graduates this year, two joined consulting
firms, three headed to business school and one to a medical device
firm. Those numbers are expected to increase next year, said senior
associate dean Phyllis Gardner, who herself took time out from
medicine to work at a start-up.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Shen, 27, has taken time off from his Stanford medical
schooling to get an engineering degree and help design a device for
treating strokes. He plans to get an MBA as well and become ``a
bridge between physicians and engineers.'' Working in medicine full
time, he said, he wouldn't have time envision new devices; yet his
medical education will be indispensable to understanding what
devices are needed.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, David Chung, 29, founded Beansprout.net, a Web site
for pediatricians and parents, during his pediatrics residency at
Children's Hospital. He now plans to practice in Brockton three
days a week and work two days a week at Beansprout. He said that at
any given time in his residency program, a half-dozen young doctors
were working on side business ventures, even as they covered
overnight shifts in the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Hospitals, meanwhile, are not alarmed at the trend, said Debra
Weinstein, who oversees residency programs at MGH and Brigham and
Women's Hospital in Boston. She defined residency's mission as
``training people to be leaders in a variety of medical fields.''
As an example, she pointed to Richard Peters, a former MGH resident
who cofounded MedNav.com to make Internet networks for hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   People were not always so understanding. Stephen Sherwin, CEO of
Cell Genesys, a California biotech company that researches cancer
vaccines, graduated from Harvard Medical School in 1974. His
interest in research led him first to the National Cancer
Institute, then to a private firm where he felt he could take a
more active role in directing drug research. Few of his colleagues
identified with his choice. In 1984, a 10th reunion booklet listed
him as an ``industrial physician,'' a moniker that conjured up ``an
unfortunate soul doing worker's comp physicals,'' Sherwin said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he was able to do research without begging for grants,
as well as profit from getting into biotech on the ground floor.
His first company went from 150 employees to 1,500. Later Sherwin
helped create Cell Genesys, which recently raised $250 million by
selling shares in a spinoff called Abgenix. That is a staggering
amount of capital for researching new cancer cures, he said: ``In
some ways it's just another way of being a doctor.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Solit, 33, might not have put it quite that strongly
when he joined the consulting giant McKinsey &AMP; Co. shortly after
completing a residency at Thomas Jefferson University in
Philadelphia. But he did dream that a financial job would allow him
to help the medical industry negotiate the difficulties of managed
care.
</P>
<P>
   Reality so far has been more complicated: After consulting for
several drug companies and one managed-care organization, he said,
``I've done nothing that would directly impact the physician
dilemma.'' One problem, he said, is doctors' adversarial attitude
toward managed care.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Cheryl Tessler, 29, also an MD, went to McKinsey for a
different reason: She did not want to enter a 90-hour-per-week
residency while caring for an infant daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Ilene Cohen, too, was thinking of her personal life when she
gave up a beloved internal medicine practice at Mount Auburn
Hospital in Cambridge to design software for Bard Electrophysiology
in Lowell, Mass. She traded a maple-furnished office for a cubicle
at half the pay. But every day, she takes her lunch to a picnic
table _ something she almost never had time for in 12 years of
practice. The other day, she even played table tennis with
colleagues. ``I could not believe this was happening to me,'' she
said. ``I have entered another universe.''

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ Freedom is one of those words that politicians bandy
around a great deal over the July 4th holiday. Few practical
freedoms seem to matter to Americans more than the ability to drive
their own set of wheels wherever they want, whenever they want _
and to have cheap gasoline to do it.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, gas is suddenly not nearly as cheap as Americans
would like; and even though this is probably a temporary
phenomenon, it is already causing a political fuss.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, prices at the pump have soared to record highs
(in nominal terms at least). In parts of the country, they have
gone past $2 a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers have been full of pictures of mournful car drivers
staring at gas pump nozzles and faded images of their parents
queuing for gas during the Carter years.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders in Congress want to scrap the tiny federal
tax on gasoline (about 18 cents a gallon) altogether. Indiana and
Illinois have suspended their tiny state taxes. Both Al Gore and
George W. Bush have responded to the ``crisis'' by saying how much
they hate high gas prices.
</P>
<P>
   In one way, the American motorist's outrage has already cured
itself. The high level of gas prices in America is the chief reason
why Saudi Arabia shocked the oil markets this week by announcing
unilaterally that it would release more oil shortly.
</P>
<P>
   In part, this was a simple commercial decision: the American
economy is the goose that lays the golden egg for OPEC, and
sustained high energy prices threaten to drag the miracle economy
into recession.
</P>
<P>
   Another part of the answer, though, lies in politics: Saudi
Arabia relies heavily on American goodwill and soldiers for
protection from Iraqi bogeyman Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   Although this dependence embarrasses the Saudis in front of
militant brethren like Iran, it is also why they always take the
angry phone calls from Bill Richardson, America's energy secretary,
demanding lower prices.
</P>
<P>
   Does this mean that energy policy will soon fade from the
political landscape? Not necessarily. One reason is that drivers
may not see much relief before the summer is over.
</P>
<P>
   Unless this week's news prompts a split in the cartel and so a
collapse in crude-oil prices, retail-gasoline prices in America may
not drop dramatically before the end of the summer driving season.
</P>
<P>
   There is also likely to be another burst of consumer outrage as
America's overloaded and decaying electricity grid succumbs to
blackouts, like the one that plunged parts of Northern California's
Silicon Valley into darkness a few weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Colder weather will bring little relief: natural-gas prices are
also soaring, and low stocks of heating oil suggest a possible
repeat of last year's winter oil-price crunch.
</P>
<P>
   This week President Bill Clinton vowed to create a
home-heating-oil reserve for the Northeastern states.
</P>
<P>
   In Gore's case in particular, there are good reasons to keep oil
prices in the spotlight: they provide an easy link to Bush's ties
to the oil industry, which is currently making record profits. Gore
has already come out fighting, blaming the price spike on the Big
Oil pals of his rival.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has ordered the Federal Trade
Commission to investigate possible price-gouging in Midwestern
states, where price hikes have been steepest.
</P>
<P>
   Forced into a corner, Bush has also meekly voiced support for
the FTC enquiry. He himself pins the blame for the recent price
increases on costly environmental mandates for cleaner gas ordered
by the federal government (by implication: Gore). In this, he has
just been joined by the state of Wisconsin, which has filed a
federal lawsuit to overturn the federal orders.
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates are being outstandingly hypocritical. For Bush,
who has openly campaigned to defend the interests of the oil
industry, to go suddenly weak at the knees about high oil prices is
bizarre.
</P>
<P>
   How Gore, the author of ``Earth in the Balance'' and a keen
proponent of ridding the world of the internal-combustion engine,
can piously insist that he also believes in low energy prices
beggars belief.
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, it is not just the two candidates who are talking
rot. The energy industry has once again issued warnings that
America must no longer remain ``hostage'' to foreign oil: it thus
needs not only subsidies but also permission to drill in pristine
wilderness.
</P>
<P>
   Such arguments ignore the fact that the crude-oil market is
global: no American firm is selling its crude any lower than the
world price. And even if America pumped all the oil trapped in
forbidden areas, it would not attain the volumes necessary to
dictate world prices.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, what outrages the rest of the world is not how high
American gasoline prices are, but how low.
</P>
<P>
   Today's ``shocking'' prices for gas, adjusted for inflation, are
lower than the prices Americans paid for gas during the oil shock
of two decades ago, and far less than what European or Japanese
drivers pay now.
</P>
<P>
   America guzzles more gas per person than any other big country,
and uses more energy to produce each unit of economic output than
most of its rivals.
</P>
<P>
   If America's politicians were really serious about reducing
OPEC's sway over America, they would consider three things. The
first is tougher fuel-economy rules. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 75 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 900) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The Sierra Club, an influential green lobby, talks about finding
oil by ``drilling under Detroit.'' The group wants Congress to
stiffen the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards, which
have led to a steady improvement in the fuel efficiency of cars.
</P>
<P>
   Greens grouse that light trucks and sport-utility vehicles
(SUVs), which now make up about half of the vehicles sold in the
country, are not subject to the same CAFE standards as cars. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   A second, better way to improve fuel efficiency and reduce
reliance on oil would be to increase taxes (or add a tax based on
the carbon content of fuels). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 150 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 1,000) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Since the oil shocks of the 1970s, Europe's energy efficiency
has soared, and now stands about 50 percent higher than America's.
</P>
<P>
   One anecdote is revealing: the average fuel economy of Ford's
cars sold in Europe is far higher than that of those it sells in
America. As a result of its diminished reliance on the mucky stuff,
Europe has weathered the recent surge in the world oil price much
better than America.
</P>
<P>
   A comprehensive carbon tax that took in other fuels, such as
coal, would be much greener than just gasoline taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is supposed to be a passionate believer in them. Yet even
when Bush's campaign has mockingly produced specific passages from
Gore's book about carbon taxes, the vice president has refused to
admit that they would drive up fuel prices. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,225) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The final option is to do more about public transport. Americans
undoubtedly love to drive. But there is also a distinct lack of
alternatives: outside the older cities on either coast, public
transport in America is usually a farce.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has just put forward his ``Keep America Moving'' scheme,
which he claims is a $25-billion plan to improve, integrate and
expand such public-transport systems as light rail and bus
networks.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has derided these proposals as a mere rehash of tired
Clinton policies. But they are better than anything he has put
forward. &QL;

 HELPING OTHERS QUIT THE MEDICAL FIELD  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE BARNARD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ For at least one doctor-turned-entrepreneur,
physicians' career angst has become a business opportunity in
itself.
</P>
<P>
   As a psychiatric resident at Beth Israel Hospital, Gigi Hirsch
counseled doctors who felt stuck in the wrong career. Then she
realized she was one of them. She left medical practice in 1997 to
found MD IntelliNet, a company that specializes in what she has
dubbed ``physician human capital.''
</P>
<P>
   Running the firm out of her Brookline home, Hirsch, 45, links
doctors with jobs outside traditional physician roles and advises
companies on how to market new products and technologies to
doctors.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first hung out my shingle, some physicians who came to
see me gave me fake names,'' she said in an interview at Zaftigs,
the Harvard Street hangout that serves as her auxiliary office.
``They're not used to talking about career problems. They don't
want to be seen as `not coping well.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Managed care is not the root cause of many doctors'
dissatisfaction, she said. Rather, it has ``brought a lot of career
issues out of the closet'' by destroying the promise of delayed
gratification in the form of money, status and respect.
</P>
<P>
   Many disillusioned doctors stick with the profession, she said,
because their identity is tied to the ``Dr.'' title, or because the
average medical school graduate owes $80,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to be treated by a doctor who doesn't want to
be a doctor,'' Hirsch said. ``It's kind of an ugly thing and no one
wants to talk about this.''
</P>
<P>
   Unsatisfied doctors are more likely to be targeted by
malpractice suits and to file expensive disability claims, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   While there are growing opportunities for doctors in other
fields, it can be surprisingly hard for them to get hired, she
said. Many find networking distasteful, thinking their credentials
speak for themselves. And worse, doctors have an awful reputation
in the business world: arrogant, headstrong, demanding.
</P>
<P>
   But if they do it right, she said, they can ``leverage'' their
medical skills to get relatively high-level jobs in their new
field.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Silverstein, 45, still uses his analytical skills to
``diagnose'' problems, but at Boston Consulting Group, his patients
are now companies, not people. And Rod Altman, a former emergency
room doctor, said his new job in a venture capital firm _ dividing
finite capital among competing start-up proposals _ reminds him a
lot of triage.
</P>
<P>
   Those two got business degrees to move out of medicine, but one
of Hirsch's clients, Ilene Cohen, 44, took a more unusual route:
She taught herself HTML, the Web-design programming language, took
a programming course at Boston University, and was hired by a
medical software company. What she lacked in experience, she made
up for by knowing what doctors would look for in a program.
</P>
<P>
   Hirsch, who has consulted for 1,600 physicians since 1992, also
advises doctors on how to get into part-time activities such as
lecturing, patient advocacy, starting a business, and advising drug
companies. Avoiding conflicts of interest is up to the individual,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   As for her own business venture, Hirsch declined to say whether
it was profitable. ``It's growing,'' she said.

<P>
   COPENHAGEN _ Pushing 70, Ed Thigpen can still play a mean set of
drums.
</P>
<P>
   Which is no surprise, given that he once backed Ella Fitzgerald,
and that he was part of a trio that included Oscar Peterson on
piano and Ray Brown on bass.
</P>
<P>
   Like many aging jazzmen, Thigpen is a gentleman, a dignified
ambassador for his music. But when people here notice his accent
and remark that he is an American, Thigpen gently corrects them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I consider myself an international,'' the courtly drummer said
while sipping spring water at the Copenhagen JazzHouse between
sets.
</P>
<P>
   Thigpen has made Europe in general, and Denmark in particular,
his home for almost 30 years. Europe is a common choice for jazz
artists who say the music is appreciated more outside their _ and
jazz's _ homeland in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``The US denies itself its own heritage,'' Thigpen said.
</P>
<P>
   For black jazz artists, in particular, Europe offers a more
tolerant venue. But race is only one part of the equation. Respect,
says Thigpen, is key. So is the quality of life.
</P>
<P>
   Thigpen admires the socialism of West European democracies such
as Denmark, where people fork over roughly half of their income to
pay for a generous welfare system that dramatically narrows the gap
between rich and poor, and that ensures decent housing, education,
and health care for all.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're more civilized over here,'' Thigpen said, shrugging.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for example, the way Carlsberg, the biggest brewer in
Denmark, underwrites the arts. Carlsberg Breweries, which also owns
the other big beer here, Tuborg, donates about $21 million annually
to Danish arts and sciences. An arm of the brewery, the New
Carlsberg Foundation, donates about $7 million to visual arts each
year.
</P>
<P>
   Carlsberg not only sponsors the annual jazz festival here,
Tuborg also subsidizes the JazzHouse to showcase jazz throughout
the year.
</P>
<P>
   It was poignantly ironic that last week, Ed Thigpen and his band
played a tribute at the JazzHouse to Ernie Wilkins, a St. Louis
native and jazzman who lived, played and recently died in
Copenhagen. Like the legendary Miles Davis, Wilkins hailed from the
home of the King of Beers in America, but while Anheuser-Busch, the
brewers of Budweiser, dwarfs Carlsberg in profits, it doesn't
support jazz like the Danish brewers do, Thigpen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``American business looks at the arts differently than
Europeans, and that's one reason you see jazz supported more over
here, not just by business, but by the government, too,'' Thigpen
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Danish parliament has voted to fund more jazz venues and to
provide more support for existing ones, like JazzHouse. JazzHouse
managers say the club is secure at least for another three years
thanks to the government support.
</P>
<P>
   Danish jazz fans say government support, combined with business
philanthropy, is essential. Annette Flicker, a Dane who is married
to an American lawyer, said Copenhagen's jazz scene in the 1960s
and 1970s rivaled any other spot in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gordon Dexter played here, Kenny Drew. We had a place called
Jazzhouse Montmartre, and Stan Getz started it,'' said Flicker, 56.
</P>
<P>
   But in the 1980s, the once-flourishing jazz scene withered, and
many clubs closed. Now only a handful, like the upscale JazzHouse
and the down-and-dirty La Fontaine, provide a nightly fix for jazz
addicts such as Jens Esmann, 54.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't what it used to be, but on a night like tonight, when
you can see the great Ed Thigpen, no one's complaining.''
</P>
<P>
   Flicker said Danish jazz fans have a special place in their
heart for Thigpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ed moved here about 30 years ago and married a Danish girl.
Not long after, she died, and he was left to bring up the kids
alone. A lot of jazz fans feared that Ed would go back to America
to raise his kids, but he didn't. He stayed here. And he's much
loved for that, and for his music,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   As if on cue, Ed Thigpen called his Danish band on stage and
invoked the name of that gentle man from St. Louis named Ernie
Wilkins.
</P>
<P>
   ``God rest his soul,'' Thigpen said.
</P>
<P>
   And then the band began to wail.

   AMMAN _ Ask the King of Jordan what knowledge he most lacked
when he unexpectedly came to the throne last year, and he explains
how difficult he has found it to work out the hidden agendas and
personal rivalries among his advisers, ministers and court
officials.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, although he does not put it so bluntly himself,
Abdullah II knew little about Jordanian politics. A lifelong
soldier, he had served as crown prince for only a week before his
father, King Hussein, died.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, thanks to his schooling at military academies in Britain
and America, he could barely get by in the language of his
subjects. ``The king's Arabic has improved,'' says one, ``but he
still has trouble with his h's and his r's.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Jordanians were hoping for other improvements too,
especially to their country's stagnant economy and stalled
democratization process. Since 1996, the population has grown at
least twice as fast as the national income.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with this dire economic picture, and with widespread
popular opposition to Jordan's 1994 peace treaty with Israel, King
Hussein spent his last few years trying to rein in the democratic
debate that he had previously encouraged.
</P>
<P>
   At his accession, King Abdullah promised to steer his country
towards free markets and a constitutional monarchy. He strode off
on his reforming tasks with resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Within weeks of his father's death, he went first to the Gulf,
to persuade his wealthy Arab brethren to provide more jobs and aid,
and then to Europe (and sent his finance minister to Japan) to
plead for relief from Jordan's hobbling $8.5 billion debt.
</P>
<P>
   He even persuaded the United States to start negotiations on a
free-trade pact, a rare distinction.
</P>
<P>
   At home, he spoke of turning Jordan into an Arab Singapore, and
prodded his government to reform education to that end.
</P>
<P>
   A new intellectual-property law and lower import duties helped
win the country admittance to the World Trade Organization.
Long-delayed privatizations, of the state-run freight railway and
telephone systems, finally got off the ground, as did much-needed
tax reform.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's Bill Gates, charmed by the king during a meeting of
the World Economic Forum, announced that he would think about
setting up shop in the country.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the regal vigor the king exudes, Jordan remains
stubbornly uninvigorated. The real keys to growth are out of the
government's hands.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli security concerns and the international embargo on Iraq
strangle trade with two of Jordan's closest markets: Iraq and the
West Bank. A huge proportion of the budget goes on debt repayment
and salaries, and there is no easy way of changing this pattern.
Jordan already receives the best deal it can hope for from its
biggest creditors.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, with unemployment at 25 percent, laying off workers
would be political suicide.
</P>
<P>
   When asked how he will get the economy going again, Ali
Abul-Ragheb, the recently appointed prime minister, can think of
nothing more dramatic than following up on the privatization and
trade policies of his predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   On the political front, the record looks equally equivocal. Even
as the king toured the world, confiding his liberal inclinations,
the government in Jordan was hounding critical journalists.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, although the king has condemned the systematic
discrimination against Jordanians of Palestinian origin (who make
up as much as two-thirds of the population), he also took the
controversial step of closing down the local offices of Hamas, a
radical Palestinian group allowed to operate by his father.
</P>
<P>
   A royal adviser who had the temerity to discuss the
Palestinians' role in Jordan's future found himself out of work. An
academic who spoke openly about the king's inexperience also lost
his job.
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, many of these decisions came not from the king
himself, but from his more conservative advisers.
</P>
<P>
   Abdel-Rauf Rawabdeh, King Abdullah's first prime minister, who
revels in the nickname of ``the bulldozer.'' spent his time doling
out jobs to his chums and strong-arming his opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Sami Battikhi, the head of the secret police, has also made his
mark on policy, to the extent of sitting in on the meeting at which
the king appointed Abul-Ragheb.
</P>
<P>
   An old guard of such reform-leery native Jordanians has
succeeded in driving the best-known liberals from office. On the
other hand, King Abdullah stood by and let the old guard have its
way.
</P>
<P>
   He argues that he needed intimidating figures to ensure a smooth
succession, and says that he will now allow more progressive types,
such as Abul-Ragheb, to take center stage.
</P>
<P>
   But King Abdullah preserves a soldier's obsession with security,
talking of shadowy ``extremists'' on the Jordanian political scene,
and hinting darkly at plots to overthrow the present order. He
suggests that he will not concede parliament more power until the
electorate, and their representatives, learn to behave more
responsibly.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Jordan's main political forces, including its prominent
Islamic movement, seem remarkably moderate. But they certainly
differ from King Abdullah in their hostility to the peace treaty
with Israel. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (50-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 850) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Most of the political parties and professional associations have
pursued an aggressive campaign against normal nongovernmental ties
with Israel. Next year's parliamentary elections will doubtless
give this view more publicity, especially if the government sticks
to its promise to alter the electoral law to increase
representation in towns where Palestinians are the majority. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,000) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   King Abdullah's dismissal of anti-peace agitation as a passing
trend that will fade as the economy grows may be overly optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   He has misjudged his people before, most visibly over a laudable
but heavy-handed drive to stamp out the tradition of murdering
young women in the name of family honor.
</P>
<P>
   He sounds more comfortable talking about computer moguls in
Davos than about Islamist politicians in his own country. His
latest initiative, a Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi poster campaign designed to
lift morale, has met with bemusement.
</P>
<P>
   While he has improved his grasp of his subjects' language, he
still seems uneasy with their political views. &QL;

GLOBE COLUMNIST JACOBY SUSPENDED 4 MONTHS FOR `MISCONDUCT' 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (e and k coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Boston Globe suspended editorial page columnist Jeff Jacoby
for four months without pay Friday after concluding that his July 3
column on the fate of the signers of the Declaration of
Independence constituted ``serious journalistic misconduct.''
</P>
<P>
   Editorial page editor Renee Loth, who determined Jacoby's
punishment along with publisher Richard H. Gilman, stopped short of
calling his action ``plagiarism.'' But the paper found that his
July 3 column was based on accounts that have appeared ``in other
publications and books and on Web sites for years'' and failed to
alert readers to those other sources, according to a Globe
statement released Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot look the other way if any of our columnists,
reporters, or writers borrow without attribution from the works of
others, even in an attempt to improve upon it,'' said Gilman in the
statement. ``The Globe will not equivocate in abiding by the
highest journalistic standards and ethics.''
</P>
<P>
   In a brief interview Friday, Jacoby, who carved out a niche as
the conservative voice on the Globe op-ed page, said, ``I've got 6
1/2 years of columns behind me at The Boston Globe, and I invite
anybody to judge my integrity and the care that I take in my work
from the body of work I've produced.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been aware from the outset that I have to be extremely
aware of my column,'' he added, noting that his politics are at
odds with the paper's more liberal opinion pages.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the suspension seemed harsh, Loth said, ``it was a
serious violation of the relationship between the Globe and its
readers. . . . We considered mitigating factors as well as the blow
this is to the Globe's credibility, and we came up with a balanced
response that's proportionate.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacoby becomes the third prominent Globe columnist to face major
sanctions in the past two years. In June 1998, award-winning Metro
columnist Patricia Smith resigned after admitting to fabricating
some characters and quotations. Two months later, veteran Metro
columnist Mike Barnicle resigned after being unable to verify facts
in a 1995 column. At the time, he was under suspension for a column
that contained jokes from George Carlin's book ``BrainDroppings.''
</P>
<P>
   One mitigating factor in Jacoby's favor was an e-mail he
circulated on July 2 containing his July 3 column. It included an
introduction stating the column ``is not a mere rewrite of an
anonymous piece that has been making the rounds on the Internet,''
but an attempt to correct errors in that piece. That e-mail, which
was received by Boston Phoenix media critic Dan Kennedy among
others, suggests Jacoby was not simply trying to replicate the
original story, but to improve upon it.
</P>
<P>
   However, Loth said Jacoby's practice of circulating his column
before publication without Globe permission was factored into his
punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Globe ombudsman Jack Thomas said that as of Friday he had
received more than 125 e-mails and calls concerning Jacoby's July 3
column.
</P>
<P>
   In a response to readers questioning the origin of the piece,
Jacoby wrote in a message now posted on Jim Romenesko's MediaNews
(www.poynter.org) Web site that ``knowing that previous treatments
of the lives-of-the-signers theme contained mistakes and
exaggerations, I tried to take pains not to repeat anything untrue.
. . . In retrospect, I wish I had noted in the column that I am
only the latest in a long line to write about the fate of the
signers.''

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ Could this week mark the great schism that
eventually tears apart OPEC?
</P>
<P>
   Only time will tell. But what is clear is that Saudi Arabia has
decided to lift the veil of pretense, and admit that the cartel is
mere window-dressing for its political and economic agenda, a
convenient fiction to be tolerated in good times but disregarded in
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The oil cartel has a long history of fractious infighting, but
it had recently appeared more harmonious. After watching the price
of crude oil plunge to below $10 a barrel early last year, the
member governments seemed to put aside their differences.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of Mexico and Norway, two outsiders, they slashed
production. When prices shot past $30 a barrel in response, they
agreed to release more oil on to the market in March.
</P>
<P>
   When the price stubbornly refused to go down, they raised
production quotas again in June _ but to little effect, as it
turned out.
</P>
<P>
   Through all the recent ups and downs, Saudi Arabia has worked
hard to win the agreement of its smaller partners. No longer. The
Saudis announced on July 3 that they will unilaterally release
500,000 barrels of crude oil on to the market shortly if prices do
not drop to $25 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   The news caught world oil markets by surprise, and clearly had
the same effect on the rest of OPEC. Oil ministers from other
countries, when quizzed by reporters, seem hazy about what is
happening.
</P>
<P>
   Ali Rodriguez, Venezuela's oil minister and currently OPEC's
president, made himself look more foolish than usual by declaring
that there was ``no idea by any country to raise output
unilaterally.'' He blamed the whole episode on ``journalistic
misinterpretation.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, compared with the Delphic proclamations that the Saudis
usually issue, this week's announcement was unmistakably clear.
</P>
<P>
   Saudi Arabia has dropped the pretense that OPEC is a consensual
body, and is ready to push the market in the direction that best
serves its own interests _ even if that means risking a collapse in
the cartel.
</P>
<P>
   What has forced the Saudi hand? In recent months the problem has
been a shortage not of oil on world markets, but of gasoline in
America's domestic petrol market, which is the world's biggest
single market for oil.
</P>
<P>
   America's record-high gas prices are largely caused not by any
actions by OPEC, but by domestic factors _ such as bottlenecks at
domestic refineries and tough new environmental standards on
gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Saudis cannot afford to appear as America's
lackeys, they listen carefully to its concerns. The desert kingdom
depends on the United States both for its biggest market and for
its defense.
</P>
<P>
   The raging energy debate in the United States alarms the Saudis.
It has already become a hot political issue.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Saudis fear that it might tip the economy into
recession. They gritted their teeth through two recent OPEC summits
as the cartel's small fry kept them from raising output as much as
they would have liked.
</P>
<P>
   And, explains Roger Diwan of the Petroleum Finance Company, an
industry consultancy, they looked ahead and saw that worse may be
in store. He points to low stocks of heating oil in America.
</P>
<P>
   Unless crude-oil prices drop soon, this may presage another
energy crisis this winter. Adding urgency to the Saudi decision are
signs from elsewhere in the world that sky-high oil prices are
doing damage.
</P>
<P>
   Leo Drollas of the London-based Center for Global Energy Studies
blames current high prices for the unusual decline in oil demand
over the past year in Europe's four biggest economies. He reckons
that they may choke Asia's economic recovery too.
</P>
<P>
   Others worry that Iraq, always unpredictable, might use the
tight supply situation to its advantage in coming months, as winter
approaches.
</P>
<P>
   Such conspiracy theorists suggest that Iraq might seize the
chance of peak demand during northern winter months to hold the
world hostage by suddenly taking its oil off the market in order to
win some concessions on, say, U.N. sanctions policy.
</P>
<P>
   If such an unlikely event were indeed to happen, the world's oil
market would have only one savior: Saudi Arabia. That is because it
is the only country with any significant amount of spare capacity.
</P>
<P>
   Important though its vast reserves and its huge production may
be, it is this ability to bring on fresh barrels in a crisis that
gives it so much power.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Saudi Arabia's rulers have been reluctant to wield
that market power too openly, and have instead used OPEC as cover.
This time, though they still talk of ``coordination with OPEC,''
they seem willing to call the shots.
</P>
<P>
   If they are to be taken at their word, however, they need soon
to produce the promised 500,000 barrels, or the world's oil markets
will be thrown into even greater turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   The OPEC cartel will surely survive, but whether anybody will
again take it so seriously is another matter. &QL;

OPEC: SAUDI ARABIA LIFTS THE VEIL OF PRETENSE

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ Could this week mark the great schism that
eventually tears apart OPEC?
</P>
<P>
   Only time will tell. But what is clear is that Saudi Arabia has
decided to lift the veil of pretense, and admit that the cartel is
mere window-dressing for its political and economic agenda, a
convenient fiction to be tolerated in good times but disregarded in
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The oil cartel has a long history of fractious infighting, but
it had recently appeared more harmonious. After watching the price
of crude oil plunge to below $10 a barrel early last year, the
member governments seemed to put aside their differences.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of Mexico and Norway, two outsiders, they slashed
production. When prices shot past $30 a barrel in response, they
agreed to release more oil on to the market in March.
</P>
<P>
   When the price stubbornly refused to go down, they raised
production quotas again in June _ but to little effect, as it
turned out.
</P>
<P>
   Through all the recent ups and downs, Saudi Arabia has worked
hard to win the agreement of its smaller partners. No longer. The
Saudis announced on July 3 that they will unilaterally release
500,000 barrels of crude oil on to the market shortly if prices do
not drop to $25 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   The news caught world oil markets by surprise, and clearly had
the same effect on the rest of OPEC. Oil ministers from other
countries, when quizzed by reporters, seem hazy about what is
happening.
</P>
<P>
   Ali Rodriguez, Venezuela's oil minister and currently OPEC's
president, made himself look more foolish than usual by declaring
that there was ``no idea by any country to raise output
unilaterally.'' He blamed the whole episode on ``journalistic
misinterpretation.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, compared with the Delphic proclamations that the Saudis
usually issue, this week's announcement was unmistakably clear.
</P>
<P>
   Saudi Arabia has dropped the pretense that OPEC is a consensual
body, and is ready to push the market in the direction that best
serves its own interests _ even if that means risking a collapse in
the cartel.
</P>
<P>
   What has forced the Saudi hand? In recent months the problem has
been a shortage not of oil on world markets, but of gasoline in
America's domestic petrol market, which is the world's biggest
single market for oil.
</P>
<P>
   America's record-high gas prices are largely caused not by any
actions by OPEC, but by domestic factors _ such as bottlenecks at
domestic refineries and tough new environmental standards on
gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Saudis cannot afford to appear as America's
lackeys, they listen carefully to its concerns. The desert kingdom
depends on the United States both for its biggest market and for
its defense.
</P>
<P>
   The raging energy debate in the United States alarms the Saudis.
It has already become a hot political issue.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Saudis fear that it might tip the economy into
recession. They gritted their teeth through two recent OPEC summits
as the cartel's small fry kept them from raising output as much as
they would have liked.
</P>
<P>
   And, explains Roger Diwan of the Petroleum Finance Company, an
industry consultancy, they looked ahead and saw that worse may be
in store. He points to low stocks of heating oil in America.
</P>
<P>
   Unless crude-oil prices drop soon, this may presage another
energy crisis this winter. Adding urgency to the Saudi decision are
signs from elsewhere in the world that sky-high oil prices are
doing damage.
</P>
<P>
   Leo Drollas of the London-based Center for Global Energy Studies
blames current high prices for the unusual decline in oil demand
over the past year in Europe's four biggest economies. He reckons
that they may choke Asia's economic recovery too.
</P>
<P>
   Others worry that Iraq, always unpredictable, might use the
tight supply situation to its advantage in coming months, as winter
approaches.
</P>
<P>
   Such conspiracy theorists suggest that Iraq might seize the
chance of peak demand during northern winter months to hold the
world hostage by suddenly taking its oil off the market in order to
win some concessions on, say, U.N. sanctions policy.
</P>
<P>
   If such an unlikely event were indeed to happen, the world's oil
market would have only one savior: Saudi Arabia. That is because it
is the only country with any significant amount of spare capacity.
</P>
<P>
   Important though its vast reserves and its huge production may
be, it is this ability to bring on fresh barrels in a crisis that
gives it so much power.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Saudi Arabia's rulers have been reluctant to wield
that market power too openly, and have instead used OPEC as cover.
This time, though they still talk of ``coordination with OPEC,''
they seem willing to call the shots.
</P>
<P>
   If they are to be taken at their word, however, they need soon
to produce the promised 500,000 barrels, or the world's oil markets
will be thrown into even greater turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   The OPEC cartel will surely survive, but whether anybody will
again take it so seriously is another matter. &QL;

<P>
   TOKYO _ ``The shame of our history is now going abroad,'' says
Tadashi Kosho, who has spent his life studying the use of slave
labor by Japanese companies during the war.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Edward Fagan, a New York lawyer and world-class
embarrasser. The man who shamed Swiss bankers and German
industrialists into stumping up billions of dollars for their
wartime offenses now plans to take on the might of Japanese
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Launched late last year, with all his customary flair, on the
anniversary of Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor, Fagan's class-action
lawsuit charges Mitsubishi Corporation, Mitsui &AMP; Company and Nippon
Steel with violations of human rights, the use of forced labor and
unjust enrichment.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, more than 30 similar lawsuits have been lodged
in California, a state where courts have a statute of limitations
extending until 2010 all claims related to the Second World War.
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiffs include former allied prisoners of war, Asian slave
laborers, ``comfort women'' and other alleged victims of Imperial
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Since, under American law, foreigners can file suit as easily as
Americans, Asia is now crawling with lawyers. Worryingly for
Japanese companies, this sudden barrage of lawsuits has caught the
attention of politicians in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In May, the Senate passed a bill to require the American
government to open its archives on Japanese war crimes, compiled
during the postwar occupation.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, 18 congressmen presented the House of
Representatives with a bill calling for Japan to apologize for its
war crimes and to pay compensation to victims. And last week the
Senate held hearings to sift the historical and legal issues
surrounding forced labor.
</P>
<P>
   Former American prisoners of war spoke of their grievances and
demanded justice and compensation.
</P>
<P>
   If Fagan is to be believed, Japanese firms may have to pay tens
of billions of dollars in reparations, outstripping the $5-billion
Nazi-slave-labor settlement reached by Germany's companies and
government that was confirmed in the Bundestag this week.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the secrecy still surrounding government and company
archives in Japan, nobody knows for sure how many people Japanese
firms enslaved during the war. But some historians guess that there
were as many as 700,000 Koreans, 40,000 Chinese and hundreds of
thousands of other Asians who were forced into labor.
</P>
<P>
   Besides these, perhaps half of the 140,000 allied prisoners
captured by the Japanese army were also forced to work.
</P>
<P>
   Workers slaved in wretched conditions in mines, steel plants,
construction sites and factories in Japan and throughout its
colonies. Death rates were high in many of the prisoner-of-war and
work camps, and torture and abuse were common. Promised salaries
for Asian ``workers'' were rarely paid.
</P>
<P>
   The most enthusiastic users of slave labor were the zaibatsu,
the giant financial and industrial conglomerates that the Americans
dismantled after the war.
</P>
<P>
   Although their owners were purged, the zaibatsu managed to
regroup themselves under the same management. Despite what Japanese
firms claim about their non-relationship with the zaibatsu, the
postwar break was by no means complete.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the capital amassed by the zaibatsu during Japan's
colonial expansion also survived the purge: the money was siphoned
off into house banks that escaped American attentions.
</P>
<P>
   Cold-war politics further discouraged the Americans from
pressuring Japan and its large companies to pay reparations. So
far, Japan has not budged an inch. The companies involved are
keeping a frosty silence. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (200-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 575) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The government, meanwhile, seems in no mood to cut a deal,
insisting that the 1951 San Francisco peace treaty settled all
reparation claims permanently.
</P>
<P>
   On June 27 Japan's ambassador to the United States, Shunji
Yanai, said his government would support Japanese companies, adding
that it would furnish them with the ``necessary information'' to
defend themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Despite assurances from the American government that it supports
Japan's interpretation of the 1951 peace treaty, Yanai seemed
sufficiently agitated to issue threats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Opening the lid'' on the issue of war reparations would, he
claimed, ``result in grave consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   For a start, it is by no means clear that the 1951 peace treaty
protects Japanese companies.
</P>
<P>
   Some lawyers argue that, although the treaty settles all claims
by governments against Japan, the text is less clear about the
rights of individuals to bring suit.
</P>
<P>
   Other specialists and human-rights scholars argue on fundamental
grounds that peace treaties between governments cannot take away an
individual's right to sue.
</P>
<P>
   Even if these legal arguments eventually fail, Fagan's talent
for publicity will ensure plenty of damaging stories in the
meantime. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,125) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Influential Asian-Americans and human-rights organizations, such
as the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles, have begun focusing
on the ``forgotten Holocaust'' of the Pacific war.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, California's state government passed a law, sponsored
by a local Japanese-American politician, calling for Japan to offer
``an unambiguous apology and compensation to the victims of its
wartime atrocities.''
</P>
<P>
   It took two years of rough handling in the media and untold
damage in public relations before Swiss and German firms agreed to
pay compensation. One sign of the sensitivity of the political
issues surrounding the German suits was the role that the
government played in organizing the compensation fund.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, at least, the Japanese ought to be tempted to settle
quickly on commercial grounds alone. This time, however, Fagan may
have hit a blind spot. For companies such as Mitsui have resisted
pressure for reparations for years.
</P>
<P>
   More than 40 court cases have been filed in Japan demanding
restitution for slave labor. Not one has won. Only three have been
settled out of court, and even then on terms that were hardly
favorable to former slaves.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, for instance, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries refused to
make a court-suggested payment to a group of 12 Korean forced
laborers.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, the Japanese press lets its companies get away with
this sort of high-handed treatment: criticism of big Japanese
companies by the mainstream media in Japan remains muted.
</P>
<P>
   There will be stubborn political resistance too. Among the right
wing of the dominant Liberal Democratic Party are politicians who
refuse to accept that Japan waged a war of aggression. It is thanks
to these enduring political forces that, to the outside world,
Japan still cannot seem to offer an unequivocal apology for its
wartime actions.
</P>
<P>
   The difference with the latest court cases, of course, is that
they have been filed abroad, exposing Japanese firms to a hostile
press, hostile public opinion and hostile politicians.
</P>
<P>
   On the evidence so far, the guess has to be that they will make
a worse mess of the issue than even the Swiss and the Germans. &QL;

government played in organizing the compensation fund.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, at least, the Japanese ought to be tempted to settle
quickly on commercial grounds alone. This time, however, Fagan may
have hit a blind spot. For companies such as Mitsui have resisted
pressure for reparations for years.
</P>
<P>
   More than 40 court cases have been filed in Japan demanding
restitution for slave labor. Not one has won. Only three have been
settled out of court, and even then on terms that were hardly
favorable to former slaves.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, for instance, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries refused to
make a court-suggested payment to a group of 12 Korean forced
laborers.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, the Japanese press lets its companies get away with
this sort of high-handed treatment: criticism of big Japanese
companies by the mainstream media in Japan remains muted.
</P>
<P>
   There will be stubborn political resistance too. Among the right
wing of the dominant Liberal Democratic Party are politicians who
refuse to accept that Japan waged a war of aggression. It is thanks
to these enduring political forces that, to the outside world,
Japan still cannot seem to offer an unequivocal apology for its
wartime actions.
</P>
<P>
   The difference with the latest court cases, of course, is that
they have been filed abroad, exposing Japanese firms to a hostile
press, hostile public opinion and hostile politicians.
</P>
<P>
   On the evidence so far, the guess has to be that they will make
a worse mess of the issue than even the Swiss and the Germans. &QL;

<P>
   TOKYO _ ``The shame of our history is now going abroad,'' says
Tadashi Kosho, who has spent his life studying the use of slave
labor by Japanese companies during the war.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Edward Fagan, a New York lawyer and world-class
embarrasser. The man who shamed Swiss bankers and German
industrialists into stumping up billions of dollars for their
wartime offenses now plans to take on the might of Japanese
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Launched late last year, with all his customary flair, on the
anniversary of Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor, Fagan's class-action
lawsuit charges Mitsubishi Corporation, Mitsui &AMP; Company and Nippon
Steel with violations of human rights, the use of forced labor and
unjust enrichment.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, more than 30 similar lawsuits have been lodged
in California, a state where courts have a statute of limitations
extending until 2010 all claims related to the Second World War.
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiffs include former allied prisoners of war, Asian slave
laborers, ``comfort women'' and other alleged victims of Imperial
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Since, under American law, foreigners can file suit as easily as
Americans, Asia is now crawling with lawyers. Worryingly for
Japanese companies, this sudden barrage of lawsuits has caught the
attention of politicians in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In May, the Senate passed a bill to require the American
government to open its archives on Japanese war crimes, compiled
during the postwar occupation.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, 18 congressmen presented the House of
Representatives with a bill calling for Japan to apologize for its
war crimes and to pay compensation to victims. And last week the
Senate held hearings to sift the historical and legal issues
surrounding forced labor.
</P>
<P>
   Former American prisoners of war spoke of their grievances and
demanded justice and compensation.
</P>
<P>
   If Fagan is to be believed, Japanese firms may have to pay tens
of billions of dollars in reparations, outstripping the $5-billion
Nazi-slave-labor settlement reached by Germany's companies and
government that was confirmed in the Bundestag this week.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the secrecy still surrounding government and company
archives in Japan, nobody knows for sure how many people Japanese
firms enslaved during the war. But some historians guess that there
were as many as 700,000 Koreans, 40,000 Chinese and hundreds of
thousands of other Asians who were forced into labor.
</P>
<P>
   Besides these, perhaps half of the 140,000 allied prisoners
captured by the Japanese army were also forced to work.
</P>
<P>
   Workers slaved in wretched conditions in mines, steel plants,
construction sites and factories in Japan and throughout its
colonies. Death rates were high in many of the prisoner-of-war and
work camps, and torture and abuse were common. Promised salaries
for Asian ``workers'' were rarely paid.
</P>
<P>
   The most enthusiastic users of slave labor were the zaibatsu,
the giant financial and industrial conglomerates that the Americans
dismantled after the war.
</P>
<P>
   Although their owners were purged, the zaibatsu managed to
regroup themselves under the same management. Despite what Japanese
firms claim about their non-relationship with the zaibatsu, the
postwar break was by no means complete.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the capital amassed by the zaibatsu during Japan's
colonial expansion also survived the purge: the money was siphoned
off into house banks that escaped American attentions.
</P>
<P>
   Cold-war politics further discouraged the Americans from
pressuring Japan and its large companies to pay reparations. So
far, Japan has not budged an inch. The companies involved are
keeping a frosty silence. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (200-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 575) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The government, meanwhile, seems in no mood to cut a deal,
insisting that the 1951 San Francisco peace treaty settled all
reparation claims permanently.
</P>
<P>
   On June 27 Japan's ambassador to the United States, Shunji
Yanai, said his government would support Japanese companies, adding
that it would furnish them with the ``necessary information'' to
defend themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Despite assurances from the American government that it supports
Japan's interpretation of the 1951 peace treaty, Yanai seemed
sufficiently agitated to issue threats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Opening the lid'' on the issue of war reparations would, he
claimed, ``result in grave consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   For a start, it is by no means clear that the 1951 peace treaty
protects Japanese companies.
</P>
<P>
   Some lawyers argue that, although the treaty settles all claims
by governments against Japan, the text is less clear about the
rights of individuals to bring suit.
</P>
<P>
   Other specialists and human-rights scholars argue on fundamental
grounds that peace treaties between governments cannot take away an
individual's right to sue.
</P>
<P>
   Even if these legal arguments eventually fail, Fagan's talent
for publicity will ensure plenty of damaging stories in the
meantime. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,125) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Influential Asian-Americans and human-rights organizations, such
as the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles, have begun focusing
on the ``forgotten Holocaust'' of the Pacific war.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, California's state government passed a law, sponsored
by a local Japanese-American politician, calling for Japan to offer
``an unambiguous apology and compensation to the victims of its
wartime atrocities.''
</P>
<P>
   It took two years of rough handling in the media and untold
damage in public relations before Swiss and German firms agreed to
pay compensation. One sign of the sensitivity of the political
issues surrounding the German suits was the role that the
government played in organizing the compensation fund.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, at least, the Japanese ought to be tempted to settle

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ America's House of Representatives voted last month
to phase out the country's estate tax over the next ten years.
</P>
<P>
   If the law passes the Senate and has enough support to override
a threatened veto by President Bill Clinton (unlikely but
possible), America could become one of a handful of rich countries
without an inheritance or estate tax, at least at the federal
level.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the ``death tax,'' as they have dubbed it, claim
that its repeal would remove an unfair, immoral tax that adds to
the pain suffered by mourning families.
</P>
<P>
   They say it prevents farms and small businesses from passing
from generation to generation. And they claim that it penalizes the
frugal who pass wealth on to their children, reducing everybody's
incentive to save and invest.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the tax, in contrast, retort that it is highly
progressive (the more you have, the more, proportionally, you pay)
and thus a small, but effective, counterweight to America's
concentration of wealth.
</P>
<P>
   They assert that it has few disincentive effects since it is
payable only at death. And they claim that repeal would generate a
huge windfall to rich people.
</P>
<P>
   The truth probably lies somewhere in between. America's estate
tax is levied at a high rate (a marginal rate of 55 percent for the
biggest estates), but it kicks in only after a sizeable exemption
(in effect, the first $1.35 million of gross estate per couple,
rising to $2 million by 2006, goes untaxed).
</P>
<P>
   As a result, it is a tax paid mainly by the rich. In 1997, over
half of all estate-tax payments were made by 2,400 estates with a
gross value of over $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Thus the tax in fact affects very few farmers and small
businesses. Farms account for only 0.3 percent of gross taxable
assets. Special provisions also ensure that small businesses and
farms have a long period to pay.
</P>
<P>
   The estate tax touches relatively few people, but it still
generates a noticeable share of tax revenue (around $30 billion in
1999, about 1.5 percent of the total).
</P>
<P>
   It remains controversial, as taxes on the transfer of wealth
have been throughout history.
</P>
<P>
   They were first levied by the Egyptians in the 7th century BC.
Classical economists argued about their merits: Adam Smith was
broadly in favor, David Ricardo (a rich man) against.
</P>
<P>
   But economists agree that, in principle, all taxes should be
judged against three criteria: fairness, efficiency and simplicity.
Fairness is hard to gauge. Clearly, the estate tax is at an extreme
of progressivity, since the vast majority of taxpayers do not pay
it at all.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand the tax also has unfair aspects. The many
loopholes and exemptions surrounding it mean that people of
equivalent wealth often pay different amounts of tax, depending on
their acumen at estate-tax avoidance.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, ``soaking the rich'' is not a principle of good
taxation.
</P>
<P>
   A progressive tax can also be a highly inefficient one.
Efficient taxes should create minimal distortions to economic
activity. How much the estate tax distorts behavior _ by, say,
reducing the incentive to save and accumulate wealth _ is a complex
question.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike income taxes, which affect choices about how much of
one's lifetime to devote to working, inheritance taxes affect
incentives governing the choice between consuming now and
bequeathing to one's descendants.
</P>
<P>
   Understanding how these incentives work means understanding why
people leave assets when they die.
</P>
<P>
   One theory is that bequests are simply an accident. People do
not know how long they will live, and so they keep more money than
they turn out to need.
</P>
<P>
   If bequests are an accident, the estate tax is quite efficient.
However, if people are motivated to work by the idea of leaving
their families an inheritance, the tax will be distortionary.
</P>
<P>
   Again, however, the impact of the distortions is unclear. People
might accumulate less wealth in an effort to avoid the tax. On the
other hand, if people have a specific amount they wish to leave to
their children, the estate tax might have the opposite effect,
increasing saving.
</P>
<P>
   Estate taxes also affect the behavior of recipients. The
children of the wealthy might work and save less, conscious that
they were going to inherit.
</P>
<P>
   Some libertarians are in favor of confiscatory estate taxes on
exactly these grounds: they see inherited wealth as affirmative
action for the children of the rich.
</P>
<P>
   Others argue that in a system that has an income tax, the estate
tax will always be less efficient than setting the income tax at
optimal rates. Indeed, the estate tax's high rate suggests that it
could have big disincentive effects.
</P>
<P>
   The top rate of 55 percent, combined with a top income tax of
39.6 percent, means that high income-tax payers, who intend to
bequeath any new dollar they earn to their descendants, are taxed
on it at the rate of almost 73 percent. &QL;
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 850, OR CONTINUE TO 1,050) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A forthcoming paper by Joel Slemrod and Wojciech Kopczuk of the
University of Michigan suggests that the estate tax does affect
people's behavior.
</P>
<P>
   By looking at changes in the rate, base and structure of the tax
since it was introduced in 1916, the two economists tried to gauge
whether these changes have affected the size of reported taxable
estates. They found that a sharp increase in the estate tax in the
1930s coincided with a sharp decrease in the size of reported
estates.
</P>
<P>
   By examining historical data on individual tax returns, they
also found evidence that rich people reduce the size of their
taxable estates as rates rise. That could be because people have
less incentive to accumulate wealth; or it might be because their
estate planning was more effective.
</P>
<P>
   Only the former affects overall capital accumulation, but both
are indicative of the costs of estate taxes.
</P>
<P>
   So critics are right that the estate tax creates distortions. It
also fails the simplicity test. These objections could however be
partly met by reducing the tax rate and removing many loopholes.
</P>
<P>
   A lower tax on a broader base would be more efficient, though
also less progressive. But it would certainly make more sense than
abolition. &QL;

<P>
   (UNDATED) _ America's House of Representatives voted last month
to phase out the country's estate tax over the next ten years.
</P>
<P>
   If the law passes the Senate and has enough support to override
a threatened veto by President Bill Clinton (unlikely but
possible), America could become one of a handful of rich countries
without an inheritance or estate tax, at least at the federal
level.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the ``death tax,'' as they have dubbed it, claim
that its repeal would remove an unfair, immoral tax that adds to
the pain suffered by mourning families.
</P>
<P>
   They say it prevents farms and small businesses from passing
from generation to generation. And they claim that it penalizes the
frugal who pass wealth on to their children, reducing everybody's
incentive to save and invest.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the tax, in contrast, retort that it is highly
progressive (the more you have, the more, proportionally, you pay)
and thus a small, but effective, counterweight to America's
concentration of wealth.
</P>
<P>
   They assert that it has few disincentive effects since it is
payable only at death. And they claim that repeal would generate a
huge windfall to rich people.
</P>
<P>
   The truth probably lies somewhere in between. America's estate
tax is levied at a high rate (a marginal rate of 55 percent for the
biggest estates), but it kicks in only after a sizeable exemption
(in effect, the first $1.35 million of gross estate per couple,
rising to $2 million by 2006, goes untaxed).
</P>
<P>
   As a result, it is a tax paid mainly by the rich. In 1997, over
half of all estate-tax payments were made by 2,400 estates with a
gross value of over $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Thus the tax in fact affects very few farmers and small
businesses. Farms account for only 0.3 percent of gross taxable
assets. Special provisions also ensure that small businesses and
farms have a long period to pay.
</P>
<P>
   The estate tax touches relatively few people, but it still
generates a noticeable share of tax revenue (around $30 billion in
1999, about 1.5 percent of the total).
</P>
<P>
   It remains controversial, as taxes on the transfer of wealth
have been throughout history.
</P>
<P>
   They were first levied by the Egyptians in the 7th century BC.
Classical economists argued about their merits: Adam Smith was
broadly in favor, David Ricardo (a rich man) against.
</P>
<P>
   But economists agree that, in principle, all taxes should be
judged against three criteria: fairness, efficiency and simplicity.
Fairness is hard to gauge. Clearly, the estate tax is at an extreme
of progressivity, since the vast majority of taxpayers do not pay
it at all.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand the tax also has unfair aspects. The many
loopholes and exemptions surrounding it mean that people of
equivalent wealth often pay different amounts of tax, depending on
their acumen at estate-tax avoidance.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, ``soaking the rich'' is not a principle of good
taxation.
</P>
<P>
   A progressive tax can also be a highly inefficient one.
Efficient taxes should create minimal distortions to economic
activity. How much the estate tax distorts behavior _ by, say,
reducing the incentive to save and accumulate wealth _ is a complex
question.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike income taxes, which affect choices about how much of
one's lifetime to devote to working, inheritance taxes affect
incentives governing the choice between consuming now and
bequeathing to one's descendants.
</P>
<P>
   Understanding how these incentives work means understanding why
people leave assets when they die.
</P>
<P>
   One theory is that bequests are simply an accident. People do
not know how long they will live, and so they keep more money than
they turn out to need.
</P>
<P>
   If bequests are an accident, the estate tax is quite efficient.
However, if people are motivated to work by the idea of leaving
their families an inheritance, the tax will be distortionary.
</P>
<P>
   Again, however, the impact of the distortions is unclear. People
might accumulate less wealth in an effort to avoid the tax. On the
other hand, if people have a specific amount they wish to leave to
their children, the estate tax might have the opposite effect,
increasing saving.
</P>
<P>
   Estate taxes also affect the behavior of recipients. The
children of the wealthy might work and save less, conscious that
they were going to inherit.
</P>
<P>
   Some libertarians are in favor of confiscatory estate taxes on
exactly these grounds: they see inherited wealth as affirmative
action for the children of the rich.
</P>
<P>
   Others argue that in a system that has an income tax, the estate
tax will always be less efficient than setting the income tax at
optimal rates. Indeed, the estate tax's high rate suggests that it
could have big disincentive effects.
</P>
<P>
   The top rate of 55 percent, combined with a top income tax of
39.6 percent, means that high income-tax payers, who intend to
bequeath any new dollar they earn to their descendants, are taxed
on it at the rate of almost 73 percent. &QL;
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 850, OR CONTINUE TO 1,050) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A forthcoming paper by Joel Slemrod and Wojciech Kopczuk of the
University of Michigan suggests that the estate tax does affect
people's behavior.
</P>
<P>
   By looking at changes in the rate, base and structure of the tax
since it was introduced in 1916, the two economists tried to gauge
whether these changes have affected the size of reported taxable
estates. They found that a sharp increase in the estate tax in the
1930s coincided with a sharp decrease in the size of reported
estates.
</P>
<P>
   By examining historical data on individual tax returns, they
also found evidence that rich people reduce the size of their
taxable estates as rates rise. That could be because people have
less incentive to accumulate wealth; or it might be because their
estate planning was more effective.
</P>
<P>
   Only the former affects overall capital accumulation, but both
are indicative of the costs of estate taxes.
</P>
<P>
   So critics are right that the estate tax creates distortions. It
also fails the simplicity test. These objections could however be
partly met by reducing the tax rate and removing many loopholes.
</P>
<P>
   A lower tax on a broader base would be more efficient, though
also less progressive. But it would certainly make more sense than
abolition. &QL;

   (UNDATED) _ The growing realism of computer games makes it ever
harder for players to tear themselves away from their screens to
attend to their daily lives.
</P>
<P>
   For some players, however, the distraction of having to earn a
living may now be a thing of the past. They have learned to make
real money in the imaginary world of online fantasy games.
</P>
<P>
   The demand for treasure in these games is so great that
experienced players can sell the fruits of their gaming labor to
their less-experienced counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   How did things become so deadly serious? In the early days of
networked computing, geeks quickly worked out how to run
role-playing ``swords-and-sorcery'' games online.
</P>
<P>
   These multi-player adventures became known as multi-user
dungeons (MUDs). Players spent their time killing monsters and
collecting treasure. Since the games had no graphics, imagination
was at a premium.
</P>
<P>
   The high cost of computers and slow speed of networks further
limited their appeal. But as microprocessors and Internet
connections have improved, MUDs have evolved in both popularity and
sophistication.
</P>
<P>
   Everquest, one of the most popular games, boasts over 200,000
players, as well as three-dimensional color graphics.
</P>
<P>
   Since players can interact online, devotees see these games as a
social experience as much as a competitive one. This makes them
maddeningly addictive. They are also time-consuming. To get the
most out of them, players find they have to spend hours every week
developing powerful online characters.
</P>
<P>
   And so a commercial opportunity has arisen. Skilled players
found they could accumulate hoards of digital treasure. Busy or
impatient players wanted a head start. So imaginary gold, castles
and magic swords began to be sold for real money.
</P>
<P>
   eBay, an auction Web site, is the main forum for such
transactions: 100,000 gold pieces in a game called Ultima Online
currently cost about $40; a well-situated castle might change hands
for over $500; Everquest players can buy a ``Froglock Bonecaster's
Robe'' on eBay for a cool $750.
</P>
<P>
   With that kind of money on offer, it is not surprising that some
old hands have decided to turn professional. They have given up
their jobs to play full-time, making a living by selling their
spoils to other players.
</P>
<P>
   They have also started to buy items for resale. Their Web sites
accept credit cards; one even offers an escrow service to guarantee
delivery of the virtual treasure before the real money is paid
over.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional players have nothing good to say about these
entrepreneurs. They are derisively referred to as ``campers'' or
``farmers'' because of their formulaic, professional playing style.
They are excoriated for commercializing the games they play, and
find themselves widely shunned by the true aficionados.
</P>
<P>
   So, although the idea of playing games for a living sounds
entrancing, full-time gamers may not be having as good a time as it
seems.
</P>
<P>
   They miss out on the games' sociable and problem-solving
aspects, which are what make them so addictive in the first place.
They face the opprobrium of their fellow players. And the demands
of running a business and buying for resale must also seem rather
mundane after a day spent slaying dragons.
</P>
<P>
   All of which raises a troubling, if not wholly new, question:
when you play games for a living, do they stop being fun? &QL;

<P>
   AUSTIN _ Along with the stifling heat, devastating fires are
part of summer in the Southwest. Whether caused by lightning or the
cigarette butt of a thoughtless camper, they ravage thousands of
acres in the region each year.
</P>
<P>
   This year's conflagrations in New Mexico, Arizona and Colorado
are worse than anything nature has produced for a long time past.
</P>
<P>
   Drought and strong winds propelled them; but the biggest fires
were begun by government workers. This raises new, and troubling,
questions about the stewardship of America's forests.
</P>
<P>
   Doubts began in May with the Cerro Grande fire that raged
through Los Alamos, in New Mexico. When the smoke finally cleared,
the fire had destroyed more than 47,000 acres and more than 400
houses, causing an estimated $1 billion in damage and barely
missing the National Laboratory, home of America's nuclear program.
</P>
<P>
   This turned angry eyes on the policy of ``controlled burning,''
which has been used by the National Park Service for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Controlled burns are fires deliberately set by park officials in
order to clear out grass, brush and deadwood that could be the fuel
for later, accidental, blazes. In essence, the practice is an
attempt to restore the natural fire cycle that existed 100 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   As more people have moved into the region (in recent years, the
Southwest has been the fastest-growing part of America), natural
wildfires have been suppressed by humans. This has led to an
enormous buildup of scrub brush and deadwood, the elements that
turn forests into tinderboxes.
</P>
<P>
   It is to burn away thir buildup that the National Park Service
has quadrupled the number of controlled burns in the past four
years.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, a controlled fire is often an oxymoron.
</P>
<P>
   According to a damning Interior Department report on the Cerro
Grande fire, park officials made ``seriously flawed'' calculations
about how the fire was likely to behave, underestimating the effect
of high winds and dry weather.
</P>
<P>
   They also failed to have enough firefighting equipment ready.
Two other notably uncontrollable ``controlled fires'' have happened
at the Grand Canyon, where the blaze spread over 14,000 acres and
forced the closure of several tourist lodges, and at Seven Springs,
in New Mexico, where the town had to be evacuated.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the conditions that lead to the best controlled
burns (usually, dryish weather and strong enough winds to spread
the fire) are nearly the same as those that cause a fire to burn
out of control. And drought in the Southwest has made things worse.
</P>
<P>
   According to Steve Gatewood, executive director of the
Arizona-based Society for Ecological Restoration, any decision to
order a controlled burn under current conditions is bound to be
risky.
</P>
<P>
   He also points out that the forest agencies are behind schedule
on controlled burns, and may have felt pushed to approve burns that
tested the limits of fire safety.
</P>
<P>
   An alternative way to restore forests, based on research by
Professor Wallace Covington of Northern Arizona University, is
being tested on 100,000 acres of dense pine forests near Flagstaff,
Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   This method involves first thinning out the forests by selective
logging, turning dense woods into pine cluster _ the sort of forest
that used to be the norm a century ago. Such a forest can then be
left, or subjected to limited controlled burns.
</P>
<P>
   Selective logging enjoys the support of the sensibly green
secretary of the interior, Bruce Babbitt, and many scientists.
</P>
<P>
   But environmentalists, never friendly to anything with the word
logging in it, see it as a scam to help the logging industry (which
would inevitably have to cut down those trees).
</P>
<P>
   This enrages Covington: ``As soon as I advocated tree-thinning,
they immediately assumed I was trying to rape the forest.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the issue has inevitably turned into a battle
between western Republicans (with strong logging-company
connections) and liberal Democrats (with green contributors).
</P>
<P>
   ``The politics of a preservationist elite are driving this
administration's environmental policies,'' says Helen
Chenoweth-Hage of Idaho, a hard-line Republican congresswoman.
</P>
<P>
   On June 30, Republicans pushed through a plan to increase the
government's budget for fighting forest fires to $350 million, with
much of the money going to forest thinning.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats whimpered about their foes exploiting national
disasters. The hot air, it seems, does not blow merely in the
West. &QL;

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   When Xin Ye returned to Beijing after a 14-year absence to take
a senior position at one of China's most popular Internet portals,
Sohu, he left behind his wife, two daughters, a California
lifestyle and a job prospect at a Silicon Valley start-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``My heart at this point is still in Silicon Valley,'' says the
36-year-old Ye, a former senior technical manager at Marimba, as he
emerged from a meeting on his first day of work early last month.
``The ocean was five minutes away. The mountains were half an
hour's drive away. But how many times does an opportunity come up
to build a leading portal in China? Just once, right?''
</P>
<P>
   Ye is not alone among overseas Chinese in having given up the
advantages of life abroad, for the time being, to chase Internet
gold in a nation he no longer calls home. In growing numbers,
first- and second-generation Chinese from Hong Kong, Taiwan,
Singapore and the United States are returning to China, many
recruited to feed a hunger for bilingual senior managers in the
country's infant Internet industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a reverse brain drain,'' says Jay Kuo, a lawyer who
in January left his job as a marketing manager at BSEM, an
agricultural-equipment manufacturer, to co-found Fudao.net, a
finance site for families that is going online next month. ``A lot
of my friends have come back for the singular opportunity to write
the next Internet chapter. Many mainland friends who have the
opportunity to go overseas now haven't gone for this reason.''
</P>
<P>
   Beijing has tried for years, without much success, to lure
natives with technical and managerial skills back to China. But the
explosion of the Internet in China is finally ``bringing them back
in droves,'' saus Charles Zhang, chairman of Sohu.
</P>
<P>
   Still, while Web entrepreneurs such as Tang Haisong of Etang, an
online portal, and Joseph Chen of Chinaren, a community Web site,
are coming back waving their Harvard and Stanford MBAs _ and flush
with millions of dollars in venture capital _ what start-ups really
need are senior executives with hands-on management experience and
technical talent, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   Norman Liu, co-founder of the job site 51job.com, says, ``Once
companies pass their first three-to-six-month periods, human
resources inevitably becomes the most important and most difficult
problem for them.''
</P>
<P>
   They particularly struggle to fill certain upper-echelon spots,
he adds.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need key senior people with the vision and capability to
lead them to an IPO,'' Liu says. ``The Chinese are good at
execution but weak on problem-solving, and lack a keen knowledge of
the business as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Though established multinational companies have lamented that
there is a scarcity of executive talent in China, the rash of new
dot-com companies is fast turning this shortage into a
cross-industry regional drought.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet industry is a big, sore open wound right now,''
says Steve Chiu, chief sales officer of Zhaopin, another job site.
``We have over 500 companies advertising on our site now, many of
them looking for the same people. It's a really, really crazy
scene.''
</P>
<P>
   A chief technical officer, with five to eight years of
management experience, tops the wish lists of more than 100
start-up companies. A talented vice president for marketing is
another highly coveted yet hard-to-find executive.
Longer-established dot-coms, including the popular portal Netease,
are beginning to recruit older executives, who can offer a depth of
experience that their brash young founders lack.
</P>
<P>
   Though well-known sites such as Sohu and Sina have the money and
name recognition to lure talent from Silicon Valley, many start-ups
without these advantages are settling for employees with less
experience, including managers from state-owned enterprises and
graduates with master's degree in engineering. Salaries for even
less-qualified chief technical officers can be as much as $100,000,
plus stock options.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the most rational hiring decision,'' Liu says,
``because they'll hit a wall in six months. But companies nowadays
are getting more and more desperate.''
</P>
<P>
   With demand up and supply down, it is no surprise that
recruiting firms such as Wang &AMP; Li Asia Resources, which culls
talent from greater China and San Francisco, has had its Net
business explode 80 percent over the past six months. About 300
competing job-search dot-coms have also crowded into the recruiting
field, Chiu says, all trying to capitalize on the expanding market.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Sinobit, a site for technology entrepreneurs,
prominently features a ``Western returnee'' center, hoping to lure
overseas talent. The site was co-founded in January by Zhang Lei,
who hastily packed his bags three months before finishing his MBA
from Yale University to return to China and join the Internet rush
``before it was too late.''
</P>
<P>
   Others scoff at the perception that returnees are a sure-fire
bet, saying that some people come back with a superior attitude
that offends their staff members, or have been away too long to
immediately grasp the complexities of a business environment
literally changing by the month.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for now, many smaller start-ups _ from
Web-development-design firms to city guides _ are not worrying
about an industry-wide scarcity of senior managers. Competent
junior-level and midlevel managers are plentiful, thanks in part to
multinational firms that started promoting local employees five
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Though more than a few executives are disappointed by the lack
of creative graphic designers or talented and self-motivated
editors, which they attribute largely to an educational system that
does not foster creativity, many have devised innovative ways to
deal with the problem.
</P>
<P>
   An American executive at Menkou, a lifestyle-and-entertainment
site, routinely does pull-ups in his hallway or plays his stereo
loudly to encourage his employees to do wacky things. Fudao.net has
built a jungle gym in its office to give its 27 employees a way to
``keep their creative juices flowing,'' as Kuo puts it. Other
Internet start-ups, unhappy with local programmers and graphic
designers, have contracted the work out to people in other
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Employees have also realized that they are in demand. With
bidding wars and raiding on the rise, salaries have increased in
some companies as much as 50 percent for writers and 80 percent for
junior-level programmers since a year ago. Across the industry,
wages have generally risen a more modest 20 percent to 30 percent,
but sudden promotions are also in vogue.
</P>
<P>
   One Internet company lured a sales clerk from another start-up
by offering her a salary 12 times higher than her previous one, and
the position of chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't even find good-quality secretaries at average
salaries,'' Kuo says. ``Some even asked us for stock options. And
we gave it to them.''

   AUSTIN _ Along with the stifling heat, devastating fires are
part of summer in the Southwest. Whether caused by lightning or the
cigarette butt of a thoughtless camper, they ravage thousands of
acres in the region each year.
</P>
<P>
   This year's conflagrations in New Mexico, Arizona and Colorado
are worse than anything nature has produced for a long time past.
</P>
<P>
   Drought and strong winds propelled them; but the biggest fires
were begun by government workers. This raises new, and troubling,
questions about the stewardship of America's forests.
</P>
<P>
   Doubts began in May with the Cerro Grande fire that raged
through Los Alamos, in New Mexico. When the smoke finally cleared,
the fire had destroyed more than 47,000 acres and more than 400
houses, causing an estimated $1 billion in damage and barely
missing the National Laboratory, home of America's nuclear program.
</P>
<P>
   This turned angry eyes on the policy of ``controlled burning,''
which has been used by the National Park Service for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Controlled burns are fires deliberately set by park officials in
order to clear out grass, brush and deadwood that could be the fuel
for later, accidental, blazes. In essence, the practice is an
attempt to restore the natural fire cycle that existed 100 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   As more people have moved into the region (in recent years, the
Southwest has been the fastest-growing part of America), natural
wildfires have been suppressed by humans. This has led to an
enormous buildup of scrub brush and deadwood, the elements that
turn forests into tinderboxes.
</P>
<P>
   It is to burn away this buildup that the National Park Service
has quadrupled the number of controlled burns in the past four
years.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, a controlled fire is often an oxymoron.
</P>
<P>
   According to a damning Interior Department report on the Cerro
Grande fire, park officials made ``seriously flawed'' calculations
about how the fire was likely to behave, underestimating the effect
of high winds and dry weather.
</P>
<P>
   They also failed to have enough firefighting equipment ready.
Two other notably uncontrollable ``controlled fires'' have happened
at the Grand Canyon, where the blaze spread over 14,000 acres and
forced the closure of several tourist lodges, and at Seven Springs,
in New Mexico, where the town had to be evacuated.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the conditions that lead to the best controlled
burns (usually, dryish weather and strong enough winds to spread
the fire) are nearly the same as those that cause a fire to burn
out of control. And drought in the Southwest has made things worse.
</P>
<P>
   According to Steve Gatewood, executive director of the
Arizona-based Society for Ecological Restoration, any decision to
order a controlled burn under current conditions is bound to be
risky.
</P>
<P>
   He also points out that the forest agencies are behind schedule
on controlled burns, and may have felt pushed to approve burns that
tested the limits of fire safety.
</P>
<P>
   An alternative way to restore forests, based on research by
Professor Wallace Covington of Northern Arizona University, is
being tested on 100,000 acres of dense pine forests near Flagstaff,
Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   This method involves first thinning out the forests by selective

left, or subjected to limited controlled burns.
</P>
<P>
   Selective logging enjoys the support of the sensibly green
secretary of the interior, Bruce Babbitt, and many scientists.
</P>
<P>
   But environmentalists, never friendly to anything with the word
logging in it, see it as a scam to help the logging industry (which
would inevitably have to cut down those trees).
</P>
<P>
   This enrages Covington: ``As soon as I advocated tree-thinning,
they immediately assumed I was trying to rape the forest.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the issue has inevitably turned into a battle
between western Republicans (with strong logging-company
connections) and liberal Democrats (with green contributors).
</P>
<P>
   ``The politics of a preservationist elite are driving this
administration's environmental policies,'' says Helen
Chenoweth-Hage of Idaho, a hard-line Republican congresswoman.

<TEXT>
<P>
   For those who support capital punishment, as I do, the
possibility that innocent people could be executed is profoundly
disturbing. No human arrangement can guarantee perfection, but if
perfection is not possible, then the number of errors ought to kept
as low as possible.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, it is worth studying ``Broken System: Error
Rates in Capital Cases,'' the recent report by professor James
Liebman and others at the Columbia University Law School,
especially since that document has stimulated an outpouring of
media coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Its essential finding is that, for the last two decades or so,
courts have found ``serious, reversible error'' in a large fraction
of the cases they reviewed. These errors, the report claims, often
involved weak or incompetent defense attorneys and the withholding
of important evidence from the juries.
</P>
<P>
   But notice what the report does not say: Its authors did not
attempt to discover whether any innocent person had been executed,
and they make no claim that this has happened. Instead, they say
that the large number of appeals leaves ``grave doubt whether we do
catch'' all of the errors.
</P>
<P>
   The clear implication is that, were the truth known, we might
well be killing many innocent people.
</P>
<P>
   But that truth is not known. The Death Penalty Information
Center, a rallying point for opponents of execution, reports that
since 1973, when the Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty, 69
people have been released from death row after being found to be
innocent. But the center does not say that any innocent person has
been put to death, though if it had found such a case it surely
would have proclaimed it.
</P>
<P>
   The Columbia University report shows that death sentences are
intensively reviewed by appeals courts. Some critics of these
reviews think they take too long and involve too many unnecessary
bites at the apple, and that may be true. But if we are to err, it
is best that we err on the side of safety.
</P>
<P>
   Nine or 10 years usually pass between the imposition of the
death penalty and its being carried out. It took 19 years and
appeals heard by more than 30 judges before Gary Graham was
executed last month in Texas. It is hard to imagine that this much
time is necessary for an adequate appeal, but offsetting the cost
and delay is the assurance of only a small chance that an innocent
person will be killed. The 5,760 death sentences handed out since
1973 had, by 1995, led to only 313 executions.
</P>
<P>
   Liebman suggests that the high rate of appeals means that
serious errors are often made by the trial courts. But before we
can accept that conclusion, we must first know whether the errors
were serious enough to affect the outcomes of the cases when they
were sent back for new trials. Did an ``error'' cause a new trial
that set aside the death penalty?
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Liebman was able to learn this for only a small
number of the reversals.
</P>
<P>
   Because of Supreme Court decisions, every death-penalty
conviction leads to an appeal to the state's highest court. About
two-fifths of these cases were reversed. As I read the report, we
have no information about what happened in the new trials.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are state appeals after convictions. These also led
to many reversals, but we don't know what happened to the great
majority of these cases when they were retried, because trial
courts ordinarily do not publish their findings. Liebman and his
colleagues managed to find 301 cases that had been retried, but we
have no idea whether these were representative of all of those
appealed or were only a few dramatic ones that somehow came to the
attention of outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   Of these 301 new actions by trial courts, 22 found that the
defendant was not guilty of a capital crime, 54 reimposed the death
sentence and 247 imposed prison sentences.
</P>
<P>
   Then there were appeals to the federal courts that also led to
reversals in about two-fifths of the cases, but again we are not
certain what happened in all the new trials.
</P>
<P>
   The report also lumps together cases going back to 1973 with
those decided more recently, even though the Supreme Court in 1976
created new procedural guarantees that automatically overturned
many of the death-penalty decisions made between 1973 and 1976. It
is not clear from the Columbia report what fraction of its
reversals date back to these big changes in the rules.
</P>
<P>
   In short, in the vast majority of death-penalty cases we have no
idea whether the finding of error that led to a reversal was based
on a legal technicality, a changing high-court standard about how a
capital crime ought to be tried or a judgment that the defendants
might be innocent.
</P>
<P>
   All we know for certain is that a lot of death-penalty cases are
reviewed over a long period of time _ a fact that dramatically
reduces the chances of innocent people having been executed.
</P>
<P>
   More procedural reforms may be coming. Congress is now
considering a bill that would require federal courts to order DNA
testing, at government expense if the defendant is indigent,
whenever DNA evidence from the crime is available. It also would
require states seeking federal crime-control funds to certify that
they have effective systems for providing competent legal services
to indigent defendants in death-penalty cases.
</P>
<P>
   But more might be done at the state level. States ought to have
laws that create imprisonment without possibility of parole for
first-degree murder convictions, and the judge in every such case
should instruct the jurors in the sentencing phase that they can
choose that or the death penalty. This allows jurors who may have
some doubts about the strength of the evidence or some other
plausible worry to hedge their bets if they are so inclined.
</P>
<P>
   Not every state now has such laws. In Texas, the alternative to
the death sentence is life in prison, but without an absolute
guarantee that the offender will actually spend his life there.
Jurors rightly suspect that the perpetrator will find some way to
get back on the street, and so they often vote for death.
</P>
<P>
   The American Law Institute, a group of legal scholars that
designs uniform state legal codes, has recommended that, even when
a jury decides that capital punishment is appropriate, the judge
should be allowed to bar the death penalty if the evidence ``does
not foreclose all doubt respecting the defendant's guilt.''
</P>
<P>
   The states have not adopted this rule, but perhaps they should,
especially if this change could be coupled with procedures designed
to reduce the seemingly endless number of post-trial appeals.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, we ought to calm down. No one has shown that
innocent people are being executed.
</P>
<P>
   The argument against the death penalty cannot, on the evidence
we now have, rest on the likelihood of serious error. It can only
rest, I think, on moral grounds: Is death an excessive penalty for
any offense?
</P>
<P>
   I think not, but those who disagree should make their views on
the morality of execution clear, and not rely on arguments about
appeals, costs and the tiny chance that someday somebody innocent
will be killed.

A DOCTOR'S JUDGMENT IS THE BEST MEDICINE

 c.2000 The New York Times  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The easy availability of medical information on the Internet has
been a mixed blessing to both patients and doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Well-informed patients now have an appreciation of the
complexities of decision-making and can better participate in their
own care. But the proliferation of data and detail has also
convinced far too many Americans that the management of health is
less complex than they had thought.
</P>
<P>
   By their lights, knowing a drug's therapeutic actions and side
effects is qualification enough to treat one's own high blood
pressure or elevated cholesterol.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, such a dubious proposition would have been
rejected out of hand. But, astoundingly, the Food and Drug
Administration recently held hearings on the possibility of making
a number of potent drugs, including several that are used to treat
potentially dangerous chronic conditions, available over the
counter. And, of course, several pharmaceutical companies have
their own reasons for pushing the agency to allow such a thing.
</P>
<P>
   What seems to have been overlooked is something doctors call
clinical judgment.
</P>
<P>
   Hippocrates called medicine ``the Art,'' because he knew that
mere information was only the beginning of the study of disease.
And despite the advances in the art of healing in the last
two-and-a-half millennia, Hippocrates' famous first aphorism
remains as true as it ever was: ``Life is short, and the Art is
long, the occasion fleeting, experience delusive, judgment
difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   In today's biomedicine, caring for patients requires a doctor's
burnished wisdom, which finds its first coalescence during the long
period of training and continues to be shaped thereafter in the
crucible of focused thought.
</P>
<P>
   Young doctors are taught to observe dispassionately. They must
understand the difference between valid evidence and spurious
appearances. They must critically evaluate medical literature,
distinguishing between new practices that promise to make lasting
contributions to health and new practices that are of fleeting
import.
</P>
<P>
   Then they must choose a course of treatment that is
individualized to each patient's circumstances, yet supported by
studies of large groups. Finally, they must monitor treatment
meticulously, making changes as necessary.
</P>
<P>
   It is not information that leads to the best medical care, but
judgment. It is in the best interest of all, doctors and
non-doctors alike, to recognize the distinction.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, over-the-counter medications have, by and large, been
useful in the treatment of temporary and rather mild problems such
as headaches, colds and allergies. Does it make any sense at all to
expand this category to include drugs that treat conditions such as
hypertension or elevated cholesterol, which have permanent effects
on many organs in the body?
</P>
<P>
   Every drug has multiple side effects, and the danger is
compounded when drugs interact with one another. The possible
complications listed in the manufacturer's package inserts are the
result of chemical activity, and are not merely nuisances to be put
up with or ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Before prescribing pharmaceuticals, doctors must consider the
benefits and risks for each patient, sometimes based on subtle
factors in that individual's physiology or health profile.
</P>
<P>
   But what happens if a patient self-medicates? As one example,
let's say a patient knows he has high blood pressure and decides to
treat it himself. If he also has heart disease or diabetes, which
are common in patients with hypertension, the medication might
change his heart rhythms or create abnormalities in the blood,
which could lead to a cardiac arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Or say a 35-year-old smoker wants birth-control pills. Normally,
a doctor would not prescribe pills to this woman, because of an
increased incidence of heart attacks. But if the contraceptive is
available over the counter, she is free to buy it, regardless of
the risk.
</P>
<P>
   The F.D.A., the drug companies and lawmakers would do well to
consult a passage from Hippocrates' Book I of ``Epidemics.'' Meant
as an admonition to doctors, it applies equally to those who would
make decisions without benefit of clinical judgment: ``As to
diseases, make a habit of two things: to help, or at least to do no
harm.''

 By PETER H. GLEICK  
 c.2000 The New York Times  
<TEXT>
<P>
   My family, like so many others, was excited about Saturday's
release of yet another Harry Potter book.
</P>
<P>
   But although there are many legitimate reasons for praising the
series _ the exciting plots, the new young readers being drawn to
books, the quality of the writing _ I am disappointed about one
thing: the decision by Scholastic, publisher of the American
edition, to translate the books from ``English'' into ``American.''
</P>
<P>
   Scholastic even went so far as to change the title of the first
Harry Potter book from ``Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone''
to ``Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.''
</P>
<P>
   Why? Were the editors worried that some people wouldn't buy the
book because they couldn't understand it in its original language?
Were they concerned that some children would be confused by new
words for otherwise familiar objects or actions?
</P>
<P>
   I like to think that our society would not collapse if our
children started calling their mothers ``Mum'' instead of ``Mom.''
And I would hate to think that today's children would be frightened
away from an otherwise-thrilling book by reading that the hero is
wearing a jumper instead of a sweater.
</P>
<P>
   Are we afraid that, when presented with new vocabulary, children
will shrink away? Or that alternative spellings of previously known
words will make children _ and adults _ suddenly start spelling
things wrong, sending school test scores falling?
</P>
<P>
   A careful reading of both the English and the American editions
of ``Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone'' reveals three kinds of
substitutions.
</P>
<P>
   The first are spelling differences: ``gray'' for ``grey,''
``color'' for ``colour,'' ``flavor'' for ``flavour,'' ``pajamas''
for ``pyjamas,'' ``recognize'' for ``recognise'' and the like.
</P>
<P>
   The second are differences in common words or phrases: ``pitch''
turns to ``field,'' ``sellotaped'' to ``taped,'' ``fortnight'' to
``two weeks,'' ``post'' to ``mail,'' ``boot'' of car to ``trunk''
of car, ``lorry'' to ``truck.''
</P>
<P>
   The third are metamorphoses of truly English experiences or
objects into something different, but distinctly American: crumpets
to English muffins, for example _ a particularly odious change, in
my opinion.
</P>
<P>
   My two sons didn't have any difficulty understanding the British
version of the book sent to them by their aunt in London. I admit
to occasionally offering the meaning of a new word the first time
it appeared, but don't we do that with every book we read to our
children, or help them read to themselves?
</P>
<P>
   Do we really want children to think that crumpets are the same
as English muffins? Frankly, reading about Harry and Hermione
eating crumpets during tea is far more interesting to an American
than reading about them eating English muffins during a meal.
</P>
<P>
   Are any books immune from this kind of devolution from English
to ``American'' English? Would we sit back and let publishers
rewrite Charles Dickens or Shakespeare? I can see it now: ``A
Christmas Song,'' ``A Story of Two Cities,'' ``The Salesman of
Venice.''
</P>
<P>
   By protecting our children from an occasional misunderstanding
or trip to the dictionary, we are pretending that other cultures
are, or should be, the same as ours. By insisting that everything
be Americanized, we dumb down our own society rather than enrich
it.
</P>
<P>
   As for Harry Potter's latest adventures, my children and I will
wait for the British version coming by mail.

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   (UNDATED) _ ``Bowling Alone'' is an ambitious book. Even before
its publication, its central thesis had been well chewed over in
America. Both major presidential candidates had consulted its
author; so had Bill Clinton. The cognoscenti were sure they knew
what Robert Putnam was saying.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the book has finally appeared, amplifying and
reinforcing a famous article from the Journal of Democracy in 1995,
the danger is that its potential audience _ wise before the event _
will not bother to read it. That would be a pity.
</P>
<P>
   If Putnam, a Harvard political scientist, is right, his findings
constitute the greatest challenge now facing America's political
classes.
</P>
<P>
   If he is wrong, his book will nevertheless afford the reader a
rich and subtle portrait of modern America (with an unexpected
nugget of information on almost every page).
</P>
<P>
   Either way, ``Bowling Alone'' is a prodigious achievement.
Putnam's scholarship is wide-ranging, his intelligence luminous,
his tone modest, his prose unpretentious and frequently funny.
</P>
<P>
   On top of all that, the professor is probably right. He argues
that while America has recently witnessed record growth in physical
and human capital, its stock of ``social capital'' _ informal
social connectedness and formal civic engagement _ has fallen
dangerously low.
</P>
<P>
   Americans used to bowl in leagues. Now they bowl alone. In New
London, Conn., they bowl alone while watching giant television
screens, thus further reducing their chances of forming meaningful
social connections.
</P>
<P>
   For Putnam, bowling alone is an extended metaphor for much that
ails both modern America and modern Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence for Americans' growing social isolation is strong:
families dine together a third less often than they did even in
1980; electoral turnout has fallen precipitously, even though
blacks in the South are now free to vote, and do.
</P>
<P>
   The underlying causes include pressures of time and money,
long-distance commuting, compulsive television-viewing and, most
important of all, the gradual replacement of the long ``civic
generation'' _ those tempered by the Great Depression and the
Second World War _ by waves of laid-back, solipsistic baby-boomers
and ``generation X'ers.''
</P>
<P>
   The evidence for isolation can be ambiguous, it is true. The
risk of caricature is always present and what is social isolation
to one person may be new forms of interaction to another.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Putnam's passion for social capital, hard as it may be to
define, is easily explained. Innumerable recent studies show that
it is at least as vital as physical and human capital for the
well-being of individual citizens and whole nations.
</P>
<P>
   Socially disconnected individuals, neither supported by dense
social networks nor contributing to them, are unhealthier,
unhappier and commit more crimes. They are also often poorer and
much less good at nurturing and educating their children.
</P>
<P>
   Putnam is too polite to say so, but he clearly feels the whole
country is becoming like those American states that are already
conspicuously lacking in social capital, notably Mississippi,
Louisiana and other states in the old Confederacy.
</P>
<P>
   Putnam concludes with a range of practical proposals, albeit
rather vague ones.
</P>
<P>
   He suggests that American policymakers _ and business and
religious leaders _ factor social capital into their plans and
decisions. Will whatever I or my company proposes to do serve to
build social capital or destroy it?
</P>
<P>
   He challenges employers ``to ensure that by 2010 America's
workplace will be substantially more family-friendly and
community-congenial'' than it is now, and he challenges the
nation's planners and developers to ensure that Americans spend
less time on the road commuting and more time connecting with their
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   He also maintains that ``a mounting body of evidence confirms
that community service programs really do strengthen the civic
muscles of participants, especially if the service is meaningful,
regular, and woven into the fabric of the school curriculum.''
</P>
<P>
   Putnam cheerfully admits to being a missionary. Inevitably, a
book cast in such an ambitious mold fails to fill all of it. Many
of Putnam's prescriptions, as he himself acknowledges, are lacking
in detail and definition.
</P>
<P>
   More seriously, he fails to develop the distinction between
strictly local social capital and forms of what might be called
``like-minded social capital'' transcending local and even national
boundaries. The one may languish while the other flourishes.
</P>
<P>
   All the same, ``Bowling Alone'' is a book that civic-minded
Americans, of whom there are still many, ignore at their peril. &QL;

   Designer fashion, unlike books or CDs, has not been an easy sell
on the Web. For starters, there is the sizing and fit challenge _
how do you persuade consumers to buy high-end clothing without
trying it on? There is the touch-and-feel problem how do you convey
the look and texture of new fabrics and materials? Then there are
limitations to graphic presentations, conflicts about distributing
products and, beyond that, intangible issues like, how do you sell
something as ephemeral as style?
</P>
<P>
   The surprising news is that online apparel sales are increasing,
particularly among consumers in their mid-20s to mid-40s.
</P>
<P>
   The NPD Group, a market research company in Port Washington,
N.Y., reports that Internet apparel sales for 1999 reached $1.1
billion and are expected to double this year. But, at just less
than 1 percent of the $184 billion in yearly total sales, it is a
small piece of the pie, and is dominated by sites such as Gap.com,
LandsEnd.com and JCrew.com.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, buying khakis online is one thing; buying a couture
ensemble is quite another.
</P>
<P>
   While designer apparel can be purchased on upscale department
store and luxury sites, designers themselves have been reluctant to
dive into the waters of e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Helmut Lang was the first designer to introduce his
fall collection on the Internet, and many designers have used their
sites to promote their clothing and products. But only a handful
are selling anything directly.
</P>
<P>
   That is why the fashion community was abuzz in February when the
Internet-shy Ralph Lauren signed a multimillion-dollar deal with
NBC and ValueVision (which operates the Home Shopping Network) to
form a new company, RL Media, which will develop Polo.com, a
lifestyle Web site that will sell a range of the designer's
products _ clothing and household accouterments _ later this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The deal is unique because it is a joint venture between three
different companies,'' said Ken Cassar, a senior retail analyst for
Jupiter Communications, an Internet research company in New York.
``NBC ponied up advertising time, Ralph Lauren ponied up his brand
name and ValueVision ponied up $50 million in actual cash. The deal
offers Ralph Lauren the potential of going a little bit more mass
market.''
</P>
<P>
   On a smaller scale, Nicole Miller is one of the few designers
who has achieved some success selling direct. Her site, at
www.nicolemiller.com, offers accessories, some evening wear and
bridesmaids' dresses, but no clothing from Miller's collection yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think e-commerce has been all that great in the
clothing area, so we'll be adding things slowly,'' Miller said.
``As far as my collection, that's going to be harder to sell online
because in fashion, you're dealing with new fabrics every year. And
people want to know what the fabrics feel like.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller is right to be cautious, analysts say. The recent demise
of the luxury clothing site Boo.com, sponsored by, among others,
Bernard Arnault, the Benetton family, J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co. and
Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., shows the unpredictability of selling
high-end apparel on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   When image is everything, the Web poses special risks. Graphic
limitations of the Web can make it hard for designers to get across
the high-gloss image that is vital to preserving ``their brand
equity,'' explained Evie Black Dykema, an analyst with Forrester
Research, a research firm in Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   For high-end designers, profits and image are intertwined.
</P>
<P>
   ``Selling style is different from selling CD's or books,''
Dykema said. ``Sales are not the first focus necessarily. Gucci,
for instance, will spend $5 million on a campaign that may generate
$50,000 in sales because the campaign's aura extends beyond the
sales of clothing. Image is absolutely key, and going online may
hurt that image. So designers may have a very long-term perspective
in that sense and aren't as opportunistic perhaps.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller is not the only one who is taking it slowly. This month,
Lang's site, www.helmutlang.com, will begin selling his new
fragrance but no clothing or accessories. Dolce &AMP; Gabbana's site,
www.dolcegabbana.it, which has been up since March, is purely
informational.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no plans to sell apparel in the immediate future
directly on our site,'' Stefano Gabbana said.
</P>
<P>
   Vera Wang's new site, www.verawang.com, will at first feature
her bridal collection, store locations and text to promote her
first book, ``Vera Wang Weddings,'' which will be published in
2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a five-year plan, and selling is a longer-term goal,''
said Chet Hazzard, the president and chief operating officer of
Vera Wang. ``We want to provide high-quality applications like
video, audio, interactive chats with Vera, articles and fashion
shows. Vera is very interested in this. She knows this is the
future. We want to make sure we do it right.''
</P>
<P>
   Most designers realize that high fashion's prices have limited
mass-market appeal. ``We really don't believe a bride is going to
buy a bridal dress on the Internet,'' Hazzard said. ``It's a very
expensive purchase _ it's not something you buy from a picture.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``There are some luxury sites that tell you they sell
$7,000 earrings. I'd like to know how many. I'm not saying they
didn't get one customer to buy them, but Vera and I look at things
in a very practical way. Would Vera buy a $7,000 pair of earrings
on the Internet? No.''
</P>
<P>
   But designers are coming to the belief that they can use the Web
to sell more everyday products.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking at bridesmaids' apparel, bridal accessories, a
gift registry, jewelry, stationery, fragrance, body, bath and
home,'' Hazzard said. Gabbana also said that accessories might make
more sense for online sales.
</P>
<P>
   Some fashion insiders may be in a wait-and-see mode about what
other major brands are doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the world of fashion and high-end retail, there is a
significant lemming effect,'' said Cassar, the analyst. ``When both
Ralph Lauren and Tommy Hilfiger are selling directly on the Web,
everyone else will have no choice but to follow suit.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if a designer decides not to sell online, having a strong
Web presence is good.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a great advertising vehicle for us _ we get about
10,000 catalog requests a week,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, she said, ``I believe people like the retail
shopping experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Many agree. ``The brick-and-mortar department and retail stores
will continue to be the primary outlet for purchases of luxury
products,'' Cassar said. But the Web can attract high-fashion
customers to retail stores. ``As designers build
informational-communication sites, they will initiate a dialogue
with the consumer, and they will then pass the consumer along to
the department store or to their own retail stores for the
transaction.''
</P>
<P>
   But ultimately,'' Cassar added, ``designer fashion is show
business, something that plays better in the physical world.''

 From The Economist magazine  
 c.2000 Economist Newspaper Ltd.  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   (UNDATED) _ ``Bowling Alone'' is an ambitious book. Even before
its publication, its central thesis had been well chewed over in
America. Both major presidential candidates had consulted its
author; so had Bill Clinton. The cognoscenti were sure they knew
what Robert Putnam was saying.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the book has finally appeared, amplifying and
reinforcing a famous article from the Journal of Democracy in 1995,
the danger is that its potential audience _ wise before the event _
will not bother to read it. That would be a pity.
</P>
<P>
   If Putnam, a Harvard political scientist, is right, his findings
constitute the greatest challenge now facing America's political
classes.
</P>
<P>
   If he is wrong, his book will nevertheless afford the reader a
rich and subtle portrait of modern America (with an unexpected
nugget of information on almost every page).
</P>
<P>
   Either way, ``Bowling Alone'' is a prodigious achievement.
Putnam's scholarship is wide-ranging, his intelligence luminous,
his tone modest, his prose unpretentious and frequently funny.
</P>
<P>
   On top of all that, the professor is probably right. He argues
that while America has recently witnessed record growth in physical
and human capital, its stock of ``social capital'' _ informal
social connectedness and formal civic engagement _ has fallen
dangerously low.
</P>
<P>
   Americans used to bowl in leagues. Now they bowl alone. In New
London, Conn., they bowl alone while watching giant television
screens, thus further reducing their chances of forming meaningful
social connections.
</P>
<P>
   For Putnam, bowling alone is an extended metaphor for much that
ails both modern America and modern Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence for Americans' growing social isolation is strong:
families dine together a third less often than they did even in
1980; electoral turnout has fallen precipitously, even though
blacks in the South are now free to vote, and do.
</P>
<P>
   The underlying causes include pressures of time and money,
long-distance commuting, compulsive television-viewing and, most
important of all, the gradual replacement of the long ``civic
generation'' _ those tempered by the Great Depression and the
Second World War _ by waves of laid-back, solipsistic baby-boomers
and ``generation X'ers.''
</P>
<P>
   The evidence for isolation can be ambiguous, it is true. The
risk of caricature is always present and what is social isolation
to one person may be new forms of interaction to another.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Putnam's passion for social capital, hard as it may be to
define, is easily explained. Innumerable recent studies show that
it is at least as vital as physical and human capital for the
well-being of individual citizens and whole nations.
</P>
<P>
   Socially disconnected individuals, neither supported by dense
social networks nor contributing to them, are unhealthier,
unhappier and commit more crimes. They are also often poorer and
much less good at nurturing and educating their children.
</P>
<P>
   Putnam is too polite to say so, but he clearly feels the whole
country is becoming like those American states that are already
conspicuously lacking in social capital, notably Mississippi,
Louisiana and other states in the old Confederacy.
</P>
<P>
   Putnam concludes with a range of practical proposals, albeit
rather vague ones.
</P>
<P>
   He suggests that American policymakers _ and business and
religious leaders _ factor social capital into their plans and
decisions. Will whatever I or my company proposes to do serve to
build social capital or destroy it?
</P>
<P>
   He challenges employers ``to ensure that by 2010 America's
workplace will be substantially more family-friendly and
community-congenial'' than it is now, and he challenges the
nation's planners and developers to ensure that Americans spend
less time on the road commuting and more time connecting with their
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   He also maintains that ``a mounting body of evidence confirms
that community service programs really do strengthen the civic
muscles of participants, especially if the service is meaningful,
regular, and woven into the fabric of the school curriculum.''
</P>
<P>
   Putnam cheerfully admits to being a missionary. Inevitably, a
book cast in such an ambitious mold fails to fill all of it. Many
of Putnam's prescriptions, as he himself acknowledges, are lacking
in detail and definition.
</P>
<P>
   More seriously, he fails to develop the distinction between
strictly local social capital and forms of what might be called
``like-minded social capital'' transcending local and even national
boundaries. The one may languish while the other flourishes.
</P>
<P>
   All the same, ``Bowling Alone'' is a book that civic-minded
Americans, of whom there are still many, ignore at their peril. &QL;

&HT;     BEHIND A SEXUAL REVOLUTION, THE PILL 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARINA PISANO  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ She was a sophomore at a Catholic women's college
in Baltimore. Her boyfriend was pre-med at Johns Hopkins
University. They were in love but not ready for marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Then it happened. Just a few months into her first sexual
experience, Pat Kelly started feeling sick and went to the family
doctor. The doctor confirmed that Kelly was pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   The only birth control Kelly knew about was the rhythm method _
abstaining from sex during monthly ovulation _ and it hadn't worked
for her.
</P>
<P>
   There is wider acceptance of single mothers today, but this was
1968. And this was the oldest of four children in a strict Irish
Catholic family from a small town in New Jersey, the first in the
family to attend college. For this 19-year-old, there could be only
one response to out-of-wedlock pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   Shame.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly, who now serves on the board of Planned Parenthood of San
Antonio and South Central Texas, remembers her mother's words.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, now you've done it,'' she said confronting Kelly with
the doctor's report. ``Now you've done it.''
</P>
<P>
   Painful discussions followed, but her boyfriend assured her it
would be all right. They would get married. She would drop out of
college and work. His family would help support them while he was
in school.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, it was not all right. The marriage lasted 2
1/2 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was your classic shotgun wedding,'' Kelly said. ``It was
clear my parents were not going to do anything to help. If I hadn't
gotten married, I would have ended up in the home for unwed mothers
across the street from the Catholic hospital where I volunteered as
a candy-striper.''
</P>
<P>
   The first thing Kelly did after her daughter was born was go on
the pill. She was determined she would have control over her
reproductive life and be able to plan any future pregnancies _
determined her education wouldn't be interrupted again.
</P>
<P>
   The pill, the oral contraceptive that uses hormones to block
ovulation, turns 40 this year. Approved for use in this country by
the Food and Drug Administration in 1960, it was introduced by G.D.
Searle &AMP; Co. under the name Enovid.
</P>
<P>
   With its 40th anniversary, Kelly and others are looking back on
how, quietly and privately and without great fanfare, the pill
changed their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Women interviewed for this story view the pill positively, and
it is considered a major public-health milestone, but it has
detractors.
</P>
<P>
   By 1965, the pill was the most popular form of birth control
among married women, for its convenience and almost 100 percent
effectiveness when used correctly. Today, the Alan Guttmacher
Institute, which researches contraceptive trends, estimates at
least 45 million women of child-bearing age have used it. But that
may be an underestimate.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at women who have ever used it, the figure is much
higher,'' said Susan Tew, a spokeswoman for the institute, adding
that firm statistics on pill use are hard to come by. ``It's
shocking but true _ the government didn't include unmarried women
in its surveys until 1982.''
</P>
<P>
   Use has dropped slightly in recent years. Still, in a given
year, 10.4 million American women, or 27 percent of those using
contraceptives, choose the pill, making it the most popular
reversible birth-control method. Twenty-eight percent choose female
tubal ligation. Some 20 percent rely on the male condom and about
11 percent on the vasectomy (male sterilization).
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, the San Antonio Metropolitan Health District looked
at the approximately 7,000 women using its family planning clinics
annually and found that 60 percent to 65 percent used the birth
control pill.
</P>
<P>
   The little pills gave women the kind of control Kelly craved.
And they transformed women's lives _ personally, economically and
socially _ and, in the process, forever changed American society.
</P>
<P>
   The pill was a revolution and then some, said sociologist Dr.
Kristin Luker, a professor at the University of California at
Berkeley. ``It was like discovering fire.''
</P>
<P>
   The fire took a few years to spread.
</P>
<P>
   Luker recounts how, as a single woman in 1968, she was refused a
graduate fellowship. ``I was told I might get pregnant and have
babies. But by 1970, (if that was said) you could look your
graduate-school adviser in the eye and say, `Don't be ridiculous.'
That was a truly momentous change.''
</P>
<P>
   Affirmative action and equal-opportunity policies opened
academic and employment doors for women. But the pill and power
over the timing and frequency of pregnancies allowed women to walk
through those doors, Luker said.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For many, the pill is inevitably linked with the sexual
revolution of the late 1960s and 1970s, freeing single women to
explore sex without the bond of marriage and fear of pregnancy.
From the start, some saw it as a passport to promiscuity.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a culture, we get worried when women's sexuality is not
tied to marriage,'' Luker said.
</P>
<P>
   The Catholic Church and some other religions reject the pill and
other contraceptives, advocating the natural family planning
approach of abstaining from sex during ovulation. But Dr. Joseph B.
Stanford, who believes sex should be reserved for marriage, opposes
the pill on non-religious moral grounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It made men not responsible for pregnancy anymore. It took
them off the hook,'' said Stanford, a practicing physician and
assistant professor in family and preventive medicine at the
University of Utah. ``Arguably, men weren't responsible before (the
pill). But instead of getting better, it got worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanford, who favors natural family planning and does not
prescribe the pill to his patients, said the pill ``correlates with
the great increase in premarital and extramarital sex. The whole
approach to sexuality became recreational.''
</P>
<P>
   Perry, who stayed on the pill for more than 10 years, argues
sexual freedom outside of marriage was only part of the story.
``The main thing was for married women. It (the pill) was the
emancipation of our sex life.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Use of the pill dipped in the mid-1970s before rising again
until the late 1980s. Now people are choosing condoms over the
pill, prompted by fear of sexually transmitted diseases.
</P>
<P>
   In the future, the daily pill faces some competition. Approval
is expected for Lunelle, a combination estrogen-progestin,
once-monthly injection. And a weekly transdermal patch is being
developed using combined hormones.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be interesting to see how this is going to change the
market,'' Tew said. ``The failure rate is high when people don't
take the pill perfectly.''

   MIDEAST-SUMMIT _ WASHINGTON _ President Clinton will open a Camp
David summit Tuesday between Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. As they were in 1978 when

calendars. Three days ago was the deadline he set for withdrawing
Israeli troops from Lebanon, but he had already beat that date by
six weeks. He's back in commando mode, challenging the conventional
wisdom and refusing to interrupt his ``mission'' _ the word he uses
for his peace efforts. Almost exactly a year since he took office,
Barak Monday appeared to have staved off parliamentary attempts to
pull down his government and headed off for a date with President
Clinton, Yasser Arafat and, some speculate, his place in history.
Newspapers and some in the Israeli public Monday decried the
erstwhile allies that had abandoned Barak on the eve of the summit.
Some compared him to Israeli founding father David Ben-Gurion, who
charged ahead even when fearful allies hesitated. (Kaplow, Cox News
Service). 25.

   DURBAN, South Africa _ While the overall rate of new HIV
infections in the United States remains stable, more than 7 percent
of young homosexual men in U.S cities are turning up infected,
another troubling sign that efforts to halt the spread of the virus
might be faltering, the U.S. government said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced
the results of a survey of nearly 3,500 men ages 15 to 22 in
advance of the 13th International AIDS Conference, which is being
held in Durban. Subjects were recruited at gay bars, nightclubs and
social events in the San Francisco Bay Area and six other American
cities. The rates of infection ranged from 12.1 percent in New York
to just 2.2 percent in Seattle, with the Bay Area reporting a 6.2
percent rate.
</P>
<P>
   Infection rates were higher for blacks, Hispanics and people of
mixed race. Only 18 percent of those who were infected knew it.
Close to half of those infected reported having unprotected anal
sex in the past six months. The full report is being published in
the Wednesday edition of the Journal of the American Medical
Association.
</P>
<P>
   HIV, or the human immunodeficiency virus, weakens the immune
system, subjecting the body to serious infection and leading to the
acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). AIDS is most often
spread through sexual contact, sharing contaminated needles and
infected blood products.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot allow the next generation of young gay men to suffer
HIV infection as a rite of passage,'' said Helene Gayle, a CDC
official. ``On the one hand we've made considerable progress. But
what we've got to ask ourselves, in light of the evidence, is
whether the gains will be maintained and can we do even better?''
</P>
<P>
   Also troubling to Gayle is recent data showing a doubling in the
rate of gonorrhea among people with HIV, indicating they are having
unprotected sex with greater frequency than before. And last month
it was revealed that the San Francisco Department of Public Health
has documented a threefold increase in the percentage of men
showing up at sexually transmitted disease clinics who test
positive for HIV.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm scared of the trends we are beginning to see,'' Gayle
said. ``It scares me to see a doubling of the rates of gonorrhea in
people who are HIV-infected.''
</P>
<P>
   Gayle said the lack of progress in fighting the spread of HIV is
due to complacency among people who think the virus has been
conquered by anti-retroviral therapies, even though such therapies
are beginning to fail a significant number of patients.
</P>
<P>
   The latest figures were a further disheartening note for the
conference, which for the first time is being held in the
developing world, where 95 percent of AIDS cases exist. If Western
nations with their scientific and health resources can't eliminate
the spread, it does not bode well for African nations trying
desperately to stem their own, far worse, epidemic, Gayle said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the United States, we already have the tools we need to end
HIV as a public health threat,'' she said. ``We as a nation ought
to set an example.''

 &HT;    Applied Materials to unveil new chip production technology
 &HT;    By Bob Keefe
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ When it comes to semiconductors, smaller is
usually better _ except when it comes to making them, that is.
</P>
<P>
   For years, semiconductor makers have been inching toward a new
production process that would double the number of chips they could
produce on a single wafer _ the thin disks of silicon where
semiconductors get their start. But until now, they haven't had all
the equipment needed for mass production.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Applied Materials Inc. is expected to introduce the first
complete line of equipment to make chips on bigger and higher
capacity 300-millimeter silicon wafers, which could finally get the
chip industry on the fast track to building more efficient
factories.
</P>
<P>
   At the annual SEMICON West trade show that starts here today,
Applied Chairman and Chief Executive Jim Morgan plans to unveil his
company's new 21-piece line of equipment designed for
300-millimeter production.
</P>
<P>
   Equipment makers typically introduce new chip tools piece by
piece. But the move toward 300-millimeter technology is so
significant that Applied wanted to introduce a complete line all at
once, Morgan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one has ever done this before,'' he said. ``But (chip
makers) need the whole capability to build a 300-millimeter line,
so we had to bring all our products out at once.''
</P>
<P>
   Applied's move could be particularly significant in Austin,
Texas. In addition to being home to more domestic chip makers than
any other place outside than Silicon Valley, Austin is where
Applied has about 4,500 workers.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan said the new machines will be built in Austin factories,
though the company has begun hiring an unspecified number of new
workers and expects to continue to expand in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   The move from the industry-standard 200-millimeter wafer - about
the size of a salad plate - to the dinner-plate-size 300 millimeter
wafers has been a long and arduous one for the industry.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, most chip makers were planning
300-millimeter production. But chip prices dropped dramatically in
1996 and the industry went into a slump. That, coupled with a rift
between chip makers and equipment makers over specifications,
prompted most companies to put their 300 millimeter plans on hold.
A recent rebound in chip sales has prompted many chip makers to
start planning or building new factories again, and many want to
build at the 300-millimeter standard, which allows up to 2 1/2
times more chips per wafer than 200-millimeter production.
</P>
<P>
   Applied and other equipment makers including Tokyo Electron
Ltd., which also has a factory in Austin, already produce some
pieces of 300-millimeter equipment. A few companies use the tools
to make a limited number of chips, but none mass produces
semiconductors with 300-millimeter technology yet. With the
introduction of a complete, 21-piece line of 300-millimeter
equipment, chip makers can start building 300-millimeter factories.
At least a dozen chip companies, including giants like Intel Corp.,
Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and Motorola Inc., all have said they
are planning 300 millimeter factories, but in part have been
waiting on the equipment.You may contact Bob Keefe at

 &HT;    Giant bugs, roomful of live insects delight children
 &HT;    By Sofia Villalobos
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio - A Chinese praying mantis more than 21 feet long
extending its sharp forearms to catch prey is making its home at
the Boonshoft Museum of Discovery through Sept. 10.
</P>
<P>
   The ``What Bugs Us'' exhibit from Kokoro Ltd. in Tokyo, Japan,
includes robotic insects more than 600 times life size and a
roomful of live insects, including the walking stick and hissing
cockroaches, plus an array of close-up bug pictures accompanied by
educational information.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hear shrieks of delight from the children since the
displays are fun and colorful,'' public relations coordinator
Catherine Mauch said.
</P>
<P>
   Large models of a grasshopper and a spider show the differences
in body structure between insects and arachnids. Some models, like
the locust, span their wings robotically, but children can manually
control the giant head exhibits of a bee, dragonfly and a mosquito
as it illustrates its bite on human skin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like we're the bugs and they're the people,'' Alissa
Ayers, 10, of Kettering said as she toured the museum recently with
her classmates from the Early Beginnings Child Care and Learning
Center.
</P>
<P>
   The display permits bug fanatics to discover not only how
insects move, but what they eat, their environments and their basic
textures, shapes and colors.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is pretty cool because they look real, they move and they
make us look like ants to them,'' said Logan Smith, 6, of
Bellbrook, one of Alissa's classmates.

   Roses From Seed
</P>
<P>
   Q. Can I grow a rose from seed? How long would it take?
</P>
<P>
   A. With patience, a rose can be grown from a seed, and in fact
all the Peace roses of today are descended from a plant grown in
1939 from a single seed nurtured by Francis Meilland, the
hybridizer. But a random seed from a Peace rose or any hybrid would
be unlikely to produce a plant like the one it came from.
</P>
<P>
   As for the time it would take, a wild, unhybridized rose like
Rosa rugosa would be relatively quick and easy to grow from seed,
with little preparation; in the early fall, remove the seeds from
the ripe rose hips, the fruit of the rose, and plant them.
</P>
<P>
   For many other roses, however, the seeds must be refrigerated
for about four weeks for stratification, a cold period, at about 40
degrees, and again for about four months for germination, at a
somewhat higher temperature, with a light on in the refrigerator.
They can be nurtured in moist peat moss.
</P>
<P>
   Before sprouting, seeds can be tested for viability by seeing if
they float in water. Floaters are hollow and unlikely to germinate
</P>
<P>
   The sprouts from the refrigerated seeds can be planted,
preferably in sterile soil, perhaps with a cut-off plastic bottle
as a greenhouse. If they survive, they may produce miniature roses
in just a couple of months, previews of the color of mature roses,
but not their shape. The plants and their roses should reach full
size in about three years.

<P>
   Sooner or later, we all meet up with a jarring reminder that we
are not as young as we think. Increasingly, the jolt hits
middle-age types when a doctor walks through the door: He or she is
not Marcus Welby, in keeping with the demographics of the medical
profession.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 621,000 doctors practicing in hospitals or offices in
1998, the year for which the most recent data are available, almost
half were under age 45, according to the American Medical
Association. The greatest proportion _ about 189,108 _ were 35 to
44.
</P>
<P>
   The shock of dealing with baby-faced doctors may not go beyond
the reflexive brain flash ``She/he looks like a child!'' when the
doctor speaks with authority, professionalism and calmness.
</P>
<P>
   The patients of Dr. Valerie Asher, an ear, nose and throat
specialist in a group practice in Silver Spring, Md., for example,
say she exudes a confidence that belies her age, 39. ``It helps
that I'm tall and I've been a bossy person my whole life,'' Asher
said.
</P>
<P>
   It was that persona that Chris Dowd, 47, saw when doctor and
patient met. ``She was a very succinct, efficient professional,''
said Dowd, of Potomac, Md. ``There was never any question in my
mind that she didn't know precisely what she was doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the fact that Asher, who took time off between her
undergraduate and medical school years at Yale, has been in
practice only since 1995 did not faze Dowd or her 51-year-old
husband, Dan, another patient.
</P>
<P>
   That is not uncommon, said Asher. ``Most of the aging baby
boomers I see are delighted,'' she said. ``They think that I'm
ahead of the curve, compared to someone ahead of their
generation.''
</P>
<P>
   But psychologists say that for many 40- and 50-year-olds that is
not always the case. A younger doctor, psychologists say, can
trigger insecurities about age, mortality, and achievements, as
well as care-giving and advice-taking roles.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Loranger, 36, said she was uneasy last fall when she first
saw her then 2-year-old daughter's new pediatrician, Dr. Karen
Fratantoni, 29. ``She just looked really young,'' said Loranger, a
public relations specialist on maternity leave with her second
child. ``At first, I was like, hmmmm. I questioned it.''
</P>
<P>
   Loranger, of Wheaton, Md., wanted to know why her daughter was
having repeated, stubborn ear infections, but she was worried about
Fratantoni's track record. Fratantoni, however, got to the bottom
of the problem quickly, and Loranger said she has been impressed
since then.
</P>
<P>
   Mid-lifers may also question whether a 30-year-old doctor has
enough clinical or life experience to relate to patients
meaningfully. Ben Sapers, a 33-year-old primary-care doctor who
completed his training last summer, said such concern reflects a
dim understanding of medical education today.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time I finished my residency, I'd seen at least a dozen
people die in front of me,'' said Sapers, of Harvard Vanguard
Medical Associates in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Holly Moss, 30, a specialist who helps children and families
cope with hospital stays, has been practicing for five years. Moss
counsels terminally ill children and their parents at Primary
Children's Medical Center in Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   Parents who meet her see a young woman, she said. ``At first
they are skeptical,'' she said. ``But when I start talking about
the issues and concerns, and anticipate the issues they will have,
they become very receptive.''
</P>
<P>
   She also plays with the children, cajoling them with games,
jokes, costumes _ whatever it takes. With some parents though, Moss
said, that playful mode can undermine her authority, as when a set
of parents decided she was not old enough to talk to their
14-year-old about another child's death.
</P>
<P>
   `` `I just didn't think you had it in you, and I didn't trust
you because you seemed so young, and you don't have your own
children,''' Moss recalled the mother saying.
</P>
<P>
   Some people are unprepared to take advice from a younger person,
said Dr. Nancy Schlossberg, a psychologist and professor emeritus
at the University of Maryland who has written several books about
coping with change. ``We are used to taking care of younger people,
not having younger people take care of us,'' Schlossberg said.
</P>
<P>
   The comfort level may be higher with a younger surgeon, who is
perceived as having steadier hands and more familiarity with the
latest techniques. But it may lessen when the problem is more
personal. A 50-year-old might not feel comfortable, for example,
discussing sexual dysfunction with a 32-year-old, Schlossberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Older doctors are generally better at reading patients'
emotional concerns, said Dr. Zeev Neuwirth, a family therapist and
medical educator at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. But, said
Neuwirth, 38, most newly minted physicians have razor-sharp
technical skills and a solid grounding in relating to their
patients.
</P>
<P>
   And, Dowd said, youth does not always mean inexperience. ``It
kind of gets my back up when people say you are too young to know
what you're talking about.''

PARTISAN POLITICS RUNS DEEP IN THE DEATH PENALTY DEBATE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If there had been any doubt that a partisan political subtext
lurks beneath the current hysteria over capital punishment, the
doubt was erased with this headline: ``White House plans to delay
execution.''
</P>
<P>
   Provided by The New York Times and published in Friday's Fort
Worth Star-Telegram, the story said that President Clinton is
expected to grant a reprieve to a killer who was convicted in 1993
of three drug-related murders in Texas and is scheduled for
execution Aug. 5. The delay would allow the Justice Department to
finalize clemency procedures for federal Death Row inmates.
</P>
<P>
   The Constitution empowers the president to grant pardons and
reprieves in federal cases _ 21 prisoners are awaiting execution
for federal crimes _ but there is no formal policy under which
condemned prisoners can seek presidential clemency. The lack of a
policy posed no problem in recent years _ maybe because the U.S.
government hasn't executed anyone since the Kennedy administration.
</P>
<P>
   But now, with a scheduled execution drawing near and the
anti-death penalty forces on the warpath, Clinton has reportedly
decided that the government must have a policy in place before he
can allow a cold-blooded killer to face the executioner. Clinton
decided this, by the way, even though a federal judge had already
rejected lawyers' arguments that it would be inappropriate to
execute multiple murderer Juan Raul Garza before clemency rules are
finalized, according to The Times.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible, of course, that Clinton simply wants to shield
himself from the sort of criticism heaped upon Texas Gov. George W.
Bush regarding the Lone Star State's clemency process. Although
Texas governors have no constitutional authority to overturn death
sentences, Bush has nonetheless taken the heat for a state system
that calls for members of an appointed board to rule on clemency
requests.
</P>
<P>
   Far more likely, though, is the possibility that Clinton sees in
this situation an opportunity to help Vice President Al Gore in his
presidential campaign against Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has been hard-pressed to score any political points on the
capital punishment issue because both he and Clinton have been
enthusiastic death-penalty advocates throughout their public lives.
But by bending over backward to make sure that the government is
more than fair with Garza, Clinton can market the impression that
his administration is committed to Death Row fairness _ and that
the Clinton-Gore policy on clemency is therefore superior to the
Texas policy.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, delaying Garza's execution would almost certainly keep
him out of the death chamber until after the November election.
Leave it to Clinton to devise a gambit that allows him and his
sidekick Gore to be simultaneously for and against the death
penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and there's another reason for holding up Garza's
appointment with the lethal needle, according to The Times. Clinton
is concerned about geographical and ethnic imbalance in federal
death sentences.
</P>
<P>
   The president set the stage during his White House news
conference last week when he said he was worried that a defendant's
chances of being sentenced to death might hinge on ``where you
committed the crime.''
</P>
<P>
   The implication: If federal prosecutors in certain parts of the
country are inclined to seek the death penalty for capital crimes
and those in other parts of the country are not, then defendants in
areas with aggressive prosecutors are being treated unfairly.
</P>
<P>
   There's some liberal logic for you.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Clinton's objective here is a tricky one. He wants
to help Gore by exploiting criticism of Bush's support for capital
punishment while avoiding charges of hypocrisy _ an understandable
concern, seeing as how the former Arkansas governor left the
presidential campaign trail in 1992 to oversee an execution and two
years later signed federal legislation expanding the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Just a guess: This is one trick that even Slick Willie can't
pull off.

<P>
   If Al Gore had said some of the things George W. Bush has been
saying, the Wall Street Journal editorial page would be having
fits, and the Heritage Foundation broadside-o-matic machines would
be churning with outrage.
</P>
<P>
   In a single mid-June speech on disabilities, Bush promised to
``triple the current funding'' for disability research; to create a
``technology transfer fund'' that would subsidize small-business
efforts to adapt for the handicapped; to ``spend $20 million''
buying computers so that disabled workers can telecommute; to
``swiftly implement the recently passed 'Ticket-to-Work' law,''
which apparently allows people to keep their disability benefits
after taking a job; to ``seek $10 million each year'' to build
wheelchair ramps in ``churches, synagogues and mosques,'' and on
and on.
</P>
<P>
   More than the money itself, it's the laundry-list rhetoric_
here's every problem you can think of (and a few you never thought
of), and here's my plan to throw money at it_ that ought to offend
conservative ideologues but doesn't seem to.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Republicans in Congress race the Democrats to enact a
Medicare drug benefit, which, even in the more stinting Republican
version, would be the biggest new social welfare program in a
generation.
</P>
<P>
   In another recent speech outlining his alleged philosophy of
government, Bush performed a series of
Democratic-presidential-candidate impersonations. He started off
sounding like early Clinton of the ``reinventing government''
period: ``In Pennsylvania, Governor Ridge has reformed government
contracting. ... Indianapolis has put 80 municipal services
(somewhere or other).''
</P>
<P>
   Soon he was doing a pretty good Michael
``Swedish-Land-Use-Planning'' Dukakis: professing indignation that
the Commerce Department claims to be in compliance with something
called the Government Performance and Results Act ``if performance
is at just two-thirds of the target level.''
</P>
<P>
   He ultimately regressed to Jimmy Carter, calling (as Carter did)
for ``sunset'' laws requiring agencies to be reauthorized every few
years. Did Carter also call for creation of a ``Sunset Review
Board''? Perhaps that is a Bush innovation.
</P>
<P>
   The premise of this kind of government reform is that government
should be doing more, not less. In his speech text, Bush calls for
more government half a dozen times. His only reference to the
possibility of less government is accusing the Clinton
administration of failing to ``ask fundamental questions'' about
what government does, including ``whether it should be doing it at
all.'' But he gives no evidence of asking the question himself.
</P>
<P>
   Bush says his own ``vision'' is ``guided by three principles:
government should be citizen-centered, results-oriented, and,
wherever possible, market-based.''
</P>
<P>
   The first two are near-meaningless bromides. The third_ market
forces _ has meaning, but it's procedural. It may help in deciding
how the government should get involved, but not whether.
</P>
<P>
   If Bush has a theory to distinguish his thinking on this
``fundamental issue'' from Al Gore'sor even George McGovern's,he is
keeping it to himself.
</P>
<P>
   So why is it left to me to point this out? Where are the voices
of conservatism, quoting the anti-government wisdom of Ronald
Reagan?
</P>
<P>
   Obviously Gore would be even worse from their point of view. But
the virtual total silence on the right about Bush's sins against
the true faith is an impressive triumph of political discipline
over intellectual honesty. Call it a Vast Right-Wing Conspiracy of
Silence. What they don't say is better evidence that such a
conspiracy exists than what they do say.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, I sympathize. Eight years ago I wrote in a column,
``I'm for Clinton_ just don't tell me anything about him.''
Democrats were tired of losing and not inclined to be fussy. You
can't blame Republicans for feeling that way now.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, liberals ignored their man's reputation for personal
and political character flaws because he looked like a winner. More
than that: Those flaws had something to do with making him look
like a winner.
</P>
<P>
   This year conservatives are ignoring their man's reputation for
being dim and his ideological apostasy because he looks like a
winner. And, once again, it's more than that: The apostasy (if not
the dimness) is part of what makes him look like a winner.
</P>
<P>
   Viewed from the outside, this is all quite wonderful. For eight
years, the conservative explanation of Bill Clinton has been:
``He's a dangerous left-winger who stole all our ideas.'' Slightly
self-contradictory, but true enough in that moving his party and
himself rightward helped Clinton to win. It's also true that for
more like 28 years than merely eight, the Democratslacking
confidence in the popularity of their own valueshave tended on many
issues to take the dispiriting line, ``We're just like the other
guys, only less so.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, it is the Republican nominee who is patently
stealing ideas from the other side. And the GOP is the party that
seems to be afraid the voters won't buy its own principles, So, it
is offering a watered-down version of the other side's principles
instead.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe this is just the yin and yang of democracy. The parties
take turns establishing and then compromising their principles.
Once-radical ideas are enacted into law by the party that
courageously fights for them, but they are absorbed into the
mainstream by the party that cravenly borrows them.
</P>
<P>
   For liberals who've been coming to terms with conservative ideas
for three decades, conservatives' silent acceptance of George W.
Bush's many betrayals is Bill Clinton's final gift.

 FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES 
 By ANNASUE McCLEAVE WILSON  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    The shimmering heat of a summer's morning on the short-grass
prairie of the Great Plains is unsettling. It's already so hot, and
the wind never seems to let up.
 &HT;    Stepping out of a truck onto the parched stubble in sandals is
downright alarming, for with each footfall a thousand grasshoppers
scatter.
 &HT;    My 13-year-old son, John, and I had driven cross-country last
July to Oklahoma, which in the language of the Choctaw means ``red
people,'' looking for American Indian powwows because, like many
American families, we have an Indian ancestor, a Choctaw.
 &HT;    Earlier that morning we had left Guthrie, the territory's first
capital, 15 miles north of Oklahoma City; picked up my husband,
John, at Will Rogers World Airport; and headed southwest toward the
town of Anadarko, tribal headquarters for the Plains Apache,
Western Delaware and Wichita.
 &HT;    Although this part of the world has been Indian territory for
20,000 years, it wasn't officially designated as such until 1825,
when the U.S. government promised it to the Plains Indians and what
were known as the Five Civilized Tribes _ Choctaw, Cherokee, Creek,
Chickasaw, and Seminole _ ``for as long as grass grows and water
runs.''
 &HT;    Their powwows evolved from gatherings of medicine men and
spiritual leaders who danced to invoke divine aid or, on the Great
Plains, to commemorate the buffalo hunt.
 &HT;    Now the powwows are social events that take place every weekend
from Memorial Day to Labor Day. Visitors have been welcome at
intertribal powwows since the late 19th century, and because our
extended families live at the northern and southern boundaries of
Indian territory, we have attended powwows over the years from
Kansas City, Mo., to Fort Worth.
 &HT;    ``When you get to Anadarko, take a right at the Baptist Church,
pass Wal-Mart, and meet us at the deserted gas station about three
miles on your left,'' were the directions given us by Margo
Edringer.
 &HT;    She and her husband, Edgar, are the German proprietors of a
tepee village called Wolf's Heaven who were to guide us to powwows
in the area that weekend. Guests at the camp sleep in tepees, eat
meals prepared over an open fire by an Indian cook, hike, fish,
listen to storytelling and attend local powwows.
 &HT;    After following Margo Edringer across that grasshopper-laden
prairie, we rested under a willow awning. She offered us iced tea
and frybread, then led us to the tepees.
 &HT;    ``They're all authentic,'' she said. ``This one is made in the
Northern style.'' We stepped over the rawhide threshold onto the
packed-dirt floor; two narrow beds flanked a hole in the center,
dug to accommodate a small fire. The door had been cut out of the
side to create a snow break.
 &HT;    The heat made snow seem so remote that I found myself
calculating instead how hard it would be for a snake to sneak in.
 &HT;    ``Oh, snakes are not a problem,'' Ms. Edringer assured us,
raising her long skirts as she crossed the narrow path through the
grass to the river. Edgar Edringer and the staff _ all Indian _
were fishing from the riverbank, and while we watched, they snagged
a snapping turtle. The woods by the river broke the prairie wind,
and here it was still.
 &HT;    That afternoon a dozen of us from Wolf's Heaven were invited to
a smoking ceremony out at Nathan Redbone's place. Redbone is an
Apache elder whose wife had just died, and the ceremony was taking
place in her honor. The extended family and friends of the Redbones
were eating in their yard under a canopy that bowed furiously in
the fierce wind at the top of the hill.
 &HT;    Inside a tepee beside the family's brick house, Redbone's
brother-in-law was ``cedaring'' (blessing) first the children, then
the family and Wolf's Heaven people with smoke from a small fire of
seeds and fragrant grasses, which he coaxed upward and brushed
along each of our faces with a feather fan.
 &HT;    I asked Nathan Redbone if the blessings were words best kept
quietly in one's heart. ``Once we tell you a story it's not ours
anymore,'' he replied.
 &HT;    The Apache lifeway _ an American Indian term for lifestyle _ is
so endangered that this family shared its most intimate gatherings
so that someone, anyone, might remember.
 &HT;    By evening we were traveling in convoy to a powwow near the town
of Apache, 18 miles from Anadarko. A rarely performed fire dance
was going on at the Fort Sill Apache Tribal Center.
 &HT;    Dancers wearing flat, antlerlike headdresses, their upper bodies
painted white with black slashes and their mouths covered with red
scarves, danced the story of two men caught in a cave after a great
battle.
 &HT;    The Mountain Spirit tells the lame man to climb up on the blind
man's shoulders and lead him to where they can make a fire, so that
together they may be rescued. One dancer in the group was a boy of
10 or so, learning by following along.
 &HT;    The next morning _ awakened before dawn by a noisy chorus of
birdsong _ we drove about an hour south to Fort Sill, still an
active Army post, built in 1869 to pacify raiding tribes of the
southern Plains. One by one the Indian bands surrendered at Fort
Sill, including Geronimo, the rebel warrior who was confined there
until his death in 1909.
 &HT;    Geronimo is buried in the Apache prisoner-of-war cemetery under
an unruly rocky mount of a tombstone, which has become a pilgrimage
site. When we asked soldiers at the visitors center the way, they
spoke volumes by gruffly informing us the road was flooded and
inaccessible.
 &HT;    Just west of Fort Sill is the Wichita Mountains National
Wildlife Refuge. Although signs posted along the perimeter of the
Army base cautioned drivers about weapons testing overhead, inside
the wildlife refuge one could imagine what this part of the world
might have looked like while the Indians were still pursuing their
lifeway.
 &HT;    A herd of buffalo grazed on a prairie filled with summer
wildflowers bent over double by the wind. A road coils up the rocky
Mount Scott, and from it you can see Texas, and almost to Oklahoma
City to the northeast.
 &HT;    The second half of our trip was spent zigzagging across central
and eastern Oklahoma the following weekend. This part of the state
was settled by the Choctaw, Cherokee, Creek, Chickasaw and Seminole
after 1825 when some 16,000 of them were marched by force on a
Trail of Tears from lands coveted by white settlers east of the
Mississippi River.
 &HT;    Unlike Plains Indians, these tribes were not nomadic, and they
recreated their lifeways in the wooded areas east and southeast of
Tulsa. They resisted annexation to Oklahoma Territory, planning
instead for a separate Indian state, but were ignored by Congress,
which created a unified Oklahoma in 1907.
 &HT;    We planned to take in the Pawnee Indian Homecoming Powwow in the
town of Pawnee on Saturday night and the Quapaw Powwow on the
Fourth of July in Miami, in the far northeast corner of the state
at the Missouri border, so we had to high-tail it due east on I-40
toward the Arkansas border aiming for the ancient Spiro Mounds,
earthen burial chambers built between 850 and 1450 A.D.
 &HT;    By afternoon we had reached Sequoyah's Cabin, a national
historic landmark near the town of Sallisaw. Sequoyah, a Cherokee
intrigued by the white people's books, which he called ``talking
leaves,'' created a written syllabary for his native language. As a
result, the whole Cherokee nation became literate almost overnight.
 &HT;    Computers at the site print out each visitor's name in Cherokee.
Armed with copies of our names, and a postcard of the Cherokee
alphabet, our son spent the rest of the long road trip translating
English word sounds into Cherokee.
 &HT;    By the time we were close to the Spiro Mounds, it was dusk,
which gave courage to several foolish turtles that tried to cross
the highway in front of us.
 &HT;    We were eager to find our bed-and-breakfast before dark. We had
reserved Aunt Jan's Cozy Cabin next to the home of its owner, Jan
Wood, in the rural woodlands near Spiro. She offers an optional
steak dinner in the cabin, and there's a hot tub on the porch. By
nightfall the cicadas are in full chorus. This is not a land of
silence, but of raucous varmints and wind.
 &HT;    In the morning, we drove a short way north to the Spiro Mounds.
The sophisticated artifacts excavated there are fashioned from
copper or adorned with pearls and conch traded from tribes near the
Gulf of Mexico. Some are on view at the adjacent interpretive
center, but many more are scattered among museums throughout the
state and all over the world.
 &HT;    Outside, a path loops around 12 mounds that look simply like
grassy hills; they are presided over by tiny toads that kept us
amused by leaping across the walkway.
 &HT;    The Cherokee Heritage Center is north of Spiro on a roundabout
way to Tulsa, 40 miles back northwest. It includes Tsa La Gi, a
re-creation of a 16th-century Cherokee settlement, and a stridently
didactic museum, which includes a display of ancient Indian games
and gaming gear.
 &HT;    From there we traveled through Tulsa and down an undulating
ribbon of two-lane highway to the Homestead at GT Ranch near the
town of Red Rock. This bed-and-breakfast is a log cabin with a view
out over the heads of a few longhorn cattle being teased by the
ranch's noisy dogs.
 &HT;    We'd gone back west just far enough to be in the Plains again,
where the land looks like an endless sea and the dirt is red as
blood.
 &HT;    When we went inside to drop off our bags the only thing in the
vast sky was the orange sun. When we got back in the truck on our
way to the Pawnee Powwow, the sun had slipped so quickly beyond the
horizon that we could almost feel the earth turning.
 &HT;    It was dark by the time we arrived in Pawnee. A brightly colored
circle of woven plastic lawn chairs formed a wide ring on the field
around the sacred drum. Nine or 10 men sat at the drum, striking it
and singing. Once the powwow began, the drum was as incessant as a
heartbeat.
 &HT;    This intertribal powwow honors Indian veterans. Before
reservation life, the Indian warrior's role was paramount to the
survival of his people, so Indian veterans of any war are highly
revered.
 &HT;    The Grand Entry at all powwows is led by soldiers bearing the
Eagle Staff, representing the American Indian ``first nation.''
Some who fought in Vietnam and the Persian Gulf danced in fatigues,
squatting low and imitating the movements of a prairie chicken.
 &HT;    The evening progressed through different categories: junior
men's grass dance, traditional and fancy dances, followed by
ladies' fancy shawl, jingle and buckskin dances.
 &HT;    Men's traditional dance steps mimic birds or warriors in search
of an enemy. Women's are more subtle, a step and a bend of the knee
or a gentle rocking. Fringe on a buckskin skirt sways like grass in
the breeze; an outstretched shawl becomes a butterfly. It is part
of the contest to make headdress feathers and fringe come to a
complete stop on the downstroke of a song's last drumbeat.
 &HT;    Big powwows include raffles of Indian blankets and jewelry,
prize money for dance contest winners, and a contingent of booths
selling crafts, tribal T-shirts and ``Free Leonard Peltier'' pins
and bumper stickers.
 &HT;    Peltier, a leader of the Ojibwa-Sioux, has spent two decades in
prison after being convicted, some believe wrongfully, of killing
two FBI agents in 1975. Alcohol is strictly forbidden but stands
sell Indian tacos and frybread.
 &HT;    Protocol dictated that as tourists we ask permission before
setting up folding chairs behind families of those dancing. It took
a little courage to plunge into the all-Indian crowd, but we were
welcomed with a genial indifference.
 &HT;    At one point, the whole powwow came to a standstill when an
eagle feather fell to the ground during a dance. Four men attacked
four times from the four directions to retrieve it and restore its
lost power.
 &HT;    Our last day in Oklahoma was the Fourth of July. The Quapaw
Powwow we attended that night is held at a campground outside
Miami, Okla., in a sunken arena with concrete bench rows built into
the hill that made it look like a little Roman amphitheater.
 &HT;    Miss Indian USA, a former Quapaw tribal princess, danced near
the head of the line during the Grand Entry and led the blanket
dance, during which a blanket is laid out for donations to the
drum. It is customary to place money on the blanket for the
singers' traveling expenses, then to dance the rest of the song.
 &HT;    We felt awkward joining in, so we asked a child already in the
circle to throw our money in. We stayed late enough to see the
men's fancy dance, notable for its elaborate regalia (it is never
called a costume), including two huge feather bustles and matching
headdress.
 &HT;    At a booth selling Indian jewelry, our son John laid claim to a
ceremonial club made in the traditional style by a man of Choctaw
descent. He came back from the concession stand with a Quapaw
friend with whom he forged a brief bond as one does when meeting a
second cousin once removed. The Quapaw Powwow, like any big family
reunion, seemed a remarkably apt way to spend an American holiday.

 FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES 
 By WAYNE CURTIS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    The spirited waterfront city of Portland, Me., has quietly
emerged from the shadows in the past few years. Residents these
days don't need to explain to visitors quite so often that, well,
the Trail Blazers play basketball in that other Portland.
 &HT;    Two decades ago entrepreneurs reinvigorated the Victorian Old
Port neighborhood, known for its exceptional brick architecture.
The revival recently moved uptown to Congress Street, where an arts
district is taking root, helped by the Maine College of Art's
decision to fill an empty Beaux-Arts department store with students
after its owners decamped to a mall.
 &HT;    On the streets this summer you're likely to overhear Portlanders
talking of soaring real-estate values and of Web entrepreneurs who
have started to trickle in.
 &HT;    Portland, Maine's largest city, once had easy access to European
trade routes in its favor; now it has lifestyle. Situated on Casco
Bay, which is often speckled with colorful sailboats on summer
weekends, it's a tidy and compact city, where you can walk almost
everywhere. Yet it's imbued with far more urban energy than one
would expect for a city of 65,000.
 &HT;    The optimism is sometimes tinged with nervousness. Portlanders
have been comfortable in the shadows, thank you very much, and
there's growing concern that too much attention will bring
unwelcome change.
 EVENTS  
 &HT;    This month Portland's harbor will take on a 19th-century air
when more than two dozen tall ships from around the world will
converge here, the final port in Operation Sail 2000, (207)
541-7400, which began in Puerto Rico in May. The Portland
festivities begin with a ship parade at noon on July 28, when the
tall ships will be greeted with gun salutes as they pass sites of
two 19th-century forts.
 &HT;    Among the best vantage points is the pathway along the Eastern
Prom, which runs northward along the harbor from near the Casco Bay
Lines ferry terminal. The three-day event will also include
fireworks, musical performances at stages along the waterfront,
ship tours and maritime exhibits at museums in and around the city.
 &HT;    The Yarmouth Clam Festival, (207) 846-3984, takes place July 21
to 23 in the village of Yarmouth, about 15 minutes' drive north of
Portland. It's an old-fashioned community festival, and this year
will feature pageantry imported from the medieval festival in
Cortona, Italy, including a crossbow contest and a parade with
costumed performers, Carnival rides, old-fashioned games and
splendidly caloric foods round out the event; admission is free.
 &HT;    The Portland Museum of Art, 7 Congress Square, (800) 639-4067,
is displaying more than 50 works by N. C. Wyeth, the patriarch of
the Wyeth clan (1882-1945), through Oct. 15. Wyeth is best known
for his vivid illustrations of books like ``Treasure Island,'' but
he also painted privately, dabbling in styles ranging from
Impressionism to Realism. The exhibition's emphasis is on the
paintings, but a number of Wyeth's illustrations are also on view.
 &HT;    The Center for Cultural Exchange, 1 Longfellow Square, (207)
761-1545, presents a series of global music concerts and dances
each week throughout the summer. At 7 p.m. this Saturday the Saigon
Water Puppets of Vietnam will perform at the center, to the
accompaniment of music played on centuries-old instruments. Tickets
are $10, $5 for children.
 &HT;    The colorful Maine Festival, (207) 772-9012, runs from Aug. 4 to
6, with an eclectic assortment of Maine musicians, poets, dancers,
artists and craftsmen. The sprawling festival attracts about 20,000
visitors during its three-day run at the Thomas Point Beach
campground in Brunswick, at the north end of Casco Bay, 26 miles
north of Portland. Tickets are $12 at the gate, $10 in advance,
with discounts for seniors and children.
 SIGHTSEEING  
 &HT;    A superb spot to get the lay of the land is atop the Portland
Observatory, 138 Congress St., (207) 774-5561, on Munjoy Hill, one
of the downtown residential neighborhoods. The 86-foot cone-shaped
tower was built in 1807 as a perch to notify Portlanders of
incoming ships via a system of flags. It reopened on June 10 after
a five-year renovation, and the observation deck offers a
vertiginous view of the city, harbor and islands. Open daily; $3.
 &HT;    The best way to tour Portland is on foot, for a better
appreciation of the brick sidewalks, granite curbs, architectural
details and the sound of gulls wheeling overhead.
 &HT;    The Old Port district, home to dozens of boutiques and
restaurants, has some fine examples of Victorian commercial
architecture, most of them dating from after 1866, when the last
great fire swept through the city.
 &HT;    Greater Portland Landmarks, 165 State St., (207) 774-5561,
publishes self-guided walking tours of four neighborhoods, for
$1.25 each. The organization also conducts daily guided walking
tours, beginning at 10:30 a.m. and lasting for about an hour and a
half, between July 5 and Oct. 9. The starting point for the tours
is the Convention and Visitors Bureau of Greater Portland, 305
Commercial St., (207) 772-5800.
 &HT;    In the city's West End, one of Portland's grand 19th-century
neighborhoods of architecturally eclectic houses, is the
Morse-Libby House, 109 Danforth St., (207) 772-4841, one of the
nation's pre-eminent examples of Italianate Victorian architecture.
Guided tours through this opulent brownstone mansion suggest a
lavishness that might arouse envy in Donald Trump. The house is
open Tuesday through Sunday; $7.
 &HT;    Along the waterfront on Commercial Street, a fleet of
sightseeing boats offers excursions through the dozens of islands
that dot the bay. Among the more intriguing destinations is the
17-acre Eagle Island, the former summer home of the Arctic explorer
Robert E. Peary.
 &HT;    The four-hour trip includes an hour-and-20-minute stop on the
island (take a picnic), where Peary's home, a 1904 shingle and
stone summer cottage, is open to the public. Eagle Island Tours,
Long Wharf, (207) 774-6498, offers one trip daily at 10 a.m., with
reservations suggested. The price is $18, $10.50 for children.
 &HT;    Fifteen minutes from downtown is the Portland Head Light, 1000
Shore Road, Cape Elizabeth; (207) 799-2661. It may look instantly
familiar _ it appears frequently in calendars and ads. The light
dates from 1791 (President George Washington appointed the first
keeper), and the present lightkeeper's house, the third on the
site, was built in 1891.
 &HT;    The light is still operational and so isn't open to the public,
but travelers can stroll the expansive park grounds overlooking the
harbor's entrance and visit the museum at the keeper's house. The
park is free; the museum, open daily, is $2, $1 for children.
 &HT;    On sweltering days, visitors might opt for a trip 20 miles south
to Old Orchard Beach, home to a seven-mile sandy strand edged by
chilly ocean waters, carnival rides and food vendors.
 WHERE TO STAY  
 &HT;    The stylishly funky Pomegranate Inn, 49 Neal St., (207)
772-1006, fax (207) 773-4426, in the West End, was built in 1884.
It has eight guest rooms, all above average in size, decorated with
antiques, modern art and vibrantly painted walls. Doubles are $135
to $225, including breakfast.
 &HT;    Barbara Hathaway has converted a regal 1821 brick house into the
welcoming Danforth Inn, 163 Danforth St.; (207) 879-8755, fax (207)
879-8754. The 10 guest rooms vary in size (some are in the former
servants' quarters), but all are comfortable and attractive. Room 1
has a private sitting room and second-floor deck; guests have
access to the billiard room in the basement. Doubles are $135 to
$285, including breakfast.
 &HT;    Budget: The Percy Inn, 15 Pine St., (207) 871-7638, fax (207)
775-2599, is in a narrow 1830 brick row house in the city's West
End and has two guest rooms and three suites furnished in early
Federal style. All rooms are up a steep winding staircase. Those
facing the street are a bit noisy, but brighter and more spacious
than those facing the rear. Doubles are $89 to $169, with
breakfast.
 &HT;    The Inn at Park Spring, 135 Spring St., (800) 437-8511 or (207)
774-1059 has six guest rooms in a cozy 1835 brick house near the
art museum and within strolling distance of the Old Port and city
restaurants. Summer rates for two are $135 to $145, including
breakfast.
 &HT;    Luxury: About 15 minutes southeast of Portland is the Black
Point Inn, 510 Black Point Road, Prouts Neck, Scarborough, (800)
258-0003, fax (207) 883-9976, a compound of shingled 19th-century
buildings on nine acres overlooking the ocean.
 &HT;    Built as a summer resort in 1873, the inn features 85 guest
rooms in five buildings. Most rooms are in the main lodge, and are
generous in size and furnished in a cheerful summer-cottage style.
Summer rates from $345 for two, including breakfast and dinner.
 WHERE TO EAT  
 &HT;    Cravings for basic boiled lobster are probably better indulged
elsewhere along the Maine coast, at rustic lobster shacks, at
picnic tables atop a pier. In Portland, the fare is more creative.
 &HT;    Natasha's, 40 Portland St., (207) 774-4004, features new
American fare in an echo-y industrial space, with a menu that
features Thai noodles with vegetarian pot stickers, grilled pork
loin with po blano jam, and ravioli stuffed with lobster and crab.
Open Tuesday to Saturday for dinner, daily for breakfast and lunch.
Dinner for two with wine, about $60.
 &HT;    At Ribollita, 41 Middle St., (207) 774-2972, Kevin Quiet, the
chef and owner, offers a menu of handmade pasta and other
Mediterranean-influenced dishes. Among the options: ravioli with
white beans and Romano cheese served with a hazelnut brown butter,
and oven-poached sole with crabmeat mascarpone tortellini. Open for
dinner Tuesday to Saturday; dinner for two, with wine, is about
$70.
 &HT;    Bella Cucina, 653 Congress St., (207) 828-4033, combines
romantic and hip in a storefront restaurant that's awash in mellow
tones. The restaurant bills its fare as country Italian, and serves
up a good selection of fresh seafood and vegetarian options.
 &HT;    The menu changes according to availability of ingredients;
expect entrees like a grilled salmon medallion in a
parmesan-hazelnut crust, or a rabbit, duck and pork ragu served
over pasta with wood-grilled peppers. Open nightly; dinner $75 for
two, with wine.
 &HT;    The informal and eclectic Katahdin, 106 High St., (207)
774-1740, is near the art museum and offers budget blue-plate
specials along with more refined fare. The seafood is particularly
good, with dishes ranging from yellowfin tuna with a green onion
wasabi sauce to grilled sea scallops. The bar has been mixing
martinis since well before the martini bar was rediscovered. Open
nightly, Tuesday through Saturday; dinner for two, with martinis:
$75.
 &HT;    Silly's, 40 Washington Ave., (207) 772-0360, will satisfy
aficionados of kitsch (especially Elvis kitsch) and zesty finger
food. It's a boisterous neighborhood joint; the pizzas are popular,
as are the lamb shish kebab roll-ups with feta cheese. Hand-cut
fries and a milkshake nicely fill out a meal, not to mention the
customer. Open daily except Sunday for lunch and dinner: about $15
to $20 for two.

 (Free to clients of Way to Go!) 
 (FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES) 
 BY MELANIE REHAK  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    When I was a child in Manhattan, summer vacation signaled the
start of hours spent playing inside air-conditioned apartments,
leavened by forays to the Good Humor truck or to roller-skate
around the block under the watchful eye of neighborhood doormen.
 &HT;    These activities seemed very average to me, and I reserved my
excitement for a pastime that represented the truly exotic:
camping.
 &HT;    The idea of sleeping under the stars _ even seeing the stars _
epitomized the sublime. I lay in my room at night pretending that
the steady stream of cold air from the window unit was a breeze,
and that the hum of traffic was the burble of a running brook.
 &HT;    Eventually, my father took me camping in the White Mountains in
New Hampshire, where I discovered that along with the pleasant
attributes of outdoor life _ the crackle of the fire, the sound of
the wind in the trees, the piney smell of the campsite _ came some
rather difficult logistics.
 &HT;    Our tent was made of pale orange canvas, and its aluminum poles
had to be put together piece by piece by piece _ an endless
process. The tent pegs came in a tiny, moldering bag that reminded
me of the pouches in which gold panners kept their meager finds.
 &HT;    The tent was poorly ventilated and damp, and all night, no
matter which way I turned in my soggy cloth sleeping bag, rocks and
twigs jabbed at me. I forced myself to focus on the joy of setting
marshmallows on fire.
 &HT;    Still, I was an instant addict. In subsequent years, I pitched
innumerable tents. At summer camp, I went on canoe trips, gleefully
portaging a canoe with my fellow grimy bunkmates (this was a
benefit of camping I hadn't foreseen: no showers!).
 &HT;    I acquired my own canoe paddle and engaged in high-minded
discussions about whether or not using soap in lakes would kill off
the plant life. Even the trip on which I stepped on a fish hook
(after being told repeatedly not to walk around barefoot) did not
dampen my enthusiasm. I drank bug juice with pine pitch in it and
ate scores of hot dogs.
 &HT;    As I got older and busier, my desire to go camping waned. When I
finally made plans to head into the woods again, last summer, it
had been a dozen years since my last night of ghost-story terror
intensified by strange rustlings in the underbrush. The occasion
was a cross-country drive, on which my friend Noah and I planned to
camp in Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming.
 &HT;    Envisioning hot cocoa and reading by flashlight, I went in
search of a tent _ and got something of a shock. Navigating the
outdoors first meant navigating the 21st century. The woods seemed
very far away.
 &HT;    Instead of heading out to Eastern Mountain Sports or leafing
through the L.L. Bean catalog, as I might have done 10 or even five
years ago, I went on the Internet. There, I discovered the Web site
of Recreational Equipment Inc., the Seattle-based outdoor gear
store.
 &HT;    Then I found the link to the REI Outlet Web site,
(www.rei-outlet.com) designed for _ not to mention directed at _
people who want to prove, or perhaps improve, their physical
prowess without paying retail or setting foot in a store.
 &HT;    Within minutes, I had located the perfect tent for the perfect
price ($52.95). It was made of hunter-green nylon, and had
fiberglass poles, a window in the back, and a screen across the
front flap. A nifty fly to ward off rain went over the top. I
couldn't test the zippers or lie down in it, but one click and it
was mine.
 &HT;    Having made such short work of my task, I spent some time
cruising through some of the unbelievable numbers of items offered
on the site to see if there was anything I couldn't live without.
Most of it was stuff I'd never heard of.
 &HT;    There were ``hydration backpacks,'' with tubes running from
built-in reservoirs for easy drinking. There were no fewer than 30
styles of hiking shoes _ for day hikes, long hikes, winter hikes,
summer hikes. There were Therm-a-Rest self-inflating mattresses in
10 styles. There were water-filtration systems, gourmet cook sets,
even a Java Press for brewing that perfect latte around the coals.
 &HT;    While some of these improvements seemed eminently reasonable _
for example, making sleeping bags out of materials that do not
absorb water _ a lot of it seemed excessive. Did I really need
microfiber pants that convert into shorts for a three-night camping
trip? Yet they were tempting.
 &HT;    True, much of this stuff is meant for people who do things like
hike the Appalachian Trail from North Carolina to New Hampshire.
But marketing departments for these outfitters must figure that
certain people will feel that even one night in the wild requires a
headlamp and a two-way radio _ just in case someone gets lost
looking for the water tap.
 &HT;    I refrained, however. Luckily Noah was already the proud owner
of a pair of Therm-a-Rests.
 &HT;    When the great day finally arrived, we were traveling light. We
pulled up to our campsite, pulled out our tent and prepared for
battle. In my mind's eye, I had imagined us struggling with poles
and confusion; in reality, we had the thing pitched in under five
minutes.
 &HT;    Having budgeted the hour or so left before dark for putting up
the tent (not to mention arguing about it), I was unsure of what to
do next. Then I realized it was time for the part of camping that
was fun, which, thanks to the miracles of modern technology, had
arrived early. I got a novel, put on a sweater, and promptly fell
asleep on my air mattress.
 &HT;    A few hours later, we started to get hungry, and the issue of
collecting kindling for the fire arose (we had opted not to buy a
gas camp stove, theorizing that these were for sissies). Who was
going to go out there into the dark woods to look? And furthermore,
had we remembered bug spray?
 &HT;    In the end we both went, but some of the old ill will that I
remembered so well from previous camping trips had begun to well
up.
 &HT;    I found this oddly comforting _ all the high-tech efficiency was
getting on my nerves. Dinner, naturally, was franks and beans
cooked to a slow scorch over the fire. We topped it off with
s'mores and then it was time for bed.
 &HT;    The trip to the wash house wasn't bad _ we walked along the path
with a flashlight, banging the tin pot we'd cooked our dinner in
against our knees, listening to the friendly chirping of birds and
insects.
 &HT;    Sometime in the creepy dark of early morning, I woke up and
wanted to go to the bathroom. My left arm, which had been out of my
sleeping bag, was freezing cold. It was pitch black. I heard noises
outside and my mind immediately flicked to a helpful article I had
scanned on the REI site, ``Reasons for Using Bear-Resistant Food
Containers.'' Hadn't I seen some signs about bears on the way to
the wash house earlier? Maybe it would be better just to try to go
back to sleep.
 &HT;    I looked over at my sleeping companion. Should I wake him and
ask him to walk me to the bathroom, or was this too pathetic? Would
he be angry? Worse, would he think less of me?
 &HT;    My certainty that there were bears just outside the zippered
front flap grew with every passing second. Though I knew it was
absurd, I was scared, not to mention uncomfortable.
 &HT;    Then it hit me: Despite Web sites, fancy gear and halogen
flashlights, camping was still camping. Certain things, after all,
cannot be mitigated. I felt claustrophobic in my sleeping bag, and
because we'd forgotten to zip that handy back window shut, my
sneakers were squishy with dew.
 &HT;    The tent was small and cramped, and blessedly, the outdoors, the
unknowable world of stars and bears and strange noises in the
night, was still great.

 &HT;    
 By WILLIAM T. TOMICKI 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;     Q:  I'm looking for a sleek and modern hotel in the heart of
Seattle. Any suggestions?
 &HT;     A:  Plush chenille pillows, intimate lighting and an impressive
24-hour concierge service are just a handful of the special touches
that guests can expect at the new W Hotel in Seattle.
 &HT;    Part of the brand-driven W hotel chain launched by Starwood
Hotels and Resorts, the W Seattle is a unique refuge for business
and leisure travelers who have a penchant for hip hotels that
combine sophisticated urban style with relaxed elegance.
 &HT;    Guests love amenities such as high-speed Internet access, luxe
bedding, in-room CD players, 24-hour fitness center and quirky
munchie-bar offerings such as candy necklaces and pez dispensers.
 &HT;    Many of the rooms have office facilities, including scanners,
printers and fax machines. Rates start at $239 to $259 per night.
For more information or reservations, call (877) W Hotels.
 &HT;     Q:  My wife and I have noticed that cruise ships seem to be
getting bigger. We love the features and activities found on big
ships, but we like the intimacy found on smaller ships. Can we have
our cake and eat it too?
 &HT;     A:  It's true that some of the new cruise ships are so huge
that the enjoyment of being ``at sea'' is lost.
 &HT;    Multideck atriums on some ships feel more like airline terminals
and aren't conducive to meaningful conversation. Dining elbow to
elbow with hundreds of shipmates in a cavernous space in the ship's
belly is often little more than a tedious banquet.
 &HT;    Holland America Line seems to have gotten the message, and the
MS Volendam is the first of the company's new generation of luxury
cruise ships. With a passenger capacity of 1,440, the Volendam is
isn't a small vessel, yet its design gives it the intimate feel of
a much smaller ship. Public rooms are plentiful, but each is
creatively distinct in its ambiance.
 &HT;    So cleverly has Holland America crafted the scale of the
Volendam that, combined with its exquisite furnishings, flattering
lighting and $2 million worth of art, passengers have the
impression they are pampered guests on a private yacht.
 &HT;    Those who desire something other than the dramatic two-deck
747-seat Rotterdam Dining Room are free to reserve a private table
at the beautiful 88-seat Marco Polo Restaurant.
 &HT;    While the opportunity to enlarge its already legendary Ocean Spa
and increase the number of its verandah minisuites by 40 percent
were just two of Holland America's persuasive arguments to build a
large ship, the company's commitment to intimate scale and quality
design has retained the romance of cruising.
 &HT;    Economies of scale dictate that ships will get bigger as
passenger demand continues to grow, but the new MS Volendam is an
eloquent example of how small a big ship can be. For more
information, contact your travel professional, or call (877)
SAIL-HAL (724-5425).
 &HT;     Q:  Where can I go to find good travel information on the Web?
 &HT;     A:  Online travel is the largest internet commerce category on
the Web today as more and more browsers discover how easy it is to
plan travel 24 hours a day from the comfort of their homes or
offices.
 &HT;    However, it is important to choose reputable sites that deliver
reliable and worthwhile services to consumers.
 &HT;    Expedia.com is the online travel-industry leader with over $400
million in sales in the last quarter of this year alone. Touches
such as e-mailing customers to inform them of travel delays and
cancellations have helped the company obtain its leading edge.
 &HT;    They also have chosen to offer travel options for a wide variety
of budgets and are committed to finding the best value for your
dollar. However, they operate on the premise that you get what you
pay for. Take a look: www.expedia.com.
 &HT;     Q:  I finally have the opportunity to visit the Amazon rain
forests _ something I have wanted to do my whole life _ but I'm a
little concerned about traveling there alone.
 &HT;    Can you suggest a place where I can really experience the Amazon
without worrying about being taken advantage of or feeling like an
obvious tourist?
 &HT;     A:  Located on the eastern edge of the Andes Mountains in
Ecuador, a small village houses a collection of cabins that should
suit your needs.
 &HT;    Operated by Beny Ammeter, a Swiss expatriate, La Casa del Suizo
is a small group of cabins that overlooks the Napo River and the
expansive rain forest.
 &HT;    Guests are immediately plunged into the Quichua Indian culture
as soon as they arrive at the resort _ by canoe _ and visit the
village to mingle with the locals; watch blowpipe demonstrations;
learn to make the local alcoholic drink, chicha; and hike through
the awe-inspiring rain forest.
 &HT;    For more infomation, visit www.casadelsuizo.com on the Web.
 &HT;    This trip, and more like it, can be found in the Spring/Summer
2000 Specialty Travel Index, $10 per year for two issues. Send
orders to info(AT)specialitytravel.com.
 &HT;     Q:  My husband and I are taking our children to Chicago this
summer. Where do you suggest we take them? As a mom, I'm obligated
to ask for something somewhat educational.
 &HT;     A:  One way to beat the heat is to spend the day at Chicago's
John G. Shedd Aquarium. The aquarium opened its newest exhibit last
month, Amazon Rising: Seasons of the River. Visitors journey
through the annual cycles of the Amazon River basin, which features
over 250 exotic species of animals and explains how they adapt to
the extreme conditions of this ever-changing ecosystem.
 &HT;    Some of the astounding animals your children will see include
the Goliath bird-eating spiders; a green anaconda; and the world's
smallest monkey, the pygmy marmoset.
 &HT;    Also, be sure to visit the aquarium's other current exhibits _
the Oceanarium and the Seahorse Symphony. For adults, the aquarium
will be open until 10 p.m. on Thursday nights for Jazzin' at the
Shedd.
 &HT;    For more information, call (312) 939-2438, or visit
www.sheddaquarium.org. Advance tickets are available through
Ticketmaster at (312) 559-0200.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Readers are invited to submit questions to William Tomicki, P.O.
Box 5148, Santa Barbara, Calif. 93150. Although he cannot answer
each query individually, selected questions will be included in his
column. Mr. Tomicki, who logs over 150,000 miles each year, is the
publisher of ENTREE, a travel newsletter.

 By EVERETT POTTER 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    When the Department of State issued a ``Worldwide Caution'' on
June 27, 2000, it was a telling reminder that the world of
terrorism doesn't relax when Americans take their summer vacations.
 &HT;    The caution urged American ``citizens worldwide of the need to
remain vigilant with regard to their personal security. This Public
Announcement is not in response to a particular threat or event but
to emphasize our ongoing concern for the security of Americans
overseas.''
 &HT;    Indeed, unlike past cautions, which have been linked to specific
terrorist events, this one was much broader. Yet it did single out
one date.
 &HT;    ``Periods on or around significant dates, such as the August 7
anniversary of the bombings of the U.S. Embassies in Nairobi,
Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, may be chosen as opportunities
for further terrorist acts. As a result, security continues to be a
prime concern at U.S. government facilities worldwide.''
 &HT;    Anyone heading abroad would do well to visit the Department of
State's Web site, http://travel.state.gov, and have a look at the
Consular Information Sheets, Public Announcements, Travel Warnings.
 &HT;    There's a Consular Information Sheet for every country in the
world. These reports include information on the location of the
U.S. Embassy or Consulate, health conditions, minor political
disturbances, entry regulations as well as crime and security
information.
 &HT;    As the State Department notes, these reports ``generally do not
include advice, but present information in a factual manner so the
traveler can make his or her own decisions concerning travel to a
particular country.''
 &HT;    But if there is an area of a given country where there is some
kind of trouble, it's typically listed under a subhead of ``crime''
or ``security.''
 &HT;    Take a country such as Mexico, which draws many Americans.
Currently, that country's Consular Information Sheet states that
``crime in Mexico continues at high levels, and it is increasingly
violent, especially in Mexico City, Tijuana and Ciudad Juarez. Low
apprehension and conviction rates of criminals contribute to the
high crime rate. Other metropolitan areas have lower, but still
serious levels of crime. Travelers should leave valuables and
irreplaceable items in a safe place, or not bring them at all. All
visitors are encouraged to make use of hotel safes when available,
avoid wearing obviously expensive jewelry or designer clothing, and
carry only the cash or credit cards that will be needed on each
outing.''
 &HT;    Obviously, much of this is common sense while traveling, but
given the heightened crime, it bears repeating. For the Bahamas,
the State Department says, ``Visitors should store
passport/identity documents, airline tickets, unused credit cards
and extra cash in hotel safes, and avoid wearing expensive jewelry,
particularly Rolex watches, which have been targeted increasingly
by criminals. Visitors should not travel alone on deserted areas of
beaches or poorly-lit areas at night.''
 &HT;    Even Singapore, which is generally considered one of the safest
places in the world, merits advice: ``Petty crimes such as
pickpocketing and purse or briefcase snatching occur in tourist
areas, hotels and at the airport.''
 &HT;    In the same reports, the government also looks at ``Aviation
Safety Oversight.'' Austria, for example, is in ``compliance with
international safety standards,'' as is most of Western Europe. But
Russia is a different story, and the Department of State says,
``Air travel within Russia can at times be unreliable.''
 &HT;    Travel Warnings are issued when the State Department decides,
``based on all relevant information, to recommend that Americans
avoid travel to a certain country.'' These countries currently
include Afghanistan, Albania, Algeria, Angola, Bosnia-Herzegovina,
Burundi, Cambodia, Central African Republic, Colombia, Congo,
Democratic Republic of Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Fiji,
Guinea-Bissau, Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, Liberia, Libya, Montserrat,
Nigeria, Pakistan, Serbia-Montenegro, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Sudan,
Tajikistan and Yemen.
 &HT;    These countries are seen as potentially dangerous places for
Americans, and the State Department recommends that Americans avoid
going there.
 &HT;    The Fiji warning, issued on June 28, says, ``The Department of
State urges U.S. citizens to defer non-essential travel to Fiji
because of continued uncertainty and instability resulting from the
ongoing political crisis.''
 &HT;    It goes on to say that U.S. citizens who remain ``should
exercise a high level of caution, avoid demonstrations or public
meetings, maintain adequate stocks of food and water, and monitor
the local radio closely for breaking developments.''
 &HT;    That's hardly a recipe for a nice tropical vacation.
 &HT;    Finally, there are Public Announcements. These are issued for
``terrorist threats and other relatively short-term and/or
transnational conditions posing significant risks to the security
of American travelers.''
 &HT;    The public announcement for Indonesia and East Timor, issued on
June 1, says, ``all American citizens traveling in these areas
should be aware of their surroundings and use common sense to avoid
situations and locations that could be inherently dangerous.''
 &HT;    Travelers who want a broader perspective can consult the Web
sites of such governments as Great Britain (www.fco.gov.uk), Canada
(www.dfait-maeci.gc.ca) or Australia (www.dfat.gov.au/consular) and
make up their own mind about whether it's really safe to go.
 &HT;    For those without access to the Internet, the Department of
State's ``A Safe Trip Abroad'' and other travel-related documents
can be obtained from the Superintendent of Documents, U.S.
Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C. 20402; (202) 512-1800.

 PLEASE NOTE: Optional trim indicators have been included to make
cutting this article for length an easier task.) 
 &HT;    
 (Color slide included.) 
 By ADELE MALOTT 
 Condensed from The Mature Traveler Newsletter 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Hold it! Someone is rattling a candy wrapper. Another person is
digging around in a paper bag. Fifteen heads turn and indignantly
whisper a collective ``Sshhhh'' to the noisy movie-goers. All eyes
are on the Festival Theater's large screen, where the introductory
credits of the opening film are rolling. Only a handful of the
theater's 548 seats are empty.
 &HT;    Beverly Shaver of El Cerrito, Calif., is among the more than 500
film buffs in the darkened theater who have embarked on a glittery
five-day program sponsored by Elderhostel Inc. The program is
linked to the Palm Springs International Film Festival.
 &HT;    Half the movie-goers are Californians. The rest _ from the
Midwest and East _ realize that the place to be in January is
sun-blessed Southern California.
 &HT;    Elderhostel, which has been known to lodge its participants in
spartan dormitory accommodations, now houses its travelers to Palm
Springs in four-star inns and resorts with luxurious pools and
spas.
 &HT;    
 GOLDEN ADOLESCENCE  
 &HT;    Apart from the weather and celebrity-studded glamour of this
elite oasis in the desert, the lure of this particular film program
is the chance for seniors to recall their golden period of
adolescence. ``A time when it took a quarter for admission and 10
cents for popcorn to sit, bewitched, in a dark theater from noon
Saturdays until well after the street lights lit our way home,''
Shaver says.
 &HT;    Ardent devotees of the film fest will view two scheduled films
each morning and also will sample from among 184 full-length
features shown in the afternoons and evenings for general festival
audiences. Elderhostelers get a discounted price of $6 for the
additional films.
 &HT;    A number of directors, cinematographers, writers and actors will
be present at select screenings to comment on their films.
Discussions and critiquing sessions also will be held at the
hotels.
 &HT;    Elderhostel travelers play an important role in assessing the
films, says program director Donna McLain. Their reactions will
provide feedback to film makers as well as influence buying
decisions of distributors who have come shopping at the festival.
And more than 30 of the festival's films have been submitted to the
Motion Picture Academy as candidates for Oscars.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    (OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE.)
 &HT;    
 &HT;    The Festival Theater is brand new and has been reserved
exclusively for Elderhostel in the mornings. Every seat provides
full-screen views as well as deep cushioned comfort. The Dolby
Digital Sound System produces crisp audio so that even the
hearing-impaired catch every word.
 &HT;    Subtitles (about half of the festival's films are foreign) are
fully explanatory, clearly visible and remain long enough to be
read. Shaver says, ``The buzz among the hostelers reflects
incredulity at the technical quality of this film experience, and a
despondent sense that we will never again be satisfied with our
local theaters.''
 &HT;    
 &HT;    (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS HERE.)
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Background briefings for each film begin at 8:30 a.m., the first
showing is at 9 a.m.; the second, about 11:15. In between, McLain
and her 12 coordinators distribute tickets for afternoon and
evening films, operate a curbside lost-and-found area, answer
questions, take money and signups for sightseeing excursions and
replace meal tickets for those lost or mislaid.
 &HT;    The films selected by the festival's officials are of
outstanding quality. They are a feast of different accents that
bring to life the universal language of film.
 &HT;    The Elderhostel attendees are enchanted by plucky, lovable
72-year-old Mattie Rigbee (played by Ellen Burstyn) in ``Walking
Across Egypt,'' a world premiere, and empathize with her feisty
resistance to moving into a ``senior home.''
 &HT;    On the third day, as the hostelers settle down for ``Ikinai,''
there is a ripple of excitement as the Japanese production team
files down to their row of reserved seats. The film has the
audience alternately spellbound and dissolving into helpless
hilarity.
 &HT;    It portrays nine lugubrious men assembling on a tour bus in
Okinawa. All hopelessly in debt, they plan to die in an accidental
crash, enabling their dependents to claim large insurance payments.
 &HT;    At the last minute, though, a bouncy young woman climbs aboard
the bus using a tour voucher bought by her uncle who is too ill to
go. The ensuing action is quirky, unpredictable, wildly comic and
inspired. The production team earns a standing ovation.
 &HT;    The post-film discussion with the director illuminates some
uniquely Japanese values and customs which the movie-goers hadn't
understood.
 &HT;    Probably the most memorable film of the week _ also a world
premiere _ is ``Pink Pumpkins at Dawn,'' which deals insightfully
with gun-toting homicidal adolescents.
 &HT;    Made on a shoestring budget by a 29-year-old director and
starring little-known actors, the film traces the development and
fate of an appealing, but terribly damaged teen-ager.
 &HT;    The post-film discussion with director Rick Onorato is
emotional, high decibel and deadly serious. Afterward, clusters of
hostelers linger, reluctant to let go without reaching some kind of
closure on a topic of intense concern.
 &HT;    By the final day, most program participants have seen 10 to 12
films. But there are also those for whom the movies are close to a
secular religion _ marathoners who have managed to attend more than
20 films. The latter are glassy-eyed but euphoric.
 &HT;    More than half the group has taken time out for tours of the
mysterious desert and local museums. A few intrepid golfers sneaked
off to take advantage of a Thursday $10 green fee at the Bob Hope
Classic course.
 &HT;    Every boutique and trendy specialty shop lining Palm Canyon
Drive has been combed for treasures, and many Elderhostelers are
departing with bulging shopping bags.
 &HT;    
 WHAT'S INCLUDED  
 &HT;    The program described here cost $475 and included meals from
Sunday dinner through Friday breakfast, two films each morning, a
dinner dance and all the lectures and discussions.
 &HT;    The program will be offered again in January 2001 in conjunction
with the 122th International Film Festival. Hostelships covering
all but $75 of the fee are available for those on limited incomes.

Mass. 02210-1941; or call (877) 426-8056.

   How Tomatoes Grow
</P>
<P>
   In the campy 1970s horror spoof ``Attack of the Killer
Tomatoes,'' the planet is threatened by giant mutated tomatoes
(much as the average garden is threatened by overgrown tomato
plants about this time of year). The good guys won in the film, of
course, but things might have been easier had they known about some
research at Cornell.
</P>
<P>
   Long before the age of the two-pound beefsteak, tomatoes were
much smaller. In fact, the precursor to the domesticated tomato
produced fruit that were less than a half-inch in diameter and
weighed a fraction of an ounce. But through domestication, tomatoes
grew in size.
</P>
<P>
   The Cornell researchers, reporting in the journal Science, have
uncovered the gene responsible for this evolutionary size growth.
</P>
<P>
   The area of the tomato plant chromosome responsible for this
growth had been identified previously, but the new research
pinpoints the specific gene. The finding may help in understanding
the function of genes that control quantitative traits _ that is,
ones that vary by degree, rather than all or nothing.
</P>
<P>
   In the film, the tomatoes are defeated through the playing of an
awful teen-age love ballad, which causes the killer fruit to shrink
(after which they are stomped into puree). The Cornell researchers
found a different way to get the same result: They took the
size-growth gene from a wild tomato plant and inserted it into a
domesticated one, and the new fruits were much smaller.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Deaths Investigated
</P>
<P>
   Veterinarians are still trying to figure out exactly what killed
10 Bengal tigers at a zoo in eastern India last week.
</P>
<P>
   The animals, seven of which were rare white tigers, died within
about 36 hours last Wednesday and Thursday at the Nandankanan zoo
near Bhubaneshwar, the capital of Orissa.
</P>
<P>
   Initial reports said the tigers died of trypanosomiasis, or
sleeping sickness, a parasitic infection. But there were
conflicting accounts that medication the animals received may have
been to blame. The Indian government established a team of six
veterinary experts to investigate.
</P>
<P>
   The zoo had housed 56 Bengal tigers, including 32 white ones,
the largest collection of white tigers in captivity (the white fur
is the result of a recessive gene).
</P>
<P>
   India has an estimated 3,500 wild tigers. The animals are
considered endangered, and India has set up a nationwide network of
preserves to help protect them. Still, 200 to 300 are lost yearly,
either from habitat lost to development or from poaching. Tiger
bones have long been used in traditional Chinese medicine to treat
rheumatism and arthritis, among other conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Butterfly Warning
</P>
<P>
   Travel alert for tourists motoring through the Sierra Nevada:
Make sure the windshield washer tank is full before heading up that
mountain pass.
</P>
<P>
   An ecologist at the University of California at Davis says that
the summer bug-smashing season could be particularly intense this
year and that the culprit is the California tortoise shell
butterfly.
</P>
<P>
   The insects, which have wings that are orange and black on top
and brown underneath, are due for an outbreak this year, according
to the scientist, Dr. Art Shapiro, who has studied butterfly
populations for nearly three decades.
</P>
<P>
   The tortoise shell migrates from coastal and foothill regions of
California into the higher Sierra, and by middle to late July new
offspring emerge and head even higher up in the hills, above the
tree line.
</P>
<P>
   According to Shapiro, large numbers of the insects were spotted
over the Memorial Day weekend, but the situation may get far worse
this month. This summer may be as bad as one in the early 1970s,
when millions of butterflies splattered onto car windshields and
piles of dead insects littered the roadsides. It was a pain for
motorists, but local birds had a field day.

   UPDATE: Vigilance Urged in Detecting Nile Virus
</P>
<P>
   West Nile virus, the mosquito-borne illness that for a year has
scared people in and around New York, is harder to detect than
generally realized, researchers say.
</P>
<P>
   A report in the current issue of Neurology urged greater
vigilance in diagnosing the disease, citing two patients who
exhibited unusual symptoms and so were found to have the disease
only after a delay.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, a 69-year-old Long Island man was given a
misdiagnosis of Guillain-Barre syndrome after entering a hospital
and reporting progressive weakness. West Nile was not diagnosed for
several weeks, and by then he was severely paralyzed and on a
respirator.
</P>
<P>
   In a second case, a healthy 15-year-old boy was hospitalized
after three days of fever, headache, vomiting and confusion, the
journal said. Although he did not show symptoms of West Nile,
spinal fluid and blood tests later showed he had the disease. The
boy eventually recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Although there is no specific treatment for the disease, doctors
who are aware that a patient has it can take measures to reduce its
harm.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, 7 people died of the disease in the New York region,
and 62 were made ill. This year, no cases have been confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, one of the authors, Dr. Charles Nichter of
Columbia and Bronx-Lebanon Hospital, said that alerting doctors to
the difficulties of diagnosing West Nile would not only help them
treat patients but would also let health officials get a better
handle on the extent of the outbreak.
</P>
<P>
   RISKS AND REMEDIES: The Kinder Side of a Scorpion Sting
</P>
<P>
   The only things scorpions inspire in most people are fear and a
desire to get out of the way of their poison-tipped stingers.
</P>
<P>
   But researchers at the University of California at Irvine say
they have developed a chemical that works like scorpion venom, but
instead of harming people, it may one day help doctors who perform
organ transplants or treat autoimmune diseases like lupus and
arthritis.
</P>
<P>
   The findings were reported last week in The Proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   The author of the study, Dr. Heike Wulff, a pharmaceutical
chemist, said in an interview that the synthetic chemical, TRAM-34,
had not been modeled on scorpion venom, but was inspired by
discoveries about how the poison affected the cells of scorpion
victims.
</P>
<P>
   The venom inactivates some cell functions, including the immune
response system, but is not usually fatal.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the drugs, like cyclosporin, now given to suppress the
immune response in transplant and other patients also have
detrimental effects, like gastrointestinal and urinary tract
problems.
</P>
<P>
   TRAM-34 appears to be more adept at suppressing T-cells, part of
the body's arsenal against foreign objects, without hurting the
production of enzymes and other important cellular functions.
</P>
<P>
   Wulff said the findings were preliminary, and he could not
predict when the chemical might be tested on people.
</P>
<P>
   THERAPIES: An Old Antibiotic Generates New Hopes
</P>
<P>
   A common antibiotic that has been around for decades may help
people who suffer from Huntington's disease, a debilitating
hereditary ailment.
</P>
<P>
   Although researchers emphasized that much study remained to be
done, they said the drug, minocycline, a relative of tetracycline,
did much to slow the course of the disease in mice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a cure,'' cautioned Dr. Robert Friedlander of Brigham
and Women's Hospital, who described his findings in the current
issue of Nature Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   But use of the drug prolonged the lives of the mice by 14
percent, Friedlander said.
</P>
<P>
   Huntington's disease is characterized by involuntary movement of
the limbs and cognitive problems. Some 30,000 people have it, while
another 150,000 are at risk of inheriting it.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers believe the drug may help stop production of two
enzymes _ caspase -1 and -3 _ associated with Huntington's.
</P>
<P>
   Friedlander said he got the idea to try the antibiotic after
reading about Finnish scientists who used it to help people who had
had strokes, in which the caspase enzymes also appear to play a
role.
</P>
<P>
   He said his study suggested that minocycline could also help
with other diseases, including Alzheimer's.
</P>
<P>
   MENTAL HEALTH: Older and Better, With Firmer Footing
</P>
<P>
   You're not getting older, you're getting better. At least
psychologically.
</P>
<P>
   That's the argument put forth in a new study by a University of
California psychologist, who says most people become better
adjusted as they age. Which is not to say they are necessarily any
happier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really, there's not a direct connection between psychological
health and happiness,'' said the psychologist, Dr. Constance Jones,
the author of the report in the current issue of Psychology and
Aging. ``Psychological health, actually, is a more complicated
construct.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones, an associate professor at the university's Fresno campus,
came to her conclusions after studying evaluations of 236 people
done over a 50-year period. Participants were interviewed at ages
14, 18, 30, 40, 50 and 62.
</P>
<P>
   Interviewers gauged psychological health by trying to determine
if subjects were responsible and dependable, whether they were
productive and whether they had good relationships.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found from analyzing our three groups that psychological
health steadily increased from 30 years of age,'' the authors
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Jones said, this applies to the average person, with
the normal levels of anxiety and other neuroses. People who have
serious psychological problems will not necessarily see
improvements as they age.
</P>
<P>
   Jones also found that, contrary to general belief, psychological
health in adolescence was not shaky.
</P>
<P>
   And the more balanced the adolescent, she said, the better the
outlook for the adult.
</P>
<P>
   IN PRACTICE: For a Drop of Blood, Take It in the Ear
</P>
<P>
   The next time a doctor wants to take a blood sample from your
thumb, tell him to stick it in the ear.
</P>
<P>
   The idea here is not to encourage impoliteness but to reduce
pain. Reporting in The British Medical Journal, a group of doctors
in England said they had determined that taking a blood sample from
the ear lobe instead of the thumb was less painful.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors measuring glucose levels conducted an experiment on 60
patients. Thirty were lanced on the side of the thumb (a technique
adopted over the years when doctors realized that the area was less
sensitive than other digits), while the rest were lanced on the ear
lobe. The wound was then squeezed to force out a drop of blood.
</P>
<P>
   Patients were then asked to assess the pain using a standard
technique, and the results clearly favored the ear lobe, the study
said.
</P>
<P>
   The reason was unclear. The doctors theorized that the density
of pain receptors in the ear lobe might be lower than in the thumb.
But they also said further research was needed into the effect of
repeated ear lobe punctures on patients who require frequent
glucose screening.

PERSONAL HEALTH: FOR LIFELONG GAINS, JUST ADD WATER 
</HEADLINE>
   EDITORS: This is the first of two columns on the body's need for
water. Next week: safety standards for the water supply.  
(The Science Times) 
 By JANE E. BRODY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   You've heard it by now a million times: drink at least eight
glasses of water a day. And, to be sure, water, as a beverage, has
become much more popular in recent years. Nearly everywhere you go,
you're likely to see someone carrying a water bottle. Even many
backpacks and some belt pouches are now equipped with holders for
water bottles.
</P>
<P>
   And maybe you are among the smart ones who know the value of
being well hydrated, especially, but not only, in warm weather and
when physically active.
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time, concerns about water safety have
skyrocketed. Sales of bottled water, which may or may not be safer
than what comes from your tap, are soaring. So are sales of home
water treatment systems, from inexpensive carafes and faucet
attachments that filter water through activated carbon to much more
costly countertop and under-the-sink units permanently connected to
the sink's water supply.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, if you are an avid water drinker, you are in the
minority. The average American consumes a bit more than half the
recommended amount of water each day and an equal amount of
dehydrating beverages, which include any drink with caffeine or
alcohol. In effect, these cancel each other out because for every
dehydrating drink consumed, an additional glass of water should be
drunk.
</P>
<P>
   Every system in your body, from brain to bowel, depends on
water. As IDEA, an international health and fitness organization,
has pointed out, ``Water regulates body temperature, transports
nutrients and oxygen, carries away waste, helps detoxify the
kidneys and liver, dissolves vitamins and minerals and cushions the
body from injury. Every day you lose on average 10 to 12 cups of
water that needs to be replaced to maintain your body's important
fluid balance.''
</P>
<P>
   The average adult body contains 40 to 50 quarts of water. Your
blood is 83 percent water; muscles are 75 percent water; the brain
is 74 percent water and even bone is 22 percent water.
</P>
<P>
   Water lubricates every joint in your body and keeps soft tissues
from sticking together. When you become dehydrated, your body and
brain become sluggish, your blood thickens and your heart is forced
to work overly hard.
</P>
<P>
   Water is essential to the workings of the digestive tract, from
the digestion and absorption of food and nutrients to the
elimination of digestive wastes. Fiber alone is not enough to aid
normal bowel function. Without adequate water, fiber, which
increases the water-holding capacity of the stool, can be
constipating.
</P>
<P>
   Water is also the body's air-conditioning system. When you
become too warm, the loss of water through the pores of the skin,
sweat glands and lungs prevents the body from building up too much
internal heat. Athletes who fail to drink enough during a
prolonged, grueling activity can reach potentially lethal body
temperatures, which is what happened to Alberto Salazar upon
winning the Boston Marathon in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   He required emergency administration of six liters of
intravenous fluids to replenish his loss of water and salts. Three
years earlier after a particularly challenging race, his body
temperature had soared to 107 degrees and he was administered last
rites. The loss of just 15 percent to 20 percent of the body's
water is fatal.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to be aware of perspiration to be losing a great
deal of water. And even if you are completely inactive, your body
produces heat through metabolic processes that it may have to
dissipate through ``insensible'' perspiration.
</P>
<P>
   Skin cells, too, need water to look healthy. Yet millions of
appearance-conscious American women walk around like dried prunes,
afraid to drink water lest they become bloated or have to use the
bathroom. However, it is not water that is bloating but rather the
excess salts and carbohydrates consumed that hold water in the
body.
</P>
<P>
   As for bathrooms, I've learned not to be shy and have yet to be
denied the use of someone's or someplace's bathroom. At public
events when the line for the ladies' room has become unconscionably
long, I've been among women who've commandeered the men's room.
</P>
<P>
   Don't rely on thirst to tell you when to drink. By the time you
feel thirsty, you're already mildly dehydrated. Even mild
dehydration can impair physical and mental performance. Know the
symptoms of dehydration: headache, lethargy, dizziness, mental
fuzziness and loss of appetite. One of my tennis partners who
perspires heavily when he plays suffers a daylong headache if he
fails to drink enough. He has learned to drink 16 ounces of water
before playing, another 16 while playing, and 16 more afterward.
</P>
<P>
   There is no set amount of hydrating drinks a person should
consume. Eight eight-ounce glasses should be the minimum for the
average person. IDEA suggests that you calculate your basic fluid
need by dividing your weight in half to get the number of ounces to
consume each day. However, if you are physically active, if the
weather is hot and humid, if you are at a high altitude or if you
have a cold or fever, you're likely to need considerably more fluid
than the minimum.
</P>
<P>
   The American Dietetic Association recommends consuming at least
two cups of fluids two hours before physical exertion, followed by
another two cups of water about 15 to 20 minutes before your
activity and further drinks every 15 to 20 minutes during the
activity.
</P>
<P>
   As for the need for sports drinks that contain electrolytes
(sodium and other minerals that are lost through sweat), that
depends on the duration of your activity and how heavily you
perspire.
</P>
<P>
   A heavy workout lasting more than an hour, or exercise done in
extreme environmental conditions (like high-altitude hiking or
singles tennis at 90 degrees) may warrant a sports drink to replace
lost electrolytes as well as water. But because many of these
drinks are overly sweetened, which would delay water absorption,
they are best ``chased'' with an equal amount of water.
</P>
<P>
   Water _ plain, flavored, even lightly carbonated _ is the best
replacement fluid under most circumstances. Decaffeinated coffee,
tea or sugar-free soft drinks and diluted fruit juice will also
work. But any beverage that contains a fair amount of sugar or
salt, or any caffeine or alcohol-containing drink, is likely to
increase, not satisfy, your water need.
</P>
<P>
   Foods that are mostly water, like watermelon, which is 98
percent water, can also be a help as long as they are not too rich
in carbohydrates or salt.
</P>
<P>
   How can you get in all the water you need? By having water handy
wherever you happen to be. I'm a big fan of insulated, handled,
quart-sized cups, which I keep at my desk, in my car and wherever I
sit to read.
</P>
<P>
   I also pack a water bottle into my briefcase and carry one on my
belt pouch. On airplanes, where the atmosphere is as dry as the
Sahara, I book an aisle seat and drink eight ounces of water for
every hour in the air. And, the extra water helps to reduce jet lag
and the fatigue of travel.

A REMEDY NOT WORTH THE PAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (The Science Times) 
 By SANDEEP JAUHAR    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Do you want to keep eating, even if it means dying of pneumonia?
That was the question I posed to Mr. C. as he ate the rest of his
lunch. Yes, he replied without hesitation.
</P>
<P>
   A wizened 77-year-old with fiery eyes, he had been admitted to
the hospital short of breath. It wasn't clear why. He did not smoke
and had no cough. There was nothing suggesting asthma, pneumonia,
congestive heart failure or other common causes of shortness of
breath.
</P>
<P>
   His chest X-ray gave it away. Littering both lung bases were
opaque speckles that turned out to be barium, a metal that exposes
internal organs on X-rays.
</P>
<P>
   But why was it in his lungs? He had undergone a
barium-swallowing test a few months earlier when doctors suspected
he was aspirating food into his lungs. To rule out esophageal
narrowing, a common cause of swallowing difficulties, he swallowed
barium and had X-rays. It went down his lungs, and stayed there.
</P>
<P>
   His breathing trouble, I suspected, was caused by intermittent
aspiration of barium, food or whatever else. I told him he should
strictly regulate his diet, avoiding thin liquids that are easily
aspirated. He would have to eat sitting up, and in small bites. But
he said he had already found such a diet too burdensome.
</P>
<P>
   When a person swallows, both voluntary and involuntary
mechanisms ensure the food ends up in the stomach and not the
lungs. First, the tongue pushes the chewed-up food to the back of
the throat, where sensory receptors cause muscles in the pharynx to
contract. As the muscles contract, the epiglottis, a flap of
cartilage, flexes protectively into place over the larynx,
preventing food from entering the windpipe. The food is propelled
into the esophagus, where contractions usher it down to the lower
esophageal sphincter, which allows entry into the stomach.
</P>
<P>
   Several things can disrupt this complex reflex. Cancer or
blockages can narrow the opening so that food does not pass easily
to the stomach but backs up in the pharynx, where it can be
aspirated into the lungs. Muscular dystrophy, polymyositis and
scleroderma can paralyze the pharyngeal muscles.
</P>
<P>
   Neurological dysfunction, too, from nerve diseases like polio
and Lou Gehrig's disease, or brain disorders, like Alzheimer's
dementia or strokes, can disrupt the complex signaling.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for Mr. C.'s swallowing trouble wasn't obvious. A
brain scan revealed no strokes. There was no constriction. Nerve
studies were normal. In the end, we were faced with a condition we
could neither explain nor treat very effectively. The safest
treatment was to stop him from eating and insert a feeding tube.
But he so loved to eat _ it was one of the few remaining pleasures
in his life. He even raved about the hospital food. I presented the
option to him. He said he wasn't interested. It was too high a
price to pay, even for a longer life.
</P>
<P>
   Swallowing dysfunction is one of the most common problems in a
hospital, and it is becoming more prevalent as life spans increase.
This year, an editorial in The New England Journal of Medicine
criticized as futile and harmful the routine placement of feeding
tubes into patients with advanced dementia who stop eating. On the
other hand, it said, careful hand-feeding of such patients is an
act of nurturing.
</P>
<P>
   But feeding someone who cannot eat, by any means necessary, is
almost a reflexive act. New York state law says tube feeding can be
withheld only if there is clear and convincing evidence that the
patient never wants it. The default position is to feed.
</P>
<P>
   The paradigm is shifting, but the process will be slow. Families
will have to accept that feeding cannot sustain life in the face of
terminal diseases. And nursing homes, already short-staffed, will
have to figure out a way to hand-feed their patients efficiently.
</P>
<P>
   But what about the patients like Mr. C., dying not because they
are starving but because they are eating?
</P>
<P>
   I remember a 60-year-old lawyer I took care of last year. He was
admitted to the hospital because of severe emphysema. A protracted
stay in the intensive care unit left him dependent on a ventilator,
with a breathing tube. The tube (and his illness) had so impaired
his swallowing that he aspirated whenever he was fed. He constantly
got pneumonia.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone thought he needed a feeding tube, but his private
doctor, intelligent and experienced, insisted we feed him. ``You
must feed him,'' he reminded the nurses, ``if he is to learn to
eat.'' One day I told the doctor hand-feeding didn't seem to be
working. Wouldn't a feeding tube be useful to help the patient
regain his strength? ``I know this patient and who he was,'' the
doctor replied. ``A feeding tube will kill him.''
</P>

 &HT;    Crackers got their name from Florida cow hunters
 &HT;    (''Dispatches from Dreamsville'' is an occasional series in
which readers share with Cox Newspapers senior writer Joe Murray
their memories of growing up in small-town America. Back then, or
at least the way we remember it, life was like a dream.)
 &HT;    By Colonel Rod Hendrick
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   I am a Florida Cracker, a pedigreed Florida Cracker. I got
papers to prove it, a birth certificate. I was born down in the
bottom of the state, about 30 miles south of Miami, in Homestead. I
got lucky and was born right on my birthday, which makes it easy to
remember.
</P>
<P>
   Many folks in the South know what a Cracker is, but a lot of
them don't know how Crackers got their name.
</P>
<P>
   Right after the War Between the States, Southerners were in a
migration in the Deep South, especially with the carpetbaggers
forcing their will on the defeated Confederacy.
</P>
<P>
   Fleeing for their lives and leaving their homes behind them,
these are the pioneers who became the backbone and spine and spirit
of the great State of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Many came south carrying all their possessions in a mule-drawn
wagon _ axes and saws and things to make a life in a hostile
wilderness. There were no stores in many areas, so if you didn't
bring it with you, you just didn't have it. You made do with living
off the land.
</P>
<P>
   The reason Floridians are called Crackers, so the tales goes, is
that when the pioneers came to Florida they found thousands of wild
cattle roaming the free range. These cattle had been left by the
Spaniards and multiplied into a strong breed that could live off
the land. They belonged to whoever could round them up.
</P>
<P>
   Florida has now, and always has had, more cows than Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Think about it: In West Texas it takes 30 acres of desert to
support a cow; in Florida one acre of lush green grass in the
summer months will support half a dozen cows.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike Texas, Florida had palmetto thickets and dense woods.
Lariats would not work here as they would in the wide-open spaces
of the Texas range.
</P>
<P>
   What worked in the wilds of the Florida swamps were bullwhips.
Cow hunters could go into a palmetto thicket and drive a cow out
with a bullwhip.
</P>
<P>
   It was the sound of the cracking whip that led to the name of
Cracker for the cow hunters of Florida. This eventually spread to
all Floridians.
</P>
<P>
   With no railroads in those early days, it was necessary for
these pioneers to drive their cattle to market.
</P>
<P>
   One such market was in Fort Myers. They drove these cattle from
west of Lake Okeechobee to the west coast over a trail called the
Old Cracker Trail.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the Spanish-American War, the United Stated Army
had thousands of troops stationed there waiting to go to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   One of the young Army boys who was waiting to be shipped out
wrote to his family and advised his kin not to worry about him
anymore.
</P>
<P>
   He explained that the Army had been feeding him Florida beef
every day for the past few weeks and that the meat was so tough he
was now bulletproof.
</P>
<P>
   Only one out of every three people who live in Florida is a
native.
</P>
<P>
   Florida is growing faster than China, we like to say.
</P>
<P>
   So if you want to be a Cracker, just go get yourself a straw
hat, a mess of collard greens and slow down a notch or two.
</P>
<P>
   Get yourself a good rod and reel, and go fishing. Find some guy
named Gator or Skeeter and buy him a cold drink.
</P>
<P>
   You will be well on your way to becoming Crackerfied.

   Getting to Stromboli
</P>
<P>
   Q. After several tantalizing glimpses of Stromboli from cruise
ships, I at last got there in 1998. The trip, however, was arduous,
involving planes, train and hydrofoil. Is there a less grueling way
now? Jan E. Adlmann, Santa Fe, N.M.
</P>
<P>
   A. The island of Stromboli, about 40 miles north of Sicily, has
been in continuous eruption for 2,000 to 2,500 years _ and even
more, according to some volcanologists. Over the course of each
hour, there are several small gas explosions of glowing lava
fragments. But violent eruptions are rare; the most recent of note
was in 1996 when four people were hurt.
</P>
<P>
   To reach Stromboli from the United States, you still have to fly
to Rome first. If you want to avoid multiple stops and to go to
Stromboli without stopping at the other Lipari Islands first, fly
to Naples or Reggio di Calabria and then take a boat.
</P>
<P>
   The Siremar ferry line departs from Naples for Stromboli daily
except Wednesday at 9 p.m. and arrives as a new day is dawning, at
5 a.m. Ticket prices range from $33.40 for unreserved deck space to
$56.50 for reserved space in an enclosed lounge-like area, at 2,034
lire to the dollar. Among the sources for a ticket is the Ontano
agency in Naples, (39-081) 580 0340, fax (39-081) 580 0341. By
hydrofoil, it's faster _ four hours _ but perhaps not so romantic.
Departures are at 8:30 a.m. and 2:30 p.m. and the fare is $51.65.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the hydrofoils from Reggio di Calabria, which is across
the Strait of Messina from Sicily, go directly to Stromboli. They
leave at 7, 7:25, 8:55 and 10:45 a.m. and take about two hours. The
fare is $17.70.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Information on hydrofoil service, which is operated by SNAV, can
be found on the Web at www.snavali &QC; .com, but may require a measure
of competence in Italian (for starters, click on ``ali-scafi,''
which means hydrofoils). Or try (39-081) 761-2348, fax (39-081)
761-2141. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To refresh your memory of Stromboli, take a look at these rich
resources, which include video clips with audio: stromboli.net and
volcano.und.nodak.edu.
</P>
<P>
   Archery in London
</P>
<P>
   Q. My 7-year-old nephew will accompany us to central London, and
he likes archery. Are there schools or ranges there where he can
practice and learn? _ Ruth A. Unterberg, New York, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   A. Though many clubs do not accept children younger than 12,
archery instruction for a 7-year-old is not out of the question in
the view of some instructors. But the problem may be having to go
to the outskirts of London to find such instruction.
</P>
<P>
   Here are two possibilities for experienced instructors who have
taught adults and children. The charge includes a bow, arrows, a
tab (which protects the fingers) and a bracer (which protects the
forearm of the hand holding the bow).
</P>
<P>
   Falcon Junior Archery Club, Royal Arsenal Sport and Recreation
Association, Church Manor Way, Abbeywood, London SE2 0EZ. The
club's chairman and senior coach, Edward Hart, teaches once a week
for two to three hours. After three sessions students are generally
``fairly consistent, but not necessarily proficient,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lessons are given at a field that is a drive of 30 to 40 minutes
from central London. The charge for private instruction is a total
of $36, at 66 pence to the dollar, said Hart, who has taught
archers in county-level competitions. He can be reached at (44-208)
311 3416.
</P>
<P>
   At the Falcon Junior Club, students start out with a solid
fiberglass training bow (like an American longbow) or a recurve
bow, similar to that used in Olympic events.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Bradford is an instructor and coach based at 62 Hook Rise
North, Tolworth, Surrey KT6 7JY; (44-208) 397 2603; e-mail
ted(at)theglade.co.uk. With children up to the age of 10 or 11, he
said, ``I don't insist on perfect application until they start
asking questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradford, who has taught archers competing in international
competitions, said that lessons would not exceed an hour and that a
7-year-old would probably start with a fiberglass bow. Private
instruction for a 7-year-old, given at an outdoor site, is roughly
$6 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   For general information about archery in Britain, call the Grand
National Archery Society at (44-195) 267 7888 or visit
www.gnas.org.
</P>
<P>
   By Rail in Provence
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am planning to spend some time this September in the south
of France, particularly Nice. I have read about a narrow gauge
railroad from Nice north through the Var Valley. The train is
called Chemin de Fer de Provence. Can you provide information,
including schedule and stops? _ G.G., Tiburon, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   A. The railroad runs 93 miles between Nice, on the Riviera, and
Digne-les-Bain. Of special interest is a 12-mile stretch between
Puget-Theniers and Annot. During the warmer months, one can take an
hourlong ride aboard the Train des Pignes using equipment built
between 1888 and 1912.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The regular train between Nice and Digne-les-Bain operates four
times a day in each direction and is well suited for travelers who
are not in a hurry: It takes three hours and makes 21 stops. From
Nice, departures are at 6:42 and 9 a.m. and at 12:43, 5 and 6:35
p.m. From Digne-les-Bain, departures are at 7 and 10:33 a.m. and at
1:58 and 5:25 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   As its name suggests, Digne-les-Bain is a spa. Every August, the
town celebrates the lavender for which towns in the region are
known. From the fourth to the eighth, Digne-les-Bain stages the
Corso de la Lavande, a parade of floats saluting lavender, with
musical performances and fireworks. From the 17th to the 22nd, it's
the Journees Lavande, which features music as well as ethnic food.
Information: (33-4) 92.36.62.62.
</P>
<P>
   The town is also the home of the cathedrals of St.-Jerome and
Notre-Dame du Bourg and of a collection of Tibetan mementoes at the
Fondation Alexandra David-Neel (27, avenue Marechal Juin). Tours
there run 90 minutes and are free.
</P>
<P>
   Excursions aboard old train equipment run on Sundays, starting
in mid-May. The trips remaining this season are next Sunday as well
as on Aug. 6, 13, 20 and 27, Sept. 10, 17 and 24 and Oct. 8, 15 and
22.
</P>
<P>
   Diesel trains leave Nice at 9:10 a.m., arriving at
Puget-Theniers at 10:45. Ten minutes later a steam locomotive takes
over for the ride to Annot, a small town with winding lanes,
arcades and a Romanesque church. The train leaves for Nice at 3:30
and arrives at 6:30. For the entire run, the fare is $26, at 7
francs to the dollar; for just the steam engine part, it's $13.

 &HT;    Musician struggles with choice of music over hockey
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Barchas
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas - The problem with telling the story of Derek
Geary is deciding where to begin. Do you start with his hockey
skills or his genius at the piano. Or focus on how he had to choose
between the two when he had the rest of his life waiting for him,
if only he could figure out what the ``rest'' part was supposed to
be?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's part of my story,'' he said. ``I've always been torn by
trying to do too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Six years ago, Geary fled the National Hockey League's Boston
Bruins' training camp because he couldn't abandon his passion for
the piano. He moved to Austin in 1996, released his first CD,
``Wire,'' late last year and is currently working in a liquor store
so he can scrape together money to feed his interest in composing
and performing.
</P>
<P>
   Geary, 30, first strapped on hockey skates at age 5, a common
practice in his hometown of Gloucester, Mass. ``You knew he was
good at hockey right from day one,'' said Steven Geary, his father.
</P>
<P>
   Piano lessons followed a year or two later. Geary immediately
bonded with the instrument, practicing diligently on classical
pieces even as he was dreaming up his own. ``I wasn't some child
prodigy genius, but I got into it,'' Geary said.
</P>
<P>
   When he was 10, Geary's time investment with the piano paid off.
``One day I heard him playing a song which didn't sound anything
like the songs the teacher had given him and I asked him where it
came from and he said, `Oh, I just made it up,''' his father said.
``I was amazed and it sort of took off from there.''
</P>
<P>
   This first composition, ``Avalanche,'' inspired more than 40
others. Geary also began working with a new teacher, John Heiss, to
concentrate on writing music. ``I've worked with thousands of
musicians, and he was special even when he was 12,'' Heiss said.
``He had a feeling for the poetry of what he did. He used the piano
as an instrument for painting, making texture, making mood
scenarios. In five seconds I went, `Mmm, this is a kid who's got
something.'''
</P>
<P>
   Geary's natural gifts extended to the ice rink, and he divided
his time between gliding on skates and gliding his fingers over the
keys, seamlessly tying these interests together.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had grace on the ice,'' Heiss said. ``When he was skating
up to make a goal, he looked like a pianist about to play a
beautiful symphony. He's very musical in his hockey and he's very
graceful in his music.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Geary exceeded expectations when he checked the
newspaper on the day of his graduation from Gloucester High in 1988
and saw he had been drafted by the Bruins in the sixth round.
Surprise? Shock? Euphoria? Geary wasn't sure how to feel, so he
spent a year at Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass., trying to
figure it out. Five more years in college, first at Boston
University and then Dartmouth, were filled with hockey and music,
but Geary also discovered another passion, film, which eventually
became his major.
</P>
<P>
   And then he had to choose.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had managed to do all three at a pretty high level, and it
was hard to just choose one because you're shutting the door on the
other two,'' Geary said. ``The logic was that this was my time to
make it really happen in hockey.''
</P>
<P>
   Geary moved back to Boston and started playing hockey intensely,
but just three days into the Bruins' training camp, something
stirred him into an action different from pounding players on the
ice. ``I had this current of feeling that maybe I wasn't committed
to hockey,'' Geary said. ``I just felt like I couldn't do it. My
heart was not into it. I just didn't want it enough.''
</P>
<P>
   The note was short. All it said was that he had decided to quit,
and it was the only thing Geary left behind when he departed
suddenly from the training camp. Phil Muller, one of Geary's
closest friends, was with Geary both on the day he was drafted by
the Bruins, and the day he chose to give it all up. ``He felt
relieved,'' Muller said. ``I think he was ready to say, `OK, I gave
it a shot and now I'm going to start on music.'''
</P>
<P>
   Even today, Geary is trying to work out for himself what that
means. ``You know, it's this whole thing about living in the
past,'' Geary said. ``When I go for runs, I daydream about the
games I played in and goals I should have scored. I see a lot of
people I played with making millions of dollars in the NHL as I'm
struggling to pay rent, working in a liquor store.''
</P>
<P>
   While Geary's music is a hybrid of jazz and classical, the
tracks on his CD ``Wire'' resist labeling as they settle, simply,
into a realm of their own. ``Derek is not as avant garde as some,
but by no means is he imitative or routine,'' Heiss said. ``He
works in what I might call a somewhat conservative way, but with
tremendous fantasy and the kind of heart that ought to someday win
him a large audience. I think Derek is someone who's yet to be
discovered, really.''
</P>
<P>
   Not willing to sit still waiting for fame, Geary is working to
make his music available to the Austin crowd. His CD can be found
everywhere, and he gives concerts as frequently as he can afford.
But he admits his work is not easy. ``I definitely don't know where
all this is headed,'' he said. ``I've been kind of discouraged just
trying to make a living with this, trying to figure out how to do
what I want to do. It's the human struggle. With me, it's a blank
piece of paper and an empty room and an instrument. Are you going
to sweat it out and make it happen?''
</P>
<P>
   These periods of despondency about where his life is headed are
as natural to Geary as scoring a goal or creating a composition.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of the most focused people I know in everything,
especially his music,'' Geary's girlfriend, Kristen Woolf, said.
``That goes along with it, the focus and determination, the ups and
the downs.''
</P>
<P>
   But what exactly does Geary want? Does he know now? He thinks of
going back to graduate school. He's considered returning to his
passion for film and combining this with music by writing film
scores. Questions about the future weigh on Geary almost as much as
memories of his past. ``Where do you dedicate your energy?'' he
said. ``Do you focus on solo piano and try to take that to a whole
new place, or do you expand your sound? I feel like you can spend
your whole life discovering the possibilities of the piano, but the
whole universe is there and I still want to explore.''

 (ART ADV: With illustration depicting vice-presidential sweepstakes
as a card game, moving as a photo (NNS1). 
 By MILES BENSON   
 c.2000 Newhouse News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It's time to play the mentioning game, otherwise
known as: Who wants to be vice president?
</P>
<P>
   The list of potential candidates named in news reports lengthens
daily, it seems.
</P>
<P>
   To be ``mentioned'' as a possible running mate for Al Gore or
George W. Bush is a badge of distinction, a boost for the careers
of the politically ambitious, even those who haven't the remotest
chance of actually being chosen as second banana.
</P>
<P>
   So how come they get mentioned anyway?
</P>
<P>
   Ahhh, that's what makes it a game _ one that can be played right
up to the national conventions of the two major parties.
Presidential candidates usually wait until then to name their
hand-picked running mates, but that doesn't deter the mentioners in
politics and the press.
</P>
<P>
   ``With five 24-hour-a-day cable rumor-mongering services, there
are more `mentioners' than ever,'' said Stephen Hess, a political
analyst at the Brookings Institution. ``So it ain't difficult to
get your name on that circuit.''
</P>
<P>
   A search of the electronic archiving service Lexis-Nexis over a
recent 60-day period shows just how crowded the candidate field has
become.
</P>
<P>
   If you count the number of mentions in newspapers, newsmagazines
or on television, the clear front-runner to be Al Gore's Democratic
running mate is former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey, whom Gore
chewed up in the primaries. Bradley turns up 742 times.
</P>
<P>
   Next is Energy Secretary Bill Richardson of New Mexico, who
would be the first Hispanic on a major party's national ticket. He
has 642 mentions. Unfortunately for Richardson, most of the recent
stories also mentioned that his chances virtually vanished in the
scandal over nuclear secrets lost in his department under his
watch.
</P>
<P>
   On the Republican side, the most mentioned man is Arizona Sen.
John McCain,who gave Bush a scare in the primaries and has been the
subject of vice presidential speculation in more than 1,000
stories.
</P>
<P>
   First runner-up is Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge, a dazzling
campaigner with a war record, and a Catholic, which political
analysts consider a plus. But most of the stories also mention that
Ridge is pro-choice, which could send Bush's pro-life supporters
screaming from the convention.
</P>
<P>
   The same problem poses an obstacle for New Jersey Gov. Christie
Todd Whitman, with 17 mentions. The leading name among Republican
women is Elizabeth Dole, mentioned in 198 stories as a Bush running
mate.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse Ventura, the Reform Party governor of Minnesota, a former
pro wrestler, has been mentioned 338 times as a possible choice _
to run with Gore or Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Some names emerge because of polls taken to determine who might
be the most help to the presidential candidate in certain states.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press recently published a poll about vice
presidential running mates for both Bush and Gore by Intersurvey, a
Menlo Park, Calif., research firm. The poll surveyed 6,788 adults
chosen at random. It suggested that Bush, running with retired Gen.
Colin Powell, would be elected president with an average of 62
percent of the vote over Gore teamed with any of a half-dozen
possible running mates. Teamed with McCain, Bush would win with 58
percent of the vote. The only running mate who would lift Gore to
victory, according to the poll, was Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   These findings are studied by political analysts and
journalists, who mention them, thereby adding them to the
background din of speculation.
</P>
<P>
   There are rules, of a sort.
</P>
<P>
   It's necessary to have some credentials to be among the
mentioned. ``You've got to be somebody who holds the type of
position putting you in the on-deck circle,'' Hess said.
</P>
<P>
   This would include members of the Senate, well-known members of
the House of Representatives, Cabinet officers, governors and
``assorted others of that ilk, all of whom have friends or shills,
usually called press secretaries, who have friends in the media,''
Hess said. ``Your folks sort of spread the word of why you'd make
sense. Before you know it, they're throwing your name back and
forth on television and in the papers.''
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally names are floated as trial balloons by the
presidential candidates' staffs. Sometimes genuine leaks occur,
revealing that someone has been contacted by the person the
presidential candidate has charged with the vice presidential
talent hunt _ Warren Christopher, the former secretary of state,
for Gore, and Richard Cheney, the former defense secretary, for
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   More often it works like this, said Frank Luntz, a Republican
pollster and senior analyst for ``YRock.com.,'' a political Web
site:
</P>
<P>
   ``The potential candidate asks his political adviser to call his
favorite reporter to mention that he heard the candidate's name
referred to either over food or drinks at a gathering of political
operatives for the presidential campaign. It's as convoluted as
Tinkers to Evers to Chance, but just as effective. What's cool
about this is that everyone's in on it, but it's how this whole
process starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Or, if you are the presidential candidate and you have a good
friend for whom you want to provide publicity, you will mention
this person's name. It is a premium plum in politics to be
mentioned by Al Gore. To come off his lips is worth a front page
story and a 6 p.m. TV feature.''
</P>
<P>
   Presidential candidates themselves drop hints about their lists
all the time.
</P>
<P>
   Bush recently said of New Jersey's Whitman: ``She's on the
list.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about that on the ABC News program ``Face the Nation'' on
a recent Sunday, Whitman responded with the modest aplomb of an
accomplished political player.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, that's very nice of him and I think that's reflective of
all the good things that have been happening here in the state of
New Jersey and if he were to offer, I'd be crazy not to consider it
very seriously, but I'm not counting on it.''
</P>
<P>
   On the same Sunday morning, different channel, Florida Sen. Bob
Graham was enjoying mention on another TV show, NBC's ``Meet the
Press,'' because a poll showed Gore would rise to contention in
that important state if Graham were his running mate, and because
it is known that Christopher has been in touch with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very flattering to be considered for such a high
position,'' Graham said. ``I have a job. I'm very appreciative that
the people of Florida have given me this opportunity to represent
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes a name is floated because journalists ask various
constituent groups whom they want and don't want, said David Keene,
a veteran political operative who heads the American Conservative
Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``But nobody really has a clue how the choice will be made,''
Keene said.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Sabato, a University of Virginia political scientist who
closely monitors presidential politics, said there are really two
processes at work in each party's veepstakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``One is pure speculation engaged in by reporters and people
like me who don't have a clue,'' Sabato said, echoing Keene. ``We
are simply looking at the map and trying to identify logical
candidates who would help a nominee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other process is the one that really matters, the one
engaged in by the presidential candidate and his senior staff. It's
like they say, the people who know aren't talking and people who
are talking don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   One interesting historical fact, Sabato said, is how often
presidential candidates blunder when they choose a running mate who
they believe will help them win the election.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Quayle, Geraldine Ferraro, Spiro Agnew, Thomas Eagleton and
William Miller were ``major goofs,'' Sabato said.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle, an Indiana senator when he was chosen by George W.
Bush's father, brought no visible electoral strength to the ticket
but generated controversy over whether family connections eased his
entry into the National Guard, enabling him to avoid going to
Vietnam. Later he misspelled ``potato'' on national television,
becoming an object of laughter and ridicule.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Mondale, the Democratic presidential candidate in 1984,
chose Rep. Geraldine Ferraro of New York as his running mate. But
the first woman to grace a major party's national ticket became a
drag on the ticket when questions were raised about her husband's
business dealings.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Nixon's vice president, Spiro Agnew, resigned in
disgrace after it became known that he had accepted bribes as
governor of Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   George McGovern, the Democratic presidential nominee in 1972,
chose Sen. Thomas Eagleton of Missouri, then hastily replaced him
when it was revealed that Eagleton had been treated for depression
with shock therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, a little known congressman from New York, was Barry
Goldwater's choice for vice president in 1964, contributing nothing
to offset Goldwater's landslide defeat by Lyndon Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``And there were many more,'' Sabato said. ``In fact, you could
make the case that presidential candidates made serious errors at
least one out of every four times they picked vice presidential
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``So if the candidates make illogical choices one out of four
times, then how could anyone be certain that a logical process will
help them guess the identity of the eventual nominee?''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the game goes on.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a partial list of other Republicans and how many times
they have were mentioned in the 60-day Lexis-Nexis search as
potential running mates for Bush: Ret. Gen Colin Powell, 482; Sen.
Fred Thompson of Tennessee, 222; Michigan Gov. John Engler, 184;
Florida Sen. Connie Mack, 160; House Budget Committee Chairman John
Kasich of Ohio, 153; Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating, 127; former Sen.
John Danforth, 85; former Education Secretary William Bennett, 36;
California Rep. Chris Cox, 23.
</P>
<P>
   Some other Democrats mentioned with regularity were Nebraska
Sen. Bob Kerrey, 260; California Gov. Gray Davis, 260; California
Sen. Dianne Feinstein, 254; Indiana Sen. Evan Bayh, 189; Illinois
Sen. Richard Durbin, 137; former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin,
127; HUD Secretary Andrew Cuomo, 122; Massachusetts Sen. John
Kerry, 120; former Maine Sen. George Mitchell, 76; Maryland Lt.
Gov. Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, 65; and Connecticut Sen. Joseph
Lieberman, 50.

 By DAVID BINDER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALPENA, Mich. _ Engaged in daily combat on many fronts are
swarms of invader species that number in the millions throughout
the Great Lakes _ among them the Eurasian ruffe, the round goby,
the zebra mussel and the sea lamprey _ and hundreds of
single-minded biologists and wildlife managers who are trying to
destroy them.
</P>
<P>
   Well behind the battle fronts are commanders, often with
conflicting agendas, from dozens of local, regional and federal
agencies, American and Canadian, and their constituents _ big
shippers and industries, sport and commercial fisherman,
environmentalists and the general public.
</P>
<P>
   At stake is the ecological future of the Great Lakes,
collectively the world's largest body of fresh water. Under the
impact of wave after wave of alien invasions, most brought in the
ballast tanks of freighters arriving from across the Atlantic, the
lakes are ``really in turmoil,'' said David Jude, a research
scientist at the University of Michigan. The alien incursions are
killing off native species and, in some areas, changing the very
face of the lakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably 90 percent of the animals present in Lake Erie were
not there 15 years ago,'' said Dr. Hugh MacIsaac, a professor of
ecology at the University of Windsor, Ontario, and the same could
be said of most of the other Great Lakes.
</P>
<P>
   As of 1997, Canada and the United States had spent $30 million
on research into alien species, said Tracy Mehan, director of the
Michigan Office of the Great Lakes. And since 1970, $300 million
has been spent on actual operations aimed at eradicating a single
species, lampreys.
</P>
<P>
   But all this money has been like artillery barrages against a
well-entrenched enemy that constantly brings in reinforcements.
Just as scientists seem to gain control of one invader, a new alien
species appears.
</P>
<P>
   The newest threat is the spiny water flea, Bythotrephes
cederstroemi, which clogs anglers' fishing lines. reels and nets
with their gooey bodies hooked together in crystalline masses. But
it is only one of a long line of invaders.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists believe the biggest threat, sea lampreys (Petromyzon
marinus), first reached the western lakes as early as the 1920s by
way of the Welland Canal, which connects the Erie Canal _ and
beyond it the Hudson River _ with Lake Erie. Still earlier, in the
1820s, the European weed purple loosestrife (Lythrum salicaria)
arrived, infesting and corrupting wetlands.
</P>
<P>
   By the time many of the alien species arrived, human settlement
had already severely damaged the delicately balanced ecosystems of
the inland lakes, which are only 10,000 years old. People
overfished, dammed up many of the lakes' 5,747 tributaries, drained
wetlands and polluted the water with industrial waste and sewage.
</P>
<P>
   But all this was nothing compared with the damage wrought by the
sudden profusion of alien species unintentionally imported by ships
from overseas. By 1997 the list of so-called exotics _ ranging from
bacteria to plants, fleas to fish _ numbered 139. Now it is up to
145.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a war, started by man,'' Jude said. ``And we're losing
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Imported species can proliferate with remarkable speed.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1990, Jude discovered a strange fish during a study,
financed by the Michigan Department of Natural Resources, at the
intake tube of a Detroit Edison power plant on the St. Clair River,
an important link between Lake Erie and Lake Huron. A university
colleague identified it as a round goby (Neogobius melanostomus),
an aggressive bottom dweller originating in the Caspian, Black and
Azov Seas that can spawn up to five times a year.
</P>
<P>
   Within four years round gobies and their cousins, the tubenose
gobies(Proterorhinus marmoratus), had spread to Lake Huron and Lake
Michigan and into streams.
</P>
<P>
   To amuse colleagues, Jude composed an 11-verse ballad, ``The
Galloping Goby Blues,'' portraying the goby as the fish that
swallowed the Great Lakes. He sang a sample:
</P>
<P>
   Round gobies now rule among the rocks
</P>
<P>
   They can live out of water, they'll bite you in your socks
</P>
<P>
   And if we don't stop them soon, there'll only be bad news
</P>
<P>
   I've got those egg-suckin', fish- chewin', galloping goby blues.
</P>
<P>
   Although Jude still follows the goby, after a recent bid for
more research money was rejected, he turned his attention to lake
trout, the main predator of the lakes and the native species most
endangered by sea lampreys.
</P>
<P>
   The proliferation of the goby and other alien species is caused
mainly by bilge water discharges from the ocean-going ships that
have been entering the Great Lakes through the St. Lawrence Seaway
for the last 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   To combat the problem, the federal government adopted a law in
1993 requiring overseas shippers to exchange their ballast water in
the Atlantic, before entering the Great Lakes. Canada has similar,
but voluntary, guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   The ballast exchange, however, leaves residual alien species
unscathed in the 100 to 200 tons of unpumpable sludge at the bottom
of ballast tanks of the 500 or so foreign vessels that traverse the
lakes annually.
</P>
<P>
   Industry officials oppose proposals that would require shippers
to treat bilge with ultraviolet rays, heat, chemicals or biocides
like glutaraldehyde. A coalition of 72 port representatives,
shippers, trade unions and other interested groups has formed to
fight ballast-sterilization legislation submitted in January by a
Michigan state senator, Ken Sikkema.
</P>
<P>
   On a broader level, the Great Lakes Fisheries Commission,
established by the United States and Canada in 1955, sent letters
in April to Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Lloyd
Axworthy, Canada's minister of foreign affairs, saying that the
ballast water exchange programs ``need to be revised or replaced.''

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   About the same time, working in the combat zone _ the mouth of
the Thunder Bay River, which flows through the shipping port of
Alpena to Lake Huron _ Anjanette Hintz, a federal Fish and Wildlife
Service worker, was trawling in a small boat for exotic species.
She had her sights sets on another nuisance fish, the perchlike
Eurasian ruffe (Gymnocephalus Cernuus).
</P>
<P>
   In five passes that consumed the better part of a day, Hintz
dragged up only one ruffe, a year-old female that was about to
spawn. But dredged up from 20 feet below _ along with submerged
logs, clusters of zebra mussels, a beer can, a fat carp, a
bluegill, a bullhead, some trout perch and other minnows _ were
three round gobies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't really know where the ruffe goes in spring,'' she
explained. ``They like the Thunder Bay because it is deep and dark.
We are trying to develop a small enough acoustic sensor to track
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Hintz has been tracking the exotics since she started with the
service here in 1994. The first ruffe arrived the next year, and
last summer she caught 400 of them with trawl nets and
electroshocking.
</P>
<P>
   As with the gobies, the ruffe originated in the Black and
Caspian Seas. They were first detected in Duluth Harbor in 1986 and
have since spread through other Great Lakes. The ruffe was
designated an aquatic nuisance species by the federal government in
1992.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Busiahn, who works for the wildlife service in Ashland,
Wis., called the explosively growing ruffe population ``a serious
threat to North American fishery resources.'' The fish compete with
native yellow perch and walleyed pike, and consume the eggs of the
commercially important whitefish, among other species.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, gobies feed voraciously and pose a threat to native
species by competing for food, including fish eggs and zooplankton.
(The only plus attributed to gobies is that they also eat zebra
mussels.)
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have concluded that some gobies have spread by
anglers who acquired them at one site for bait and then dumped the
excess overboard in other waters.
</P>
<P>
   What to do?
</P>
<P>
   So far the biologists have succeeded only in intensive
surveillance of the latest invaders and in spreading the word among
sports fishermen and commercial bait dealers to kill them and
report them.
</P>
<P>
   There are proposals to design nesting shelters attractive to the
invaders where they and their offspring could be trapped and
destroyed; to create barriers to migration; to foster likely
predators like the largemouth bass; and to spread a relatively
benign but costly compound proven successful in controlling sea
lampreys, TFM, to destroy ruffe and gobies. There have been strong
objections to some of these by environmental groups.
</P>
<P>
   The most promising technology for combatting invaders may lie in
the realm of pheromones, the odors that the fish generate,
especially in turbid waters, to attract sex partners, to warn of
danger or, like canines, to mark hospitable territory.
</P>
<P>
   One scientist who has pioneered pheromone research in fish is
Dr. Peter Sorensen of the University of Minnesota. In 1995, he and
his associates succeeded in identifying the migratory pheromone of
the sea lamprey, which is so efficient at following chemical traces
through the water that Sorensen once described it as ``a swimming
nose.''
</P>
<P>
   The elusive scent consisted of two bile acids exuded from the
gall bladder in feces. Sea lampreys mark favored spawning streams
with this substance, allowing them to locate the streams at a great
distance from open waters. Three years later, in 1998, Sorensen and
his team isolated the sex pheromone in the urine of male lampreys.
</P>
<P>
   Sorensen said he and his colleagues were also ``fairly far
along'' in learning how to calibrate pheromone densities from
stream to stream with what he called ``enzyme immunoassays.'' This
may make it possible one day to neutralize popular spawning sites,
or to attract vast numbers of males to selected ``manageable''
streams where they can be trapped and sterilized. This would
provide scientists the equivalent of ``shooting fish in a barrel,''
Sorensen said.
</P>
<P>
   The principal measures against lampreys, short of catching and
eating them (Henry I of England died in 1135 after consuming some),
have included applying lampricides to larval habitats, trapping
them at barriers and releasing sterilized males at spawning time in
the spring.
</P>
<P>
   This spring, the wildlife service trapped over 2,400 lampreys at
a $240,000 barrier equipped with electrodes on the Ocqueoc River
near here _ one of 19 barriers on American and Canadian streams. An
estimated 56 percent of the spawning run is trapped. Sterilized
with the chemical compound bisazir, males compete successfully for
females but are unable to fertilize them.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Fishery Commission, lampreys destroy lake
trout, whitefish and chub by attaching themselves to their bodies,
rasping holes and sucking the life out of them. Fishermen once
harvested 15 million pounds of trout annually from the lakes. Since
1973 the much smaller harvest has depended on restocked trout _ 2.6
million a year by Michigan at a cost of $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   There have been successes against predators. Forty years ago,
after lampreys and overfishing caused the collapse of the predator
lake trout, the population of another invader, the herringlike
alewives, surged. Millions of them started washing up dead on the
beaches of Lake Michigan. The huge die-off during spring spawning
season was attributed to ``winter thermal stress, high abundance
and shortage of food'' for the alewives, said Gavin Christie of the
Fishery Commission.
</P>
<P>
   But now, restocked trout, together with large stocks of chinook
and coho salmon introduced for sport fishing, have ``pushed
alewives just about up against the wall in Lake Huron,'' said James
Johnson of the Michigan Department of Resources station.
</P>
<P>
   The restocked trout, however, seldom reproduce, Johnson said,
and they remain vulnerable to lampreys, which account for 50
percent of lake trout mortality in Huron.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to go after the lamprey, Roger Bergstedt, head of
the U.S. Geological Survey's biological research station at Hammond
Bay, Mich., has spent eight years mapping 12,000 lamprey larval
habitats in St. Mary's River, which links Lake Superior to Lake
Huron. The work was part of an American-Canadian program to put
lampricides in the roughly 300 tributary streams where the lampreys
spawn.
</P>
<P>
   Applying lampricides to 30 hot spots, Bergstedt reduced the
population to about 10 percent of its peak, he believes. Last year
$4.5 million was spent on lampricide.
</P>
<P>
   Calling the effort ``highly successful,'' Bergstedt said the
future focus would be on ``new weapons in this war to reduce
reliance on chemical control, like pheromones.''

MICHAEL JOHNSON, AT 32, STILL THE MAN TO BEAT
</HEADLINE>
 (Repeating for all needing) 
(For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By GIL LeBRETON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On a track in South Africa in the middle of March, Michael
Johnson ran the 200 meters in 19.71 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Too fast, the Baylor ex assessed. And in short order, he headed
home, cancelling his race appearances, even the one in Waco at the
meet named in hishonor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in South Africa for three weeks,'' Johnson explained.
``I went there to see where I was, and I found out there that I was
way ahead of where I needed to be. So there was no need to compete
at that point.''
</P>
<P>
   Experience remains the best teacher, and Johnson has been a
straight-A student. At the age of 32, therefore, he headed home in
April not to race, but to become a new father and to do the things
that he knew from experience that he must do.
</P>
<P>
   His new son was born on May 6. The U.S. Olympic Track and Field
Trials begin in Sacramento, Calif., on Friday. The Sydney Olympics
open in less than 10 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Johnson, again, has the clock on his side.
</P>
<P>
   Four years older, four years wiser, Johnson is still the man to
beat in the Olympic 200 and 400 meters.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, it is different than it was in 1996. Going into those
Olympic Trials, Johnson was toying with history. Now, he heads for
Sacramento not only owning gold medals in both events but also the
world records.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be easier from a mental standpoint,'' he said. ``I've
done it before. It's familiar territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether I can do it again physically _ I think I can _ that
will be the mystery this time. I'm four years older. But I look at
it as I've got four more years of experience.''
</P>
<P>
   His golden reign has brought him wealth and fame. He signed a
$12-million endorsement deal with Nike after the Atlanta Games. In
October of 1998, he married Kerry Doyen. In May, their first child,
Sebastian, was born.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's the exact same thing as '96,'' Johnson argued. ``It's
the Olympic Games. There's nothing better. You're going to face the
best competitors at their best in an Olympic year. Nobody's giving
you anything. That's the motivation. That's the challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, but Johnson's primary antagonist has already been
tagged and identified by a curious public. Maurice Greene of Kansas
City, Kan., holds the world record (9.79) in the 100-meter dash and
won the 200 at last year's world championships.
</P>
<P>
   The two have spent the summer running in measured circles. At
the Prefontaine Classic in Eugene, Ore., last month, Greene ran the
200. Johnson opted for the 400. Greene has barked that he thinks
Johnson is ducking him, a charge at which His Goldenness scoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Once, Johnson himself was the new gun in town. Carl Lewis
eventually gave Michael his grudging due.
</P>
<P>
   Now Johnson is the sprints' old gunslinger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yep, that's me,'' he said, smiling at the thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that's great. That's the thing I'm most proud of. There's
always someone new, but I'm always right here. I'm always the guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've handled it the same way, and I'm going to continue
handling it the same way. I'm going to keep my mouth shut and let
my legs do the talking.''
</P>
<P>
   If Greene and Johnson meet, it figures to be in the finals of
the Olympic Trials' 200 on Sunday, July 23 _ Greene's 26th
birthday.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as the matchup, no, I don't get as excited as the fans
do,'' Johnson said, ``because I know more than the fans do. I know
that Maurice has never beaten Ato Boldon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't look at it like the fans look at it. I've got to look
at what Michael's got to go out there and do. Maurice Greene is the
world record holder in the 100, and off pure speculation he might
be the guy who can beat Michael Johnson. But that's what the fans
are looking at.''
</P>
<P>
   What Johnson knows _ and what Greene melted under at the '96
trials _ are the pressures that the next two weeks will hold. It's
been said that U.S. track and field has the fairest unjust system
of selecting an Olympic team in the world.
</P>
<P>
   In some events, notably in the sprints, the trials talent pool
is deep. It takes a patient intensity just to reach the finals.
Only the three fastest _ and often the strongest _ survive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like running the rounds,'' Johnson said. ``It adds a degree
of strategy to the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus, there is work to do in the days ahead. Johnson is
convinced that his world record in the 400 _ 43.18 set in the
Seville World Championships last August _ can be lowered under 43
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   If Greene stands in the way in the 200, so be it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that the public is looking for someone to beat me,''
Johnson offered. ``It's what we're all looking for _ a great race.
Great competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Atlanta, it was ridiculous how far I beat everybody. Nobody
wants to see that again. They want to see a race. And I don't blame
anyone for hoping Maurice is that guy.''
</P>
<P>
   At age 32, however, four years older and wiser than in Atlanta,
Michael Johnson has experience and the clock on his side.
</P>
<P>
   What doeshewant to see in the 200-meter finals?
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to see the tops of two guys' heads while I'm standing
on top of the podium,'' Johnson answered. ``That's what I want to
see.''

A RETICENT LARRY MCMURTRY TAKES STOCK OF HIS LEGACY AND LIFELONG
PASSIONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF GUINN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCHER CITY, Texas _ He sits in the back of one of his
bookstores, looking rumpled in jeans and a white knit shirt, his
eyes darting. Larry McMurtry, a Pulitzer Prize winner for
``Lonesome Dove,'' says he isn't comfortable talking about himself
or his work _ ironic for someone who makes a living with words.
</P>
<P>
   McMurtry, 63, comes across as painfully shy. He doesn't do many
interviews and wants to make certain he isn't portrayed as a
celebrity. For 45 minutes McMurtry tries to reveal as little as
possible on a variety of subjects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really, what I think about anything is in my books,'' McMurtry
says.
</P>
<P>
   He grudgingly admits he has achieved a certain level of
prominence, although not as great as some perceive. ``I'm probably
the main celebrity around here north of Willie Nelson,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``My popularity, such as it is, is a regional thing. I have some
status, I'm not saying I don't, but if you asked a cross section of
readers nationally to list their top 10 novelists, most wouldn't
mention me. They'd think of Anne Tyler, John Updike, Philip Roth.
Texans might mention me.''
</P>
<P>
   He says that ``Lonesome Dove'' is really his only popular book.
``The books of mine making the bestseller lists are the `Lonesome
Dove' series (''Streets of Laredo,'' ``Dead Man's Walk,''
``Comanche Moon'') or other westerns,'' he says. ``My last couple
westerns barely made the list. My last nonwestern novel, ``Duane's
Depressed,'' a very good novel, didn't make it at all.''
</P>
<P>
   McMurtry, through modesty or disingenuousness, isn't giving
himself sufficient credit. His reputation as a writer is immense.
Booked Up, the massive old-book business McMurtry has gradually
moved from Washington, D.C., to his tiny West Texas hometown, is
flourishing (it currently occupies four buildings along or near
Archer City's main street).
</P>
<P>
   Almost a decade after heart bypass surgery, he finally feels he
has recovered. And, over the next few months, he has no fewer than
three books being published, all by Simon &AMP; Schuster _ ``Roads,'' a
nonfiction account of driving some of America's major highways;
``Still Wild,'' a McMurtry-edited collection of short stories by
other writers about the modern American West; and ``Boone's Lick,''
new western fiction from the man who has proved a master of the
genre with ``Lonesome Dove'' and ``Anything for Billy.''
</P>
<P>
   But in Archer City, McMurtry appears most content when he is
opening boxes of books to place on shelves in his store. His
reluctance to embrace stardom prevents him from stocking his own
titles at Booked Up, because, invariably, he would be asked to sign
books for visitors. This would take him away from day-to-day tasks
in the store.
</P>
<P>
   When fans do show up, McMurtry says, ``I try to be reasonable.
If I can, I talk. I suppose people are curious.''
</P>
<P>
   He isn't particularly forthcoming about ``Roads,'' a series of
first-person essays that openly discuss many aspects of McMurtry's
personal life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always liked to drive, but I don't do that much anymore,''
McMurtry says. ``I had an eye problem that was corrected, so I
indulged myself in a year of driving.''
</P>
<P>
   But McMurtry does become more expansive when discussing Booked
Up. He first became involved in book buying and selling during his
college days at Rice University in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't scout books anymore, but I go out and buy
collections,'' he says. ``Buying books is like breathing to a
bookseller. If we don't have new boxes to open here, after three
weeks I start to get paranoid.''
</P>
<P>
   McMurtry won't allow his staff to computerize the Booked Up
operation, which involves an ever-changing inventory of hundreds of
thousands of titles. He prides himself on knowing where any given
book is shelved and how much it costs.
</P>
<P>
   He proves it when asked where a visitor could find ``Yankee From
Olympus'' by Catherine Drinker Bowen: ``That's about Justice
Holmes. It's a five-dollar book, and you'll find it on the south
wall of this building.'' He's right.
</P>
<P>
   When the topic turns to his personal library, McMurtry
practically becomes effusive. He leans forward, props his chin in
his hand and gives the subject some thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a large personal library, about 20,000 books, and it's
a working library,'' he says. ``It has various world literatures,
lots of history, a lot of historical biography. I wrote `Crazy
Horse' (a short biography of the Cheyenne chief) out of my own
library. I'm writing another book, eventually, maybe two or three
years from now, about the role the Missouri River has played in
American history. I have 30 or 40 books on the Missouri River now
and expect to have maybe 100 by the time I'm ready to write. I'll
read them all.''
</P>
<P>
   He is a prolific reader, saying it is the most important thing
in his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, reading is more central than writing, more central
than anything,'' he says, smiling. ``What I read varies but
includes mostly biography and nonfiction. In the event I do read
fiction, it's mainly older French or Russian fiction. A lot of the
nonfiction concerns the 20th century.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Walter Benjamin at the Dairy Queen,'' a collection of
essays published last year, McMurtry ruminated on ``Don Quixote,''
one of the first ``real'' books he read as a child. The novel
fascinated him, McMurtry wrote, and started him on a lifelong quest
to seek out classic writing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried reading `Don Quixote' again a couple of years ago,''
he says. ``It didn't work for me anymore. It didn't hold my
attention.''
</P>
<P>
   As an author, McMurtry still has a basic career goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always want to write a better book,'' he says. ``You always
hope you'll hit it just right.''
</P>
<P>
   Of his own work, he says that ``Terms of Endearment'' and
``Lonesome Dove'' have the best chance of being remembered. Another
favorite is ``Desert Rose'' (published in 1983), because ``I'd been
in a writing slump for 10 years before that one.''
</P>
<P>
   He is also pleased with ``All My Friends Are Going To Be
Strangers,'' ``In a Narrow Grave,'' and ``Walter Benjamin.'' The
rest of his backlist, he believes, will eventually be forgotten by
most readers.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his discomfort with the fame that comes with success,
McMurtry says he isn't ready to stop writing, close Booked Up and
stay home reading all day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a wealthy person; I'm a working person,'' McMurtry
says. ``I have to support myself. Perhaps if I sold all my book
stock, I wouldn't have to work. But writing is still fun, to some
extent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bookselling is fun. I find most of the people who come (to
Booked Up) are quite literate, interested in the books and not me.
So I can have a reasonable life.''

   ``It's not that the public is looking for someone to beat me,''
Johnson offered. ``It's what we're all looking for _ a great race.
Great competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Atlanta, it was ridiculous how far I beat everybody. Nobody
wants to see that again. They want to see a race. And I don't blame
anyone for hoping Maurice is that guy.''
</P>
<P>
   At age 32, however, four years older and wiser than in Atlanta,
Michael Johnson has experience and the clock on his side.
</P>
<P>
   What doeshewant to see in the 200-meter finals?
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to see the tops of two guys' heads while I'm standing
on top of the podium,'' Johnson answered. ``That's what I want to
see.''

FOLLOWERS OF MANY FAITHS SEEK ZEN'S SPIRITUAL CALM
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Pei-Fang Chuang once tried religion as a
means of finding what was missing in her life.
</P>
<P>
   At 18, she accompanied a friend to church for the first time and
she remembers crying and crying as she was filled with the
overwhelming joy of hearing the congregation praise God.
</P>
<P>
   ``On that day, I got baptized,'' said Chuang, now 25.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, she continued to pray, but she felt that irritating
void creeping back into her life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I didn't find what I was looking for,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Then she found Zen.
</P>
<P>
   The name Zen means ``to meditate peacefully,'' or seeking the
truth by meditation, as a means of achieving a harmonious
relationship between nature and human beings. It was introduced
from China to Japan, and spread along with Buddhism, according to
Zen Master Miao Tien, in an article titled ``The General Concept of
Zen.''
</P>
<P>
   In America, it has been used by Christians, Jews and others to
achieve harmony and balance in a chaotic world.
</P>
<P>
   Zen, considered by many practitioners to be a branch of
Buddhism, is not considered a religion, say experts. But many
practitioners of Zen who also have religious affiliations have said
that the contemplative aspects of meditation have supplemented
their religious relationships.
</P>
<P>
   And for those who are not involved in organized religion, the
meditation techniques are said to bring better health and greater
insight.
</P>
<P>
   Chuang started the Zen Club when she came to UT-Arlington from
Taiwan in 1999 to study anthropology. Now the club has grown to
more than 40 members, meeting at least weekly to practice
meditation techniques and discuss the benefits of practicing Zen.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Reyes, 36, an assistant professor of computer science and
engineering began investigating Zen when he was working on his
Ph.D.
</P>
<P>
   ``My main goal is to not have to work so hard in order to
accomplish goals,'' he said. ``I need wisdom. I need to be able to
perceive what is an appropriate goal and pursue that. In order to
do that, I need to have a mind that is at peace, not so distracted,
easy to focus.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, when days at school get tough or when he has his hands full
with his two daughters, ages 8 and 11, Reyes takes time to slow his
thoughts and clean the clutter out of his mind.
</P>
<P>
   He devotes at least half an hour each day to meditation. He has
seen benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The basic, the big win for me is, really, that I don't have to
have my way all the time,'' he said. ``That is probably the
greatest advantage I've garnered from studying this. Being
sensitive to perceiving God's will and allowing his will to happen
without me getting in the way.''
</P>
<P>
   As a Christian studying Zen, Reyes has had to cope with a few
paradoxes, such as Buddhist teachings about reincarnation. Reyes
says, however, that he goes to the Zen Club meetings to learn
breathing and meditation techniques and he ignores anything that is
out of sync with his Christian beliefs. In fact, learning to be
still and quiet has enhanced his relationship with God, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's calming down and realizing I'm not really in control of
anything and the very best I can do is realize that God has been
merciful to me and let his will be done because he is much wiser
than me.''
</P>
<P>
   Because there is little indoctrination associated with the
practice of Zen, there is little conflict between religious
practitioners who also participate in Zen, said Mackenzie Brown,
professor and chairman of the religion department at Trinity
University.
</P>
<P>
   ``The general attitude of Zen tradition and masters, certainly
in the West, is there would be no conflict in engaging in these
sorts of practices and engaging in Christian practices and the
like,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   Although at a Zen monastery one would see a very regimented
service, many Westerners seek Zen because there are so few rules
and regulations, Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The emphasis of Zen is experience rather than doctrinal or
book learning,'' he said. ``Doctrines are almost irrelevant. You
don't study as much as you will practice. Practice along with
letting that flow into every area of one's life so every act is an
act of meditation.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown said any attempt to articulate the meaning of Zen is
secondary.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have people who are hungry for some sort of spiritual
experience, especially among younger people like college students,
if they are a little bit bored or disillusioned by church
experiences growing up or synagogue experiences growing up with its
exposition of a fair amount of doctrine, Zen is ideal,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are purifying our minds and making our bodies healthy,
mentally and physically,'' Chuang said. ``It's holistic. It just
changes your life.''

BRINGING TREASURES BACK TO CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, July 16) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ A much-needed little antiquities museum has been
created in Beijing by a most improbable source: a giant state
corporation that was long notorious for its global weapons sales
and was until recently a branch of the People's Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   The new Poly Art Museum's attractions include its manageable
size _ for now, just one large room stocked with choice ancient
bronzes and a small side room with a few sublime Buddhist statues _
and its highly selective approach to acquisition. The brazenly
Epicurean philosophy is detailed in a brochure in which the museum
resolves ``to eschew quantity and comprehensiveness, confining
ourselves rather to the pursuit of the exquisite, the rare and the
fine.''
</P>
<P>
   I don't know what serious scholars might think of this approach,
but for this borderline antiquities-philistine who nods off at the
sight of long cases filled with objects, the museum offered
unexpected delights.
</P>
<P>
   True to its word, the Poly museum is exhibiting no more than
about 100 objects, each with some wonderful aspect and each given
plenty of space, with labels both in Chinese and in English.
</P>
<P>
   Situated in an unprepossessing office building at a busy
intersection, the museum had kept such a low profile after its
opening last year that few even knew of its existence. But in early
May, it suddenly thrust itself into the news when it spent $4
million to buy three bronze animal heads at auctions in Hong Kong.
The heads had been part of a zodiac fountain at the Old Summer
Palace near Beijing, designed by a European Jesuit in the mid-18th
century, and were looted by French and English troops when they
razed the estate in 1860.
</P>
<P>
   The pillaging of the emperor's summer home was a humiliating
moment in Chinese history, and this spring, when Sotheby's and
Christie's put these bronze heads and a similarly stolen vase on
auction in Hong Kong, nationalistic voices were raised in
objection. The Poly Museum helped save the day, buying the heads at
what many considered an extravagant price of $4 million and
announcing their ``return to the motherland.''
</P>
<P>
   This ``political purchase'' was a departure for the museum,
which has focused on far older relics, and the pieces themselves
are more important as historical symbols than as art. But with the
enormous public interest that was generated by the dispute, the
museum is making space for its new monkey, ox and tiger heads.
</P>
<P>
   The purchases were in line with one part of the museum's
mission: to bring back Chinese treasures that have been smuggled or
sold out of the country. The parent company, the China Poly Group
Corp., has officially separated from the military and now describes
itself as a huge government-owned conglomerate involved in real
estate, industry, high technology and tourism. With this museum it
is trying out what is a new concept for China: corporate
philanthropy.
</P>
<P>
   The company has spent untold millions to build a collection from
scratch over the last two years, mainly in Hong Kong and Taiwan,
where newly discovered relics tend to appear on the market after
being smuggled out of China. Some of the most stunning bronzes on
display were almost certainly unearthed and smuggled out in just
the past several years, museum officials believe.
</P>
<P>
   Because the museum is reversing, ever so slightly, the flood of
relics leaving the country, it was able to enlist one of China's
premier archaeologists as a consultant: Yu Weichao, who recently
retired as head of the National Museum of Chinese History in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a very cheerful job, buying these items back from
overseas,'' Yu said. ``But I think the Chinese people will be happy
to know that at least we're getting them back.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently Yu gave me a quick tour of the exhibition, barely
containing his enthusiasm as his eyes almost fondled each piece.
</P>
<P>
   The most rare and valuable single bronze, he said _ and I would
add a most fascinating object to scrutinize _ is the ornate bronze
ceremonial wine vessel prominently displayed near the entrance,
with the face of a deity and various birds and other figures and a
gorgeous blue-green patina. Unusually well preserved and made with
exceptional skill, it dates from the Western Zhou period, from the
11th to 8th centuries B.C., and was probably unearthed in Shaanxi
province in the recent past, Yu said. The museum bought it from a
Hong Kong dealer.
</P>
<P>
   Yu dwelled lovingly on a set of eight ritual bronze bells,
graduated in size. Inside each bell is a narrow groove, hollowed
out to perfect the tone, and depending where it is struck, each has
two clear tones. An inscription in ancient Chinese characters
resembles pictographs much more than modern Chinese writing; they
are fun to examine in themselves. The inscription commemorates the
previous three generations of the family of nobleman who had the
bells made and used them to make music some 2,800 years ago in what
is now Shaanxi.
</P>
<P>
   My eyes were drawn to a gold-covered long-necked dragon head,
which around 2,000 years ago formed part of the frame for a royal
canopy and offered an elegant contrast to the many bronze and
bronze-with-copper-inlay vessels. ``My feeling is simply that this
is an exquisitely beautiful piece,'' Yu said, dropping all pretense
of archaeological objectivity.
</P>
<P>
   In a small side room, the museum displays a few of the stone
carvings of Buddhist figures that have been unearthed in Shandong
province over the last quarter century, part of an extraordinary
find known as the Qingzhou sculptures, after a county at the center
of the excavations. Stolen examples of these serene and graceful
figures, created during the northern Wei dynasty in the sixth
century, have started appearing in museums and collections abroad,
but the Poly Art Museum collected its examples inside China.
</P>
<P>
   For now, museum officials say, they plan to keep building their
collections of bronzes and stone carvings, and may soon branch into
ceramics and add another exhibition hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're only one company, so there are only so many things we
can buy,'' said Ma Baoping, assistant director of the museum and a
former army officer with a nose for art. ``It's beyond us to buy
every stolen object that comes up for sale, and I hope that other
Chinese companies and collectors, including overseas Chinese
collectors, will join with us to help bring these treasures back
into Chinese hands.''
</P>
<P>
   The museum is on the second floor of the Poly Plaza commercial
building, 14 Dong-zhimen Nandajie, at the intersection of
Dongzhimen Avenue with the Second Ring Road, across from the
Swissotel. For some months to come, it will be open only on Tuesday
and Thursday from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. Admission is $2.40; telephone
(86-10) 6500-8117.

CONCH SHELL   AS A MODEL   FOR TOUGHER   CERAMICS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ohio)   By KENNETH CHANG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like plywood, a conch shell is stronger than its parts.
</P>
<P>
   The spiral-shaped shell is 99 percent aragonite _ a mineral made
of calcium, carbon and oxygen _ but is up to 1,000 times as tough
as pure aragonite. For creatures desiring to eat the conch, that's
a formidable fortress to breach.
</P>
<P>
   The strength comes from nature's evolutionary engineering and
could inspire tougher ceramics.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are, we believe, valuable lessons to be learned in the
design of materials from the evolutionary processes that have taken
place,'' said Dr. Arthur Heuer, a professor of material sciences
and engineering at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   In the June 29 issue of the journal Nature, researchers led by
Heuer and Dr. Roberto Ballarini, a professor of civil engineering
at Case Western, described in detail the shell of the queen conch,
which lives in the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   To the naked eye, a chip of conch shell looks unremarkable.
``You would think it was a homogenous piece of chalk,'' Ballarini
said.
</P>
<P>
   Under high-power electron microscopes, the view is more
intricate. The shell consists of layers of rods of aragonite that
crisscross at right angles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to think of it as ceramic plywood,'' Heuer said.
</P>
<P>
   Like wood, each shell layer, about a 25th of an inch thick,
cracks easily when bent along the direction of the rods, the
equivalent of along the grain of wood, but it is very strong when
bent in the perpendicular direction, the equivalent of against the
grain of wood.
</P>
<P>
   The layered crisscross structure strengthens the shell in all
directions. When the shell is bent, tiny cracks accumulate within
individual layers, but the cracks don't propagate all the way
through _ and the shell stays in one piece. ``It doesn't fail,''
Heuer said, ``and that's not a bad definition of a tough
material.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike plywood, though, each aragonite rod is, in turn, also
reinforced.
</P>
<P>
   ``One big rod is made of a bunch of smaller rods,'' Ballarini
said, ``and the smaller rod is made of even smaller rods, which is
made out of even smaller rods.''
</P>
<P>
   A protein secreted by the conch _ the remaining 1 percent of the
shell _ glues the rods together.
</P>
<P>
   If ceramics could be made as tough as conch shells, they would
find new uses in combustion engines, furnaces, body armor and other
applications for which they are now too brittle.
</P>
<P>
   But the layered, crisscross structure is not easy to mimic,
because of the wide range of rod sizes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hard part would be producing such structures in
cost-effective ways,'' Ballarini said.
</P>

`QUEER AS FOLK,' FROM SHOWTIME, IS MATURE LOOK AT GAY EXPERIENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Ever since Ellen DeGeneres stepped gingerly
from the closet, the depiction of homosexuals on network television
has advanced from the wink-wink-nudge-nudge stage to somewhat more
frank portrayals. But even these new examples are generally
relegated to comedies like ``Will &AMP; Grace'' because it's easier to
laugh at gays than take them seriously.
</P>
<P>
   The place for honest, unvarnished treatment of gay life, it
seems, is Showtime, whose ``No Limits'' slogan actually means
something. Jerry Offsay, president of programming for Showtime
Networks, says it really comes down to greenlighting good material,
not targeting a particular issue or audience.
</P>
<P>
   Still, on Offsay's watch the cable channel has aired sensitive,
open-minded fare like ``The Twilight of the Golds,'' ``Common
Ground'' and ``Armistead Maupin's More Tales of the City.'' And its
fall/winter slate includes the sort of gutsy programming that would
never get past the drawing board at the networks.
</P>
<P>
   Most likely to offend someone's sensibilities is ``Queer as
Folk,'' an American version of what might be England's most
controversial series in years. Centering on the everyday lives of
seven homosexual men and women, ``Queer as Folk'' is a mature,
randy and often explicit exploration of the gay experience.
</P>
<P>
   The original English series, which has appeared in the United
States on the BBC America cable channel, is set in Manchester. The
Showtime version moves the setting to Pittsburgh to retain the same
working-class feel. Executive producer Ron Cowen plans to be
faithful in all other aspects of the series, as well. ``We're not
tempering anything,'' he said. ``It's going to be just as explicit,
just as graphic, just as honest and just as funny as the English
series. The mandate we made ourselves was to either match the level
of honesty of that show or, hopefully, even go beyond what they
did.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though it's on premium cable, producer Tony Jonas expects
the series to raise eyebrows. ``I have to believe there's going to
be a great deal of shock because it's just something you haven't
seen,'' he said. ``What we are planning to do is something that is
frank and honest and unapologetic _ something that will be
shocking, but shockingly good.''
</P>
<P>
   Showtime also will air ``Holiday Heart,'' a television
adaptation of Cheryl L. West's play about an aging drag queen and
his fatherly relationship with the young daughter of a
drug-addicted woman. Ving Rhames and Alfre Woodard star in the
film, which pointedly asks the question: What makes a family?
</P>
<P>
   Woodard, who plays the drug-using mom, thinks the film has a
universality that will surprise. ``You don't expect to go in having
something reflect your own life in any way and actually have the
protagonist be the person that's reflecting something about you,''
she said. ``Your heart is going to be touched.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Unabashed crime junkie'' Dick Wolf, creator of ``Law &AMP;
Order,'' will syndicate a real-life version of his long-running
cops-and-courts series this fall. Brian Dennehy will host the
five-days-a-week show, titled ``Arrest &AMP; Trial'' and designed to
run in the 7 o'clock hour just before prime time. Wolf says it will
focus on actual crimes, mostly murders, starting with the police
investigation and arrest, and ending with the trial and verdict.
</P>
<P>
   Not a fan of reality shows like ``Survivor'' and ``Big
Brother,'' Wolf says ``Arrest &AMP; Trial'' appeals to him ``because it
can go on the same way `Law &AMP; Order' has gone on for years, and be
continuously interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   Judd Apatow is a reasonably happy man. Though his series
``Freaks and Geeks'' was canceled by NBC, the original 18 episodes
have found a new home at Fox Family Channel and will begin airing
in proper sequence on Aug. 29.
</P>
<P>
   No new episodes will be made, but Apatow and co-creator Paul
Feig are just happy that viewers will have the chance to see the
well-crafted paean to high school life in the '80s as they intended
it to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always assumed we would be a one-season show,'' Apatow
said, ``so we designed the show like it was an 18-hour
miniseries.'' Unfortunately, NBC aired episodes out of order and
frequently pre-empted the series, so any possibility of maintaining
continuity was out the window.
</P>
<P>
   Apatow says he's not bitter. ``If you refuse to work for anyone
who is annoying in this business,'' he said, ``you won't work.''
</P>
<P>
   But he is troubled by the current mania to find the one show _ a
la ``Who Wants To Be a Millionaire'' and ``Survivor'' _ that will
change a network's fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a terrible trend for shows like `Freaks and Geeks'
because we are never going to change television,'' Apatow said.
``In fact, I was thinking as I go in to pitch new shows for next
season that my pitch (to the networks) is: `Let me make the show
that makes you feel less dirty about the other s--- you're putting
on the air.'''

confidence just one hour before departing for what he hopes will be
successful peace talks with the Palestinians in Camp David,

   NJ-WHITMAN-PHOTO (Trenton, N.J.) _ After spending much of her
second term trying to convince the public that she is sincere in
her efforts to end racial profiling by the New Jersey State Police,
Gov. Christie Whitman is suddenly struggling with a self-inflicted
image problem: a photograph of Whitman herself grinning as she
frisks a black man in Camden during a ride-along with state
troopers in 1996. The photo, which has been subpoenaed by two
troopers who have filed a discrimination suit against the state,
was obtained by The Associated Press and distributed over the
weekend to the news media. The symbolism of the photo, and the
facts of the frisking _ the man was stopped for ``suspicious
activity'' but never found to be violating the law _ have stirred
criticism about Whitman's response to discrimination complaints
against troopers and has renewed questions about her sensitivity to
inner-city residents. By David Kocieniewski.

   GORE-MILITARY (Undated) _ A look at the military service of Al

afraid to even sign him up without calling in a supervisor, once
they heard his name and caught on that he was that anti-war Sen.
Albert Gore's son, just out of Harvard. No less than the Army's
highest-ranking officer, Gen. William Westmoreland, singled him out
during a visit to Fort Rucker, Ala., where Pvt. Gore was stationed
for more than a year. The Army chief of staff stopped in the middle
of an official farewell ceremony to pull the young man aside for a
private chat _ and kept Gore's superior officers waiting, and
watching, while he asked one of the lowest-ranking guys on base for
his thoughts on why so many young people opposed the war. Yet there
is no evidence that Gore sought special treatment, or that the
extra notice he got anyway provided any real protection. On the
contrary, within the parameters of his job as an Army journalist,
Gore probably assumed more risk than he had to, choppering around
South Vietnam interviewing soldiers who had just seen action. By

RESEARCH PREDICTS SUMMER DOOM FOR NORTHERN ICECAP 
</HEADLINE>
  (The Science Times) 
 By WALTER GIBBS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   OSLO, Norway _ The mythic icescape that stretches south in all
directions from the North Pole is melting so fast that Norwegian
scientists say it could disappear entirely each summer beginning in
just 50 years, radically altering the Earth's environment, the
global economy and the human imagination.
</P>
<P>
   Climatologists have warned for a decade that the northern ice
cap is retreating. But researchers at the University of Bergen's
Nansen Environmental and Remote Sensing Center are apparently the
first to predict the disorienting specter of a watery North Pole
open to cruise ships and the Polar Bear Swim Club within the lives
of today's young people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The changes we've seen have been much faster and more dramatic
than most people imagine,'' said Tore Furevik, 31, a polar
researcher and co-author of the article ``Toward an Ice-Free
Arctic?'' in the latest issue of the Norwegian science journal
Cicerone.
</P>
<P>
   Not all ice specialists agree with Furevik, but his 50-year
projection is supported by the director of the Bergen research
center, Professor Ola M. Johannessen, whose own study will appear
in the fall issue of Science Progress, a British journal.
</P>
<P>
   Johannessen, 61, said the pull-back and thinning of Arctic sea
ice have outstripped the theoretical effect of global warming from
greenhouse gases by a factor of three. ``The greenhouse is here, no
doubt about it, but there is more to it,'' he said, speculating
that a conjunction of long-term oscillations in North Atlantic air
pressure have exacerbated the Arctic meltdown. If so, he said, the
cycles will eventually decouple and the ice, or what's left of it,
could regain stability.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1978, the coverage of Arctic sea ice in winter has
decreased by 6 percent, an area the size of Texas, according to
satellite pictures. As for average ice thickness in late summer,
submarine sonar measurements since the 1950s have shown a decline
to 5.9 feet from 10.2 feet, or 42 percent. The Norwegian countdown
to zero ice is based partly on extrapolation of the submarine data
and partly on Johannessen's discovery last year that hard-core,
year-round ice is shrinking twice as fast as the overall winter
perimeter.
</P>
<P>
   While an ice-free Arctic Ocean would likely disrupt the global
environment, researchers said, it could have positive economic
aspects. It could shorten shipping routes, for example, and expand
the range of offshore oil drillers. Rich new fishing and
aquaculture zones would likely appear, though established fisheries
to the south could decline.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Drew Rothrock, a University of Washington oceanographer,
said he agreed that Arctic sea ice was on a trajectory to disappear
in 50 years. But, he added, that did not mean it would. He said the
ice was being expelled from the Arctic by abnormally strong winds
before it could achieve its accustomed thickness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is quite possible that in the next 10 years we will
see the winds revert to a more historical pattern, so that the ice
begins to reside longer in the Arctic and thicken up again,''
Rothrock said. ``I would be cautious about predicting doom.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the ice in a pond, Arctic sea ice consists of independent
floes of varying age that glom together, pull apart or pile up on
one another in reaction to wind and currents. In winter, it extends
as far south as Hudson Bay in Canada. By late summer it pulls back
to the roughly circular Arctic basin.
</P>
<P>
   The seeming permanence and impregnability of the northern
icescape have given it almost continental status in the human
imagination. As a mythic anchor point, the North Pole, home of
Santa Claus, has few geographic rivals. The ancient Greeks and 19th
century theosophists believed humanity originated there.
</P>
<P>
   ``The North Pole is the strongest symbol of mankind's struggle
against, and with, nature,'' said the Norwegian adventurer Boerge
Ousland, the first man to ski there alone without aerial
reprovisioning, in 1994. ``If the ice disappears, well, I just
can't imagine it.''
</P>
<P>
   The sea ice is thickest above North America, where Canadian
islands and the fingers of northern Greenland act as a sieve in the
current. As the floes stack up there, they create pressure ridges
up to 40 feet high. By contrast, a branch of the warm-water Gulf
Stream keeps Norway's north coast ice-free. That warm flow
continues under the ice along most of the northern Siberian coast.
</P>
<P>
   If the trend continues, it is there, the Eurasian Arctic, that
the first significant opening of ice-clogged water is expected.
Russia, Scandinavia and Japan are laying plans. Government
ministers and shipping executives met in Oslo last fall and
declared after six years of study that ``considerable profit
potential'' existed for a proposed shipping lane linking Western
Europe and Asia across the mellowing Arctic. The Northern Sea Route
is a centuries-old dream comparable to that of the Northwest
Passage of Canada, which is even more solidly frozen.
</P>
<P>
   Ships using the Arctic to move cargo from Hamburg to Yokohama
would save about 4,800 miles compared with today's route through
the Suez Canal. Current traffic is limited to the Russian navy and
a handful of heavily subsidized nickel ore carriers escorted by
nuclear-powered icebreakers. But receding ice could open the way
for a parade of cargo vessels and oil tankers, shipping industry
strategists said.
</P>
<P>
   A proponent of the short cut is Ivan Ivanov, leader of an Arctic
shipping demonstration project carried out by Finland's Fortum
energy company with funding from the European Commission. Citing
what he called official Russian estimates, he said the Russian
Arctic shelf contained three times the oil of Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   The vision of an industrialized Arctic Ocean scares
environmentalists, who see the dwindling of ice as a disaster. They
said the loss of white surface area would cause the Arctic to
reflect less of the sun's energy, accelerating the warm-up. On the
other hand, open water makes a better ``sink'' for absorbing
atmospheric greenhouse gases.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, according to one model, an ice-free Arctic Ocean could do
as much to slow global warming as the melting did to stimulate it.
Yet even a modest change in Arctic dynamics could have wrenching
effects elsewhere. If the Gulf Stream were diverted, Johannessen
said, much of Western Europe could be plunged into an ice age.
</P>
<P>
   One sure thing is that melting sea ice cannot be implicated in
the coastal flooding that many global warming models have
projected. Just as melting ice cubes do not cause a glass of water
to overflow, melting sea ice does not increase oceanic volume. Any
future rise in sea level would be a factor of onshore glacier melt,
of which there has been little evidence to date.
</P>
<P>
   Another sure thing is that the polar bear and other creatures
face a bleak future if their habitat keeps liquefying. So do Eskimo
populations that rely on the ice for game like seal and walrus.
Alan Springer, a wildlife specialist at the University of Alaska in
Fairbanks, said Alaska's 250,000 walruses seem to have suffered
weight loss and stress from retraction of the pack ice they need
for resting and raising pups.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sea ice in summer has been receding so far north that it
carries the walruses into very deep water, far from their optimal
feeding ground,'' Springer said.
</P>
<P>
   Furevik, the Norwegian researcher, said he could foresee
ice-dwelling mammals making ``a desperate last stand'' north of
Greenland, where he believes the final patch of Arctic sea ice will
linger before vanishing into the waves in about 2050.

 &HT;    Silicon Valley lets the chips fall where they may
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - Life in Silicon Valley may be getting a little too
tightly wound. Business Week (July 17) says the valley's
win-at-all-cost mentality is showing ``increasingly dark
implications for the Valleyite's professional and personal life.''
</P>
<P>
   A backlash against the highly competitive mentality that evolved
there is reflected in companies that would rather not locate there,
as well as burned-out executives anxious to flee the valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Silicon Valley, companies throttle and plot against each
other with remorseless glee,'' says Business Week. ``As the dot-com
meltdown of the last two months worsens, the hypercompetition is
going to get a lot feistier.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not over til it's over
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the Federal Reserve passed up a chance to raise interest
rates last month. But that doesn't mean the Fed's campaign to slow
the economy is complete, says Barron's (July 9).
</P>
<P>
   Fed Gov. Edward Gramlich said in an interview, however, that
future rate hikes can be kept to a minimum as long as American
workers become more and more productive and wage increases remain
under control.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine also notes that while the first half of the year
was downright ugly for stocks, history shows that a tough first
half typically presages ``kinder treatment in the second.``
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the last 20 years, a losing first half was followed by a
down market in the second half only once, in 1981,'' the investment
weekly says.
</P>
<P>
   Now for Act II
</P>
<P>
   Act I of the Internet revolution belonged to the dot-coms with
big visions and small bank accounts. Now, says Forbes (July 24),
it's time for Act II, which will be led by big companies that move
their operations to the Web. They are managed by the ``E Gang.''
</P>
<P>
   Among them is Delta Air Lines, led by Chief Executive Officer
Leo F. Mullin. The other E-Gang companies are General Electric,
Charles Schwab, Cisco Systems, Hewlett-Packard, Nordstrom, Lands
End, Wal-Mart, Enron, General Motors, Merck-Medco Managed Care and
DoveBid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Together, the companies. . . employ almost one million people
and have more than $400 billion in revenues. They aren't playing
for paper options or the fast flip. Their drive is to serve
customers, eliminate inefficiency and spark new growth,'' says
Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   The millionaire employee
</P>
<P>
   How do you discipline a millionaire employee? It can be a
problem, says Harvard Business Review (July/August), which notes
that ``millions of millionaire employees'' work in America's new
stock-driven economy.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is not their behavior, although they can be
``demanding, fickle, uncommitted.'' It's keeping them from leaving,
since they don't have to work. In the end, the business quarterly
says, this may be the best thing that has happened to American
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Millionaires force companies to be far more creative than ever
about their products and services _ how else to keep the work
interesting,'' the Harvard Business Review says.

   OUTREACH TO CRITICAL AUDIENCE
</P>
<P>
   Death penalty protesters interrupted an introduction for George
W. Bush on Monday at the NAACP national convention in Baltimore,
with one shouting, ``An innocent man was murdered by Governor
Bush.'' Security forces led the four or five protesters out after
they waved signs with pictures of Gary Graham, who was executed
June 22 in Texas. In his speech, Bush appeared to acknowledge the
protesters, saying, ``For those of you who support me _ I see a
couple here, maybe more than a couple _ I hope you will not change
your opinion. For those of you who don't, I hope you ... give me
the chance to tell what is in my heart.'' He added that he
recognizes that ``the party of Lincoln has not always carried the
mantle of Lincoln.''
</P>
<P>
   ENVIROS GO AFTER GORE
</P>
<P>
   Environmental demonstrators chained themselves together in front
of the entrance to Al Gore's campaign office in Knoxville, Tenn.,
today and hung protest banners on the building. Gore promotes
himself as a friend of the environment and is author of ``Earth in
the Balance.'' But the protesters said they saw little difference
between him and George W. Bush. About 100 members of the group
Earth First! danced and chanted in the foyer of the campaign
offices _ 160 miles east of Gore's national headquarters in
Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   ENDURING STAR POWER
</P>
<P>
   With George W. Bush's unusual decision to arrive at the
convention later in the week, John McCain will be in the spotlight
for the first few days. McCain will pull in to Philadelphia on July
29, packed with many of the same journalists who covered his
insurgent campaign. His schedule includes time with just about
every media outlet from major networks to MTV to Comedy Central. A
spokesman says he plans to use the convention as a ``bully pulpit''
for his favorite issue, campaign finance reform. And if you somehow
miss him, wife Cindy has agreed to carry a minicam for ABC's ``Good
Morning America.''
</P>
<P>
   TAX CUTS ON RADAR SCREEN
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore, in a twist on Harry Truman's winning campaign slogan,
says he will spend this week running against the
``do-nothing-for-people Congress'' and its ally George W. Bush.
Gore also for the first time offered unequivocal support for
President Clinton's proposed legislative swap in which Democrats
would accept the Republicans' bill to reduce taxes for most married
couples in return for passage of their party's Medicare
prescription drug plan. Just a couple of weeks ago, Gore doubled
his proposal to $500 billion over 10 years, closer to the $1.3
trillion plan offered by Bush.
</P>
<P>
   CAMPAIGN LIMITS HARD TO SETTLE
</P>
<P>
   Twelve years after California voters first approved caps on
campaign contributions, reform proponents and politicians are still
arguing over how high to set those limits. A federal court judge is
scheduled Tuesday to consider once again whether limits set by
Proposition 208, imposed by voters in 1996, unconstitutionally bars
candidates from conducting effective campaigns. A bill signed by
Gov. Gray Davis last week will take the issue to voters again in
November, this time in a measure to approve higher campaign
contributions than those imposed by Proposition 208.
</P>
<P>
   BUCHANAN FOE BOUNCED
</P>
<P>
   Pat Buchanan's campaign has forced the removal of Russell Verney
as chairman of the Reform Party's convention credentials committee
in an effort to prevent allies of Ross Perot from blocking
Buchanan's nomination as the party's presidential candidate.
Verney, who headed the party during the 1996 Perot campaign and was
one of the driving forces in the party's founding, ``basically
decided to spearhead the anti-Buchanan efforts,'' said Angela
``Bay'' Buchanan, the candidate's sister and senior adviser. She
said Verney had encouraged as many as 25 challenges from state
delegations to the August convention in a tactic designed to turn
the nominating process into ``chaos.''
</P>
<P>
   DESPITE FEC, FULL STEAM AHEAD
</P>
<P>
   House Republican campaign officials are preparing to defy the
Federal Election Commission and inject huge amounts of party money
into key congressional races this fall without waiting for a
Supreme Court appeal that will determine whether the practice is
legal. Federal law now limits national parties to direct
expenditures of no more than $33,780 in House races and restricts
the kinds of ads they may run. Last month, the FEC issued an
unusually stern warning to the political parties that it would seek
retroactive fines if they ignored the federal spending limit while
the case is on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   GORE'S CONVENTION
</P>
<P>
   Howard Wolfson, spokesman for Hillary Clinton's Senate campaign,
denied there was tension between her camp and Al Gore's about her
role in the Democratic convention next month. Asked if there was
friction, Wolfson said: ``Not at all.'' He also said, ``It's the
vice president's convention, and we're going to do everything we
can to make sure it goes as well as possible for him, and that's
our goal.''
</P>
<P>
   ARSENIC AND OLD STANDARDS
</P>
<P>
   The Sierra Club wants several House members to pay a political
price for blocking rules that would update the standard for arsenic
levels in drinking water. The standard is currently set on data
collected in 1942. The organization is running ads for at least a
week in the districts of Reps. Marion Berry (D-Ark.), Jay Dickey
(R-Ark.), Robin Hayes (R-N.C.), Anne Northup (R-Ky.), E. Clay Shaw
(R-Fla.), Tom Tancredo (R-Colo.) and Charles Taylor (R-N.C.),
criticizing them for the vote.

   Outgoing Commerce Secretary William Daley is taking three of his
top aides when he heads to Nashville in a few days to take over Al
Gore's presidential Gore campaign: his chief of staff, David Lane;
executive assistant Shirley Rothlisberger; and Graham Streett, his
deputy chief of staff and troubleshooter. And Daley is eyeing some
other veteran Gore staffers to see if they'll make the move to
Music City, according to the Wasup at the Penn State Conference
Center in University Park, Pa., for meetings about such topics as
farm conservation and transforming state government.

   California Gov. Gray Davis said he'd turn Al Gore down if he's
asked to be his running mate. ``I would say no,'' Davis said,
adding that his answer would not change, even if Gore said the
party and country needed him on the ticket. ``I still believe the
best thing I could for the country is to elect Al Gore and the best
way to elect Al Gore is to carry California and remain his chief

U.S. IMPOSES CURFEW AND ALCOHOL BAN ON MILITARY ON OKINAWA 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ In a concession to local concerns about the behavior of
American soldiers stationed in Okinawa, the U.S. military has
indefinitely banned the drinking of alcoholic beverages between
midnight and 5 a.m. and prohibited its personnel from leaving their
bases during those hours.
</P>
<P>
   The curfew was imposed after a hit-and-run accident involving a
staff sergeant stationed at the U.S. Air Force's Kadena Air Base
early Sunday morning. A pedestrian was injured in the accident and
the sergeant was later caught. The authorities investigating the
accident said it appeared that alcohol was involved.
</P>
<P>
   This latest incident follows an apology from the highest-ranking
U.S. military official in Okinawa after a Marine was arrested last
week for allegedly entering a house and molesting a 14-year-old
girl in her bed while she was sleeping.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal of this policy is to enhance discipline among service
members and prevent the recurrence of liberty incidents,'' the
military said in a statement Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese officials have asked the military to take steps to
address the problem of crimes committed by its servicemen, an issue
that has long bedeviled relations between local residents and the
government of the prefecture and between the prefecture and the
central government. ``The fact that another incident of this sort
has occurred at a time when we were already seeking tighter
official discipline is regrettable,'' said the chief cabinet
secretary, Hidenao Nakagawa, during a regularly scheduled news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   The two most recent alleged crimes occurred at a particularly
sensitive time for the Japanese government, which is doing its
utmost to ensure that the Group of 7 summit meeting of world
leaders scheduled for July 21-23 in Okinawa will come off without a
hitch.
</P>
<P>
   Police forces around the country have been staging drills in
preparation for any trouble that might occur, and the national
government has been working feverishly to end a dispute with the
U.S. trade representative over charges imposed by the dominant
telephone carrier.
</P>
<P>
   The incidents have also embarrassed the United States. President
Clinton's participation in the summit meeting will be the first
visit by an American president since the United States returned
Okinawa to Japan in 1972. Last week, Japan was treated to the sight
of Lt. Gen. Earl B. Hailston of the U.S. Marine Corps, the
highest-ranking American officer here, bowing deeply to the
prefecture's governor in a striking display of contrition.
</P>
<P>
   About 26,000 of the 48,000 American military personnel in Japan
are stationed in Okinawa, 1,000 southeast of Tokyo, and residents
of the island have long complained that they are unfairly burdened
with the social and economic costs of the U.S. presence.

&HT;     HOORAY FOR HARRY 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARIANNE MEANS  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Silence descended upon much of America this
weekend. It was the sound of millions of children _ and adults _
reading a book.
</P>
<P>
   It was a very special book, to be sure, but a book full of all
those printed words that are supposedly doomed to obsolescence in
the modern tech-world.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth installment in the seven-part Harry Potter series is
magically living up to its high expectations, both in the literary
and commercial sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,'' delivered promptly to
my door Saturday from Amazon.com via FedEx, just as promised, has
already virtually sold out its first printing of 3.8 million copies
in this country. The American publisher, Scholastic, hastily
ordered the printing of another 2 million copies.
</P>
<P>
   And it is great reading. J.K. Rowling, the author, is a gifted
story-teller who cleverly mixes wondrous whimsy and dramatic, scary
adventure. Her newest book is both familiar and fresh, in which our
hero and his buddies return to the customary oddities at Hogwarts
School for Witchcraft and Wizardry.
</P>
<P>
   But they also confront new magical creatures like the Merpeople
(mermaids plus mermen), new spells like the Jolly-Legs Jinx, nasty
new villains like the Death Eaters and new, tougher mental and
physical challenges. They read advanced magic texts like ``Madcap
Magic for Wacky Warlocks''' and learn to handle skrewts, nifflers
and potions of armadillo bile and mashed scarab beetles.
</P>
<P>
   Harry, 14, is now in his fourth year in training to be a wizard
and evolving nicely from the frightened, naive orphan of the first
book into a confident teen-ager ready to take on what life throws
him. And it throws him a lot.
</P>
<P>
   His story is already a classic in the making _ it appeals across
generational lines with imaginative concepts, beautiful writing and
a timeless moral message.
</P>
<P>
   Children can identify with Potter, who is described wryly as
having ``a knack for attracting a lot of trouble.'' His travails
range from the scorn of classmates who sometimes resent his fame
and don't believe him, to near-death at the hands of evil Lord
Voldemort, the most powerful dark wizard in a century.
</P>
<P>
   Adults can identify with him too. The Ministry of Magic, the
wizards' governing body, could move to Washington any day and be
right at home.
</P>
<P>
   His mentor, Hogwarts headmaster Albus Dumbledore, the most
powerful good wizard of his time, is frustrated by stupid ministry
bureaucrats who refuse to accept the growing danger posed by
Voldemort.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the ministry is preoccupied with such vital tasks as
standardizing the thickness of cauldrons to reduce the number of
leakages. And when magic goes awry, as it sometimes does, the
ministry sends out its version of spin doctors, called the
Accidental Magic Reversal Squad.
</P>
<P>
   A nasty reporter, a sneaky witch who writes puff pieces about
the wizards she likes and rotten stuff about those she doesn't,
complicates this scene. Ah, our kind is everywhere. Guess which
bespectacled 14-year-old she doesn't like?
</P>
<P>
   Conservative religious leaders complain that the Potter books
advocate witchcraft and some school districts have denied children
the freedom to read them. This is outrageous nonsense; the
continuing theme here is the conflict between good and evil, the
importance of fair play and standing up to evil and the triumph (so
far, barely) of good.
</P>
<P>
   Harry's adventures this time are even more hair-raising than
before, and expand the cast of characters from England throughout
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Hogwarts hosts a Triwizard Tournament, in which the school
competes against Beauxbatons and Durmstrang, rival wizard schools
based somewhere in or near France and Bulgaria. The Goblet of Fire
unexpectedly picks Harry to compete against the foreign teams'
champions in three tasks, which involve outwitting horrible
monsters and similar magical monkey business.
</P>
<P>
   Harry is both clever and brave, although not always efficient.
</P>
<P>
   But the last task has been booby-trapped by Voldemort and is
nearly Harry's undoing. The conclusion is complicated and
breath-taking in the audacity of its repeated surprises; my lips
are sealed so that readers may discover the exciting details for
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Rowling has said that this book, expanding Harry's horizon
beyond England throughout Europe and resurrecting Voldemort to his
full powers, lays the foundation for the next three books. She is
heading her wizards into a terrible global confrontation that will
determine whether the secret masters of magic exist to terrorize
the world's muggles (nonwizards like us) or to help them.
</P>
<P>
   Her last chapter is titled, ``The Beginning,'' signaling the
mortal struggle ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Harry will be at the center of it all. He can't help it. It is
his destiny, as invented by Rowling and cheered on by us.
</P>
<P>
   ``It matters not what someone is born but what they grow to
be,'' Dumbledore observes wisely.
</P>
<P>
   What a book. Move over, ``Mary Poppins,'' ``Alice in
Wonderland,'' ``Wind In the Willows,'' ``Wizard of Oz,'' ``Peter
Pan,'' ``Winnie the Pooh.''
</P>
<P>
   You've got worthy company.

 &HT;    Debate still rages over ballplayers in different eras
 &HT;    By Tim Tucker
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA He was a Detroit Tigers batboy 75 years ago. He is an
avid Atlanta Braves fan today. And so we turn to Jimmy Lanier _
``Jimmy my boy,'' family friend Ty Cobb always called him _ for
perspective on baseball's perpetual debate:
</P>
<P>
   Are ballplayers today as good as _ better than? _ they used to
be?
</P>
<P>
   Or were they better, after all, in the good old days?
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly think about that all the time,'' the 85-year-old
Lanier said.
</P>
<P>
   He thinks about the profound differences between eras _ the
differences in equipment, facilities, training, travel, everything.
He notes, unapprovingly, that players sit out more games with
injuries these days. He considers, with regret, the escalation of
relief pitching and the demise of the complete game. He remembers,
vividly, the game as it was played 7 1/2 decades ago, when he was a
Tigers batboy in 1925-26, and every decade since.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one thing I've been blessed with _ a good memory,'' he
said. ``I can see the Detroit team of 1925 come right out on the
field today, as if it's in front of me. I can see Johnny Bassler
behind the plate, Lu Blue on first, Frank O'Rourke on second,
Jackie Tavener at shortstop, Fred Haney on third.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can see the finest outfield in the American League _ Mr.
Cobb, Harry Heilmann, Heinie Manush. And I can see me wearing Mr.
Haney's old uniform, which they gave me because he was the smallest
player on the team. It was big and baggy on me, although my mother
had tried to cut it down.''
</P>
<P>
   Fast-forward 75 years, and Lanier's view of the 2000 Braves,
whom he regularly watches on television, is just as clear: ``I
think they have a great team; I think they can win it all if they
get some of their pitchers going.''
</P>
<P>
   Bridging baseball's eras, Lanier _ a retired sales manager who
has lived in Atlanta for nearly 50 years _ draws upon what he saw
as a pre-teen batboy and what he has seen as a fan ever since to
offer his verdict on the game's perpetual debate:
</P>
<P>
   ``All these young stars today are so wonderful, and the playing
conditions are so much better now. But the players in Mr. Cobb's
day had all the abilities they have now, all of the same basic
abilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if you would take the 2000 Braves and put them in
Detroit in 1925, with all the conditions of that day, and if you
would take the 1925 Tigers and switch them over to today's
equipment and conditions, there wouldn't be much difference
(between the teams), in my opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   There you have it.
</P>
<P>
   But, alas, there is no final word on this subject.
</P>
<P>
   There never will be.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could argue these points day in and day out for the next
20 years,'' Hall of Fame pitcher Phil Niekro, 61, said, ``and I
don't know if anyone is going to come up with the correct answer.''
</P>
<P>
   From Hank Aaron, 66, the very topic elicits a knowing chuckle.
``This is the talk in every era,'' he said. ``When I was chasing
Babe's record, that's all I heard _ the difference between the
eras.''
</P>
<P>
   And so it continues, that fun and futile question of how today's
best players rank against yesterday's, that fun and futile question
of how to reconcile the irreconcilable differences of time. How
does Randy Johnson stack up with Sandy Koufax? Mark McGwire with
Aaron? Ken Griffey Jr. with Joe DiMaggio? This generation of stars,
collectively, with other generations?
</P>
<P>
   The argument that today's players are better than any previous
era's players almost always starts this way: Athletes are bigger,
faster, stronger, better-conditioned in all sports, and baseball
surely is no exception.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not one of those guys who says, `They don't play it like
they used to,' '' said 76-year-old Ernie Johnson, the retired
Braves broadcaster and former big-league pitcher. ``I think
everyone is getting better in all sports.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys are better athleteregimens. Some former players
envy the weight rooms and the personal trainers; some wonder about
the influence and danger of muscle-building drugs and supplements.
</P>
<P>
   Niekro recalls the extent of his offseason conditioning program:
``Show up at the ballpark a couple of weeks before spring training
and play some Ping-Pong.'' Aaron notes that one hurdle to
year-round conditioning in previous eras was economics: ``Hell, I
remember four or five years in a row, maybe longer, that as soon as
the season was over, I had to get a job. Now, as soon as the season
is over, players might take a scenic cruise somewhere, then get
back to lifting weights.''
</P>
<P>
   Bigger. Stronger. More athletic. No arguments so far.
</P>
<P>
   The argument that today's players are not as good as another
generation's players usually starts with the distinction between
being a great aas good as it used to be,' '' Rawlings said. ``But
my reading of history is . . . it seems every generation says that.
I just think that's silly.''
</P>
<P>
   On ESPN.com, senior writer Rob Neyer recently compared Bonds _
TSN's No. 34, SABR's No. 65 _ with Ted Williams and Stan Musial,
offensively and defensively, and concluded: ``Is Barry Bonds the
greatest left fielder who ever lived? I would argue that if he's
not now, by the time his career is over, he will be.''
</P>
<P>
   In a book published last year, ``Baseball's All-Time Best
Hitters,'' Michael Schell deduced that the greatest hitter ever is
not Williams or Cobb or Ruth but an active player _ Tony Gwynn.
</P>
<P>
   Feel free, of course, to disagree.
</P>
<P>
   One thing that will not settle these arguments is raw
statistics; they only intensify the debate. Clearly, a 40-home run
season is not nearly the feat now that it was 20 years ago, and a
60-home run season is not nearly the feat now that it was in 1927,
when Babe Ruth hit more homers than any other American League team.
Conversely, a 3.00 ERA is much more impressive now than in 1968,
when the major-league average was 2.99. It is all relative.
</P>
<P>
   And yet the attempt to compare eras is irresistible.
</P>
<P>
   It seems apparent that the few great pitchers of this era would
have been even better in eras when the parks were bigger, the ball
less lively, the hitters less juiced and the mound higher. Of
course, they would have had to learn to go nine innings.
</P>
<P>
   It seems apparent, too, that the great hitters of past eras
would have been even better in this one, facing expansion-diluted
pitching staffs in a hitter-friendly environment. Of course, they
would have had to face setup men and closers, rather than the
starting pitcher four times a game.
</P>
<P>
   It seems apparent that there are more great defensive plays than
ever before, or does it just seem that way because we see all of
them on ``SportsCenter'' and ``Baseball Tonight''?
</P>
<P>
   Truth is, it is getting harder to wage baseball's perpetual
debate.
</P>
<P>
   Hall of Fame pitcher Jim Palmer, 54, noting the unprecedented
level of offense in today's game, said: ``Roger Kahn wrote in
``Boys of Summer'' that what's great about baseball is you can
always compare one generation to another. I don't really think you
can anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   We'll keep trying, of course.
</P>
<P>
   And it can be confusing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today,'' Jimmy Lanier said, ``even the batboys look like
ballplayers.''

WRITER TRIES TO BUCK THE TRENDS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GLENN WHIPP 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thirty-year-old screenwriter Mike White never lacked for work
after graduating from Wesleyan University in Connecticut, but the
jobs he managed to secure weren't exactly what he had in mind. One
was a ``Die Hard'' spin-off for Roseanne where she saved the world
from mall-mauling terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   He also wrote the MTV/Paramount teen comedy ``Dead Man on
Campus,'' a movie he doesn't like much since he was kicked off the
set after the first day for giving the director too many
suggestions.
</P>
<P>
   White then spent two years as a supervising producer for
television's ``Dawson's Creek,'' writing nine episodes. The pay was
good, but he hated his work. Any time he tried to give one of the
show's characters the tiniest quirk or imperfection, he'd be
overruled. Ambivalence was a no-no. Each ambiguous note needed to
be ironed out before the episode ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so frustrating,'' the Pasadena-born White says. ``It
made me just want to write a character that no one wanted to be and
have that be the centerpiece of a story, a really ambiguous story
with a really ambivalent character. I just wanted to make some
mischief.''
</P>
<P>
   White has done just that with ``Chuck and Buck,'' a dark,
heartfelt buddy movie that subverts traditional film conventions
about obsession, growing up and man-child characters. The movie,
directed by Miguel Arteta (``Star Maps''), also flouts standard
practice in its cast, which is dominated by behind-the-scenes
talent. Among those involved: Chris and Paul Weitz, who directed
``American Pie'' and wrote ``Antz'' and the upcoming ``Nutty
Professor II: The Klumps,'' as well as talent manager Beth Colt and
White himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chuck and Buck'' premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in
January and was snapped up immediately by Artisan Entertainment.
White plays Buck, a strange childlike man who, after the death of
his mother, becomes fixated on his boyhood buddy, Chuck (Chris
Weitz). Buck has never moved past the day when Chuck moved away,
while Chuck, in the intervening 16 years, has become a successful
record executive with a beautiful house, car and fiancee. When
their worlds collide, both Chuck and Buck must confront their
respective _ and very different _ memories of their boyhood
friendship.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a movie about unlikely heroes,'' director Arteta says.
``I think Mike was in some kind of rebellion when he wrote it, kind
of like Alan Ball, another television writer, was when he wrote
`American Beauty.' Here, Mike has busted out and written about this
needy man-child and made a hero out of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Since White dresses like Buck (he has a closet full of striped
T-shirts straight out of ``The Brady Bunch'') and possesses a
similar impish personality, most people who see the movie assume
White is Buck. Or at least Buck minus a few of the more serious
neuroses. (``I'm a quirky guy; I can't hide,'' White says.)
</P>
<P>
   But given the level of his success, White is probably much
closer to the prosperous Chuck. After working as a supervising
producer on the acclaimed, lamentably canceled NBC series ``Freaks
and Geeks,'' White is currently writing two television pilots for
Brillstein-Grey, as well as feature scripts for MTV Films, director
Tim Burton and Adam Sandler.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many respects, Chuck is me, the guy trying to keep up
appearances and be the successful person,'' White says. ``And all
the while, I'm thinking, `Wait, there's this twisted side of
myself, both creatively and personally, that needs to be
acknowledged.'''
</P>
<P>
   Enter ``Chuck and Buck.'' Although aspects of the movie sound
like typical indie-film fare, the movie gently defies any attempt
at categorization. The likable, sympathetic Buck is a stalker, but
he doesn't carry a gun and, as White notes, ``He doesn't get thrown
out of an attic window and impaled on a stake below at the end of
the movie.'' The movie even has a happy ending, albeit (of course)
an ambivalent one.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest twist in the movie is its hopeful spirit,'' Chris
Weitz says. ``You have the feeling at the end that everybody is
going to be OK, which flies in the face of indie cool.''
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean the movie is without some disturbing moments.
Buck's peculiar sexuality is unmistakable here; he isn't a neutered
man-child like cinematic predecessors Forrest Gump and Dustin
Hoffman's Raymond Babbitt in ``Rain Man.'' Neither is he an idiot
savant. He writes a play, and it stinks. He also does some
inappropriate things and behaves at times in _ yes _ a very
ambiguous manner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buck is a real person with all the inherent imperfections,''
Arteta says. ``He's not sanitized and safe like Forrest Gump.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds White: ``Really, I just wanted to call a spade a spade.
Look at a black comedy like 'The Cable Guy,' which is like the most
homoerotic comedy of all time. But movies like that never get
around the hinting and playing with the undertones. I wanted to
take those undertones and put them front and center.''
</P>
<P>
   And in doing so, White ended up putting himself front and center
when Arteta cast him in the role. White, who acted at Wesleyan,
always hoped to play Buck, and Arteta supported the notion, even
when it meant that the movie might not receive financing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could have made this film a lot faster and for a lot more
money if we had cast famous actors,'' Arteta says. ``Investors
wanted somebody like Jon Favreau. We entertained that for a short
time but felt the story should be the star.''
</P>
<P>
   So Arteta, following the advice of directing idol Sam Fuller
(``I can still see his cigar coming toward my face,'' Arteta says),
cast on hunches, signing up friends like the Weitz brothers and
veteran Latina actress Lupe Ontiveros. When White heard that Arteta
was casting non-professional actors, he called the director and
asked why he hadn't been given the part yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Mike was wondering what the hell Miguel was thinking
when he heard that he put Chris and I in the movie,'' says Paul
Weitz, who plays an amateur actor and Chuck look-alike in the
movie. ``And I understand that. If I had written this movie, I
would have been kicking and screaming.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe me, I was,'' White says, hearing Weitz's comments.
``It would have been one thing to pass me over because Joaquin
Phoenix wanted the part, but if those guys were going to be in the
movie, then there was no reason for me to balk at the challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like I have this burning desire to act,'' White
continues, ``but after putting my heart into this movie, it was
just hard to let it go. I wanted to be part of the process. And
playing Buck, the central character, I knew I could have a hand in
the tone of the movie. So if it succeeded or failed, it would be as
much on me as anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   But White has found he got more than he bargained for. Playing
Buck has made him the lightning rod for people's reactions to the
film _ both positive and negative. People want to ask him
questions, take issue with characters' actions or simply tell him
their life story. White found this out the hard way after ``Chuck
and Buck'' screened at Sundance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember walking into the theater that first night and it
was packed with my peers and people I knew, and my father _ who's a
minister _ was there,'' White says. ``And I was thinking, `What
have I done? This movie is too mischievous. People are going to
realize I'm insane.'
</P>
<P>
   ``So I lasted about 45 minutes; then I ran into the street. And
it was snow and cold and I don't smoke, but I found a cigarette. I
had this parka pulled over my head, so I was anonymous, and when
people came out of the theater, there were these guys who had all
these issues with the movie. And I thought, 'This is where it
begins. My life is never going to be the same.'''
</P>
<P>
   And his father's reaction?
</P>
<P>
   ``He liked it,'' White says. ``He's a big cheerleader. But he
did wonder why I had to play such a strange character. He said,
'Here's your chance to be Robert Redford and instead you play this
bizarre man. You blew it.''' &QL;

 By ANDREW C. REVKIN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Stephen Wikel pulled a little gauze-topped glass jar from a
warm, damp incubator in his laboratory, and, with the heat from his
palm and a puff of exhaled breath, roused the tiny blood-sucking
creatures inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the beasts,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bristly brown dots, each the size of a poppy seed, began to mill
across the gauze, excited by the heat and gust of carbon dioxide
that signaled the presence of a possible meal ticket on the other
side.
</P>
<P>
   One dot was immobilized on some cellophane tape and placed under
a microscope, revealing just a few of the myriad tools that enable
Ixodes scapularis, the deer tick and the main carrier of Lyme
disease, to detect, climb aboard and surreptitiously dine on a
host.
</P>
<P>
   It is this diminutive eight-legged arachnid, a cousin of
spiders, that has taken the carefree pleasure out of a summertime
walk in the woods for millions of people in the Northeast. Other
Ixodes species are spreading Lyme disease on the West Coast and in
parts of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Lyme disease, although not known to be fatal, can cause
lingering stiffness, pain, and sometimes heart trouble if not
promptly treated with antibiotics. It has affected the public
consciousness far more than the relatively small number of cases _
14,621 last year, mainly in the Northeast and Middle West _ might
seem to warrant, mainly because it has infused anxiety into
enjoyment of the outdoors. And those concerns have largely prompted
the recent wave of scrutiny of the life and habits of the deer
tick.
</P>
<P>
   The visible features of the tick are impressive, including
forearm hooks that snag fur or fabric on a passing target, a pair
of cutting mouth parts _ like scissor blades with the sharp edge
outward _ and a serrated tube that serves both as an anchor and a
drinking straw. Ticks are the ``Inspector Gadget'' of parasites.
</P>
<P>
   But it is the tick's invisible armamentarium, dozens of
elaborate chemical weapons in its saliva, that have become the
prime focus of Wikel, an entomologist at the University of
Connecticut Health Center, which sits on a hilltop near Hartford
overlooking wooded suburban yards that are prime tick habitat.
</P>
<P>
   He and other experts in tick biology have found that the
seemingly primitive parasites use an array of sophisticated
chemical strategies to subvert a host's immune defenses, to prevent
blood from clotting, and to muffle any itch or pain that might
elicit scratching that could dislodge a tick and ruin a vital blood
meal.
</P>
<P>
   Ticks, which spend their lives stealthily avoiding detection,
are beginning to give up some of their secrets.
</P>
<P>
   A central goal of the scientists is to develop a vaccine from
some of the molecules pumped into a host when a tick bites, thereby
turning its own weapons against it.
</P>
<P>
   A vaccine that deters the Ixodes tick, Wikel and other tick
experts say, could prove more useful than the existing vaccine for
Lyme disease, which only attacks the bacteria transmitted by the
tick, not the tick itself.
</P>
<P>
   Recent research has shown that deer ticks carry at least two
other diseases besides Lyme _ human granulocytic ehrlichiosis and
babesiosis. So an ``anti-tick'' vaccine, Wikel said, could
essentially be ``a three-in-one'' vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   Some preliminary work has shown that the strategy can be
effective, and one anti-tick vaccine is being used against a
different species that infests cattle in Australia _ sometimes with
up to 20,000 ticks on a single host.
</P>
<P>
   But it will be years before scientists clearly identify the
structure and purpose of the soup of molecules in tick spit, Wikel
said, and years more before there is a marketable human vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, other scientists are finding that tick saliva
is fertile territory for seeking potential new drugs, especially
for controlling clotting and inflammation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ticks know everything we know and don't know about
pharmacology,'' said Dr. Jose Ribeiro, a tick expert at the
parasitology laboratory of the National Institutes of Health in
Bethesda, Md.
</P>
<P>
   Ribeiro, Wikel and others studying ticks have practical ends in
mind, but almost all of these scientists say they were drawn to
these persistent pests mainly by their complex, often astonishing,
abilities. ``Biologically, a tick is a box inside a box inside a
box,'' Ribeiro said.
</P>
<P>
   Another tick expert, Dr. James Keirans, recalled his wonderment
30 years ago when he was based in western Montana and hiked paths
leading into the Rockies in the spring, when adult dog ticks
emerge.
</P>
<P>
   There, when you crouch down with the light behind you, he said,
``you can see the ticks up on the grass blades, just sitting there
attached by their third pair of legs. You can take off your hat and
pass a shadow over them and see 60 or 70 ticks at once moving their
legs.''
</P>
<P>
   There are about 840 tick species, divided into two families,
those with leathery bodies like the dog and deer tick _ which have
three life stages and take only one big, momentous meal during each
stage _ and others with soft bodies, which behave more like fleas,
feeding repeatedly and often.
</P>
<P>
   Ticks feed on just about every kind of back-boned animal except
fish, said Keirans, the curator of the National Tick Collection,
which is owned by the Smithsonian Institution but is located at
Georgia Southern University in Statesboro, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   He rattled off a few examples, including ticks that hopscotch
continents on migrating seabirds, specialized ticks that may soon
become extinct as the rhinoceroses on which they feed dwindle, even
ticks that only feed on the Galapagos tortoise. The largest is a
tick that feeds only on sloths in the American tropics. When fully
engorged, he said, it is the size of a Ping-Pong ball.
</P>
<P>
   There is some debate, but many biologists say that ticks
probably evolved more than 300 million years ago, possibly feeding
on dinosaurs and amphibians.
</P>
<P>
   ``For them, the mass extinction of dinosaurs just meant a menu
change,'' said Ribeiro. A new target, the mammal, had a new feature
in its blood, platelets, which aid clotting and would have thrown a
roadblock at ticks. But, Ribeiro said, evolution carried on and
ticks _ in the endless spy-versus-spy game of life _ developed ways
to keep the blood flowing.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The hard-bodied ticks have been the focus of most research in
North America because they are the predominant carrier here of
diseases that affect people and their livestock and pets.
(Wildlife, of course, is not immune. Biologists have documented the
presence in northern forests of ``ghost moose'' _ moose that have
as many as 400,000 ticks feeding on them and that lose all their
hair as they rub hopelessly against trees.)
</P>
<P>
   In its life cycle and habits, the deer tick is typical of many
species, said Dr. Daniel Sonenshine, a biology professor at Old
Dominion University in Norfolk, Va., and author of the two-volume
``Biology of Ticks'' (Oxford University Press, 1991 and 1993). A
tick's prime goal is to find an appropriate host, climb aboard,
find the ideal spot to latch on, and to dine on red blood cells,
the source of the globin molecules needed to molt and mature and,
in the end, for females to make and lay eggs.
</P>
<P>
   In each stage of life _ larva, nymph and adult _ the process of
finding and feeding on a host is almost exactly the same. Only the
targets change. The larvae almost always feed on mice, while the
adult deer tick, which is big enough that it tends to be detected
by a person and brushed or plucked off, targets mainly deer.
</P>
<P>
   For deer ticks, the nymph stage _ the stage milling around in
Wikel's jar _ is the main transmitter of disease to people, with
its peak of activity coming from late spring to late summer.
</P>
<P>
   A nymph's day generally starts in a moist, protected place,
typically buried in leaf litter and only rarely out in the middle
of a mowed lawn. Without adequate moisture it can quickly dry out
and die.
</P>
<P>
   As the hours pass, it begins to ``quest,'' in the parlance of
tick biology, climbing instinctively in the opposite direction of
gravity, usually up a blade of grass or a twig, and generally no
more than a foot or two off the ground.
</P>
<P>
   It sits poised, waiting. In this posture, resumed daily, the
tick is like a land mine, primed and ready and patient as can be,
with weeks or even months passing before a potential target comes
along. Most, Keirans said, never find a meal.
</P>
<P>
   But enough do. They detect a rustling vibration and a whiff of
carbon dioxide and maybe a slight sensation of warmth. A shadow
passes, triggering nerves attuned to changes in light. Holding onto
the perch with that third pair of legs, they wave the rest of their
appendages. Especially active are the forearms, which contain a
sensory organ that is exquisitely tuned to sense chemical changes.
</P>
<P>
   The legs are tipped with sharp hooks. The lucky ones snag a
ride.
</P>
<P>
   But, Sonenshine said, for the tick, the job has only just begun.
</P>
<P>
   It begins to explore the host, he said, generally moving up
against gravity until it either reaches an obstruction _ the
elastic of underpants or a tight shirt collar _ or until it finds
an ideal feeding spot, a place exuding sweat and warmth, indicating
an ample blood supply.
</P>
<P>
   The sensory tools that led it to this place are now disregarded
and it relies on its palps, paired arms next to its cutting mouth
parts, to select an ideal dining spot.
</P>
<P>
   Once there, ticks do not bite like a horsefly or use a syringe
like a mosquito. Unlike these insects, which eat and run, ticks
have taken an evolutionary path requiring them to settle in for the
long haul.
</P>
<P>
   Ticks dig a well.
</P>
<P>
   Using their serrated mouth parts, they excavate a pool beneath
the host's skin from which they draw sustenance using the
hypostome, a straw-like tube that resembles a drywall anchor and
holds the animal almost as effectively.
</P>
<P>
   A tough, rubbery cement is released, helping hold the tick in
place.
</P>
<P>
   The meal unfolds over up to five or even seven days, which is
why people are generally not apt to acquire Lyme disease from a
tick bite if the offender is removed within a couple of days of
attachment, researchers say.
</P>
<P>
   The tick sips tentatively at first, while steadily pumping into
the wound saliva that carries ingredients that help it stay
attached, avoid detection, suppress the immune system and keep
blood flowing.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a pool brimming with just what the tick wants, red
blood cells. The white blood cells that would normally flood a
wound have been tricked to stay away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ticks are very finicky, like one of those brats who will only
eat cookies,'' said Sonenshine. ``The tick has this choice of all
these wonderful things _ a big cafeteria of cells, muscle, other
tissue. But it says no thanks. Just give me red blood cells.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there comes what tick biologists call ``the big sip,''
a binge of feeding reserved until the end so there is the least
risk that the now rapidly growing parasite will be detected. As it
ingests blood, it has to expel water, and it does so through its
saliva, accelerating the passage of any hitchhiking Lyme bacteria
into the host.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers stress that old methods for removing a tick _ like
touching it with a burned match or daubing with alcohol _ probably
cause it to expel even more spit into the wound. The best approach,
they say, is to use steady pressure with tweezers to draw the tick
away from the skin until it pulls free.
</P>
<P>
   As the meal comes to a close, the tick grows sometimes a
hundredfold in weight before finally dropping from the host and
crawling into leaf litter and _ in the case of adult females _
laying thousands of eggs and starting the cycle all over again.
</P>
<P>
   Ribeiro has spent more than a decade hunting in tick saliva for
all the hidden molecules used during feeding. A few have been
identified by him or other researchers:
</P>
<P>
   _Apyrase, an enzyme that destroys substances released by injured
cells that would normally cause platelets and white blood cells to
accumulate.
</P>
<P>
   _Prostaglandin E2 , which suppresses some immune defenses and
dilates capillaries, increasing blood flow.
</P>
<P>
   _Kininase, an enzyme that blocks several molecules that create
the itch sensation and swelling when skin is injured.
</P>
<P>
   And there are probably dozens more, Ribeiro, Wikel and other
researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, it appears that the infections transmitted by
ticks take advantage of the conditions created by this chemical
cocktail, Wikel said. All the more reason to find a way to
vaccinate potential hosts so that the body _ instead of being
tricked by the influx of weapons _ recognizes one of them and
mounts a counterattack, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wikel, who once enlisted a small army of students to dissect
salivary glands out of 10,000 ticks, said that genetic sequencing
techniques were accelerating the research.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, he said, ``We probably have a lifetime of work ahead of
us to look at all these products, develop the proteins and use them
in vaccination trials.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   I am tossing my old record albums.
</P>
<P>
   Every baby boomer can feel the sting of this phrase, the gravity
of the decision. Even those who have internalized the 1970s mantra
``let it go,'' combined it with the '90s credo ``we have to move
on,'' and have unsentimentally pared down their lives to the
Restoration Hardware and Eddie Bauer essentials can appreciate this
particularly painful form of separation anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   Albums. The very word is a dead giveaway to a person's
generation. If at a music store you find yourself saying, ``Do you
have the new Ben Folds Five alb ... uh, CD?'' you're a boomer. If
the word ``disc'' or ``CD'' rolls right off your tongue, you're a
definite X. If you never even heard of a Shure or Pickering
tone-arm cartridge, you're a Y _ or whatever name sticks to the
generation after X.
</P>
<P>
   Even as we began amassing CD collections, we boomers invariably
toted our prized LPs from one home to another, like a child taking
an armful of stuffed animals from room to room. Album retention is
deeply embedded in our psyches. It's an aural fixation that Gen
Xers and their even younger counterparts can't fathom, first
because they don't have albums and, second, as they tell us
Methuselahs, because every old album can be found on CD anyway _ or
downloaded from some distant Internet redoubt. Which is not only
untrue, it completely misses the point.
</P>
<P>
   Our hundreds and even thousands of vinyl discs are practically
living organisms to us. We've spent countless hours removing dust
from their skins, carefully holding them by the edges as we replace
them in their sleeves. These albums were temperamental,
inconvenient, high-maintenance creatures of great and often
irritating fragility. Whereas CDs are metallic digital clones made
up of strings of ones and zeros in invisible mathematical
configurations, albums were physical, tactile entities that
demanded care, sensitivity, commitment.
</P>
<P>
   Our record albums saw us through decades. Each one, like an
individual person, carried its particular history. CDs always have
a nice day and don't care what you do to them. Albums are moody and
could easily end up injured or broken. CDs, gleaming and cold and
technocratic, glint like the steely eyes of a corporate takeover
executive and have the survival ability of roaches.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, to this day, those old vinyl stalwarts maintain a
warmer, richer sonic ambience than even the most artfully mastered
CDs. While CDs are more technically accurate in their reproduction
of music, with a greater dynamic range than records, albums had
that ineffable quality of human depth _ even sensuality _ that CDs
never seem to capture. The sound of a record simply had more
character.
</P>
<P>
   We may have shed most of the merchandise we acquired over the
years: Qiana shirts, lava lamps, and black-light posters. But our
album collection remained an inviolate part of our lives, through
dorm rooms to first apartments to first homes, through various
marriages and living arrangements and divorces. And through it all,
each album assumed a set of snaps, crackles and pops that ranged
from irritating to infuriating, but somehow we got used to them and
ultimately accepted them. Albums were like a collection of familiar
friends: You lived with the flaws and learned to love the records
all the more because of them.
</P>
<P>
   After a few playings, albums became as individual to us as DNA.
Within my record collection, for example, there was the loud,
familiar clicking near the English muffin line in Simon and
Garfunkel's ``Punky's Dilemma'' on their Bookends album. There was
the telltale skip at the beginning of ``Lay Lady Lay'' on Bob
Dylan's Greatest Hits album _ ``Lay acro ... acro ... acro ... acro
...'' _ which always needed a little nudge of the turntable arm to
get it back on track. The subtle series of pops at the transition
point in my copy of Sgt. Pepper's ``A Day in the Life'' soon became
an embedded aesthetic element of the song. Recently, when I heard
it on CD, it seemed to be missing something; my music memory had
integrated the flaws.
</P>
<P>
   I began tossing the albums in batches this past fall, and as I
did, I began to ruminate on my life in ways more poignant (and
somewhat more maudlin) than I could have anticipated. Or perhaps I
did expect to relive the pleasures and the pain, and that was what
made me so hesitant to finally do the deed: To consider each LP was
to confront my history in ways both aural and visual. Over the
course of a month, I privately eulogized each one before dropping
it into the trash bin. More than 2,000 bit the dust before I
finished. I tossed them slowly, with days of reflection in between,
before relegating them to rock 'n' roll heaven.
</P>
<P>
   I savored the associations of time and place that came and went
with each. The Beatles, the Moody Blues, Aaron Copland, Quicksilver
Messenger Service, Jefferson Airplane, the Monkees, Culture Club,
Bill Evans, Barry White, Van Morrison, Woodstock, the Animals,
Cream ... even Gary Lewis and the Playboys. I never anticipated
that this process, which started out to be so cleansing, would
become so unexpectedly grim. How do you say goodbye to Frank Zappa?
</P>
<P>
   Bidding adieu to a huge collection of record albums that have
gone unplayed for years is a symbolic act of leaving one's past
behind. These albums saw many of us through the better part of
three decades. Throwing out even a dozen records represents a
decade's worth of flashbacks in one dizzying moment. Perhaps it's
because our record albums had the power to understand us better
than any person ever could. In our most confusing years,
adolescence and early adulthood, music was our confessor, our
teacher. Such was the power of music that it could look into the
very corner of our souls.
</P>
<P>
   And that, finally, was why I procrastinated. It took me years to
start the process of tossing out my LPs and replacing them with
CDs. Gone are the album covers with the photographs and
illustrations that could instantly transport me back: Bob Dylan
walking down a windy New York street with a pretty girl beside him,
or the Siamese-twin heads of Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel sprouting
from what appeared to be one black turtleneck. Or the
phantasmagoric Magical Mystery Tour cover. Let's face it: A
scaled-down Big Brother and the Holding Company CD in its flimsy
plastic case looks like it needs to be reconstituted. And as for
Sticky Fingers ...
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, I tell myself, I'll have more space. I'll be
traveling lighter. It's time to move on. Why lug a sackful of
20th-century rocks into the new millennium? But as I tossed out my
collection, I saw that a part of me was being lost as well. In the
end, it turned out that my records had been playing me all along.
This ungainly collection of faded cardboard sleeves and their
timeworn vinyl inhabitants had become the one thing I hadn't
expected: witnesses to a life.

&HT;     NEW SPECIALTY FOR DENTISTS: THE HORSE, OF COURSE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By WILLIAM LUTHER  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Dr. Clay Stubbs isn't the typical dentist.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't have Muzak in his waiting room. He doesn't have a
comfortable reclining chair for his patients. And he doesn't give
out toothbrushes embossed with his phone number at the end of each
visit.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he almost always makes his patients wait outside.
</P>
<P>
   They have to stand up during exams. And he blindfolds them while
he works on their teeth.
</P>
<P>
   Stubbs is an equine dentist, a small but growing group of
veterinarians who specialize in treating equine molar maladies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really, competent horse dentistry is a really new
profession,'' said Stubbs, whose office and home is just near
Johnson City, some 50 miles north of San Antonio. ``There's only a
handful of us who do equine dentistry full time, and I think I know
all of them.''
</P>
<P>
   The full-time dentistry profession is so small that most horse
owners haven't even heard about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up around horses, and I knew I had to get (their teeth)
floated, but I never thought I would be going to a horse dentist,''
Alex ``Sandy'' Logan said during his first visit to Stubbs' office
with his two horses, Cappie and Connie.
</P>
<P>
   Logan's wife, Becky, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our kids thought it was pretty funny we were bringing (our
horses) to a dentist. They said, `You've really lost it now,''' she
said.

<P>
   A 1965 graduate of the Texas A&AMP;M veterinary school, Stubbs
didn't start out to be an equine dentist. He spent most of his
career doing what most doctors do _ establishing a successful
general practice.
</P>
<P>
   All was going well until the economic downturn of the 1980s and
family problems forced him to sell his clinics.
</P>
<P>
   At 50, Stubbs said to himself: ``If I'm going to be working
until I'm 90, then I better be doing something I like.''
</P>
<P>
   That led him to specialize in horse dentistry.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing Stubbs did was improve floating of horse teeth.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike human teeth, horse teeth are designed to wear with age.
</P>
<P>
   ``A tooth can be 3 to 4 1/2 inches long,'' Texas A&AMP;M Professor
Leon Scrutchfield said of young horses' teeth. ``And when they are
20 years old, they can be an inch.''
</P>
<P>
   This wearing creates sharp points, which cause sores inside the
horse's mouth, according to Scrutchfield, who is the head of Field
Services at the A&AMP;M College of Veterinary Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Floating a horse's teeth _ a masonry term, which refers to
creating a level row of bricks _ involves grinding off those points
to create a level row of teeth.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, these points were ground off with nothing more than
a hand rasp, requiring a strong hand and a lot of time.
</P>
<P>
   Now Stubbs uses an air-driven file he designed and patented that
runs at 8,000 oscillations per minute.
</P>
<P>
   Stubbs says his file is easier on the horse, does the job better
and saves time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm making some money for the first time in my life because of
this specialization,'' Stubbs said, noting that owners don't mind
paying for his services because they see almost immediate
improvements in their horse's attitude and performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'm most proud of, though, is developing the tools to do
a full exam,'' Stubbs said. ``I sell everything you need to do
dentistry.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say he's definitely a pioneer,'' Scrutchfield said. ``Not
only is Dr. Stubbs good at what he's doing, he has been innovative
in developing new instruments.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Noticeably less humid air will flow into the Northeast as a cold
front pushes farther offshore. Colder air aloft will lead to
billowy clouds forming over the higher terrain, and there will be a
few showers in northern New England.
</P>
<P>
   The boundary with a sultry air mass over the southern half of
the nation will be active, with several large thunderstorms from
the Middle Atlantic coast to southern Iowa. The return flow of
milder, moist air into the upper Plains will produce a batch of
thundershowers from Nebraska to the Dakotas.
</P>
<P>
   Torrid conditions will stretch from the southern Plains to the
deserts of the Southwest. Afternoon thunderstorms will erupt over
the southern Rockies, and a few will form along the Front Range.
The Northwest will notice a warming trend as sunshine returns to
most sections and temperatures rise above seasonal levels. Fog will
be nestled along parts of the West Coast.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: LONG-LASTING SMOKE
</P>
<P>
   The view of Fairbanks, Alaska, on Sunday resembled a smoggy East
Coast city with a veil of smoke hovering over the town. This past
weekend marked the beginning of the third week of hazy conditions
over interior southern Alaska, a result of recent forest fires. On
Sunday, a new twist was added to the unusual scene as clusters of
thunderstorms blossomed in the warm air mass. By midafternoon, more
than 1,600 lightning strikes had been detected, leading to more
forest fires and additional smoke, which should keep the skies
dull. &QL;

`TUFF': AN INSIDER BATTLES THE INNER-CITY TRAP 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: Publication notes appear at end of review.)  
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The eponymous Tuff of Paul Beatty's new novel is a smart
small-time hoodlum from the streets of East Harlem who sees things
as they are and whose dreams that they might be different smash up
against the jagged edges of reality. He is 19, married and the
father of a small boy, and he is surrounded by a cast of characters
who, like Tuff himself, are outside the usual categories.
</P>
<P>
   His best friend is a disabled anti-Semitic black Muslim who is
always coming up with get-rich schemes, legal and otherwise. His
father is a cant-spouting former Black Panther who begins poetry
readings by firing shotgun shells into the auditorium ceiling. His
self-appointed mentor is a black rabbi named Spencer Throckmorton,
who converted to Judaism to marry his college sweetheart and became
a rabbi even though she later left him. Tuff, whose real name is
Winston Foshay, decides about midway through Beatty's satirical
ghetto romp to run for city council, raising money by working in a
three-card monte scam in midtown Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tuff,'' in other words, is an extravagant, satirical cri de
coeur from the inner city, centering on that most common of all
sociological concepts, the young black urban male, which is
Beatty's principal literary subject. This gifted writer's first
novel, ``The White Boy Shuffle,'' was about one Gunnar Kaufman, who
in moving from middle-class Santa Monica to meaner, grittier
Hillside, Calif., has to learn to handle himself in the urban
arena. Beatty's new book shifts the scene from Los Angeles to New
York, and from a neophyte home boy to a native son, but it stays
within the genre of comic parody, with its poison darts aimed both
at the black urban male himself and the sociologists who have
conceptualized him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tuff'' is a funny book, and Beatty's blunt, impious,
streetwise eloquence has a kind of transfixing power. The serious
point, though never put in serious political-science language by
Beatty, would seem to be the subtle power of the inner city trap,
with Winston and his friends hemmed in by stiff-necked
victim-culture ideologues in one corner, self-defeating in-group
machismo in another and an indifferent economic system in the
third.
</P>
<P>
   The main ingredient of ``Tuff'' is portraiture, word-rich,
profanity- and caricature-drenched tableaus of Winston and the
off-kilter world in which he dwells. Skillfully drawn as those
tableaus are, one yearns for Beatty to advance beyond his absurdist
color photos of Winston's world, to do something more than slash
our conventional notions into scraps.
</P>
<P>
   Advance to what exactly is difficult to say. Maybe something
deeper and more affecting than Winston's insouciant, self-defeating
confrontation with the limitations of his world. Beatty's
genre-busting technique, his mingling of parody with naturalism,
seems aimed at avoiding stock situations, ghetto stereotypes. His
book is a kind of anti-``Shaft'' in this sense, and that is most
welcome. But his unwillingness to shed the transgressive comic mode
also subjects his narrative to a talky, meandering quality and a
tendency to end up not in ghetto stereotypes but in ghetto
slapstick.
</P>
<P>
   We first meet Winston waking up from a faint in a Brooklyn
tenement that has just been the scene of some drug-gang murders.
That Winston fainted, and that his childhood memories are of being
teased because of his bulk, lead the reader into mistaking him for
a hapless figure, too flabby for the mean streets. Winston is fat
but far from hapless. He casually steps around the corpses, joins
up with his best friend, whose name is Fariq, and heads toward East
Harlem, where he is a man who knows his way around.
</P>
<P>
   ``If all the world's a stage, the stoop at 258 East 109th Street
was his proscenium of Ghetto Tragedy,'' Beatty's narrator says.
Soon Winston has laid out an auxiliary policeman with a punch to
the chin and shot his dog. Then he tells one of his friends, an
unregenerate leftist revolutionary named Inez Yomura, what it's
like to stab somebody.
</P>
<P>
   Winston, talking the talk of the street, refers to himself and
to almost everybody with the most insulting racial epithet in the
language, appropriated by the hip-hop culture as a kind of
insider's insignia. Beatty's attempt in his portrayal of Winston
parallels Winston's own almost pornographic use of the word, and of
the sexual and racial meanness of his nonstop patter. You feel the
impulse to dislike Winston, to judge him, but you can't, partly
because he has charm, partly because he sees so clearly and partly
because he does want a way out.
</P>
<P>
   The satirical heart of ``Tuff'' comes when Winston, given the
absence of legal ways out, decides to turn his life around by
running for city council. His elderly friend Inez gives him $15,000
of the reparation money she got for being held in a Japanese
internment camp during World War II, but his campaign is
half-hearted and despairing from the beginning, and Beatty mines it
mostly for its satirical potential. One of Winston's opponents, for
example, a book writer and ex-astronaut named German Jordan,
complains at a debate that despite all he's done for the
neighborhood, he still doesn't feel safe parking his Mercedes
there. Then he calls on his constituents ``to start imagining
ourselves beyond race.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'd been to outer space, written books, had dollars, drove
a Mercedes-Benz, I'd imagine myself beyond race too,'' Winston
says, in one of the few statements from him that would be quotable
in this newspaper. But German Jordan is so much a straw man that
the answer Beatty puts into Winston's mouth does not have much
grip, serious or satirical. Beatty sustains his book's verbal
vitality to the end, but you wonder whether, having created this
raucous group of rugged individuals, he himself knew exactly what
to do with them.

 Nintendo Still Going Strong 
 (Latest)  
 By DAVID BLOOM  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;  &QL;  &QL;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hard to believe, but at the rate things are going, Nintendo may
start challenging McDonald's for most served. The company recently
passed the 100 million mark in the number of Game Boy handheld
systems sold since the device debuted in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   At around $70 apiece, that's $7 billion in sales before a single
game cartridge or add-on accessory is sold. And with more Pokemon
Game Boy titles coming among the scores of new games expected from
dozens of developers, there's little reason to think the machines
will stop succeeding.
</P>
<P>
   As it is, Nintendo has shrugged off one seemingly attractive
challenger, SNK's NeoGeo Pocket Color (available at www.snk.com),
which has struggled to attract any consumer interest 13 months
after its debut.
</P>
<P>
   Game Boy may face stiffer competition, at least in the long
term, from the Palm- and Pocket PC-based handheld organizers that
are proving big hits in the marketplace (Father's Day found Palm
device makers unable to keep up with demand, for instance). Go to
www.palm.com, www.handspring.com and the sites of PC and
electronics makers such as Compaq, Hewlett-Packard and Casio for
more information on any of these.
</P>
<P>
   Games are becoming a good-sized sector in the software offerings
for these machines, but their prices are far beyond the $70 or so
it costs for a Game Boy Color. Think of it as the difference
between playing games on a PC versus a console like the N64 or
PlayStation; one is a relatively complex and costly machine that
does a lot of different things while the other is simple, cheap and
does a few things well.
</P>
<P>
   A just-debuted, teen-oriented challenger, the Cybiko (at
www.cybiko.com), may prove to be a worthy opponent, particularly
because it offers delightfully simple wireless networking that lets
kids play each other or chat as long as they're within 300 feet of
each other.
</P>
<P>
   I've tested the machines and found they connect simply and
reliably with each other and provide simple ways to do a lot of
things teens in particular will think are cool, like matching up
people with similar interests and finding gaming opponents.
</P>
<P>
   It has a built-in organizer and other capabilities (much as does
the NeoGeo) and comes with an artificial life game, CyLandia. It
also links to your computer for easy updates and backups, and
Cybiko provides a free e- mail account through its Website.
</P>
<P>
   As a further enticement, Cybiko's parent company gives away a
free, downloadable game from the Internet every day to take
advantage of that power. It's a bit pricey, at $129, and the
monochrome screen is definitely behind the technology curve, but in
all, it's a fine package that holds a lot of promise.
</P>
<P>
   Nintendo's response to these challengers won't come until next
year probably, when it finally releases the Game Boy Advance, which
will jump to a far more powerful 32-bit brain (the current
processor is only 8 bits). The company has talked about providing
wireless Web connections, cell-phone capabilities and more through
the Advance.
</P>
<P>
   And interestingly, a 32-bit brain would put the Advance at the
same power level, more or less, as the original PlayStation, in a
compact, handheld box.
</P>
<P>
   Nintendo's latest word is that the Advance will debut in Japan
by year's end, but company officials have largely been mum about
details for the American market. With the Game Boy selling 17.5
million units last year alone, the company is in no hurry to put
its cash cow out to pasture.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, the original PlayStation will be getting a facelift
(and serious liposuction) after its powerful successor, the
PlayStation 2, hits American markets in October.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent Japan press conference, Sony officials unveiled the
PS One, which has all the connections and capabilities of the
original PlayStation, in a package about a third the size.
</P>
<P>
   The machine is designed for mobile uses such as in the car, and
will eventually have available add-ons such as a cell phone link
for Internet gaming and a clip-on LCD screen.
</P>
<P>
   Those attachments are many months away, but Sony finally is
beginning to do the same marketing-minded variations on a theme for
the PlayStation that they've applied with such verve and success on
all their consumer electronics products (think 200 kinds of Walkman
as interpreted on the old gray PlayStation box).

`STRANGER WITH A CAMERA': ONE MAN IN APPALACHIA WOULDN'T STAND FOR
IT 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Broadcast notes are at end of review. Time, channel are for
New York area. Check local listings.) 
 By JULIE SALAMON c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Elizabeth Barret was a candidate for homecoming queen in her
small Kentucky town in 1967 when she heard about the killing. A
local man, respected but eccentric, had fatally shot a Canadian man
for taking pictures of an impoverished miner and his baby.
</P>
<P>
   Some 30 years later, Barret could not remember what she thought
then about the killing itself, but she did remember this: ``I
didn't want the rest of the world to think of us as hillbillies, to
see us as ignorant, backward or violent.''
</P>
<P>
   She would become a documentary filmmaker, making a career trying
to show another side of her Kentucky home. In films like ``Quilting
Women,'' ``Hand-Carved'' and ``Coal Mining Women,'' she has aimed
to preserve Appalachian customs and history and to counter the
stereotype of primitive shanty dwellers. But her work only
heightened her memory of the killing. She empathized with Hugh
O'Connor, the dead Canadian, who had been a respected documentary
filmmaker, a colleague to others. By all accounts, and she listened
to many, O'Connor's intentions had been honorable, not
exploitative. Yet as a local herself she also understood the
resentment that led Hobart Ison, the killer, to explode.
</P>
<P>
   She did what artists do: she used what was nagging her in her
work. The result is ``Stranger With a Camera,'' a thoughtful and
disturbing documentary about what happened to O'Connor and why. But
Barret's film has another important agenda. ``Can filmmakers show
poverty without shaming the people we portray?'' she asks, raising
the general question of exploitation. The issue is especially
relevant today, with the blurring of entertainment and news and
with video cameras everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   She has composed her investigation as a haunting narrative, but
without losing sight of reportorial fairness. She interviewed
witnesses to the murder, including both the O'Connor and Ison
families, townspeople and reporters who covered the story
(including Calvin Trillin, reading chilling excerpts from his 1969
article about the killing in The New Yorker).
</P>
<P>
   The film emerges as a provocative moral inquiry but also as a
vivid portrait of a place and time, informed by Barret's gentle,
personal rumination (with a beautifully written narration by Fenton
Johnson, a Kentucky novelist).
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps beginning with Walker Evans' famous Depression-era
images, Appalachia's poor people became irresistible subjects for
photographers. It seemed ennobling to expose the poverty, and the
worn faces and shanties also happened to make powerful pictures.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1960s, a time of national prosperity and mounting
interest in documentary journalism, Appalachia was a hot spot for
reporters. There was good copy and even better images of poverty
amid plenty: gap-toothed coal miners living in shacks, lovely
rolling hills littered with the hulks of wrecked cars.
</P>
<P>
   President Johnson sat on the front porch of a humble house and
declared his War on Poverty. After that, says a local newspaper
publisher interviewed for Barret's film, ``Almost every time you
looked out there was a newspaper reporter or magazine reporter or
television reporter or crew coming through.'' Barret shows us
headlines from The New York Times (``Poverty, Squalor and Idleness
Prevail in Mountain Area'') and CBS news film from a report by
Charles Kuralt, which showed poor rural children singing Christmas
carols.
</P>
<P>
   Barret, who grew up on the prosperous side of the tracks,
recalls feeling embarrassed for those children, who didn't live far
from her. But then she lets us hear from the local newspaper
publisher, who insists that the reports were necessary because the
area's troubles were real. ``The nation really needed to know and
we needed the help of the nation,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Hugh O'Connor and Hobart Ison came to symbolize the two camps:
journalists seeking to right wrongs by exposing them and civilians
who felt they were being snooped on by outsiders who edited their
stories to suit a particular narrative, even if it wasn't the
entire truth.
</P>
<P>
   Barret manages to make both of them sympathetic, though it's
more of a stretch for Ison, who vented his outrage (even if it's
made understandable) with unacceptable violence. But, as someone
says, he was a man of his time and place.
</P>
<P>
   The Ison family went to eastern Kentucky at the end of the 19th
century and bought lots of land. Hobart's bond to that land was
fierce, his relatives explain. He didn't seem to have much else.
His fiancee broke their engagement, whereupon he locked the cozy
house he had built for them and let it stand unused, a monument to
his failed romance. Besides his land, he loved his guns; he would
go as far as Alaska to hunt. Even his family did not know him well,
just that he would help anyone who asked but had no tolerance for
trespassers.
</P>
<P>
   In Ison's eyes, O'Connor was the ultimate trespasser. Hired to
make a film about poverty in America, the Canadian documentary
maker had stopped with his crew at a shanty owned by Ison, who
rented several such houses _ and asked the miner living there if he
could film him with his baby. The miner agreed. Word travels fast
in the country and Ison heard what was going on. He drove over and
fired several shots. Two were lodged in the camera, and one
exploded in O'Connor's chest.
</P>
<P>
   Reading from his New Yorker article, Trillin describes the
moment: ``O'Connor briefly looked down in amazement and saw a hole
in his chest, and he looked up in despair, and said, `Why did you
have to do that?'''
</P>
<P>
   With heart-wrenching acuity, Barret has explained why.

BARAK SURVIVES NO-CONFIDENCE VOTE, THEN HEADS TO CAMP DAVID 
</HEADLINE>
 (With MIDEAST-TALKS, MIDEAST-ISSUES)

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ A defiant Ehud Barak faced down an unruly parliament
Monday night, surviving a vote of confidence just an hour before
leaving for what he hopes will be decisive peace talks with the
Palestinians in Camp David, Md.
</P>
<P>
   ``From here, from united Jerusalem, the eternal capital of
Israel, the greatest leaders of Israel went out to meet the
greatest and most important of historic decisions in the history of
the nation,'' the prime minister told parliament, raising his voice
above the jeers of the opposition. ``I wish to depart today from
Jerusalem to Camp David in order to complete the labor of peace
making that was begun by Menachem Begin and Yitzhak Rabin,''
implicitly including himself in the company of his celebrated
predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not going alone,'' he continued, pointedly reminding
opposition legislators yet again of his popular support.
</P>
<P>
   But after the defections of three rightist parties in his
year-old coalition, Barak was left the head of an enfeebled
minority government of 42 members, barely a third of the 120-seat
legislature.
</P>
<P>
   A motion to topple Barak's wobbly coalition fell seven votes
short of a parliamentary majority, of 61, but still more people
voted against the government than for it, 54 to 52. Seven
legislators abstained, and seven others were not present.
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister owes his lease on life to support from most
Arab members of parliament, who have never been invited to join his
government, and to critical abstentions from United Torah Judaism,
a religious Orthodox party, and Shinui, a resolutely anti-Orthodox
faction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barak is traveling to the summit defeated and alone!'' crowed
the opposition Likud party in announcing a rally against the peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I regret that the person who wanted to be the prime minister
of everyone became in just one year the prime minister of almost no
one, except maybe himself,'' Ariel Sharon, the Likud leader,
taunted Barak in parliament.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have a majority in the Knesset,'' he said. ``You
don't have the support of the people.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak dismissed his critics, and said, ``It was the people who
sent me and gave me my mandate, and only the people will decide.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak had planned to fly directly from Cairo to Washington on
Monday, after a morning meeting with Eqyptian President Hosni
Mubarak. Instead, with his coalition in shambles, he returned from
Cairo to address parliament before going on to America.
</P>
<P>
   Barak took a commanding 56 percent of the vote in last year's
general election, and since then has consistently maintained
support for his peace efforts in opinion surveys here.
</P>
<P>
   Yet that support may be eroding. A poll in one leading newspaper
Monday showed just 52 percent backing Barak's participation in the
Camp Davis summit &UR;  &LR; meeting, with 45 percent opposed. And in
parliament, his support is razor-thin: If United Torah Judaism and
Shinui had joined the no-confidence majority, Barak would be
heading Monday night not toward Camp David, but toward new
elections. The summit meeting begins Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli commentators groped for metaphors to describe Barak's
political predicament, and his seemingly implacable confidence amid
the wreckage of his once wide-reaching government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never has an Israeli prime minister set out on such a historic
mission with the support of such a pathetic coalition,'' Hemi
Shaleven wrote in Maariv on Monday. ``The co-pilots have activated
their ejection seats one after the other, and Barak has been left
alone, with his hands on the controls and the hysterical passengers
in the back.''
</P>
<P>
   Nahum Barnea, a political columnist at Yediot Ahronot, saw the
prime minister heading toward the summit meeting as a kind of
crazed alpinist, courageous but foolhardy. ``Barak wants to climb
Everest without a rope, without a ladder, and without a sweater,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians, meanwhile, watched Monday's parliamentary
spectacle with a mixture of cynicism and dismay. Some saw Barak's
apparent weakness as a Machievellian maneuver to evade compromise
on tough issues like Jerusalem and Jewish settlements.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is he really capable of making a peace agreement after the
disintegration of his government last night?'' asked Mahmoud
Dahlan, a top Palestinian security officer and a member of Arafat's
negotiating team.
</P>
<P>
   Khaled al-Khatib, the director-general of the Palestinian
Ministry of Information, led a large protest in Gaza Monday against
Jewish settlements there and the Israeli troops that are deployed
to protect the settlements.
</P>
<P>
   The protest was held near the site of an accidental shooting
death of a young Palestinian woman by Israeli soldiers at an army
checkpoint two days ago. ``This is a symbolic sit-in to send a
message to Israeli society, and to the Americans, that the
Palestinian people will reject Camp David if the settlements
stay,'' Khatib said.
</P>
<P>
   In Jerusalem, near the prime minister's residence, Natan
Scharansky, Barak's interior minister until Sunday, held his own
protest, collecting signatures for a petition in favor of a new
unity government. Foreign Minister David Levy, who refused to join
Barak's Camp David negotiating team, echoed the calls for a new and
broad-based coalition.
</P>
<P>
   The prevailing political wisdom Monday was that if the Camp
David meeting produces a breakthrough, Barak will fly home and
immediately schedule a referendum and new elections, perhaps
simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   But if Camp David hits an impasse, the speculation was that
Barak would try to create a unity government embracing Likud as
well as his wayward former coalition partners.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in parliament Monday Barak and Sharon appeared to be going
out of their way to scuttle any future collaboration.
</P>
<P>
   Barak had conciliatory words for Jewish settlers in the West
Bank, and for the Orthodox Jews now arrayed against him. But
staring at the Likud bench, he charged that many of his mainstream
critics prefer the prospect of war to the possibility of
reconciliation with the Arabs.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the same prophets who warned us against Sadat's
fraud when he came to visit Jerusalem,'' Barak said. ``These are
the same prophets who threatened us with Katyushas on Ashkelon and
Kfar Saba when Oslo was signed, and these are the same prophets who
dared not leave Lebanon. These are also the same prophets who are
unwilling to turn over every stone in an attempt to put an end to
the cycle of blood.''
</P>
<P>
   Interrupted repeatedly by heckling, the prime minister took the
better part of an hour to deliver a speech of 800 words. It is a
role Barak seems almost to revel in: His trademark half-smile
freezing somewhere between bemusement, disdain and anger, he waited
each time for the jeers to subside. With his unscheduled address
timed to coincide with the daily 5 p.m. television news shows, some
analysts saw his performance as a calculated attempt to draw a
contrast with his raucous and bellicose critics.
</P>
<P>
   But to others, those critics included, it looked simply like
Barak had lost control.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go to elections,'' Sharon said, addressing the prime minister.
``Don't threaten us, and don't enlist others to threaten us with
war and with rising violence, in order to force us into
concessions.''

&HT;     U.S. TEAM HAS BIG HOPES IN OLYMPIC FENCING 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARK WANGRIN  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The few. The proud. The U.S. fencing team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of these Olympics, what makes them so special, is that we
had to qualify,'' said Cliff Bayer of New York, who will make the
trip to Sydney, Australia, in September to compete in the men's
foil at the Summer Games. ``Instead of the 15 we had in Atlanta,
we'll only have eight. But the good thing is everybody has a
legitimate chance of a good result. I don't think that's happened
before.''
</P>
<P>
   At the U.S. National Championships/Olympic Fencing Trials at the
Austin Convention Center last weekend, optimism was high that what
the U.S. team lacks in numbers it will more than make up for in
performance.
</P>
<P>
   There is a legitimate chance for three medals in Sydney _ 1996
Olympian Bayer, women's foil fencer Iris Zimmerman of Rush, N.Y.,
and the women's foil team _ with hope that Iris' sister Felicia
Zimmerman in women's foil and Tamir Bloom of New York in men's epee
could also finish high. The U.S. team has won only one medal in the
past 40 years, a bronze by Peter Westbrook in the saber competition
in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Since fencing was first held in 1900 the U.S. team has won only
five individual and three team Olympic medals, none of them gold.
The 2000 competition is expected to be dominated by fencers from
the typically strong nations of Italy, Germany, France, Hungary,
Poland, Cuba, Russia and China, but the Olympics format will allow
for some surprises.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most competitions, the field is small. Only about 40
fencers will compete in each of the five weapons _ men's foil, epee
and saber and women's foil and epee _ and there will be
single-elimination bouts. At the national championships, there were
about 150 fencers in each class who were required to advance out of
round-robin pool competition before facing off in a
double-elimination tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Each bout at the Olympics will be decided by the first fencer to
reach 15 points, or touches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very simple, yes,'' said U.S. co-coach Yefim Litvan. ``But
very tough. You need a little luck _ and God has to like you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pretty crazy format,'' Bayer said. ``There are 30
people who can win. You have to turn yourself into a complete
psychopath to go out and win.''
</P>
<P>
   Rounding out the team are Ann Marsh of Buffalo, N.Y., and
alternate Erinn Smart of Brooklyn, N.Y., in the women's foil,
Arlene Stevens of Rochester, N.Y., in the women's epee, and Keeth
Smart of Brooklyn and Akhnaten Spencer of New York in the men's
saber.

   MIDEAST-SUMMIT _ WASHINGTON _ President Clinton will open a Camp
David summit Tuesday between Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. As they were in 1978 when

that began the peace process, the stakes this time are high for all
those involved. (Deans, Cox News Service). 25.

   MIDEAST-BARAK _ JERUSALEM _ If anyone thought Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak would let a little political trouble keep him
from going to the Camp David summit, they should look at their
calendars. Three days ago was the deadline he set for withdrawing
Israeli troops from Lebanon, but he had already beat that date by
six weeks. He's back in commando mode, challenging the conventional
wisdom and refusing to interrupt his ``mission'' _ the word he uses
for his peace efforts. Almost exactly a year since he took office,
Barak Monday appeared to have staved off parliamentary attempts to
pull down his government and headed off for a date with President
Clinton, Yasser Arafat and, some speculate, his place in history.
Newspapers and some in the Israeli public Monday decried the
erstwhile allies that had abandoned Barak on the eve of the summit.
Some compared him to Israeli founding father David Ben-Gurion, who
charged ahead even when fearful allies hesitated. (Kaplow, Cox News

 &HT;    BARAK SURVIVES VOTE, GOES TO SUMMIT WEAK BUT DETERMINED
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service(at)
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Bounding up the steps to his jet, Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak Monday looked happy to leave troubles at home
and eager to make a mark on history.
</P>
<P>
   He was headed to Camp David for Tuesday's scheduled start of a
summit with President Clinton and Palestinian President Yasser
Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   He had just survived a parliamentary no-confidence vote, which
had been raised by those opposed to holding the summit. His
government coalition had fallen apart the day before, when three
parties against the summit resigned.
</P>
<P>
   The no-confidence motion received 54 votes in favor and only 52
against, but abstentions and absences kept it short of the 61 votes
that could have ultimately made Barak's government fall and face
new elections.
</P>
<P>
   Highlighting the dissension, heckling members of parliament
interrupted an address by Barak. They forced him to stop for
minutes at a time as they sometimes laughed and joked with each
other.
</P>
<P>
   But at Ben-Gurion International Airport, Barak was finally able
to deliverhis pitch without interruption.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difficulties of peace are better than the agonies of
war,'' Barak said, quoting the late Israeli Prime Minister Menachem
Begin, who made peace with Egypt at Camp David 22 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear the real voice of the Israeli citizens and they are
bolstering me with their support,'' Barak said.
</P>
<P>
   The 58-year-old prime minister just completed a year in office
Friday. His popularity is sagging and his government is hobbled.
Cabinet ministers double and triple their duties to fill in for
others who had resigned.
</P>
<P>
   But, if anyone doubts Barak's determination to get to this
summit, they should note that Friday was also his self-imposed
deadline for pulling Israeli troops out of Lebanon. He had beaten
that deadline, to the amazement of the world, six weeks earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Now Israel's most decorated soldier is back in commando mode,
talking about the ``mission'' to make peace and the need to keep
his eyes on the ``target.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He thinks what he is facing is in the magnitude of the
founding fathers of Israel,'' said Dan Pattir, a Barak supporter
who was Begin's spokesman at Camp David. ``He's in a tough
situation. On the other hand, he likes to act against the odds.''
</P>
<P>
   Pattir pointed out that Barak might not come home with a deal.
In fact, he said, he could just be trying to make it clear that
Israel wants peace.
</P>
<P>
   Or, Barak could return with a deal and put it to a public
referendum that re-solidifies his hold on power. Analysts disagree
on whether Barak's government problems will restrict him in the
talks, or make him feel he has little to lose by making a deal.
</P>
<P>
   Ariel Sharon, leader of the opposition Likud Party, which
opposes the summit, chided Barak as ``prime minister of almost no
one.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Barak could take heart in an opinion poll Monday in the
Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper showing that, despite his coalition's
collapse, 52 percent of Israelis favored the summit. Further, 53
percent recognized that concessions would have to be made to the
Palestinians. The nationwide survey of 502 adults had an error
margin of plus or minus 4.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Camp David-II already had one newspaper columnist comparing him
to Israeli founding father David Ben-Gurion. Others said his
political problems were a result of the same arrogance and
confidence that make Barak a leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barak's clumsy political moves and his mistaken tendency to
rely only on himself rightly raise serious concerns,'' wrote Hemi
Shalev, of the Ma'ariv daily. But, he added, ``He has courage. He
always has had. He goes for it, and big-time, whatever 'it' may
be.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the heckles of the parliament, Barak declared that ``the
moment of truth is upon us.''
</P>
<P>
   He called his critics the same ``false prophets'' who opposed
Begin's trip to the first Camp David summit and who told Barak he
could not pull the troops out of Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   On the dark airport runway, Barak spoke again and sang the
Israeli national anthem while standing next to his foreign
minister, David Levy. Even Levy, once a confidante, is boycotting
the talks.
</P>
<P>
   Barak shook his hand warmly, hugged wife Nava Barak, then turned
and trotted alone up the steps to the airplane.

 &HT;    Summer doesn't necessarily mean working teen-agers
 &HT;    By Meredith Moss
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio - Time was when summer for a teen-ager meant mixing
sodas at the corner drugstore, mowing lawns, attending summer
school or hanging out at the pool.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we were old enough to work, we'd hunt for summer jobs in
a factory or some type of business,'' recalls Don Eifert, a retired
high school guidance counselor who in his teens worked in a steel
plant in Coldwater, a Meadow Gold creamery in New Bremen and in the
millwright shop at NCR.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hard but it was a good thing because I learned what the
real world was about,'' says Eifert. ``You did it and didn't think
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Although plenty of kids are still engaging in traditional summer
activities, ``thinking about it'' has become a high priority for
baby boomer parents anxious to make sure their kids have
opportunities they didn't have. They're determined their youngsters
will have a leg up when it's time for applications and resumes. And
when they talk about their kids seeing the ``real world,'' they're
more likely to be referring to Australia or Africa than the inside
of a factory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see a lot more parents pointing their children to some type
of educational activity in the summer,'' says Eifert, who worked at
Colonel White, Oakwood and Hillel Academy high schools during his
35-year career. ``It might be an educational camp on a college
campus or a travel program.'' Admissions officers and employers, he
adds, often look at how students choose to spend summer months.
</P>
<P>
   Pick up one of the books on summer options for teens and you'll
get some idea of the range of summer programs. Kids can sign on for
wilderness travel in Central America, study Spanish in Biarritz, go
sailing in the British Virgin Islands and do community service on a
reservation in South Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   Susie Katz, a Kettering mother of two, says one of the reasons
she and her husband have worked hard is to give their children
opportunities to experience the ``bigger world.''
</P>
<P>
   Daughter Alex, 20, has spent two summers in Israel, taken art
history and international studies courses at Georgetown University
in Washington, studied art in Nice and worked as a nanny in Geneva,
Switzerland. This summer she's working at the Smithsonian
Institution in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of my friends thought I was excessive and that our kids
should be working to learn the value of a dollar,'' says Katz, who
spent her own teen summers in school because her parents both
worked and couldn't afford expensive excursions. ``I feel you have
your whole adult life to work so if your family is in a situation
where they can access these kinds of programs, they should.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are plenty of other ways to teach children the value of
a dollar that don't commit them to slinging hamburgers all summer
long.''
</P>
<P>
   Rebecca Jacobs, 22, says taking classes in Colorado, Washington,
D.C., and Oxford, England, has taught her how to adjust to new
surroundings and new people.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to learn to rely on yourself and to figure out things
on your own,'' says the recent Washington University grad from
Vandalia. ``I learned how to get to London on the bus; I had to
figure out the Metro in Paris. There was a bus strike in Rome and I
had to find a hotel overnight. It gave me self-confidence to
realize I could do all that.''
</P>
<P>
   Donna Moosbrugger, who has been a senior counselor at Butler
High School in Vandalia for 23 years, says the biggest change she's
seen is the new emphasis on sports camps.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are quarterback camps, camps for volleyball players,
team camps,'' she says. ``It's about improving skills and being fit
and I think it's fine for the most part.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank Mannarino, a sports medicine doctor who spent last week in
Wilmington, N.C., with his daughter's high school basketball team,
says he played sports as a teen in New Jersey, but he didn't do it
in such an organized way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see a big need for kids to be working in the summer,''
he adds. ``I don't think they should be idle and if they don't have
other activities, they should get a job, but if they have a major
commitment to something else, that's great.''
</P>
<P>
   Some teens opt for paid or unpaid internships.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Saphire of Dayton, Pete Gambill of Vandalia and Terry Posey
Jr. of Tipp City have been interning for U.S. Rep. Tony Hall
(D-Dayton) in Washington this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It puts all the book learning I've been doing into practice,''
says Saphire, who says interns answer phones, open mail, do
legislative research, give tours and answers letters from
constituents.
</P>
<P>
   Gambill views summer as a time to extend his horizons. ``The
world is getting smaller and people want to be a part of things
that are bigger than the towns they grew up in,'' he says, adding
he's made a point of working for role models he admires.
</P>
<P>
   Oakwood High School art teacher Kaye Carlile spent eight summers
escorting groups of her students to Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did everything from picnicking in the vineyards of Tuscany
to visiting to the Louvre in Paris and riding donkeys to the top of
Santorini, a little Greek Island,'' says Carlile, who believes it's
important for kids to realize that ``although people are unique
from country to country, we are all very much alike.''
</P>
<P>
   Times were different, she says, when she was growing up in Tipp
City.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to the end of the street and hiked at a nearby farm.
Today's kids are boarding a trans-Atlantic plane and hiking through
Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Parents, counselors and teens all stress it's important to check
out a summer program thoroughly before signing up. And while many
programs are costly, it is possible to seek out scholarships or
part-time jobs to help pay the tab.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the Muse Machine's Lorenzo Bassani Visual Arts
Scholarship, Stivers art student William Penn of Dayton was able to
attend a two-week visual arts seminar in Colorado Springs this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``My whole drawing technique changed there,'' says Penn, 17.
``They made me do a whole different thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Although many summer programs are worthwhile, Don Eifert says he
hates to see too much pressure put on high school students to build
for their futures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Working a hard job is physical but I didn't feel the kind of
pressure that the kids feel today,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Carlile also expresses concern that many youths and teen-agers
are so heavily scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Summer should be a balance between doing something enriching _
like special lessons or travel _ and having the opportunity for
spontaneous adventure and self-discovery,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to have some time when you get up in the morning and
say, 'What am I going to do today?'''

   THINKING ABOUT SUMMER 2001
</P>
<P>
   Here are some resources for summer programs for teens and
collegians:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  High school guidance counselors typically receive lots of
information on summer programs and can also put you in touch with
students at your school who have participated in them.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Pay a visit to the library or bookstore. Here's a sampling of
helpful books:
</P>
<P>
   ``Summer Opportunities for Kids and Teenagers'' (Peterson's,
$29.95) lists a wide range of programs including academic, travel,
internships and summer specialty camps. The giant book _ it's 1,650
pages _ arranges topics by states and countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Yale Daily News Guide to Summer Programs'' by Sara
Schwebel (Kaplan, $22) has a large section for arts and music
programs and also includes study abroad. Other sections range from
community service and leadership programs to athletic and outdoor
adventure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ACA Accredited Camps'' features 2,200 day, resident and
trip and travel camps (American Camping Association, $19.95).
</P>
<P>
   ``America's Top Internships'' (Princeton Review, $21) includes
more than 18,000 internship positions.

A LIFE DEVOTED TO STOPPING THE SUFFERING OF MUTILATION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wash., Minn., Calif., Mass.)  (Science Times) 
 By CLAUDIA DREIFUS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   BOSTON _ In all the vast territory of the American health care
system, there is nothing quite like the African Women's Health
Practice of the obstetrics and gynecology department at Brigham and
Women's Hospital here.
</P>
<P>
   Every Friday, dozens of African women immigrants, now living in
the area but still wearing the brilliant gowns of their native
countries, come here for help with their medical problems. Many are
seeking not just routine care in the specialty, but treatment for
special gynecologic conditions related to female circumcision.
</P>
<P>
   The ritual, which is also called female genital mutilation, is
performed on young girls in many parts of Africa.
</P>
<P>
   This unusual clinic is the brainchild of Dr. Nawal M. Nour, 34,
a Sudanese-born, Harvard-trained gynecologist whose 1988 Brown
University undergraduate thesis was ``The Emancipation of the
Egyptian Woman.''
</P>
<P>
   A crusader against female circumcision, Nour founded the clinic
to help women who had been mutilated and to give her a platform to
organize doctors and other professionals against the ritual.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent cheery afternoon, when it seemed as if all of Boston
was out along the Charles River enjoying the warm sun, Nour sat in
her cubbyhole of an office at the Brigham and told how battling
female circumcision had become her life's passion.
</P>
<P>
   Q. When did you first become aware of female circumcision?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Early. I grew up in Sudan, Egypt and Great Britain, and so,
for as long as I can remember, I was aware of it. My father is
Sudanese. He was an agronomy professor and my mother is American.
My parents were very influential. My father spoke out against it.
</P>
<P>
   At school, I remember the girls saying: ``I was circumcised.
Have you been?'' I remember one girl saying she'd been circumcised
and that it hurt, but it was a good thing because now she was a
woman.
</P>
<P>
   The practice troubled me, but I was also intrigued by it because
it's so horrible _ and yet, it continues. As a child, I couldn't
understand why people would do something that wasn't good for them.
I think I became a physician so that I could find an effective way
to attack it.
</P>
<P>
   To this day, I get e-mails from schoolmates who write: ``You
were always talking about this practice. I remember in the 10th
grade, you brought up this issue.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. How did this African women's clinic begin?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. In 1995, after I began my residency here, I started
attracting patients from Sudan, Ethiopia, Somalia and West Africa.
I became known in the immigrant community around Boston as that
``African woman doctor'' at Brigham and Women's Hospital. Most of
these women who came to me, obviously, had undergone female
circumcision. So eventually, I went to people from the immigrant
community and asked, ``Would you like for me to open an African
clinic for Africans?'' People were very excited. We did a focus
group study and asked where they wanted this clinic _ West Roxbury,
Mission Hill? People wanted to go to the Brigham. They felt that
this was where the wealthy Americans go and they should go to the
same hospital.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What kinds of clinical problems do your circumcised patients
bring to you?
</P>
<P>
   A. The major complications are seen on women who have undergone
Type 3 circumcision. Type 1 removes the clitoris _ this is common
in Ethiopia. Type 2 excises the clitoris and the inner vaginal
lips, which may end up fusing together.
</P>
<P>
   Type 3 is removing the clitoris, the inner lips, the outer lips,
then sewing everything together, leaving only a very small opening
for urination and menses. This is mainly done among Somalis and
Sudanese and in parts of West Africa. Female circumcision, you see,
is nothing like what we know as male circumcision. In the latter,
the foreskin is removed from the penis. With female circumcision,
we have the equivalent of the penis being removed.
</P>
<P>
   The women who've undergone Type 3 can have scarring problems and
problems with their menses. Some of them have terrible trouble
having sex with their husbands, as you can imagine.
</P>
<P>
   It's still shocking to me. This morning, I saw an 18-year-old
whose opening was about dime size. I saw a woman the other week who
was pregnant and had a pencil-sized opening. One couldn't help but
wonder how she'd managed to even get pregnant.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Can some of this be solved by plastic surgery?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. If the clitoris has been removed, it cannot be returned. But
sometimes, when we do a procedure which opens up the scar tissue
from the Type 3 circumcision the end result can look very good. It
can look like new external lips have been formed. The women I've
operated on are very pleased with that. They have less pain in
intercourse and with their menses. It allows them to urinate quite
easily, which often wasn't the case before.
</P>
<P>
   If a patient is considering getting pregnant and she has a very
small opening as a result of the circumcision, I encourage her to
be opened up. If she is coming in with chronic urinary tract
infections, pain on intercourse or pain in menses, I often suggest
it, too.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Since you've had the clinic, have you gained any insight on a
question you asked as a young woman: why does female circumcision
persist?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I think it persists for complex reasons. Some people
perpetuate it because they say that religion requires it, though
that's wrong. Islam never stated that girls should be circumcised.
Others say they do it to make sure that their daughters will be
marriageable. Still others argue that it's necessary to maintain
female chastity. I find that people do it because of a deeply
ingrained belief that they are protecting their daughters. This is
not done to be hurtful, but out of love. The parents do it because
they think this is necessary to ensure that their daughters will
get married. They love their children. These are the same parents
who in time of war or famine, will give up their food so that the
children will be fed.
</P>
<P>
   One of the things our clinic tries to do is to educate American
health care providers about the practice so that they can take
better care of these women, when they come across them. And then, I
try to educate the women to prevent the practice from being
perpetuated in the U.S. and to try to prevent them from sending
their daughters home to be circumcised there.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. In 19th century America, women were castrated and
clitorectomized as a treatment for ``hysteria'' and ``eroticism.''
These operations, some historians suggest, were often used as a
means of social control. Is the same true in contemporary Africa?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. It's a very difficult question to answer. Some would argue
that, of course, it is a means of social control over women. But
the fact is that the people who are perpetuating the practice are
usually the women themselves. That's why I think one of the things
that must happen in Africa is that there should be dialogue between
men and women. The men are not involved in it. It's ``a woman's
thing.'' There needs to be much more dialogue on how this affects a
woman's life.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. How likely is it that an American gynecologist will ever see
a circumcised woman?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. People in middle America may not see so much of it, but
doctors in Portland, Ore., Washington, D.C., New York City,
Seattle, Minnesota and parts of California, are likely to. Those
are the places where immigrants are going from Africa. There are at
least 12,000 Somalis in Boston.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Q. What do your patients tell you about their experiences with
the American health care system?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. They often speak of going to a health care provider with
abdominal pain and the provider does a complete physical exam and
discovers that the woman is circumcised and is suddenly making
comments like, ``Oh my God what happened to you? This is the worst
thing I've ever seen!'' And then a patient in stirrups tries to
explain it through an interpreter. All the while, she's thinking,
``But what about my abdominal pain?'' And the fact is, she may or
may not have a problem with how her body looks, but she doesn't
want to be judged. Given how she's treated, it's possible she'll
never return to that provider again, even if she needs to.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Ideally, how should medical professionals react when they
encounter circumcised women?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I understand that female circumcision is a horrible act and I
empathize with the horror of the doctor, but what I ask is that a
physician not reveal their emotions and thoughts to the patient.
For people who haven't ever dealt with this, the whole thing may be
difficult to understand. One can say, ``it's a horrible practice
and it needs to be stopped.'' But the practice is very different
from the patient. The patient may or may not have wanted it
herself, or she may be happy with the way her body looks. In any
case, she should get sensitive and productive care.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What does your work with the circumcised African women do for
you?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. There are days when I feel so fulfilled. When women come to
me and tell me that their pain is gone, when they say ``I didn't
realize that sex didn't have to be painful,'' or they say, ``I had
so much fear about delivering my baby and it turned out to be so
easy.'' Those are certain things I feel really great about. &QL;

CONSUMER CREDIT GREW SHARPLY IN MAY 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN VAMES   
 c. 2000 NYTimes.com/TheStreet.com   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Americans expanded their debt burdens in May at the fastest rate
since January, the government said Monday, suggesting that higher
financing costs for everything from credit cards to mortgages have
done little to deter the American consumer from borrowing and
spending.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer credit grew by a seasonally adjusted $11.8 billion in
May, according to the Federal Reserve, bringing the annualized
growth rate to 9.8 percent. In April, consumer credit had grown at
a revised $8.8 billion, or 7.4 percent annual pace.
</P>
<P>
   The sharp growth in credit came even as other economic signs
suggested that consumer activity was slowing in May. For example,
retail sales took a 0.3 percent dive in May, largely due to falling
sales for items that are typically financed, such as autos and
big-ticket items like appliances. Additionally, businesses hired
fewer workers in May, causing the unemployment rate to jump to 4.1
percent in May from 3.9 percent in April. (Unemployment ticked back
down to 4.0 percent in June.)
</P>
<P>
   The fastest rate of consumer credit built up in May came from
so-called non-revolving credit, which includes debt for a one-time
use such as a car loan or a student loan. Non-revolving credit grew
10.5 percent, or $7.1 billion, in May, after growing at a much
slower 3.4 percent, or $816.2 billion, pace.
</P>
<P>
   Revolving credit, which includes reusable lines such as credit
cards and accounts for the majority of consumer debt, grew 8.9
percent, or $626.6 billion, following a 12.7 percent, or $622
billion, rise in April.
</P>
<P>
   The still-high rate of consumer credit could be a sign that
American consumers, who are responsible for about two-thirds of the
nation's economic growth, are continuing to borrow and spend, even
following six interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve in the
past year.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, higher interest rates slow demand by making it more
costly for consumers and businesses to borrow and spend, decreasing
the risk of inflation. Some areas of the economy, such as retail
sales, home sales and consumer confidence, have gotten weaker in
recent months, presumably due to higher rates. But other measures,
such as bulging consumer credit, a May rebound in factory orders
and the continued upward momentum in worker salaries are likely to
continue worrying policymakers.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed has raised rates six times in the past year, but held
rates steady at its most recent meeting on June 28, citing
``tentative and preliminary'' signs of an economic slowdown.

&HT;     CAMPAIGN FINANCE MEASURE TO GET ANOTHER COURT HEARING 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ZACHARY COILE  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Four years ago, California voters bucked the
political establishment and passed a ballot measure setting
stringent limits on contributions to state candidates and
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, Proposition 208, allowed donors to give no more
than $100 to local officials, $250 to legislators and $500 to
statewide candidates, or double that amount if the candidates
agreed to voluntary spending limits.
</P>
<P>
   But the initiative met the same fate as nearly every other
attempt by voters to change the system by which campaigns are
funded in California: It was tossed out by a federal judge as
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the same judge who rejected the 1996 initiative is
scheduled to begin hearing arguments in a second trial over
Proposition 208 in U.S. District Court in Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   An appeals court sent it back for a second trial so more
testimony could be heard.
</P>
<P>
   Proposition 208 was the law of land for just more than a year.
Shortly after it went into effect in January 1997, the major
political parties, unions and several conservative groups filed
suit, arguing the measure discriminates against some candidates and
restricts political speech.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Lawrence K. Karlton of Sacramento ultimately
agreed. After a three-week trial, he issued a preliminary
injunction, blocking the measure.
</P>
<P>
   The judge's decision created a political vacuum, leaving no
restrictions on contributions in a state that has become a showcase
for the pervasiveness and influence of money in politics.
</P>
<P>
   With the second trial looming and the future of Proposition 208
in doubt, the Legislature scrambled this week to put a new campaign
finance measure on the Nov. 7 ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Gray Davis, a Democrat, supports the initiative, but reform
advocates have blasted it as an effort to repeal Proposition 208
and replace it with a package of weaker restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole proposition is drafted by politicians for
politicians,'' said former Secretary of State Tony Miller, a
proponent of Proposition 208. ``They are protecting themselves,
notwithstanding what the people did in 1996.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's trial pits the state Fair Political Practices
Commission and reform activists, who are defending the 1996
measure, against some of the state's most influential political
groups: the Democratic and Republican state parties, several labor
unions, the California Pro-Life Council and others who filed suit
in 1997 to block the measure.
</P>
<P>
   Since the court threw out Proposition 208 in January 1998, state
legislators and top elected officials have been raking in
substantial campaign donations. Davis alone reported raising $13.2
million in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Despite voter support for contribution limits, the courts have
been hostile to such restrictions, saying they limit political free
speech. Before Proposition 208, two other California measures were
largely invalidated by the courts.
</P>
<P>
   ``There obviously is public interest in the imposition of these
kinds of limits,'' said Lawrence T. Woodlock, senior counsel to the
Fair Political Practices Commission. ``I suspect there is some
frustration on the part of members of the public that they keep
voting these things in and the courts keep throwing them out.
Sooner or later one of the measures is going to stick.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Proposition 208 was approved in November 1996 with 61 percent of
the vote. The measure, co-sponsored by Common Cause, the League of
Women Voters, the American Association of Retired Persons and
United We Stand, a Ross Perot spinoff group, called for:
</P>
<P>
   _ Restricting fund-raising to within one year of the primary for
statewide candidates and within six months of the primary for
legislative races.
</P>
<P>
   _ Limiting contributions to political action committees, or
PACs, to $500 per calendar year, and gifts to political parties to
$5,000 per calendar year.
</P>
<P>
   _ Setting voluntary spending limits of $14 million for the
governor's race, $3.5 million for other statewide offices, $700,000
for state Senate races and $350,000 for Assembly races.
</P>
<P>
   _ Allowing donors to give no more than $100 to local officials,
$250 to legislators and $500 to statewide candidates, or double if
the candidates agreed to voluntary spending limits.
</P>
<P>
   In his 1997 decision, Karlton found that restrictions on when
candidates could raise money unfairly hindered their ability to
seek contributions via direct mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``The effect of the initiative is not only to significantly
reduce a California candidate's ability to deliver his or her
message, but in fact to make it impossible for the ordinary
candidate to mount an effective campaign for office,'' the judge
wrote in his 43-page decision.
</P>
<P>
   The Fair Political Practices Commission appealed to the 9th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals, which sent the case back to the judge for
a second trial, for more testimony.

   APPLIED _ SAN FRANCISCO _ When it comes to semiconductors,
smaller is usually better _ except when it comes to making them,
that is. For years, semiconductor makers have been inching toward a
new production process that would double the number of chips they
could produce on a single wafer _ the thin waffle-like disks of
silicon where semiconductors get their start. But until now, they
haven't had all the equipment needed for mass production. Today,
Applied Materials Inc. is expected to introduce the first complete
line of equipment to make chips on bigger and higher capacity 300

industry on the fast track to building more efficient

<P>
   A few years ago, 13-year-old Drew Williams' asthma was so
severe, he could not even go to a movie. Once a fleck of dog
dander, a remnant from a pet-owner who previously had his seat,
sparked an attack. At school in Dillon, Colo., Drew's desk had to
be far from classmates who owned furry animals. That was despite
high doses of asthma medications he took every morning to open his
airways.
</P>
<P>
   Today, taking a new experimental treatment, called anti-IgE,
Drew can go anywhere he wants without fear that he will stop
breathing.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-IgE shots changed his life, Drew said. ``Before, I was
on tons and tons of medication.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he added, ``If I touched a dog, I'd be rushed to the
hospital. Now I can't really pet dogs, but I can toss them a
ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Drew is among 2,000 severe asthmatics participating in trials of
anti-IgE, one of a new class of treatments aimed at preventing
allergy and asthma attacks. The treatments, still experimental, are
aimed at stopping the attacks at their source. Most treatments
simply treat the symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly 80 years, scientists have known about the antibody
IgE or immunoglobulinE, which is one of five kinds of antibodies
that fight foreign substances. IgE is the one that reacts against
allergens causing hay fever and other allergic reactions. But only
recently have scientists considered using it for therapy. Shaped
like the letter Y, IgE has two tails that hang freely and one that
sticks to mast cells. When an allergen enters the body of a
susceptible person, it sticks to one of the free ends of IgE,
prompting the antibodies to link together. This cross-linking, in
turn, provokes the mast cells to spew its substances _ cytokines,
leukotrienes and histamines _ that cause itchy eyes and clogged
airways. The anti-IgE shots are made of a substance that blocks IgE
right where it attaches to the mast cell, foiling the chemical
cascade.
</P>
<P>
   Other new treatments block a cytokine or one kind of
leukotriene.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Peter Barnes, an expert on allergies at the National Heart
and Lung Institute in London, said the encouraging news was that
the shots seemed to be working for severe asthmatics, while other
new approaches had a limited effect because they were too specific.
For instance, a drug that blocks one kind of leukotriene may
prevent blocked airways but have no effect on itchy eyes.
</P>
<P>
   The hope is that this new family of treatments will be effective
and lead to fewer side effects than oral steroids, which are used
to treat patients with severe disease. Chronic use of oral steroids
can stunt growth in children and lead to brittle bone disease and
high blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   So far, a few small studies suggest that patients getting
anti-IgE shots once or twice a month suffer fewer flare-ups and
need less medication. Some patients are weaned off other drugs
completely.
</P>
<P>
   The results of two small random trials, in which half the
participants got the treatment and the rest a placebo, were
presented at the American Academy of Asthma and Immunology in San
Diego in March. One study included 334 asthmatic children ages 6 to
12. About 55 percent of those who got the shots no longer needed
the inhaled steroids, compared with 39 percent of those who got a
placebo. Another study of 525 adults found that those who got real
treatment, rather than a placebo, suffered fewer asthma attacks:
21.3 percent versus 32.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   These results confirm an earlier report, published in December
in The New England Journal of Medicine. In that study 314 patients
continued with their steroid treatment and in addition got either
high-dose anti-IgE, low-dose anti-IgE or a placebo. Asthma
symptoms, like chest tightness or wheezing were reduced by 42
percent among the high-dose group, 40 percent in the low-dose
group, and 30 percent in the placebo group. Anti-IgE is being
developed by Genentech, Novartis Pharma AG and Tanox, but it has
not received approval.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-IgE could have a major impact, said Dr. Henry Milgrom, one
of the investigators at the National Jewish Medical and Research
Center in Denver., a leading lung disease hospital. But, he said:
``I am reluctant to paint too rosy of a picture. There is
confirmation that has to come before you can draw firm
conclusions.''
</P>
<P>
   Other experts said the notion of allergy medication aimed at the
immune system was exciting, but they added that they were waiting
for the results of large trials to ensure the drugs were effective
and had few side effects.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Allan Weinstein, an internist in Washington and the author
of ``Asthma: The Complete Guide to Self-Management of Asthma and
Allergies'' (Ballantine, 1989), said: ``The greatest concern is
that while the death rate for so many diseases has dropped, it has
not budged for asthma. This treatment, if proven effective in large
studies, could be particularly useful for those with
difficult-to-manage disease.''
</P>
<P>
   Drew said he was grateful that he stuck with the study. ``In the
beginning when they told me it was shots twice a month, it was a
little scary,'' he said. ``But once I started, it wasn't so bad.
And now I can play without having to take extra medicine. It used
to be running to first base would take it out of me and I'd reach
for my inhaler. Now I can play baseball without worrying. I can
really do anything I want.''

INVITROGEN GETS SLAMMED AFTER DEXTER, LIFE TECHNOLOGIES DEALS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JENNIFER BARRETT   
 c. 2000 NYTimes.com/TheStreet.com   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shares of Invitrogen (IVGN:Nasdaq) plunged 24 percent Monday
after the company announced that it would acquire Dexter (DEX:NYSE)
and Life Technologies (LTEK:OTC) for a combination of cash and
stock valued at about $1.9 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Investors apparently saw the companies being acquired as the
primary beneficiaries of the proposed deals, sending Dexter's
shares up 9 percent and shares of Life Technologies up 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement includes a $65 million break-up fee, should Dexter
back out of the deal. But the Windsor Locks, Conn.-based company is
unlikely to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Dexter has been busy fending off hostile takeover bid attempts
by International Specialty Products (ISP:NYSE), a Delaware-based
manufacturer of specialty chemicals and mineral and filter
products. Last month, Dexter board members rejected the
International Specialty Products bid. Executives at the company,
which makes specialty biological and biochemical products, also
announced plans to sell off two major businesses for $675 million.
</P>
<P>
   After Invitrogen announced Sunday that it would acquire Dexter,
as well as Life Technologies, a source close to International
Specialty Products said the company was planning to drop its proxy
solicitation and withdraw its tender offer, ``depending upon market
developments.''
</P>
<P>
   Invitrogen's stock fell 18 3/4 to close at 58 3/8. Dexter's
shares climbed 4 1/8 to settle at 52 1/8. Shares of Life
Technologies rose 4 to end at 53 after reaching a 52-week high of
57 3/4.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Invitrogen, a San Diego-based company which makes
gene research kits and other scientific research products, said
they expected the acquisition of Dexter and Life Technologies to
increase the company's cash earnings per share by 30 percent in
2001, excluding nearly $1.5 billion in goodwill. Invitrogen
estimated that the combined company will have annual revenues in
excess of $500 million and approximately $100 million in operating
cash flow.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the agreements, Invitrogen will acquire all
of the outstanding common stock of Dexter for $62.50 a share, or
approximately $1.5 billion, and all of the outstanding common stock
of Life Technologies, other than the shares held by Dexter, for $60
a share, or approximately $400 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``This combination creates a new global leader in molecular
biology research and services,'' said Lyle C. Turner, Invitrogen's
chairman and chief executive. Turner will retain the same titles in
the combined company.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed acquisition is subject to the approval of the
shareholders of Dexter, Life Technologies and Invitrogen, as well
as the completion of the previously announced sales of Dexter's
electronics materials and nonwoven materials businesses which
includes food packaging and medical and industrial products.
</P>
<P>
   While analysts seemed optimistic about the potential of the
proposed company, they conceded that shares of Invitrogen could be
dragged down initially on investors' concerns about Life
Technologies' revenue growth potential.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Olan, an analyst with Chase H&AMP;Q, pointed out that Life
Technologies anticipated revenue growth of 12 percent to 13 percent
in 2000, while Invitrogen projects 25 percent top-line growth for
2000. The combined company would have 14 percent to 15 percent
annual top-line growth, and about 17 percent to 18 percent
bottom-line growth, but both would fall below the estimated growth
for Invitrogen alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the short term, Invitrogen shareholders are likely to
experience some downward volatility as investors take time to
digest the impact of this deal,'' Olan said. ``In the long term, we
believe Invitrogen will be one of the major players to take maximum
advantage of recent and future advances in genomics and
proteomics.'' Chase Securities maintains its buy rating on the
stock. It has had an underwriting relationship with Invitrogen
within the last three years.
</P>
<P>
   Other analysts were similarly optimistic about the potential of
the proposed powerhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Invitrogen is fast becoming the industry's leading provider of
the tools and re-agents of the genome era,'' said Todd Nelson,
analyst at Merrill Lynch, noting that the combined company will
boast one of the industry's largest product portfolios, with
potential annual revenues of more than $600 million.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch figures the combined company will be poised to
capture a significant share of the rapidly expanding market in
human genome and related products. If the merger is successful,
Nelson estimated the resulting company will be able to introduce as
many as 150 new products annually, in addition to Invitrogen's
approximately 5,500 existing products. Life Technologies, based in
Rockville, Md., develops and manufactures more than 10,000 products
used in life sciences research genetic engineering. Merrill Lynch
maintains a long-term buy rating on the Invitrogen stock. It makes
a market in the company's securities, but does not report any
underwriting relationships with Invitrogen.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Byrnes, an analyst at Dain Rauscher Wessels, called the
proposed company a molecular research ``powerhouse'' that will lead
the industry in gene cloning and genome analysis techniques.
</P>
<P>
   The firm cited the ``enormous'' amount of intellectual property
held by the combined company, including more than 200 company-owned
patents, and 300 technology licensing agreements involving an
additional 400 patents.
</P>
<P>
   ``The value of these patents combined with rights for new
products arising from discoveries involving its many alliances
could be an area of significant long-term upside,'' Byrnes
predicted in a report released Monday, adding that the merged
company could generate at least $30 million just by eliminating
duplicative systems. Dain Rauscher rates the Invitrogen stock a
strong buy, with a price target of $100. The firm has helped
underwrite a public offering of the corporation over the past three
years.

JDS UNIPHASE TO BUY SDL FOR $41 BILLION IN LARGEST TECH MERGER 
</HEADLINE>
   By TIM ARANGO   
 c. 2000 NYTimes.com/TheStreet.com   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JDS Uniphase (JDSU:Nasdaq), the world's largest maker of fiber
optics components, will buy SDL (SDLI:Nasdaq) in a stock deal
valued at close to $41 billion, the companies said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the deal, the largest technology acquisition
ever outside of telephony, each SDL share will be exchanged for 3.8
shares of JDS Uniphase stock. Based on Friday's closing prices, the
arrangement represents a 49.5 percent premium for SDL shareholders.
JDS closed last week at 116 3/16, up 2 3/36, while SDL was up 10
7/8 at 295 5/16.
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, JDS Uniphase stock plummeted, while SDL was up. JDS
Uniphase closed down 15 1/16, or 13 percent, at 101 1/8. SDL
finished up 25 3/8, or 9 percent, at 320 11/16 after reaching a
52-week high of 330 15/16.
</P>
<P>
   ``From SDL's standpoint, it's wonderful for shareholders,'' said
Terry O'Brien, an analyst at Branch Cabell &AMP; Co. in Richmond, Va.
who covers JDS Uniphase.
</P>
<P>
   The merger will speed up the development of high-capacity,
flexible optical networks that will allow quicker transmission of
data over the Internet, the companies said in statement. The deal
gives JDS Uniphase access to SDL's technology, particularly its
raman amplifiers, which allow laser signals to travel a greater
distance over fiber optic networks. JDS Uniphase has been a big
buyer of the devices.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the deal will increase JDS Uniphase's manufacturing
capacity, which lately has not been able to keep up with demand,
O'Brien said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is particularly good for SDL, because JDS has been
growing at such a fast pace that it has dwarfed SDL, which has no
financial capacity to grow fast enough to compete with JDS,'' he
said, noting that as of Friday's closing prices, the market valued
SDL at $22.5 billion, while JDS Uniphase's market capitalization
was $86.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   JDS has acquired 17 companies since 1995, including, most
recently, E-Tek Dynamics, which it bought for $20.4 billion last
month.
</P>
<P>
   However, JDS may be growing too big, too fast. ``In my mind, it
certainly raises antitrust concerns because of the size of the
deal,'' O'Brien said. O'Brien has a long-term buy on JDS Uniphase
stock, and has a 12-month price target of 140. His firm has not
performed underwriting for the company.
</P>
<P>
   Another analyst, James Waggoner, the director of research at
Sands Brothers &AMP; Co., had similar concerns. ``They are going to
look at it very closely,'' he said of regulators, although
eventually he believes the Department of Justice will approve the
deal. Waggoner has a strong buy on JDS Uniphase and a buy rating on
SDL. His firm, too, has not performed underwriting for either
company.
</P>
<P>
   In a conference call, company officials assured analysts that
the deal will pass regulatory muster. And since JDS recently worked
with the Justice Department to get its E-Tek deal through, analysts
are confident company management can be successful at convincing
regulators, Waggoner said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts were slightly surprised by the price tag, but noted
that the deal -- as opposed to R&AMP;D deals that take years to pay
dividends -- is expected to pay off immediately for JDS Uniphase's
bottom line. However, the high price was the result of a bidding
war for the company, which included Corning (GLW:NYSE), Waggoner
said. ``Clearly, the company held an auction,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the analyst conference call Monday, the company indicated
that quarterly earnings for JDS Uniphase, E-Tek and SDL will all
beat Wall Street analysts' estimates.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, which is expected to close in December, is the largest
U.S. high-tech acquisition, and among the top 20 largest M&AMP;A deals
of all time, according to Thomson Financial Securities Data.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose, Calif.-based SDL, which counted JDS Uniphase as one of
its largest customers, has about 1,700 employees and had sales of
$72 million in the first quarter, ended March 31. JDS Uniphase,
based in Nepean, Ontario, has more than 17,000 employees and
reported sales of $395 million in its fiscal third quarter, ended
March 31.
</P>
<P>
   JDS Uniphase was advised by Banc of America Securities and CIBC
World Markets. SDL was advised by Thomas Weisel Partners.

HONEYWELL REPORTS EARNINGS SLIGHTLY ABOVE ESTIMATES 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Conglomerate Honeywell (HON:NYSE) said Monday its second-quarter
earnings will slightly beat Wall Street estimates.
</P>
<P>
   The company expects earnings per share for the second quarter at
75 cents, up a penny from the consensus among Wall Street analysts,
according to First Call/Thomson Financial, a research firm that
tracks such statistics. It earned 66 cents per share in the same
period last year.

   Quarterly sales are expected to be $6.3 billion, up 6 percent
from last year's second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The company attributed the gains to sales growth in its
aerospace and home and building products, as well as cost-cutting
initiatives aimed at balancing shortfalls stemmimg from higher raw
material costs and higher debt service costs due to higher interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the Morris Township, N.J.-based company
announced it will merge its polymers and specialty chemicals
business into one unit, which will have about $3.3 billion in
annual sales and approximately 10,000 employees.

ALCOA TOPS ESTIMATES 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN VAMES   
 c. 2000 NYTimes.com/TheStreet.com   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alcoa (AA:NYSE), the world's biggest producer of aluminum and
related products, reported a sharp 57 percent jump in
second-quarter earnings Monday, beating Wall Street estimates as
the company implemented major cost-cutting efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Alcoa earned 47 cents a diluted share in the second quarter, up
from 34 cents a share in the second quarter of 1999, beating the
consensus of analysts' estimates for a profit of 45 cents a share,
according to First Call/Thomson Financial. Net income totaled $377
million, up from $240 million in the year-earlier period.
</P>
<P>
   Alcoa said the strong earnings were helped by ongoing
cost-cutting efforts that started in mid-1998, when the company
targeted $1.1 billion in annualized cost savings. The company said
it has thus far achieved $884 million in annual savings, and
expects to reach its target by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   A year-over-year increase in aluminum prices and a pickup in
demand also helped drive earnings higher, offsetting costs related
to acquisitions and higher prices for energy, a major factor in
aluminum production.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Alcoa, one of the 30 components of the Dow Jones
Industrial Average, rose a sharp 7 percent on the news, climbing 1
7/8 to settle at 29 1/2.
</P>
<P>
   The Pittsburgh-based company said its revenue rose 40 percent in
the second quarter to $5.6 billion vs. $4 billion in the
year-earlier period.
</P>
<P>
   The results were diluted by two months of operating results from
Reynolds Metals and one month of results from Cordant Technologies,
both of which were acquired in the second quarter. The report did
not include earnings from Reynolds assets that Alcoa had agreed to
sell as part of that acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   Though the acquired companies were dilutive to earnings in the
second quarter, the company said it expects Reynolds and Cordant
operations to add to its net earnings for its full-year results.

   GORE-MILITARY (Undated) _ A look at the military service of Al
Gore: In some ways, Army Private Al Gore was never and could never
have been just one of the guys, another grunt. Recruiters were
afraid to even sign him up without calling in a supervisor, once
they heard his name and caught on that he was that anti-war Sen.
Albert Gore's son, just out of Harvard. No less than the Army's
highest-ranking officer, Gen. William Westmoreland, singled him out
during a visit to Fort Rucker, Ala., where Pvt. Gore was stationed
for more than a year. The Army chief of staff stopped in the middle
of an official farewell ceremony to pull the young man aside for a
private chat _ and kept Gore's superior officers waiting, and
watching, while he asked one of the lowest-ranking guys on base for
his thoughts on why so many young people opposed the war. Yet there
is no evidence that Gore sought special treatment, or that the
extra notice he got anyway provided any real protection. On the
contrary, within the parameters of his job as an Army journalist,
Gore probably assumed more risk than he had to, choppering around
South Vietnam interviewing soldiers who had just seen action. By
Melinda Henneberger. 4,300 words.

   CLANCY-CHARITY (Undated) _ In 1992, Tom Clancy embarked on a
philanthropic mission worthy of Jack Ryan, the idealistic hero of
his popular techno-thrillers. Clancy wanted to help children who
had cancer and other grave illnesses use the Internet to talk to
one another and learn about their diseases. His children's health
network would also enable parents to search out the best doctors.
And it would let doctors tap into the same worldwide database to
share their expertise and find the latest research. Now Clancy is
scuttling the foundation, which despite spending more than $5
million, did not even have a Web site to show for its efforts. What
went wrong is now the subject of a legal mud fight. And the IRS is
examining the charity's financial records to decide whether to
revoke its tax-deductible status. Friends and associates say they
do not blame Clancy for undertaking what they see as a visionary
project. Several, however, faulted the best-selling author for
failing to keep a closer eye on the venture. By Michael Moss and
Jim Rutenberg.

LOSER TAKE ALL: JASON BIGGS IS A WINNING `LOSER' 
</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not
prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative
DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.) 
 (She also has information on how to subscribe to StarBeat, a weekly
package of five intriguing features with color art.) 
 (Includes a color slide of Jason Biggs in a scene from ``Loser.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    Talk about the perfect storm.
 &HT;    ```American Pie' put me on the map and it got the storm going,
got it brewing,'' says actor Jason Biggs, who so memorably shared
an intimate moment with a warm apple pie in last summer's sleeper
hit. ``I've got two movies out this summer and I'm working on two
more movies. Everything is heating up even more.
 &HT;    ``It's really, really exciting and it's really cool,'' the young
actor says. ``I'll tell you what, I don't mind these conditions. I
hope it doesn't stop storming for a long time, man _ I hope I don't
see the sun for a while.''
 &HT;    Biggs may not be quite ready to give George Clooney a run for
his money, either as a hunk or as a box-office draw, but he's
getting there. With dark hair and a broad smile that make him
resemble a young Adam Sandler, Biggs chased ``American Pie'' with
this summer's dreadful ``Boys and Girls,'' scoring the film's only
positive notices with his entertaining turn as Freddie Prinze Jr.'s
quirky, advice-spouting college sidekick.
 &HT;    And on July 21 Biggs will sweep back into theaters with
``Loser,'' a romantic comedy from Amy Heckerling, the director of
``Fast Times at Ridgemont High'' (1982) and ``Clueless'' (1995).
Biggs plays Paul Tannek, a good-natured small-town kid struggling
to hold his own at college in New York, a task made harder by
Paul's knack for hideous hats, pratfalls and abuse from others.
 &HT;    Along the way, he falls for Dora _ played by Biggs' ``American
Pie'' co-star Mena Suvari _ a student with precious little money, a
lot of attitude and the hots for an English-literature professor
(Greg Kinnear). Paul and Dora are perfect for each other, of
course, but that's something they need to discover for themselves.
 &HT;    ``I want to say it was easy to play a dork,'' the amiable Biggs
says by telephone from Los Angeles' Four Seasons hotel, where he's
busily promoting ``Loser.'' ``Is that weird? `Yeah, it was a piece
of cake!'
 &HT;    ``In `American Pie' and here again in `Loser' I'm playing that
guy who is kind of the outsider, who is kind of dorky,'' he
explains. ``The cool thing about it in both cases for me, and the
challenge for me, is that the audience has to like these guys, root
for them and sympathize with them, or else the movie doesn't work.
 &HT;    ``I could certainly relate to Paul, to an extent,'' Biggs adds.
``I think everyone can. Maybe I'm just saying that to make myself
feel better, but I can relate to feeling like an outsider at times.
I certainly felt that way in high school and especially when I went
off to college (New York University for a semester, then New
Jersey's Montclair State University for a few weeks).
 &HT;    ``I still feel like an outsider at times.''
 &HT;    To Hollywood, however, Biggs is rapidly becoming an insider. He
assumes leading-man status with ``Loser.'' He's the guy, the male
star. He's the loser.
 &HT;    ``It's cool,'' he admits, ``but I've never looked at it, and nor
do I now, as `I want this rested on my shoulders. It's my name, my
movie, I'm the lead, blah, blah, blah.' To me, yeah, I'm playing
the titular loser, but it's Amy's film, and Mena is as much a part
of it as I am.
 &HT;    ``That Amy, who also wrote the script for the movie, wanted me
to play her guy, her loser who she wanted to bring to life on
screen through me, was just such a thrill,'' Biggs says. ``I'd pay
to work with her. There's also Greg Kinnear and Jimmi Simpson,
Thomas Sadoski and Zak Orth, who play my roommates.
 &HT;    ``Yeah, I'm the loser, but there's no `Loser' without everyone
else.''
 &HT;    Biggs will turn up next in a dramatic role, co-starring as the
boyfriend of deeply troubled Christina Ricci in the upcoming
adaptation of Elizabeth Wurtzel's ``Prozac Nation.'' Then he'll
take the lead in ``Saving Silverman,'' a comedy about a recently
engaged young man (Biggs) whose friends (Jack Black and Steve Zahn)
try to convince their pal that his fiancee (Amanda Peet) is an evil
shrew. Down the line, of course, he's likely to pocket a small
fortune for ``American Pie 2.''
 &HT;    Many actors in Biggs' enviable position have blown the
opportunity. They've sold out for huge paychecks. They've become
major jerks. Or both. Or worse.
 &HT;    Biggs, who grew up in Hasbrouck Heights, N.J., and counts among
his earlier credits the television shows ``Drexel's Class''
(1991-1992), ``As the World Turns'' (1994-1995) and ``Total
Security'' (1997), as well as the Broadway play ``Conversations
with My Father'' on Broadway, vows that temptation won't get the
better of him.
 &HT;    ``Money?'' he says. ``I'm doing well for my age. I don't need to
sell out for big paychecks at this point in my career. Hopefully I
never will. I'm doing fine. Because of `American Pie,' I can be a
bit pickier about my roles.
 &HT;    ``It sounds trite, but I'm all about my work,'' he says. ``I'm
about making the right choices, having fun with my characters and
working with the right people. I don't want to do a crappy movie
for a big paycheck _ I'd rather do an awesome movie for nothing.''
 &HT;    Biggs also would rather not evolve into a jerk, if it's all the
same.
 &HT;    ``I'd like to think I've got my head on pretty straight,'' says
the actor, who is single and lives in Los Angeles. ``As far as ego
and becoming a hard person to deal with, I attribute my not falling
into that to the way I was raised. I'm a firm believer in karma _
what goes around comes around.
 &HT;    ``I have no desire to be a jerk, to be that guy who is hard to
deal with,'' Biggs says. ``I want to have fun. I want to be the guy
everyone talks about as, `Wow, man, he's cool. He's nice. And he's
great to work with.'
 &HT;    ``It would make me feel good to think other people think that.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   The future of the stalled International Space Station could
hinge on a star.
</P>
<P>
   Construction of what is to become the largest structure that
humans have ever put into space has been on hold, awaiting the late
arrival of the station's critical Russian-made command and living
section.
</P>
<P>
   The long-overdue service module, called Zvezda, which means
``star'' in Russian, is to rocket into orbit Wednesday and put an
end to the hiatus of almost two years in building what is to become
a sprawling international research complex in space.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say that successfully launching Zvezda is one of the
most critical steps in the $60-billion project, for both
engineering and political reasons. The rest of the station, which
could take another five years to finish, cannot be built without
this pivotal piece in place. And loss of this module in a launching
accident, which would further delay construction and drive up
costs, could mean political death for the project, some say.
</P>
<P>
   Zvezda, the primary Russian contribution to the space station,
is to be launched atop a three-stage Proton rocket at 12:56 a.m.
Eastern time tomorrow from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan.
After two weeks of orbital maneuvers and equipment checks, the
service module is to dock with the budding space station on July
25.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the most critical pieces of the International
Space Station,'' said James Oberg of Houston, an expert on the
Russian space program and a former engineer with the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration. Zvezda is the first in a
string of one-of-a-kind space station sections for which there are
no backups if something goes wrong, Oberg said, and is perhaps the
most crucial of these because Zvezda is to control the whole
station and keep it in space during the early stages of
construction.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would probably take at least three years for Zvezda to be
replaced,'' Oberg said. ``This is the first of a series of things
that really can't go wrong if the project is to stay on track.''
</P>
<P>
   Oberg noted, however, that he was confident that the launching
of Zvezda and its mating with the current two components of the
station would be successful, even if initial problems occurred.
``This has been very well planned and the Russians know what they
are doing,'' he said, ``There are many layers of fallback
procedures and redundant systems that give me some confidence it
will work.''
</P>
<P>
   The International Space Station is the work of 16 nations, led
by the United States. The partners, including members of the
European Space Agency and Canada, Japan, Brazil and Russia, have
already spent billions of dollars building more than 300,000 pounds
of equipment for the station, which ultimately is to weigh almost a
million pounds and, with its huge solar power panels, span an area
the size of two football fields.
</P>
<P>
   The 42,000-pound service module originally was scheduled to be
launched in April 1998, but lack of money prevented the Russian
Space Agency from finishing it on time. With support from NASA,
which bought equipment and services from the Russians, the module
was slowly completed. But the project dragged on, causing tension
between the United States and Russia because the Russians continued
to spend their scarce resources on their aging Mir space station at
the expense of the international program.
</P>
<P>
   The service module was almost ready to fly last fall when a
series of failures with the normally reliable Proton rocket caused
more delays. NASA insisted this spring that Russia correct the
rocket problems and launch Zvezda by this summer, or the agency
would launch an American interim control module and continue space
station construction without waiting for the Russians.
</P>
<P>
   Marcia S. Smith, a space policy analyst for the Congressional
Research Service of the Library of Congress, said that getting
Zvezda off the ground would be an important step in soothing
tensions in the space station coalition. ``It's a very significant
launch in terms of the relationships of the partners in the
project,'' Smith said, ``particularly the United States and Russia,
and to construction of the space station itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said that a loss of the service module would cause
substantial delays in building the space station and drive up
costs, but it would not necessarily kill the project. ``A lot of
people say it would be catastrophic if it fails, but I wouldn't go
that far,'' she said. ``There are a number of contingency and
backup plans that could be implemented to continue the project.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Russian and American space officials are optimistic that
the worst is over and space station construction can proceed
rapidly once Zvezda is in place. ``There have been some struggles,
but it's very exciting to see it coming together,'' said Mark
Geyer, NASA's manager for station integration.
</P>
<P>
   Zvezda will not only provide living quarters for the initial
crews to run the station, it also will command the station's
position in space and control all electrical, computer,
communications and flight systems for the complex. Astronauts will
use it for housing and for conducting some research, but Zvezda
will also be the base for spacewalks needed for maintenance and
accelerating station construction.
</P>
<P>
   One American and two Russian astronauts are set to take up
residence in November as ``Expedition 1,'' the first crew beginning
permanent occupation of the station.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Baker, director of NASA operations in Russia, said at a
briefing on Friday in Moscow that Zvezda was ``the beginning of the
real assembly of the International Space Station, with 15 launches
scheduled in the next calendar year.'' Officials said that during
the eight American space shuttle flights, and Russian missions
involving two Soyuz craft with crews and five Progress cargo ships,
the station would receive expanded solar power arrays, stabilizing
gyroscopes, an American science laboratory and tons of fuel and
supplies for growth.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the briefing said that two flights since early June
of the modified Proton rocket that would carry Zvezda had been
successful, including one on July 5 that had what they called a
minor malfunction in its second stage. Sergei Shayevich, a senior
manager at the Khrunichev State Research and Production Center,
which makes the rocket, said a drop in chamber pressure in the
rocket stage at the end of its operation was unlikely to affect the
Zvezda launching.

 By GARY GRAFF  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    It's been nearly 20 years since Duran Duran blew out of England
to declare that ``This is planet Earth'' and become the 'N Sync of
the 1980s.
 &HT;    But though those heady days are long gone, the group has
released its 11th album, ``Pop Trash,'' and its members say they're
still ``Hungry Like the Wolf.''
 &HT;    ``I think we've had a hard time since the sort of hysteria and
screaming of the mid-'80s,'' keyboardist Nick Rhodes says. ``We
really lost a lot of ground with the more serious end of the music
press.
 &HT;    ``I think music lovers stuck with us because they liked the
music, they liked the songs,'' Rhodes says. ``They saw where we
were coming from and really listened to the records _ they knew
there was plenty of depth in there and interesting ideas and some
good tunes, and they stuck with it.
 &HT;    ``But I think a lot of the media just thought, `OK, this is for
girls now. This isn't something for a serious audience,''' he
concludes. ``It was a double-edged sword: It helped propel us into
a much stronger position with a bigger audience, but at the same
time I think we lost a lot of the momentum we had for, I suppose,
what is normally termed credibility _ although I'm not sure that
word means anything.''
 &HT;    Credibility is, in fact, what Duran Duran had at the outset of
its career in 1980, when the group's original lineup came together
and recorded bouncy, danceable pop songs such as ``Girls on Film''
and ``Planet Earth'' that _ in addition to the group's haute
fashion and stylish videos _ were considered cutting-edge pop at
the dawn of the MTV age.
 &HT;    But within two years Duran's cult appeal went widescreen with
hits such as ``Hungry Like the Wolf,'' ``Rio,'' ``Save a Prayer''
and ``Union of the Snake,'' and the group was the object of the
same kind of screaming, teen-oriented mass adulation that the
Backstreet Boys and 'N Sync experience today. Rolling Stone
magazine even dubbed the quintet ``The Fab Five'' in recognition of
their Beatles-like popularity.
 &HT;    ``We got a ride and we thought it was going to slow down any
minute,'' the 38-year-old Rhodes says. ``But it didn't slow down
for five years.''
 &HT;    The group actually put the brakes on itself, dividing into two
separate camps to form the side groups Power Station and Arcadia.
Members began to drop out along the way _ first guitarist Andy
Taylor and drummer Roger Taylor, then bassist John Taylor in 1997.
Rhodes and frontman Simon LeBon now comprise the band, along with
former Frank Zappa and Missing Persons guitarist Warren Cuccurullo,
who joined during 1987.
 &HT;    Beside those departures, Duran Duran also suffered the
inevitable backlash that comes with great success. A series of
albums during the late 1980s and early 1990s were met with
indifference, as their fans moved on to other pop heroes and then
to heavier modern-rock heroes such as Nirvana and Pearl Jam.
 &HT;    The group enjoyed a spike during 1993 with two Top 10 singles _
``Ordinary World'' and ``Come Undone'' _ but hasn't made the charts
since.
 &HT;    ``We came out of being a nostalgia item and became a current
item, which was very important for us,'' the 41-year-old LeBon
says. ``But we never stopped working _ we tried and tried and tried
again to become current. There's never been a comeback as far as
we're concerned.''
 &HT;    Likewise, the group has purposefully avoided becoming part of
the 1980s pop revues that dot the concert landscape, especially
during the summer season.
 &HT;    ``Oh my God, I can't think of anything worse,'' Rhodes says with
a laugh. ``We're not a nostalgia act. I have no problem with anyone
from the '80s, '90s or '70s going out and earning a living and
giving people a good time at a show. That's fine _ just not our
thing.
 &HT;    ``We acknowledge that we came out of the '80s,'' he adds, ``but
then so did Prince. So did Madonna. So did U2. So did Depeche Mode.
A lot of interesting things came out that are still relevant and
creative and fresh.''
 &HT;    With ``Pop Trash,'' Duran Duran is trying to rebound from the
commercial and creative disappointment of its 1997 album
``Medazzaland,'' which led to the group's departure from its
longtime label, Capitol Records, and its eventual signing with
Hollywood Records, the musical arm of the Disney empire.
 &HT;    ``We had a bad taste in our mouth after the `Medazzaland'
debacle,'' LeBon says. ``We basically lost the interest of our
record company _ they didn't want to put more money behind it and
promote it.
 &HT;    ``But while there's the temptation to try to pass the buck and
blame other people,'' the singer adds, ``in the back of your mind
you think, `Yeah, if it had been a stronger piece of work, maybe
things would have gone better.'''
 &HT;    LeBon, Rhodes and Cuccurullo had reason to be optimistic about
``Pop Trash,'' however. They were excited about the album's first
single, ``Someone Else Not Me,'' which had been conceived during a
promotional video shoot for ``Medazzaland,'' while the three
musicians jammed on a riff Cucurullo began playing during a break
in the session.
 &HT;    ``We put it away,'' LeBon says, ``and after (`Medazzaland') came
out and we toured and everything, we went back in and the first
thing we started working on was that song. It was a good starting
point, and really set a standard for the rest of the album that
inspired us.''
 &HT;    Duran Duran also received an unexpected gift in the form of the
song ``Pop Trash Movie,'' which ultimately gave the album its
title. Rhodes and Cuccurullo had written it for Blondie's reunion
album, and went so far as to conceal it from LeBon, for fear that
he'd want to keep it for Duran Duran.
 &HT;    But when Blondie wound up not using the song, all three were
quick to snap it up for their own album.
 &HT;    ``I was rubbing my hands with glee and said, `Well, I'll have
that,''' says LeBon, who ceded most of the lyric writing on ``Pop
Trash'' to Rhodes. ``I hadn't heard it. It's a great song, and they
knew damn well if I'd have ever heard it before it went to Blondie,
I'd have wanted it. They were being clever.
 &HT;    ``But I think Duran Duran's done a better job with it.''
 &HT;    Rhodes agrees.
 &HT;    ``In a way, all the irony and humor of it suited us in exactly
the same way it suited Blondie,'' he says. ``I often see many
parallels with some of the things they'd done and some of the
things we'd done. We stayed together, but we had our down periods,
too _ although perhaps not as gruesome as theirs.
 &HT;    ``But I think they were very innovative, with a lot of good
ideas,'' he says, ``and perhaps didn't get the credit they
deserved. They wrote some amazing songs.''
 &HT;    The same, of course, might be said of Duran Duran. But while the
days of the Fab Five may be long gone, Rhodes says the remaining
three see enough evidence of their impact to feel redeemed.
 &HT;    ``We've learned that success isn't measured by how many records
you sell,'' the keyboardist says. ``But I still get the greatest
kick out of seeing someone dance to one of our songs. To me, that's
as important as anyone buying the record.''

FILMMAKERS

 (Includes a color slide of Chris Weitz with Michael White in a
scene from ``Chuck &AMP; Buck.'') 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago. 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    ``These days we get paid for what used to earn us trips to the
principal's office,'' Chris Weitz says.
 &HT;    It's 1 p.m. at the Los Angeles offices shared by Weitz and his
brother Paul, and the telephone won't stop ringing. It hasn't, in
fact, since last summer, when their movie ``American Pie'' _ Chris
co-produced, Paul directed _ became an unexpected $100 million
box-office hit.
 &HT;    Move over, Coen brothers. Get nervous, Wachowskis. The Weitzes
are in town.
 &HT;    And they're busy, too. Right now they're editing ``Down to
Earth,'' their remake of ``Here Comes Mr. Jordan'' (1941), starring
Chris Rock, which will debut this fall. By then ``Nutty Professor
II: The Klumps,'' which they helped pen, should be climbing the
box-office charts. And they're producing the inevitable ``American
Pie II,'' which should begin annoying parents sometime next summer.
 &HT;    Oh, and then there's the independent film ``Chuck &AMP; Buck,''
opening nationwide on July 21, in which the two actually make their
acting debuts.
 &HT;    If there's anything in the genes, they should do all right:
Their mother is Susan Kohner, who was nominated for an Oscar for
``Imitation of Life'' (1959).
 &HT;    ``It was weird for us to act, but I knew my vanity would
overcome my fear,'' Chris Weitz says. ``Plus I've known the film's
director, Miguel Arteta, since college. He asked me to do this
almost as a dare.
 &HT;    ``And once they cast me, they needed someone who would look like
me.''
 &HT;    The film is the story of Buck (Mike White), a misfit, stuck in
childhood, who lives with his mother and spends his days eating
candy and playing teen-age records. When his mother dies, Buck
meets up with his old friend Chuck (Chris Weitz) at the funeral.
 &HT;    Chuck is an agent, living in Los Angeles with his beautiful
fiancee, but Buck can't get over the fact that they're not buddies
the way they used to be. So he moves to Los Angeles and starts
stalking poor Chuck.
 &HT;    When he's rebuffed, he writes a play based on their lives called
``Hank &AMP; Frank,'' and casts a Buck look-alike (Paul Weitz) as one
of the leads.
 &HT;    ``The only trick I learned from our films was not to do too
much,'' Chris says. ``You should pare it down and let the audience
bring their own stuff to it. So most of my impulses to overact were
put aside.''
 &HT;    Particularly difficult was a semi-explicit gay love scene for
Chris.
 &HT;    ``I was nervous about stinking it up,'' he says. ``It's not a
lifestyle choice I'm familiar with, but I've never had a problem
with it, either. I've always been Mr. Politically Correct _ and now
I had to live up to my political credo.
 &HT;    ``Frankly, it wasn't as weird as a heterosexual love scene,'' he
says with a laugh, ``which is more complicated because I've done
that in real life.''
 &HT;    Both brothers claim that they didn't miss directing.
 &HT;    ``We watched our friend Miguel get more and more haggard,'' Paul
recalls. ``We would say, `Ah, that's not our problem.' When `cut'
was yelled, we'd say, `Adios!'''
 &HT;    That isn't the case with ``Down to Earth,'' on which the two are
co-writers and co-directors. It's a zany, off-the-wall comedy which
the brothers can't describe without finishing one another's
thoughts.
 &HT;    ``Chris Rock is a screw-up of a stand-up comic who is booed off
the stage at the Apollo,'' Chris says.
 &HT;    ``This screw-up angel played by Eugene Levy can't stand the
sight of blood,'' Paul chimes in, ``so he takes Chris before a
truck hits him.''
 &HT;    Rock ends up in heaven _ but not just any heaven.
 &HT;    ``Our version of heaven has a velvet rope, like when you're
trying to get into a disco,'' Paul says.
 &HT;    ``It's a 1950s supper club that stretches into infinity,'' Chris
says.
 &HT;    But it turns out that Rock's character would have survived the
accident, and so he's returned to earth ... this time in the body
of a white billionaire.
 &HT;    It's a funny concept, one which sold almost instantly _ as does
practically anything the Weitzes write, nowadays.
 &HT;    ``The funny thing is that we can't even believe it,'' Chris
says. ``We're the guys who were winging it on `American Pie.' We're
the guys who had never made a film before.''
 &HT;    ``Execs would show up to the set of `American Pie' and ask, `Do
you know what you're doing, boys?''' Paul recalls.
 &HT;    Apparently they do. The success of ``American Pie'' has made
them Hollywood's flavor of the month, which is all the more
surprising for two young men who grew up in New York, far from the
movie industry _ despite the fact that their grandfather, Paul
Kohner, was an influential Hollywood agent, representing John
Huston among others.
 &HT;    ``Strangely, show biz wasn't all around us,'' Paul says. ``Or
maybe we didn't get it. People with thick European accents like
Ingmar Bergman and Billy Wilder were cronies of our grandfather,
but we didn't realize they were great filmmakers. We were
clueless.''
 &HT;    They didn't show any especial filmmaking aptitude in their
youth, he recalls.
 &HT;    ``I tried to make a film in college and almost had a nervous
breakdown,'' Paul says. ``I didn't have any talent. I pulled the
plug on myself.''
 &HT;    Instead, the two decided to try their hand as screenwriters. A
short stint executive-producing and writing ABC's retread of
``Fantasy Island'' put them on the map, and established connections
which led to scripting chores on ``Antz'' (1998) and ``Madeline''
(1998).
 &HT;    The Weitzes then used the success of ``Antz'' to wangle the
director's chair for ``American Pie'' _ which, they admit, was
something of a shot in the dark.
 &HT;    ``I always heard good directors vomit on the way to the set the
first day,'' Paul says. ``I kept hoping and waiting to feel my
stomach churn, but it never happened. So naturally, I was very
worried.
 &HT;    ``But I guess it worked out OK,'' he says. ``I didn't do a
miserable job _ which is something I only realized in the editing
room, when the shots could actually be cut together.''
 &HT;    The two have plenty of irons in the fire _ among other things,
they're currently writing a script about the Culinary Institute of
America _ but will find time to see ``Nutty Professor II,'' if only
to see how much of their script remains in the final picture, which
was worked on by several other writers.
 &HT;    ``Frankly, we don't know how it turned out,'' Paul admits. ``As
happens on most of these things, writers come in and out. But it
was great to write for Eddie Murphy.
 &HT;    ``We actually met with Eddie, who gave us good advice,'' Paul
adds. ``He said, `Always make it fun. But when the character is the
midst of a horrifying situation, let him keep some dignity.''
 &HT;    ``So that's our rule,'' Chris says. ``We try to inject as much
emotion into a situation as possible, and then let the comedy take
care of itself.''

 (Includes a color slide of Kathie Lee Gifford with Regis Philbin in
a scene from ``Live With Regis and Kathie Lee.'') 
 By SIMON HOUPT  
 c.2000 TV Guide Canada  
 Not to be published in Canada before July 23, 2000. 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The only thing we know for certain is that there will be tears.
</P>
<P>
   When Kathie Lee Gifford steps off the set of ``Live with Regis
and Kathie Lee'' for the last time on July 28, she will bring down
the curtain on one of the unlikeliest successes in television
talk-show history.
</P>
<P>
   The producers of ``Live With'' are planning a weeklong
commemoration of the 15 years Gifford has spent next to Regis
Philbin. Perhaps they'll treat us to some moments from the early
years when their New York-based chatfest was called simply ``The
Morning Show,'' before it was rechristened to take advantage of the
co-hosts' increasing popularity.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe we'll see Kathie Lee and Reege, our favorite dysfunctional
duo, taking each other down a notch while co-hosting the 1991 Miss
America Pageant. We'll definitely get some clips of them snapping
at each other through the years _ let's face it, that was one of
the main reasons we watched the show every morning.
</P>
<P>
   After all is said and done, though, there will be tears. You
don't end a 15-year relationship _ even one as famously
antagonistic as Philbin and Gifford's _ without some misty eyes in
the house.
</P>
<P>
   When the show began in 1985, Philbin was the household name. He
had already been a television talk-show staple for more than 20
years, beginning as a sidekick to Joey Bishop and later becoming a
well-known personality in his own right.
</P>
<P>
   Gifford, meanwhile, was nothing more than a substitute host on
``Good Morning America.'' She was hired as a second banana to
Philbin, but it didn't take long for their vinegar-and-honey
chemistry to take them to the top of the ratings.
</P>
<P>
   He was the man-about-town, telling us about the hot new
restaurants and the great shows on Broadway starring all of his
friends. She was the doting mother of two who emerged from her
Connecticut hideaway every morning just long enough to get on his
nerves.
</P>
<P>
   For awhile that's how it stayed. But in recent years each has
found new fame and fortune.
</P>
<P>
   True, there were some stumbles along the way _ after launching a
popular clothing line, Gifford weathered allegations of profiting
from sweatshops. But she's a fighter: In the end, labor advocates
cheered her for helping to shine the spotlight on sweatshop
practices around the world. She even rose above her husband's
infidelity, keeping her marriage together through a furious storm
of tabloid coverage.
</P>
<P>
   And now, at age 46, Gifford is widening her horizons. After
years of flirting with live performance, she finally made her
Broadway debut last December, replacing Carol Burnett one night a
week in the Stephen Sondheim revue ``Putting It Together.'' A new
CD on her own record label features Gifford warbling cabaret-style
renditions of songs such as Van Morrison's ``Moondance,'' Irving
Berlin's ``I Got Lost in His Arms'' and a few of her own
Broadway-style compositions.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, of course, Philbin has been keeping himself busy with
a little prime-time game show.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a good time for me to leave,'' Gifford said recently.
``Regis won't even notice I'm gone.''
</P>
<P>
   If not, he must have gone deaf and blind. In addition to five
days of farewell shows, the airwaves will be flooded with Gifford
during her final week. She'll bounce from Letterman on Wednesday to
her alma-mater ``Good Morning America'' on Thursday. On Friday,
after her final show, she'll stop by for a chat with the ladies on
``The View.''
</P>
<P>
   Philbin has been instrumental in the search for her replacement.
Co-host chemistry is the key ingredient to the unscripted,
unrehearsed ``Live With,'' so it's not going to be easy to find
someone to sit next to Philbin for an hour each day and fill in his
pauses.
</P>
<P>
   Since Gifford announced at the end of February that this would
be her final season, executive producer Michael Gelman has brought
a regular stream of hopefuls through the ``Live With'' studio in
New York, each blessed with a brief shot at the big time.
</P>
<P>
   Last month former weathergirl Jillian Barberie spent an hour at
Philbin's side, throwing around sexual innuendo in an on-air tryout
that many felt went over the top. ``Live With'' might go for her if
the show wants to attract a younger audience, but it seems more
likely that someone of an older, more conservative vintage will get
the nod.
</P>
<P>
   New York television personality Kathleen Murphy is considered a
front-runner. ``The View's'' resident comedian, Joy Behar, has
expressed interest, as have Cybill Shepherd and former ``Good
Morning America'' co-host Joan Lunden.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, so has Darva Conger, the emergency-room nurse who
became a Playboy model after her notoriously brief television
marriage to Rick Rockwell on Fox's disastrous ``Who Wants to Marry
a Multi-Millionaire?'' That would make for an interesting
spectacle: a millionaire-maker on the left and a
millionaire-marrier on the right.
</P>
<P>
   Insiders at ``Live With'' say the decision won't be made until
toward the end of the year. It's going to be a long, hot summer.

 UNDATED: Zvezda launching.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The $340-million Zvezda, the first station module fully financed
by Russia, will join two existing modules, together weighing 70,000
pounds, that have made up the fledgling station for more than a
year and a half. The Zarya control module, made in Russia with
American financing, was the first part of the space station. The
Zarya module was launched in November 1998, and it was followed in
December by the American Unity connecting node. American shuttles
have visited the complex twice since then to bring supplies,
perform maintenance and boost the station's altitude, which slowly
decreases because of atmospheric drag even when 240 miles up.
</P>
<P>
   Zvezda is a large module that looks like the core unit of the
Mir space station launched in 1986, but Zvezda has many upgrades,
said Kirk Shireman, NASA's manager for Russian elements to the
space station.
</P>
<P>
   ``The computer system is the biggest difference,'' Shireman
said. The system, made by a German company and provided by the
European Space Agency, is more up to date than those used in other
parts of the station, but is compatible with them, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The service module also has new guidance, communications and
monitoring systems, as well as upgraded navigation, control,
guidance and ventilation equipment. As well, Russia has improved
the safety and operation of the oxygen-generating candles it uses
as a backup air supply, Shireman said. Use of such candles caused a
fire aboard Mir in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The 43-foot-long Zvezda, about the size of a city bus, has a
docking node on one end to join with other spacecraft or sections,
and a propulsion unit on the other. The pressurized interior has a
command center for controlling the station, and a center living
area with sleeping quarters, a toilet, a kitchen with a
refrigerator-freezer, a table for meals, and exercise equipment
like a treadmill and a stationary bicycle.
</P>
<P>
   The unit, which has 14 small windows distributed throughout,
could serve as a self-sustained space station by itself, drawing
electrical power from two solar wings that span 95.5 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Getting Zvezda and the other units together will not be simple.
Normally, it takes two days for a spacecraft to rendezvous and dock
with the station, but the service module's journey is scheduled to
take two weeks. Program managers said the leisurely schedule for
mating the modules is designed to let controllers thoroughly check
out the unit before the critical docking.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after the launching, Zvezda's antennas and solar
arrays will be deployed, and guidance, navigation and control
systems will be activated. After testing sensors and engines, the
craft will conduct two major engine firings to take it to the space
station's altitude. During the next 10 days, controllers will check
power and communication systems, and test the Kurs automatic
docking systems that are to guide the craft together. Some days
have no scheduled activities and have been left open to allow time
to fix any problems that arise, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Docking is to occur on the 15th day of the mission and is timed
to occur over Russian ground stations so that controllers can
monitor the robotic mating. Zvezda will be the passive partner in
the maneuvering and docking, holding its position while the space
station slowly closes in. The Kurs system on each module will
constantly send signals to the other to guide the speed, position
and direction of the units as they close.
</P>
<P>
   After the units dock and locking clamps secure them, the space
in between will be pressurized and there will be three days of leak
testing. When the linkup is confirmed as permanent, Zvezda's
computers are to take control of the complex and deactivate control
systems previously used by the station, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Ferring, the lead space station flight director at the
Johnson Space Center in Houston, said there should be fuel aboard
the space station for two, and possibly three, docking attempts. If
something goes wrong and the mating cannot be done automatically,
he said, the Russians have emergency plans to launch two astronauts
to Zvezda to conduct a manual docking.
</P>
<P>
   Astronauts Gennady Padalka and Nikolai Budarin have been trained
as ``Expedition Zero,'' a crew that would be launched in a Soyuz
craft on Aug. 10 to dock with the service module. The crew would
enter Zvezda and assemble a remote-control rendezvous system called
TORU, which was designed to let them control the space station
sitting some distance away from the service module. Two days later,
the astronauts would use TORU to guide the space station toward
Zvezda for a linkup. After spending another 10 days or so aboard
the service module activating some systems, the crew would return
to Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Space station assembly would resume with the launching of the
shuttle Atlantis on Sept. 8, bringing supplies to outfit it for the
first resident crew and a team of spacewalking astronauts to
complete outside connections of the newly expanded orbiting
outpost.

LOSER TAKE ALL: JASON BIGGS IS A WINNING `LOSER' 
</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not
prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative
DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.) 
 (She also has information on how to subscribe to StarBeat, a weekly
package of five intriguing features with color art.) 
 (Includes a color slide of Jason Biggs in a scene from ``Loser.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    Talk about the perfect storm.
 &HT;    ```American Pie' put me on the map and it got the storm going,
got it brewing,'' says actor Jason Biggs, who so memorably shared
an intimate moment with a warm apple pie in last summer's sleeper
hit. ``I've got two movies out this summer and I'm working on two
more movies. Everything is heating up even more.
 &HT;    ``It's really, really exciting and it's really cool,'' the young
actor says. ``I'll tell you what, I don't mind these conditions. I
hope it doesn't stop storming for a long time, man _ I hope I don't
see the sun for a while.''
 &HT;    Biggs may not be quite ready to give George Clooney a run for
his money, either as a hunk or as a box-office draw, but he's
getting there. With dark hair and a broad smile that make him
resemble a young Adam Sandler, Biggs chased ``American Pie'' with
this summer's dreadful ``Boys and Girls,'' scoring the film's only
positive notices with his entertaining turn as Freddie Prinze Jr.'s
quirky, advice-spouting college sidekick.
 &HT;    And on July 21 Biggs will sweep back into theaters with
``Loser,'' a romantic comedy from Amy Heckerling, the director of
``Fast Times at Ridgemont High'' (1982) and ``Clueless'' (1995).
Biggs plays Paul Tannek, a good-natured small-town kid struggling
to hold his own at college in New York, a task made harder by
Paul's knack for hideous hats, pratfalls and abuse from others.
 &HT;    Along the way, he falls for Dora _ played by Biggs' ``American
Pie'' co-star Mena Suvari _ a student with precious little money, a
lot of attitude and the hots for an English-literature professor
(Greg Kinnear). Paul and Dora are perfect for each other, of
course, but that's something they need to discover for themselves.
 &HT;    ``I want to say it was easy to play a dork,'' the amiable Biggs
says by telephone from Los Angeles' Four Seasons hotel, where he's
busily promoting ``Loser.'' ``Is that weird? `Yeah, it was a piece
of cake!'
 &HT;    ``In `American Pie' and here again in `Loser' I'm playing that
guy who is kind of the outsider, who is kind of dorky,'' he
explains. ``The cool thing about it in both cases for me, and the
challenge for me, is that the audience has to like these guys, root
for them and sympathize with them, or else the movie doesn't work.
 &HT;    ``I could certainly relate to Paul, to an extent,'' Biggs adds.
``I think everyone can. Maybe I'm just saying that to make myself
feel better, but I can relate to feeling like an outsider at times.
I certainly felt that way in high school and especially when I went
off to college (New York University for a semester, then New
Jersey's Montclair State University for a few weeks).
 &HT;    ``I still feel like an outsider at times.''
 &HT;    To Hollywood, however, Biggs is rapidly becoming an insider. He
assumes leading-man status with ``Loser.'' He's the guy, the male
star. He's the loser.
 &HT;    ``It's cool,'' he admits, ``but I've never looked at it, and nor
do I now, as `I want this rested on my shoulders. It's my name, my
movie, I'm the lead, blah, blah, blah.' To me, yeah, I'm playing
the titular loser, but it's Amy's film, and Mena is as much a part
of it as I am.
 &HT;    ``That Amy, who also wrote the script for the movie, wanted me
to play her guy, her loser who she wanted to bring to life on
screen through me, was just such a thrill,'' Biggs says. ``I'd pay
to work with her. There's also Greg Kinnear and Jimmi Simpson,
Thomas Sadoski and Zak Orth, who play my roommates.
 &HT;    ``Yeah, I'm the loser, but there's no `Loser' without everyone
else.''
 &HT;    Biggs will turn up next in a dramatic role, co-starring as the
boyfriend of deeply troubled Christina Ricci in the upcoming
adaptation of Elizabeth Wurtzel's ``Prozac Nation.'' Then he'll
take the lead in ``Saving Silverman,'' a comedy about a recently
engaged young man (Biggs) whose friends (Jack Black and Steve Zahn)
try to convince their pal that his fiancee (Amanda Peet) is an evil
shrew. Down the line, of course, he's likely to pocket a small
fortune for ``American Pie 2.''
 &HT;    Many actors in Biggs' enviable position have blown the
opportunity. They've sold out for huge paychecks. They've become
major jerks. Or both. Or worse.
 &HT;    Biggs, who grew up in Hasbrouck Heights, N.J., and counts among
his earlier credits the television shows ``Drexel's Class''
(1991-1992), ``As the World Turns'' (1994-1995) and ``Total
Security'' (1997), as well as the Broadway play ``Conversations
with My Father'' on Broadway, vows that temptation won't get the
better of him.
 &HT;    ``Money?'' he says. ``I'm doing well for my age. I don't need to
sell out for big paychecks at this point in my career. Hopefully I
never will. I'm doing fine. Because of `American Pie,' I can be a
bit pickier about my roles.
 &HT;    ``It sounds trite, but I'm all about my work,'' he says. ``I'm
about making the right choices, having fun with my characters and
working with the right people. I don't want to do a crappy movie
for a big paycheck _ I'd rather do an awesome movie for nothing.''
 &HT;    Biggs also would rather not evolve into a jerk, if it's all the
same.
 &HT;    ``I'd like to think I've got my head on pretty straight,'' says
the actor, who is single and lives in Los Angeles. ``As far as ego
and becoming a hard person to deal with, I attribute my not falling
into that to the way I was raised. I'm a firm believer in karma _
what goes around comes around.
 &HT;    ``I have no desire to be a jerk, to be that guy who is hard to
deal with,'' Biggs says. ``I want to have fun. I want to be the guy
everyone talks about as, `Wow, man, he's cool. He's nice. And he's
great to work with.'
 &HT;    ``It would make me feel good to think other people think that.''

ROCKING ON: DURAN DURAN MAY BE DOWN, BUT THEY'RE NOT OUT 
</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not
prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative
DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.)

 (Includes a color slide of the rock band Duran Duran, including
members Simon LeBon, Nick Rhodes and Warren Cuccurullo.) 
 By GARY GRAFF  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    It's been nearly 20 years since Duran Duran blew out of England
to declare that ``This is planet Earth'' and become the 'N Sync of
the 1980s.
 &HT;    But though those heady days are long gone, the group has
released its 11th album, ``Pop Trash,'' and its members say they're
still ``Hungry Like the Wolf.''
 &HT;    ``I think we've had a hard time since the sort of hysteria and
screaming of the mid-'80s,'' keyboardist Nick Rhodes says. ``We
really lost a lot of ground with the more serious end of the music
press.
 &HT;    ``I think music lovers stuck with us because they liked the
music, they liked the songs,'' Rhodes says. ``They saw where we
were coming from and really listened to the records _ they knew
there was plenty of depth in there and interesting ideas and some
good tunes, and they stuck with it.
 &HT;    ``But I think a lot of the media just thought, `OK, this is for
girls now. This isn't something for a serious audience,''' he
concludes. ``It was a double-edged sword: It helped propel us into
a much stronger position with a bigger audience, but at the same
time I think we lost a lot of the momentum we had for, I suppose,
what is normally termed credibility _ although I'm not sure that
word means anything.''
 &HT;    Credibility is, in fact, what Duran Duran had at the outset of
its career in 1980, when the group's original lineup came together
and recorded bouncy, danceable pop songs such as ``Girls on Film''
and ``Planet Earth'' that _ in addition to the group's haute
fashion and stylish videos _ were considered cutting-edge pop at
the dawn of the MTV age.
 &HT;    But within two years Duran's cult appeal went widescreen with
hits such as ``Hungry Like the Wolf,'' ``Rio,'' ``Save a Prayer''
and ``Union of the Snake,'' and the group was the object of the
same kind of screaming, teen-oriented mass adulation that the
Backstreet Boys and 'N Sync experience today. Rolling Stone
magazine even dubbed the quintet ``The Fab Five'' in recognition of
their Beatles-like popularity.
 &HT;    ``We got a ride and we thought it was going to slow down any
minute,'' the 38-year-old Rhodes says. ``But it didn't slow down
for five years.''
 &HT;    The group actually put the brakes on itself, dividing into two
separate camps to form the side groups Power Station and Arcadia.
Members began to drop out along the way _ first guitarist Andy
Taylor and drummer Roger Taylor, then bassist John Taylor in 1997.
Rhodes and frontman Simon LeBon now comprise the band, along with
former Frank Zappa and Missing Persons guitarist Warren Cuccurullo,
who joined during 1987.
 &HT;    Beside those departures, Duran Duran also suffered the
inevitable backlash that comes with great success. A series of
albums during the late 1980s and early 1990s were met with
indifference, as their fans moved on to other pop heroes and then
to heavier modern-rock heroes such as Nirvana and Pearl Jam.
 &HT;    The group enjoyed a spike during 1993 with two Top 10 singles _
``Ordinary World'' and ``Come Undone'' _ but hasn't made the charts
since.
 &HT;    ``We came out of being a nostalgia item and became a current
item, which was very important for us,'' the 41-year-old LeBon
says. ``But we never stopped working _ we tried and tried and tried
again to become current. There's never been a comeback as far as
we're concerned.''
 &HT;    Likewise, the group has purposefully avoided becoming part of
the 1980s pop revues that dot the concert landscape, especially
during the summer season.
 &HT;    ``Oh my God, I can't think of anything worse,'' Rhodes says with
a laugh. ``We're not a nostalgia act. I have no problem with anyone
from the '80s, '90s or '70s going out and earning a living and
giving people a good time at a show. That's fine _ just not our
thing.
 &HT;    ``We acknowledge that we came out of the '80s,'' he adds, ``but
then so did Prince. So did Madonna. So did U2. So did Depeche Mode.
A lot of interesting things came out that are still relevant and
creative and fresh.''
 &HT;    With ``Pop Trash,'' Duran Duran is trying to rebound from the
commercial and creative disappointment of its 1997 album
``Medazzaland,'' which led to the group's departure from its
longtime label, Capitol Records, and its eventual signing with
Hollywood Records, the musical arm of the Disney empire.
 &HT;    ``We had a bad taste in our mouth after the `Medazzaland'
debacle,'' LeBon says. ``We basically lost the interest of our
record company _ they didn't want to put more money behind it and
promote it.
 &HT;    ``But while there's the temptation to try to pass the buck and
blame other people,'' the singer adds, ``in the back of your mind
you think, `Yeah, if it had been a stronger piece of work, maybe
things would have gone better.'''
 &HT;    LeBon, Rhodes and Cuccurullo had reason to be optimistic about
``Pop Trash,'' however. They were excited about the album's first
single, ``Someone Else Not Me,'' which had been conceived during a
promotional video shoot for ``Medazzaland,'' while the three
musicians jammed on a riff Cucurullo began playing during a break
in the session.
 &HT;    ``We put it away,'' LeBon says, ``and after (`Medazzaland') came
out and we toured and everything, we went back in and the first
thing we started working on was that song. It was a good starting
point, and really set a standard for the rest of the album that
inspired us.''
 &HT;    Duran Duran also received an unexpected gift in the form of the
song ``Pop Trash Movie,'' which ultimately gave the album its
title. Rhodes and Cuccurullo had written it for Blondie's reunion
album, and went so far as to conceal it from LeBon, for fear that
he'd want to keep it for Duran Duran.
 &HT;    But when Blondie wound up not using the song, all three were
quick to snap it up for their own album.
 &HT;    ``I was rubbing my hands with glee and said, `Well, I'll have
that,''' says LeBon, who ceded most of the lyric writing on ``Pop
Trash'' to Rhodes. ``I hadn't heard it. It's a great song, and they
knew damn well if I'd have ever heard it before it went to Blondie,
I'd have wanted it. They were being clever.
 &HT;    ``But I think Duran Duran's done a better job with it.''
 &HT;    Rhodes agrees.
 &HT;    ``In a way, all the irony and humor of it suited us in exactly
the same way it suited Blondie,'' he says. ``I often see many
parallels with some of the things they'd done and some of the
things we'd done. We stayed together, but we had our down periods,
too _ although perhaps not as gruesome as theirs.
 &HT;    ``But I think they were very innovative, with a lot of good
ideas,'' he says, ``and perhaps didn't get the credit they
deserved. They wrote some amazing songs.''
 &HT;    The same, of course, might be said of Duran Duran. But while the
days of the Fab Five may be long gone, Rhodes says the remaining
three see enough evidence of their impact to feel redeemed.
 &HT;    ``We've learned that success isn't measured by how many records
you sell,'' the keyboardist says. ``But I still get the greatest
kick out of seeing someone dance to one of our songs. To me, that's
as important as anyone buying the record.''

FILMMAKERS

 (Includes a color slide of Chris Weitz with Michael White in a
scene from ``Chuck &AMP; Buck.'') 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago. 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    ``These days we get paid for what used to earn us trips to the
principal's office,'' Chris Weitz says.
 &HT;    It's 1 p.m. at the Los Angeles offices shared by Weitz and his
brother Paul, and the telephone won't stop ringing. It hasn't, in
fact, since last summer, when their movie ``American Pie'' _ Chris
co-produced, Paul directed _ became an unexpected $100 million
box-office hit.
 &HT;    Move over, Coen brothers. Get nervous, Wachowskis. The Weitzes
are in town.
 &HT;    And they're busy, too. Right now they're editing ``Down to
Earth,'' their remake of ``Here Comes Mr. Jordan'' (1941), starring
Chris Rock, which will debut this fall. By then ``Nutty Professor
II: The Klumps,'' which they helped pen, should be climbing the
box-office charts. And they're producing the inevitable ``American
Pie II,'' which should begin annoying parents sometime next summer.
 &HT;    Oh, and then there's the independent film ``Chuck &AMP; Buck,''
opening nationwide on July 21, in which the two actually make their
acting debuts.
 &HT;    If there's anything in the genes, they should do all right:
Their mother is Susan Kohner, who was nominated for an Oscar for
``Imitation of Life'' (1959).
 &HT;    ``It was weird for us to act, but I knew my vanity would
overcome my fear,'' Chris Weitz says. ``Plus I've known the film's
director, Miguel Arteta, since college. He asked me to do this
almost as a dare.
 &HT;    ``And once they cast me, they needed someone who would look like
me.''
 &HT;    The film is the story of Buck (Mike White), a misfit, stuck in
childhood, who lives with his mother and spends his days eating
candy and playing teen-age records. When his mother dies, Buck
meets up with his old friend Chuck (Chris Weitz) at the funeral.
 &HT;    Chuck is an agent, living in Los Angeles with his beautiful
fiancee, but Buck can't get over the fact that they're not buddies
the way they used to be. So he moves to Los Angeles and starts
stalking poor Chuck.
 &HT;    When he's rebuffed, he writes a play based on their lives called
``Hank &AMP; Frank,'' and casts a Buck look-alike (Paul Weitz) as one
of the leads.
 &HT;    ``The only trick I learned from our films was not to do too
much,'' Chris says. ``You should pare it down and let the audience
bring their own stuff to it. So most of my impulses to overact were
put aside.''
 &HT;    Particularly difficult was a semi-explicit gay love scene for
Chris.
 &HT;    ``I was nervous about stinking it up,'' he says. ``It's not a
lifestyle choice I'm familiar with, but I've never had a problem
with it, either. I've always been Mr. Politically Correct _ and now
I had to live up to my political credo.
 &HT;    ``Frankly, it wasn't as weird as a heterosexual love scene,'' he
says with a laugh, ``which is more complicated because I've done
that in real life.''
 &HT;    Both brothers claim that they didn't miss directing.
 &HT;    ``We watched our friend Miguel get more and more haggard,'' Paul
recalls. ``We would say, `Ah, that's not our problem.' When `cut'
was yelled, we'd say, `Adios!'''
 &HT;    That isn't the case with ``Down to Earth,'' on which the two are
co-writers and co-directors. It's a zany, off-the-wall comedy which
the brothers can't describe without finishing one another's
thoughts.
 &HT;    ``Chris Rock is a screw-up of a stand-up comic who is booed off
the stage at the Apollo,'' Chris says.
 &HT;    ``This screw-up angel played by Eugene Levy can't stand the
sight of blood,'' Paul chimes in, ``so he takes Chris before a
truck hits him.''
 &HT;    Rock ends up in heaven _ but not just any heaven.
 &HT;    ``Our version of heaven has a velvet rope, like when you're
trying to get into a disco,'' Paul says.
 &HT;    ``It's a 1950s supper club that stretches into infinity,'' Chris
says.
 &HT;    But it turns out that Rock's character would have survived the
accident, and so he's returned to earth ... this time in the body
of a white billionaire.
 &HT;    It's a funny concept, one which sold almost instantly _ as does
practically anything the Weitzes write, nowadays.
 &HT;    ``The funny thing is that we can't even believe it,'' Chris
says. ``We're the guys who were winging it on `American Pie.' We're
the guys who had never made a film before.''
 &HT;    ``Execs would show up to the set of `American Pie' and ask, `Do
you know what you're doing, boys?''' Paul recalls.
 &HT;    Apparently they do. The success of ``American Pie'' has made
them Hollywood's flavor of the month, which is all the more
surprising for two young men who grew up in New York, far from the
movie industry _ despite the fact that their grandfather, Paul
Kohner, was an influential Hollywood agent, representing John
Huston among others.
 &HT;    ``Strangely, show biz wasn't all around us,'' Paul says. ``Or
maybe we didn't get it. People with thick European accents like
Ingmar Bergman and Billy Wilder were cronies of our grandfather,
but we didn't realize they were great filmmakers. We were
clueless.''
 &HT;    They didn't show any especial filmmaking aptitude in their
youth, he recalls.
 &HT;    ``I tried to make a film in college and almost had a nervous
breakdown,'' Paul says. ``I didn't have any talent. I pulled the
plug on myself.''
 &HT;    Instead, the two decided to try their hand as screenwriters. A
short stint executive-producing and writing ABC's retread of
``Fantasy Island'' put them on the map, and established connections
which led to scripting chores on ``Antz'' (1998) and ``Madeline''
(1998).
 &HT;    The Weitzes then used the success of ``Antz'' to wangle the
director's chair for ``American Pie'' _ which, they admit, was
something of a shot in the dark.
 &HT;    ``I always heard good directors vomit on the way to the set the
first day,'' Paul says. ``I kept hoping and waiting to feel my
stomach churn, but it never happened. So naturally, I was very
worried.
 &HT;    ``But I guess it worked out OK,'' he says. ``I didn't do a
miserable job _ which is something I only realized in the editing
room, when the shots could actually be cut together.''
 &HT;    The two have plenty of irons in the fire _ among other things,
they're currently writing a script about the Culinary Institute of
America _ but will find time to see ``Nutty Professor II,'' if only
to see how much of their script remains in the final picture, which
was worked on by several other writers.
 &HT;    ``Frankly, we don't know how it turned out,'' Paul admits. ``As
happens on most of these things, writers come in and out. But it
was great to write for Eddie Murphy.
 &HT;    ``We actually met with Eddie, who gave us good advice,'' Paul
adds. ``He said, `Always make it fun. But when the character is the
midst of a horrifying situation, let him keep some dignity.''
 &HT;    ``So that's our rule,'' Chris says. ``We try to inject as much
emotion into a situation as possible, and then let the comedy take
care of itself.''

 (Includes a color slide of Kathie Lee Gifford with Regis Philbin in
a scene from ``Live With Regis and Kathie Lee.'') 
 By SIMON HOUPT  
 c.2000 TV Guide Canada  
 Not to be published in Canada before July 23, 2000. 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The only thing we know for certain is that there will be tears.
</P>
<P>
   When Kathie Lee Gifford steps off the set of ``Live with Regis
and Kathie Lee'' for the last time on July 28, she will bring down
the curtain on one of the unlikeliest successes in television
talk-show history.
</P>
<P>
   The producers of ``Live With'' are planning a weeklong
commemoration of the 15 years Gifford has spent next to Regis
Philbin. Perhaps they'll treat us to some moments from the early
years when their New York-based chatfest was called simply ``The
Morning Show,'' before it was rechristened to take advantage of the
co-hosts' increasing popularity.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe we'll see Kathie Lee and Reege, our favorite dysfunctional
duo, taking each other down a notch while co-hosting the 1991 Miss
America Pageant. We'll definitely get some clips of them snapping
at each other through the years _ let's face it, that was one of
the main reasons we watched the show every morning.
</P>
<P>
   After all is said and done, though, there will be tears. You
don't end a 15-year relationship _ even one as famously
antagonistic as Philbin and Gifford's _ without some misty eyes in
the house.
</P>
<P>
   When the show began in 1985, Philbin was the household name. He
had already been a television talk-show staple for more than 20
years, beginning as a sidekick to Joey Bishop and later becoming a
well-known personality in his own right.
</P>
<P>
   Gifford, meanwhile, was nothing more than a substitute host on
``Good Morning America.'' She was hired as a second banana to
Philbin, but it didn't take long for their vinegar-and-honey
chemistry to take them to the top of the ratings.
</P>
<P>
   He was the man-about-town, telling us about the hot new
restaurants and the great shows on Broadway starring all of his
friends. She was the doting mother of two who emerged from her
Connecticut hideaway every morning just long enough to get on his
nerves.
</P>
<P>
   For awhile that's how it stayed. But in recent years each has
found new fame and fortune.
</P>
<P>
   True, there were some stumbles along the way _ after launching a
popular clothing line, Gifford weathered allegations of profiting
from sweatshops. But she's a fighter: In the end, labor advocates
cheered her for helping to shine the spotlight on sweatshop
practices around the world. She even rose above her husband's
infidelity, keeping her marriage together through a furious storm
of tabloid coverage.
</P>
<P>
   And now, at age 46, Gifford is widening her horizons. After
years of flirting with live performance, she finally made her
Broadway debut last December, replacing Carol Burnett one night a
week in the Stephen Sondheim revue ``Putting It Together.'' A new
CD on her own record label features Gifford warbling cabaret-style
renditions of songs such as Van Morrison's ``Moondance,'' Irving
Berlin's ``I Got Lost in His Arms'' and a few of her own
Broadway-style compositions.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, of course, Philbin has been keeping himself busy with
a little prime-time game show.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a good time for me to leave,'' Gifford said recently.
``Regis won't even notice I'm gone.''
</P>
<P>
   If not, he must have gone deaf and blind. In addition to five
days of farewell shows, the airwaves will be flooded with Gifford
during her final week. She'll bounce from Letterman on Wednesday to
her alma-mater ``Good Morning America'' on Thursday. On Friday,
after her final show, she'll stop by for a chat with the ladies on
``The View.''
</P>
<P>
   Philbin has been instrumental in the search for her replacement.
Co-host chemistry is the key ingredient to the unscripted,
unrehearsed ``Live With,'' so it's not going to be easy to find
someone to sit next to Philbin for an hour each day and fill in his
pauses.
</P>
<P>
   Since Gifford announced at the end of February that this would
be her final season, executive producer Michael Gelman has brought
a regular stream of hopefuls through the ``Live With'' studio in
New York, each blessed with a brief shot at the big time.
</P>
<P>
   Last month former weathergirl Jillian Barberie spent an hour at
Philbin's side, throwing around sexual innuendo in an on-air tryout
that many felt went over the top. ``Live With'' might go for her if
the show wants to attract a younger audience, but it seems more
likely that someone of an older, more conservative vintage will get
the nod.
</P>
<P>
   New York television personality Kathleen Murphy is considered a
front-runner. ``The View's'' resident comedian, Joy Behar, has
expressed interest, as have Cybill Shepherd and former ``Good
Morning America'' co-host Joan Lunden.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, so has Darva Conger, the emergency-room nurse who
became a Playboy model after her notoriously brief television
marriage to Rick Rockwell on Fox's disastrous ``Who Wants to Marry
a Multi-Millionaire?'' That would make for an interesting
spectacle: a millionaire-maker on the left and a
millionaire-marrier on the right.
</P>
<P>
   Insiders at ``Live With'' say the decision won't be made until
toward the end of the year. It's going to be a long, hot summer.

SAFETY CONCERNS HALT OKLAHOMA CANCER RESEARCH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Okla)   By PHILIP J. HILTS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Medical experiments involving people at the University of
Oklahoma Health Sciences Center at Tulsa have been suspended on the
orders of federal investigators who found numerous safety and
ethics violations. The action was taken by the Office for Human
Research Protections of the Department of Health and Human
Services, after an investigation showed that about 100 patients in
one experiment were injected with a vaccine that had been made by
unqualified laboratory workers and had never been safety-tested,
and other violations. The suspension was first reported Monday in
USA Today.
</P>
<P>
   The order, issued on June 29, halted about 75 experiments at the
Tulsa center involving humans. The investigation first focused on
one experiment, in which patients with the fatal skin cancer
melanoma were given a test vaccine. In reviewing that experiment,
federal and university officials found that the center's
Institutional Review Board was routinely violating federal safety
and ethics rules.
</P>
<P>
   After hearing of problems in the melanoma experiment, the
university conducted its own investigation and brought in a
consulting firm. In March the firm recommended that the experiment,
run by Dr. Michael McGee, be shut down immediately because of
safety questions, and that the vaccine used in it be quarantined
and either destroyed or labeled ``not for use in humans.''The
experiment was halted on March 9.
</P>
<P>
   But federal investigators found that university officials had
failed to tell the patients of the vaccine's safety problems and
misrepresented the reason the experiment was being halted. The
researchers also failed to report the safety problems to the
members of the Institutional Review Board and federal officials, as
the federal rules require.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to concerns about the safety of the vaccine,
investigators found that in recruiting patients for the study,
health center doctors misled candidates by stating that the
experiment might reduce the size of their tumors, when in fact the
study was intended only to test the toxicity of the vaccine, not to
treat patients. The doctors also failed to warn patients of the
risks of suspending their regular treatments in favor of the
non-treatment vaccine tests.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 patients were enrolled in that study, and 26 died. It
is believed that most or all died of their disease, not of the
untested vaccine. But that is unclear because researchers at the
center did not carry out the necessary checks to see whether there
were negative reactions to the vaccine, a federal official said.
</P>
<P>
   After its inquiry, the university removed McGee as vice chairman
of the department of surgery. ``We're trying to understand what
happened here, why there was a breakdown in communications and
monitoring,'' Ken Lackey, president of the Tulsa campus told The
Associated Press. McGee's office referred calls to the university.
</P>
<P>
   The university also removed Dr. Daniel Plunket as head of the
Institutional Review Board, which itself has been disbanded.

 &HT;    Plunging viewership for reality TV show Big Brother
 &HT;    By Drew Jubera
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Reality bites.
</P>
<P>
   Or too much of it does.
</P>
<P>
   That seems to be an early message of the plunging viewership for
CBS' ``Big Brother,'' the spy-cam ``reality'' show whose ratings
have gone from curiosity-seeking great to ho-hum middling in less
than a week.
</P>
<P>
   Since ``Big Brother'' debuted to 22.4 million viewers last
Wednesday _ when it followed the highest-rated night ever for CBS'
six-week-old island-reality hit ``Saviour'' _ its ratings have
dropped dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big Brother'' lured only 11.5 million viewers on Thursday, 8.9
million on Friday and 6.5 million on Saturday, when the show
finished third in its timeslot, behind ABC's movie repeat of
``Ground Control'' and Fox's long-running ``Cops.''
</P>
<P>
   In metro Atlanta, 186,000 households watched the premiere, but
that number dropped to 67,000 by Saturday. ``Big Brother'' finished
sixth in its time period on Friday. Patti Cohen, WGCL programming
and research director, believes the numbers will rise as storylines
develop, adding, ``I'm not worried.''
</P>
<P>
   Some ratings erosion was expected: unlike the weekly, top-ranked
``Survivor'' series, ``Big Brother'' airs a more viewer-demanding
five nights a week (Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays-Saturdays at 8).
</P>
<P>
   Also, the European import began slowly in the Netherlands,
Germany and Spain, three countries where it went on to be a hit
once viewers started to vote the 10 contestants out of the house.
</P>
<P>
   The five women and five men inside the ``Big Brother'' house on
a CBS studio lot in Los Angeles will pick two of their own for
possible banishment this Thursday. Viewers will then vote by phone
(an as-yet unlisted 900 number), with the results and eviction
airing live the following week. Last one left after three months
wins $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   But it's clear ``Big Brother'' will not have the immediate
impact of ``Survivor,'' the biggest summer hit ever, or ABC's ``Who
Wants to Be a Millionaire,'' which premiered last summer and is
credited with kicking off the current reality craze.
</P>
<P>
   Stakes are high for CBS. It paid $20 million for the Dutch
production company concept and scheduled it for 89 nights, through
September.
</P>
<P>
   CBS is playing down the ratings drop now _ it is pleased ``Big
Brother'' culls far more younger viewers than the network is used
to _ but that is a long way from the exuberance expressed by CBS TV
president Les Moonves before the show's debut, when he said he'd
air it ``six nights a week'' if numbers went high enough.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is simple: both the TV show and it's accompanying
live, all-day-every-day Web site (www.bigbrother2000.com) have
suffered from deadly dull reality. It didn't help that the first
episode, in which viewership sunk during the second half hour,
aired 50 minutes of hyped prelude before the contestants even
showed up. So far, neither the network nor net-tracking companies
have released the number of hits the 24/7 website has received
since it went live soon after last Wednesday's premiere episode.
</P>
<P>
   But now that everyone is bunked inside the two-bedroom house,
viewers so far have been treated to little more than second-rate
kvetching (Karen on her husband: ``He thinks that if he gets a job
and brings home money and puts it in the checking account and
everybody has food, that's a father, that's a husband'') and
third-rate chores (Monday's Web site featured someone watering
tomatoes and someone else washing dishes).
</P>
<P>
   Lesson for programmers: viewers aren't interested in watching
people more bored than they are.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big Brother''

   8 tonight on CBS

   Sharks (in a Tank) In Charleston Harbor
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to Charleston can explore Southern aquatic life at the
South Carolina Aquarium, which opened on May 19. The aquarium,
which juts into Charleston Harbor for 200 feet, will showcase
plants and animals from five major regions of the Appalachian
Watershed: The mountains, the Piedmont, the Coastal Plain, the
coast and the ocean. The focal point of the 93,000-square-foot
aquarium will be a two-story Great Ocean Tank Exhibit featuring
about 800 animals, including sea turtles, sharks, stingrays and
coral.
</P>
<P>
   The Blackwater Swamp Exhibit replicates the atmosphere of a
cypress-tupelo swamp at twilight, using a spongy floor, fog, and
twinkling lights to simulate fireflies. A 2,500-square-foot salt
marsh, complete with palmettos, sandpipers and fiddler crabs,
anchors the Coastal Gallery, which also boasts lively baby
alligators.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   From an outdoor terrace, visitors can view river otters,
dolphins and migrating birds, and watch the docking and unloading
of giant container ships. The aquarium, 100 Aquarium Wharf, is open

   A Nantucket Elephant Has a Growth Spurt
</P>
<P>
   It long ago overcame the image of its name, so much so that the
White Elephant Hotel, which has overlooked Nantucket Harbor in
Massachusetts for nearly 80 years at 50 Easton St., has reopened
after a renovation that nearly doubled its size. The hotel, closed
since October, welcomed guests on June 22 to a new wing and larger
rooms. Despite the increase in size, the hotel has the same number
of rooms, 54, plus 12 cottages. It is owned by Stephen and Jill
Karp, owners of the Wauwinet, also in Nantucket. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The new wing is covered in cedar shingles to match the other
structures, and has an airy porch. It has 40 rooms, while the old
main building now has only 14 _ all doubled in size, with sitting
areas and two bathrooms each.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Both buildings have rattan chairs with leather seats and beds
with leather headboards, hand-painted lamps and linenlike fabrics
in neutral colors; many rooms have fireplaces. The bathrooms have
white ceramic tile and marble counters. All rooms have DVD players
and high-speed Internet connections, as does the business center. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Summer rates, which include full breakfast at the hotel's
refurbished Brant Point Grill, start at $450 for standard doubles
and $465 for suites. Reservations: (800) 475-2637, fax (508)
325-1195.

   Higher Prices Forecast For Business Travelers
</P>
<P>
   Runzheimer International, a Rochester, Wis., management
consulting firm, is predicting that business travel costs next year
will increase by 7 percent _ the biggest such rise it has ever
forecast.
</P>
<P>
   That includes increases of 6.8 percent in air fares, 8 percent
in hotel rates, and 10 percent in car rentals and restaurant bills.
The reason for the record forecast, Runzheimer said, is ``our
belief that inflation, high demand and constrained inventories of
seats, rooms and cars will occur simultaneously in late 2000.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Overall travel prices held steady through the first five months
of this year, however. The AAA's leisure travel index, published on
May 30, found that even though air fares were up 6 percent since
November 1999, overall costs _ that is, the combined national
average for air fares, lodging, food and car rental _ rose only
about 1 percent, to $410.60 in May from $406.02 last November. The
reason the increase was not higher, the AAA said, is that air fares
(which account for 47 percent of the total travel dollar) and
car-rental costs were offset by hotel and restaurant costs that
remained the same as a year ago.

   Fifty Acres of Culture In the Heart of Arizona
</P>
<P>
   Residents of Sedona, Ariz., have banded together to put their
town on the artistic map with an ambitious cultural park of more
than 50 acres. Ten years in the making and still a work in progress
(over $8 million has been raised so far), the Sedona Cultural Park
aims to meld nature conservation, arts education and cultural
events. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of the park is its hillside amphitheater, the
Georgia Frontiere Performing Arts Pavilion, (800) 780-2787, which
opened on May 26 with a performance by the Phoenix Symphony. The
design, by Jensvold-Thompson Architects, a California firm,
features three wooden arches that rise 60 feet above the stage and
frame not only the cultural action but also a view beyond to
Boynton Canyon and red rock formations, including Capital Butte.
Its backers hope the spot will become a summer home to orchestral
performances, theater, and folk and jazz concerts; this summer's
schedule includes six weeks of theater by Shakespeare Sedona ending
July 30, and an outdoor Jazz on the Rocks Festival on Sept. 23.
</P>
<P>
   The park also houses a digital media center, part of the Sedona
campus of Yavapai College, and the Red Rock Information Center,
which, in cooperation with the United States Forest Service, will
help introduce visitors to the natural surroundings, including the
hiking trails of the adjacent Coconino National Forest. The park's
Center for Education and the Arts, a partnership of Arizona
colleges, universities and school districts, is developing a range
of on-site and in-school programs. Eventually planned, should money
allow, is an arts village that would be home to galleries,
restaurants, studios, museums and indoor performance stages.

<P>
   No Vacation for Houses of Parliament
</P>
<P>
   The Palace of Westminster will be open for public tours for the
first time while Parliament is in recess, from Aug. 7 to Sept. 16.
Until now visitors have been allowed only when Parliament has been
in session, and have been confined to the public gallery unless
special access was arranged through a member of Parliament or a
foreign embassy.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The palace, also known as the Houses of Parliament, opened in
1852 after the previous Palace of Westminster was destroyed by fire
in 1834. A 75-minute guided tour will pass through the chambers of
the House of Commons and the House of Lords; the room where the
queen dons her robes for the opening of Parliament; the Prince's
Chamber, which reflects the taste of Queen Victoria's husband,
Prince Albert, chairman of the commission responsible for the
design of the building; and other sections.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Visitors will learn about the history of Parliament back to the
12th century and the roles of the Houses of Parliament. Arcane
rituals _ like the role of Black Rod, Gentleman Usher and
Sergeant-at-Arms, who is responsible for the security of the House
of Lords, and plays a prominent part in the annual state opening of
Parliament _ will be explained. Tour members will see the two
dispatch boxes from where the prime minister and the leader of the
opposition party address the house and battle out their
differences. A highlight is the throne in the House of Lords where
the monarch sits at the state opening of a new session of
Parliament. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Also on view will be an exhibition in Westminster Hall, ``Voters
of the Future,'' showing the history of parliamentary democracy and
the functions of the two Houses of Parliament.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tours start at 9:30 a.m., with the last one at 4:15 p.m. from
Monday to Saturday, except on public holidays. They will cost $5.25
and must be booked through Ticketmaster at (44-207) 344-9966.
Tickets are available up to five days before a visit, and cannot be
bought on the day of the tour.

ONCE AGAIN   CALLAS' FANS   CAN BID HER   FAREWELL 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALAN RIDING   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ There is a miniature by the 18th-century Italian painter
Giandomenico Cignaroli, there are a couple of sketched portraits by
the movie director Pier Paolo Pasolini and there are furs and haute
couture dresses as well as shoes and gloves galore. Yet when these
and other even more personal items come up for auction here in
December, the point of interest will not be their intrinsic value
but their provenance.
</P>
<P>
   All belonged to Maria Callas, arguably the 20th century's most
famous operatic diva.
</P>
<P>
   When she died at 53 in Paris on Sept. 16, 1977, her unlikely
heirs were her estranged husband, Giovanni Battista Meneghini, whom
she left for the Greek shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis in 1959,
and her mother, Evangelia, with whom she had not spoken in 25
years. They sold the furniture and paintings in her apartment on
the Avenue Georges Mandel and then divided up the personal objects,
with Meneghini's half going to Italy and Evangelia's share sent to
Greece.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after passing into other hands, these collections of Callas
memorabilia are coming together again for a pre-auction exhibition
that will open in Monaco on July 28 and travel to Tokyo and New
York before returning to Paris for display prior to the auction at
Drouot-Montaigne on Dec. 2 and 3. After that, they will be
dispersed, bringing to a close sporadic efforts to create a Callas
museum in both Greece and Italy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The logic of the auction is the continuation of the dispersal
of Callas' belongings since the time of her death,'' explained
Frederic Chambre, a partner in the French auction house Calmels
Chambre Cohen. ``Many things have been sold or were lost, but these
are the two largest extant collections.'' He added: ``This is an
auction in the spirit of the Marilyn Monroe auction. It's an
intimate, private affair.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is also one that Chambre and his colleagues are eager to
have noticed, in the conviction that legions of Callas devotees
dream of possessing something that brings them closer to the
legendary Divina, anything that she once owned, touched, wore. Many
of the items on sale will be on view in New York from Nov. 7 to 13
at the showroom of Leftbid.com at 1016 Madison Avenue, near 78th
Street. The auction itself will also be open to Internet bidders
using the site www.leftbid.com.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 400 or so lots on sale, a number stand out for their
close association with Callas. Cignaroli's ``Holy Family,'' for
instance, was given to her by Meneghini, who was then courting her,
when she sang the title role in Ponchielli's ``Gioconda'' in her
first performance in Verona in 1947. The painting, kept in a red
velvet case, traveled with her everywhere and can be seen in many
photographs taken in her dressing rooms around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The auction also includes Callas' chinchilla coat, made for her
in the 1950s by her couturiere friend Biki Milan, who was Puccini's
granddaughter. Among the many photographs of the fiery soprano in
this coat is one in which both Meneghini and Onassis can be seen
holding onto her, as if wrestling for possession. In the 1960s the
coat was covered by emerald green silk, with the chinchilla
becoming its lining, and that is how it now looks. The other fur to
be sold is a white mink bolero jacket with the word Maria woven
into its lining.
</P>
<P>
   The two Pasolini portraits as well as a heavy amethyst-colored
glass necklace date from 1969, when Callas played Medea in a
nonoperatic film of Euripides' play. The film was not a commercial
success but established a close friendship with Pasolini that
lasted until the Italian director's own death in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Callas herself was a collector, not of valuable paintings or
furniture (although she owned copies of a Cycladic statue and of a
Greek tomb, also to be sold) but of anything linked to her life and
career. Thus the auction will be offering three of her personal
photo albums (which not only show her before and after her famous
crash diet in 1954 but also as a blonde and as a brunette),
envelopes full of newspaper cuttings, letters from friends and
admirers, and many of her contracts, including those for her first
and last performances at La Scala in Milan, in 1951 and 1958.
</P>
<P>
   The tape recorder that Callas used to practice her roles will
also be for sale, along with a collection of large-spool tapes of
recordings of her favorite music. These include one of her
recordings of ``Tosca'' and a surprising amount of nonvocal
classical music, like symphonies by Saint-Saens and Sibelius,
Chopin waltzes and Vivaldi's ``Four Seasons.'' Among the many
scores that she kept are those for Richard Strauss songs and a
piano version of Verdi's ``Don Carlo.''
</P>
<P>
   But most of the auction lots are decidedly more personal. There
is an array of colorful party dresses, handbags, shoes, hats and
wigs, but also slips, stockings, a black girdle, two brassieres and
an embroidered blue corset of the kind known in French as a
``guepiere.'' Callas, renowned for her long slim hands, owned
drawers full of elbow-length kid gloves in many colors; 14 pairs of
gloves are in the auction. Nothing, though, could be more personal
than three plaits of the diva's hair, all in slightly different
tones of brunette.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these items have until now been on loan to a traveling
exhibition organized by the International Maria Callas Association
of Venice that drew crowds to Tokyo's Opera City in 1997 and to the
Hotel de Ville in Paris in 1998. While that exhibition also showed
what Callas wore in ``La Traviata'' at the Metropolitan Opera of
New York in 1958 and in ``Tosca'' at Covent Garden in 1965,
however, the auction includes none of her stage costumes or
jewelry, most of which are still owned by opera houses.
</P>
<P>
   Today it is hard to divine how Meneghini and Evangelia divided
up the belongings, although it is said that Meneghini refused to
take anything linking his wife to Onassis. (As it happens, the
auction includes nothing associated with Onassis, for whom Callas
felt great bitterness after he abandoned her to marry Jacqueline
Kennedy in 1968.). After the collections left Paris, though, they
had very different lives.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Meneghini, whose marriage to Callas was never annulled, is
reported to have proposed creating a Callas museum, but nothing had
come of this by the time he died in 1986, leaving his entire estate
to his housekeeper, Emma Roverselli-Brutti. She is believed to have
sold most of Callas' private archives in Italy before selling the
rest of her belongings to an Italian collector, Ilario Tamassia,
who then created a sanctuary to Callas in his home in Modena. He
also lent items for the traveling exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   It was Tamassia who first contacted Chambre late last year with
a view to selling his collection. ``He no longer wants to hold the
memory of Callas all alone,'' Chambre explained. ``He too wanted to
create a museum, but he had no response from the authorities and
decided to sell. I then set out looking for other objects here and
there, but the only other big collection was in Greece.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1982, upon the death of Callas' mother, the singer's sister,
Jackie, inherited the collection, which included an 18th-century
console that had been in Callas' Paris apartment and was offered
for sale through an Athens dealer in 1989. It was bought by a Greek
journalist, Nicolas Petsalis-Diomidis, who happened to be preparing
a biography about Callas and who met Jackie Callas through the
dealer. Between 1989 and 1995 he bought most of her collection.
</P>
<P>
   In an essay prepared for the auction catalog, Petsalis-Diomidis
said that when his biography, ``The Unknown Callas,'' was published
in Greece in 1998, he too tried to interest the mayor of Athens in
creating a Callas museum. The mayor showed enthusiasm, he said, and
even proposed naming a central plaza in Athens after the diva.
``But two years later, I have seen no name on a square and no
interest in a museum,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, he said, having been contacted by Chambre, he decided
to sell the collection and obtained Jackie Callas' ``moral
approval'' for the auction. ``Perhaps the Callas myth is better
served by dispersing her last personal belongings,'' he said.
``After all, who will buy these objects if not people who truly
love and admire Callas, who respect her memory and cultivate her
legend? I said to myself, why a museum and not 100, 150 or 1,000
ardent defenders of her glory who can perpetuate her memory?''
</P>
<P>
   So Callas' last physical vestiges _ her ashes were scattered in
the Aegean Sea _ were packed in Italy and Greece and transported to
Paris, where they were sorted out, in some cases (like her wigs)
cleaned and restored and then kept locked in the basement of an art
security firm barely a mile from where they were taken 23 years
earlier. Now, much like the international recitals that preceded
Callas' last public performance on Nov. 11, 1974, the relics are
preparing for a final tour.

ARMSTRONG SOARS INTO LEAD BY CLIMBING MOUNTAINS `LIKE AN
AIRPLANE' 
</HEADLINE>
   By SAMUEL ABT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOURDES-HAUTACAM, France _ Lance Armstrong blew apart the Tour
de France in its first day in the mountains Monday, leaving his
major rivals far behind and taking a huge step toward his second
successive victory in the bicycle race.
</P>
<P>
   Clad in the yellow jersey of the leader, Armstrong said, ``It
was a good day, a big day. The legs were good.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed they were. The leader of the U.S. Postal Service team now
is 4 minutes 14 seconds ahead of the rider in second place, Jan
Ullrich, the German leader of Telekom, the winner of the 1997 Tour
and the rival Armstrong seems to respect most.
</P>
<P>
   Such other contenders as Richard Virenque, Abraham Olano, Alex
Zulle, Fernando Escartin, Laurent Jalabert, Bobby Julich and Marco
Pantani are at least seven minutes behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is still in this race,'' Armstrong insisted to
general disbelief. `'There's two weeks to go. They won't give up
till Paris,'' where the Tour ends July 23.
</P>
<P>
   The only feat the Texan did not quite pull off was victory in
the 205-kilometer (127-mile) stage over three major and two minor
climbs in the Pyrenees.
</P>
<P>
   Finishing first in nearly daylong heavy rain was Javier Otxoa, a
Spaniard with Kelme, whose name is usually given as Ochoa except in
the Tour's official rosters. Now in his fourth year as a
professional, the 25-year-old rider scored his first victory by
joining a small breakaway at Kilometer 50, building a big lead and
holding a bit of it until the finish in fog and chilling cold atop
the Hautacam mountain.
</P>
<P>
   The spent Otxoa wobbled home in 6 hours 9 minutes 32 seconds, a
speed of 33 kilometers an hour for this 10th of 21 stages.
Proceedings began in Dax, where the 162-man field was nine starters
larger.
</P>
<P>
   ``He deserved to win,'' Armstrong said, `'and I'm happy for him.
Probably 99 percent of the people here were Spaniards.'' Tens of
thousands of spectators flooded the final road up despite the
weather, which was not as ugly as forecast. The heavy winds and
snow atop the climbs that had been predicted by the French weather
service were nonexistent.
</P>
<P>
   The uglier the better, as far as Armstrong was concerned. He had
been pleased on Sunday when he heard the forecast, noting that he
rode well in bad weather _ at age 21 he won the world road race
championship in 1993 in heavy rain in Oslo _ while cold and heavy
winds would trouble the lighter Spanish climbers.
</P>
<P>
   Except for Otxoa, their main problem was Armstrong. Riding with
determination and ease, he sped away from a clutch of Spaniards and
other contenders to finish alone, 42 seconds behind in second
place. Armstrong started the final 13.5-kilometer climb, on a
gradient of nearly 8 percent, almost nine minutes down on the
Spaniard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Armstrong went like an airplane,'' Virenque, a member of the
group Armstrong deserted, said in wonder.
</P>
<P>
   The new man in the yellow jersey, replacing Alberto Elli, an
Italian with Telekom who is now 57th, had his own explanation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very strong,'' he said, a rare confession despite his
impressive showing in the mountains of his final preparatory race
last month. ``But this was a tactical race.
</P>
<P>
   ``The important part of the race began on the Aubisque,'' two
climbs from the end. Speaking of his team, he continued: ``We were
maybe too aggressive in pulling at the start of the Aubisque.'' He
had six of his eight teammates with him there but they faded one by
one up the 16.5-kilometer climb on a 7.1 percent gradient.
</P>
<P>
   Halfway to the top, Armstrong was without support while Ullrich,
Zulle and Pantani had at least one teammate to pace each of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``My only choice was to wait,'' Armstrong said. Ahead, Virenque
and Escartin were building a lead that topped two minutes. ``It was
a little bit of a crisis for me _ two minutes was a lot to give.''
</P>
<P>
   Still two minutes behind, Armstrong stayed in his group until
the Hautacam ascension 20 kilometers later. ``Everybody was waiting
for an attack by Pantani,'' a renowned climber, ``and sure enough,
he did attack.''
</P>
<P>
   The Texan followed him, then attacked himself. He looked back at
Pantani, asking for a relay, saw that the Italian was spent and
sped off. Soon he caught the Virenque group ahead, moved to its
front and sped off alone again.
</P>
<P>
   Rising occasionally from his saddle to increase his leg thrust,
Armstrong was uncatchable.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, he tried to temper speculation that he would remain
uncatchable all the way to Paris. ``There are still a lot of
mountains,'' he said. ``There's still a lot that can happen.''
</P>
<P>
   He said much the same last year after he won the first mountain
stage, leaving his foes demoralized, on his way to easy victory.

&HT;     MISSILE DEFENSE SUPPORTERS BRUSH OFF FAILED TEST  
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Supporters of the proposed National Missile Defense
program said Monday that the system's embarrassing flop last
weekend didn't mean that the weapon was fundamentally flawed and
that the $36 billion-plus program should press ahead despite the
failure.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Kyl, R-Ariz., one of the weapon's most ardent
supporters on Capitol Hill, called the test ``disappointing,'' but
added that ``the primary failure had to do with a technology that
is not a new technology, that is, separating a booster from its
payload.''
</P>
<P>
   Kyl said the failure of the intercepting missile's ``kill
vehicle'' to separate from its rocket was ``a failure of old
technology We've done this hundreds of times.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing about this latest test that would be
definitive about not proceeding with National Missile Defense,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Baker Spring, a missile defense expert with the Heritage
Foundation, a conservative think tank, said the test failure wasn't
an indictment of the National Missile Defense program which is
designed to allow the U.S. military to destroy an incoming
ballistic missile in mid-flight by smashing it with the kill
vehicle, essentially a 130-pound battering ram.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not something to do with missile defense technology
and the relatively sophisticated elements of that technology,''
Spring said. ``The rocket booster they used in the test was a
well-known quantity and something they used on a number of
occasions,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bob Smith, R-N.H., another supporter of the program, said
that despite the test failure, ``I have seen enough of the science
and technology of this system to know that it will work.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Curt Weldon, R-Pa., an ardent proponent, said that even
with the failure it should be ``full steam ahead on missile
defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary indications blamed Saturday's test flop on the
failure of the interceptor rocket _ a Minuteman intercontinental
missile refurbished by Lockheed Martin Corp. _ to jettison its
``kill vehicle.''
</P>
<P>
   During the test, a key dry run for the National Missile Defense
system, an intercontinental ballistic missile with a fake warhead
was launched from Vandenberg AFB, Calif., at 12:19 a.m. EDT
Saturday morning. Twenty minutes later, the interceptor was
launched from Kwajalein Atoll in the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Failure of the kill vehicle to separate from the interceptor's
second stage rocket would represent a glitch in old-line technology
that has been in use since manned space flight began nearly 40
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The result was that the interceptor didn't come close to hitting
its target.
</P>
<P>
   The test cost the Pentagon $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   Air Force Lt. Col. Rick Lehner, a spokesman for the Ballistic
Missile Defense Organization, which is managing the NMD system,
said it appears that the kill vehicle never received the electronic
signal from the rocket booster to separate, fly solo and ram the
dummy warhead.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Adams, a spokesman for Lockheed Martin's space unit, in
Sunnyvale, Calif., stressed that the boosters on the Minuteman have
been ``tested and retested'' and that they have a long history of
successfully sending payloads aloft into space.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have not been any problems in the past with these
boosters. They have been very reliable and there has been a high
degree of confidence in these systems,'' Adams said.
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia Taylor, a spokeswoman for The Boeing Co., in Anaheim,
Calif., which is the lead contractor on National Missile Defense,
said the company was working with the Pentagon, Lockheed Martin and
other subcontractors to determine whether the failure was due to a
malfunctioning piece of equipment, a computer software glitch or
perhaps some combination.
</P>
<P>
   A government official who attended the interceptor launch said
Pentagon officials know that the rocket booster and kill vehicle
electronically communicated successfully throughout the test's
short duration.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we don't know is why the booster didn't tell the kill
vehicle to initiate the separation sequence. The problem could be
something as simple as a chip that went bad,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the program assert the failure of a tried and true
technology _ booster-payload separation _ underscores their view
that the United States wouldn't be able to rely on NMD in time of
national crisis.
</P>
<P>
   John Pike, a space expert with the Federation of American
Scientists, a non-profit think tank, said NMD ``has all the
fragility of normal technology plus the special fragilities of
missile defense technologies. This is complex system and a lot of
things have to work right for it to work at all.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to protecting U.S. cities against a ballistic
missile attack from so-called ``rogue'' countries such as North
Korea and Iran, the system is being designed to provide protection
against an accidental nuclear missile launch in Russia, sparked by
decaying Soviet-era equipment or a weapon that falls into the hands
of a terrorist.
</P>
<P>
   Program supporters had hoped for a successful test intercept to
make their case that National Missile Defense should move forward.
Thus far, the testing results are poor. In addition to the recent
failure, the system scored a bullseye in a test last October but
then missed in a January test.
</P>
<P>
   The program is on a tight deadline. Defense Secretary William
Cohen is scheduled to make a recommendation to President Clinton
next month about whether the weapon is ready to move from the
laboratory to the battlefield.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton in turn must give his approval no later than November or
December if the Pentagon is to meet a deployment date of 2005, the
date when U.S. intelligence officials believe North Korea might
possess a missile capable of striking the United States.
</P>
<P>
   According to current Pentagon plans, if Clinton gives the green
light, the $36 billion-plus program will be constructed in several
phases. At first, the anti-missile system will use 20 interceptors
based in Alaska by 2005. But by 2007, the Pentagon plans to add
another 80 interceptor missiles. The cost could grow substantially
if the military adds additional interceptors and another launch
site.

SPORTS COLUMN: BEANBALLS, CLEMENS AND PIAZZA 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   His name is Clemens, not Clemency. The first time Roger Clemens
pitched batting practice in spring training a year ago, Derek Jeter
stepped into the cage with his bat while wearing a catcher's mask,
chest protector and shin guards. Off to the side, Chuck Knoblauch
was dressed the same way.
</P>
<P>
   On the mound, Clemens laughed. So did the other Yankees who knew
his reputation for ``throwing inside,'' the current politically
correct euphemism for the beanball, the knockdown pitch.
</P>
<P>
   But the Yankees had never laughed when Clemens was an opposing
pitcher. In a 1998 incident, Clemens, then with the Toronto Blue
Jays, plunked Scott Brosius, prompting a scrum. Knoblauch had
always wondered if his Texas A&AMP;M background had provoked Clemens,
from the rival University of Texas, to throw inside just for the
fun of it.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens even drilled his former Boston Red Sox teammate, Mo
Vaughn, for digging in too close to the plate. When the Mets
repeatedly tried to pick Clemens off second base a year ago, he
told their infielders, ``Do that once more and I'll put one in your
ear'' _ a throwback line similar to the old ``stick it in his ear''
expression.
</P>
<P>
   So when Clemens' fastball smashed into Mike Piazza's helmet
Saturday night at Yankee Stadium, Clemens' intentions were
instantly suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Early last week Clemens had even predicted that he would be
``more aggressive'' in pitching to Piazza, who in 12 at-bats
against Clemens had seven hits, including three home runs. And
suddenly the Mets' catcher was sprawled in the dirt, dizzy with a
concussion.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Piazza branded the pitch ``definitely
intentional.'' Clemens repeated that he was just ``trying to pitch
him inside.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Mets thought they could prove in court that Clemens had
intentionally tried to hit Piazza in the head with a weapon (a
90-plus mile-per-hour fastball), the 37-year-old Yankee could be
charged with assault; Marty McSorley of the Boston Bruins is
awaiting trial in Vancouver for assault with a weapon in flattening
Donald Brashear of the Canucks with his stick.
</P>
<P>
   But only Clemens knows if he was intentionally trying to hit
Piazza on the helmet or in the head.
</P>
<P>
   Considering Clemens' reputation, the belief here is that, yes,
he was trying to intimidate Piazza by firing a flaming fastball
near his head, just as the 6-foot-4-inch, 238-pound right-hander
has intimidated so many other batters.
</P>
<P>
   But was he trying to hit Piazza in the helmet? No.
</P>
<P>
   Was he really aiming lower, hoping to hit Piazza in the back or
the ribs and the pitch sailed a little higher? Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   Would he have done it over the weekend in Shea Stadium, where a
pitcher has to bat? Maybe not.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever his intentions, if Clemens' fastball had somehow hit
Piazza in the head, especially the temple, he could have killed the
Mets' catcher. In 1920, another Yankee right-hander with a
knockdown reputation, Carl Mays, fired a fastball that struck Ray
Chapman, a Cleveland Indians shortstop, in the head. He died 14
hours later _ baseball's only fatality.
</P>
<P>
   But there's no way to tell yet if Piazza, scratched from Tuesday
night's All-Star Game, will be the same slugger who was batting
.348 with 24 homers and 72 runs batted in. He knows it will take
time for him to be completely comfortable in the batter's box.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Medwick was never completely comfortable after being beaned
in the era before batters wore helmets. With the St. Louis
Cardinals in 1937, Medwick had a triple crown season: .374, 31
homers, 154 RBIs and he's in the Hall of Fame. But soon after Larry
MacPhail, the Brooklyn Dodgers boss, obtained him in a 1940 trade,
he was beaned by Cardinal right-hander Bob Bowman.
</P>
<P>
   Police and the umpires stopped Leo Durocher, the Dodgers
manager, and several players from charging the mound. When Bowman
later departed through the Dodger dugout, MacPhail, with a swing
from his Ebbets Field box seat, knocked his cap off.
</P>
<P>
   Medwick returned to bat .301 with 17 homers and 86 RBIs that
season, followed by .318 with 18 homers and 88 RBIs in 1941 (when
the Dodgers won the pennant) and .300 with 96 RBIs but only 4
homers in 1942. But he never led the league again. He never was the
same hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, Piazza was wearing a helmet with an ear flap. It
may have saved his career, if not his life.

   CLINTON, AT CAMP DAVID, HOPES TO CLOSE THE ELUSIVE CIRCLE OF
MIDEAST PEACE
</P>
<P>
   By BOB DEANS
</P>
<P>
   2000 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When he opens the second Camp David summit on
Tuesday, President Clinton will be trying to close the elusive
circle of Mideast peace begun on the same ground two decades ago by
President Jimmy Carter.
</P>
<P>
   More than walking in history's shadow, Clinton hopes to burnish
his own scandal-tainted legacy by seizing what's likely to be his
last clean shot at a big picture foreign policy win.
</P>
<P>
   After seven years spent learning the issues and getting to know
the personalities involved in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,
Clinton is under no illusions about the difficulty of the talks
he's signed on to host in the days ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this were easy,'' he told reporters on Monday, ``it would
have been done a long time ago.''
</P>
<P>
   With just six months left in office, though, Clinton is gambling
that he can mix U.S. power and prestige with personal diplomacy to
help press Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat to complete a peace process that Carter set in motion
in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is difficult. It is perhaps the most difficult of all the
peace problems in the world,'' said Clinton. ``But, both Prime
Minister Barak and Chairman Arafat have the vision, the knowledge,
the experience and the ability _ and the sheer guts _ to do what it
takes, I think, to reach an agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   The quest for peace between Israelis and Palestinians has become
a search for the diplomatic Holy Grail among two generations of
American policymakers.
</P>
<P>
   It's seen as the key to ending half a century of enmity between
modern Israel, the Jewish state forged in the aftermath of the
Holocaust, and all of its Arab neighbors. The conflict has ensured
instability in a region that is at once the cradle of civilization,
birthplace of three of the world's great religions and home to
two-thirds of all the known crude oil reserves on earth.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton himself has already hosted two major Mideast peace
summits.
</P>
<P>
   His first, a nine-day marathon between Arafat and Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the fall of 1998 at the Wye River
Plantation in rural Maryland, produced an accord whose provisions
the parties only partly carried out, a major foreign policy
frustration for Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   His second, a weeklong set of talks between Barak and Syrian
Foreign Minister Farouk Sharaa last January in Shepardstown, West
Va., produced no agreement and precious little progress between two
countries that remain technically at war.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Clinton has held more than a dozen one-on-one
summits _ at the White House and in Jerusalem, Geneva, Oslo and
even the Gaza strip _ with Mideast leaders, hoping to press the
tortured peace process forward.
</P>
<P>
   Closing out his presidency with an Israeli-Palestinian peace
accord under his belt wouldn't erase the stain of the Monica
Lewinsky scandal from Clinton's biography, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   It would, though, go a long way toward mitigating his reputation
as a political underachiever and cementing his legacy as a
president willing to invest U.S. resources in trying to resolve
seemingly intractable conflicts from the Balkans and Northern
Ireland to South Asia and the Korean Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is his last big chance to get something historians will
remember,'' said Dan Thomas, professor of political science at
Warburg College, in Waverly, Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, who is completing a book entitled ``Clinton and the
Public Mind,'' said there's little hope the Republican-led Congress
would permit the president a major domestic policy achievement in
an election year.
</P>
<P>
   ``He realizes that he's pretty much a lame duck,'' said Thomas,
``so this is it.''
</P>
<P>
   Both politically and strategically, Carter faced a very
different set of circumstances in September,1978, when he spent 13
days holed up with Egyptian President Anwar al-Sadat and Israeli
Prime Minister Menachem Begin at Camp David.
</P>
<P>
   Carter, for one thing, had two years remaining in office. He
used that time to help win congressional backing for the historic
peace accord he brokered between Egypt and Israel _ and the $4
billion in annual aid to those countries that was part of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   If Arafat and Barak strike a deal at Camp David, much of the
tough work of implementing the agreement would likely be left to
Clinton's successor.
</P>
<P>
   The geopolitical stakes were also different. Carter would soon
face an oil shock that ravaged the U.S. economy, the capture of
American diplomats by Iranian revolutionaries and the Soviet
invasion of Afghanistan. Each of those events shook this country
and underscored the precarious nature of U.S. interests in the
volatile Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   No such dire consequences are anticipated in the region in the
months ahead _ regardless of the outcome of this week's summit.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton hopes, however, to pick up the string left dangling ever
since the Camp David accords laid out a roadmap for a broader
Mideast peace. Begin and Sadat agreed, after all, to convene
Israeli-Palestinian negotiations aimed at resolving their dispute
``in all its aspects'' within five years.
</P>
<P>
   Similar language was enshrined again in October, 1993. Then, in
a peace treaty signed on the White House lawn just eight months
after Clinton took office, Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin pledged to negotiate a comprehensive land-for-peace
agreement by 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Intent and implementation quickly parted ways, though, after
Rabin was assassinated by a Jewish zealot who feared the prime
minister was embarked on a mission to sell Israeli security short.
</P>
<P>
   It was at a memorial service to Rabin last fall that Clinton
pressed Barak and Arafat to work in earnest for a peace agreement.
They've set a Sept. 13 target date for completing the deal.
</P>
<P>
   That would require agreement on the most difficult issues
between the two sides, including the question of Palestinian
statehood, borders, the future of Jerusalem and the right of
Palestinian refugees to return to their former homelands, now
occupied by Israel.
</P>
<P>
   As he sat Sunday in his regular pew at the Foundry United
Methodist Church, two blocks from the White House, Clinton soaked
up allusions to the Holy Land and the ancient conflicts he seeks to
resolve. There was the Old Testament lesson, and its reference to
Jerusalem, the holy citadel where, according to Psalm 48, ``God has
shown himself a sure defense.''
</P>
<P>
   There was the spectacular stained glass rendition of the birth
of Christ in nearby Bethlehem, just outside of Jerusalem and under
Palestinian control.
</P>
<P>
   There were two tall red banners, flanking the altar and the
choir pews, each adorned with a single white dove.
</P>
<P>
   And there were the words to the closing hymn, ``God of Grace and
God of Glory,'' which Clinton appeared to be singing, containing
the third-stanza admonition, fateful perhaps, ``Cure thy children's
warring madness.''

WILLIAMS SISTERS WOW WIMBLEDOM AND THEMSELVES 
</HEADLINE>
   By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WIMBLEDON, England _ Venus Williams kept pointing at the clock,
and Serena kept taking her time, but once the two sisters arrived
at the champions dinner Sunday night, they shimmered in perfect
harmony.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was stunning,'' Venus Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I passed by a mirror, and I was like, Whoa,'' Serena added.
</P>
<P>
   It seems Venus and Serena Willams don't have daily affirmations,
they have them hourly. Together, the queens of self-esteem exited
the All England Club Monday after adding the doubles title to the
singles championship Venus Williams won on Saturday. In their
eye-catching wake, they left some of the best players in the world
searching their pockets for some confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just for us to come back like this, I can only imagine what
people are thinking,'' said Serena Williams, who, like her sister,
missed most of the spring because of injury. ``Obviously, they're
probably going to go home and practice harder. But you know what?
We are, too. We come at it really serious. And we mean business.''
</P>
<P>
   In one fortnight, Venus Williams bludgeoned the instinctive
talents out of Martina Hingis' game and then overwhelmed Lindsay
Davenport's power with her own. After missing two months with a
knee injury, Serena Williams came to the All England Club without a
warmup match. But she dropped just one service game in four rounds,
took less than hour to dismantle most of her opponents and
discovered the only obstacle in her journey to the title was her
big sister in the semifinal.
</P>
<P>
   As a seal of proof to their dominance, the two won their doubles
match after being awaken by an 8:30 a.m. phone call this morning.
It was their mother calling from Florida, but Venus Williams
admitted that she was too groggy to be coherent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was somewhat in a coma,'' said Venus Williams after falling
asleep at 2 a.m. following the champions dinner. ``I couldn't
think, so I said, `I've got to call you back.' I haven't spoken to
her since.''
</P>
<P>
   Just four hours after the wake-up call, Venus and Serena
Williams walked out on Centre Court to play their rain-delayed
doubles championship title. Almost in their sleep, the unranked,
unseeded wild-card entrants into the competition defeated Julie
Halard-Decugis and Ai Sugiyama, 6-3, 6-2, for the title. After the
sisters embraced at the net, they held up the trophy to provide one
last Wimbledon snapshot of their invincibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's getting pretty scary,'' Venus Williams said of their
dominance, ``but we like it.''
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the Tour seems a bit unsettled by their surge.
Hingis once had the genius to diffuse any opponent's power. Two
years ago, her confidence was unrivaled and her cunning was her
ally. When her body was stretched to its limit and her will was
worn down, Hingis' spirits were broken after her semifinal loss to
Venus Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be enough just with my abilities I had at the
time,'' said Hingis. ``It has changed so much since the Williamses
started playing better. I guess as the No. 1, you're supposed to
win a Grand Slam. But now someone else probably deserves to be No.
1.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the goal of the Williams sisters, both of them. Whatever
tension existed when Serena Williams had a Grand Slam title and her
big sister didn't, it seems to have been diluted by Venus'
Wimbledon win.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're both even again,'' Venus said. ``Now, we're both going
for our second one.''
</P>
<P>
   As they sat side by side in an interview room Monday, they were
very straightforward when asked about their plans for the immediate
future.
</P>
<P>
   ``To win the U.S. Open,'' Venus said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, for me too,'' Serena chimed in.
</P>
<P>
   The competition between them has the potential to leave everyone
else drifting like satellites around their world if they ever reach
their goal of becoming No. 1 and No. 2. What once seemed
far-fetched isn't such a wild idea anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're both going to try and get as many wins as we can,''
Venus Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really greedy,'' Serena Williams added.
</P>
<P>
   This is how they were all day. Venus Williams would answer a
question, then the little sister would tag-along in response. When
asked who would star in the sisters' home-designed tennis
newsletter, Venus looked at Serena to cue her reply.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be about Wimbledon, and what I think happened
this year,'' Serena Williams said. ``Pete Sampras won his 13th
Grand Slam, and I don't know, I think Venus might get the cover
story. That was a pretty big happening.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have pull,'' Venus said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CAN END HERE.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It was the same way Sunday night. The big sister kept pushing
the little sister to get herself together.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took two hours for me to get ready, and I wasn't even the
Wimbledon ladies champion,'' Serena Williams said. ``So it was
pretty ridiculous. Venus was rushing me.''
</P>
<P>
   For a fortnight, one pushed the other to reach goals that only
feed their confidence. For the sisters, it's full-steam ahead.  &QL;

NATURE REBOUNDS AT MOUNT ST. HELENS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, July 16)  
 By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Mount St. Helens erupted early on the morning of May 18,
1980, the devastation was immense. In the span of a few seconds,
1,312 feet of rock were cleaved off the top of the mountain, and
the flow of mud, lava and boulders covered the earth 20 miles away.
Dozens of square miles were transformed into a barren, burned gray
moonscape, and 57 people and thousands of animals perished. Today,
20 years later, nature has rebounded in surprising ways on the
mountain, in southwest Washington State. There are some fledgling
plants, trees and berry bushes, most from seeds reintroduced to the
area by wandering elk. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Other animals _ frogs, salamanders, beavers _ have come back,
too. While the area still shows evidence of breathtaking
incineration, there are now literally hundreds of research plots,
where scientists are carefully chronicling the amazing process,
known as recolonization, under which nature is springing back to
life.The delicate question is, How much of a tourist attraction
should all this be?
</P>
<P>
   Many tourism boosters in the area are lobbying for greater
visitor access to the mountain, formally known as the Mount St.
Helens National Volcanic Monument. Among other things, they'd like
to extend the main road that snakes through the monument to provide
access from the east. (The road currently provides access from
Interstate 5 to the west, ending at a federal observatory near the
crater.) They have talked of marketing the mountain and the
surrounding area as a multiday vacation destination with hiking,
camping, biking and kayaking _ not, as most visitors make it now, a
detour of a half-day or so to learn about the volcano and gape at
nature's awesome power.
</P>
<P>
   Whether such an effort to expand tourism could succeed is an
open question, and some scientists say that because of the
fragility of the recovering landscape it's best to keep an informal
lid on the number of visitors by holding off on such promotions.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The most immediate issue concerning tourism centers on the main
visitors center, known as Silver Lake. It is a few miles off the
Interstate near Castle Rock, Wash., and is thus a popular spot for
motorists between Portland and Seattle to stop and learn about the
blast. (The Spirit Lake Memorial Highway leads from there to the
mountain, about 40 miles away.)  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last winter, citing budget cutbacks, the Forest Service closed
the center for a few months. But when it announced in March that
the center would not reopen at all this year, local officials were
angry, citing the upcoming 20th anniversary. Under pressure from
the state's Congressional delegation, the Forest Service agreed to
reopen the center for the year, but its future remains uncertain,
and the federal government is even considering privatization. This
is largely because of shortfalls in the Recreation Fee
Demonstration Program, which the Congress started four years ago
with the aim of making some federal recreation sites
self-sufficient. The program generated about $2.3 million at Mount
St. Helens in 1998, but last year, when poorer summer weather
reduced the number of visitors, dropped to about $1.4 million, not
enough to make the monument self-sustaining. There are four other
visitors centers of various sizes around the monument, two operated
by the Forest Service, one by Cowlitz County, and one by
Weyerhaeuser, the timber company. The official total for visitors
to the monument last year was 1.5 million, but that might overstate
the case a bit: the Forest Service counts someone who stops at all
three of their visitors centers as three visitors. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At the mountain, a network of good hiking trails has been
formed, carefully laid out not to interfere with the regeneration
taking place all around. These include the Ptarmigan Trail, which
leads to the summit (8,363 feet these days), and the 28-mile Loowit
Trail, which essentially circles the volcano and provides a
fascinating glimpse of the destruction along with some lands that
were, given the vagaries of the winds and the lava flow that day,
relatively untouched. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Access to the crater itself remains forbidden, with good reason:
it's still steaming in there.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the visitors centers, old photographs depict the cheerful
bygone days, with a lodge and the beautifully snowcapped cone of a
peak, a startling contrast to today's desolate landscape. The lodge
lies buried below hundreds of feet of debris from avalanches and
mud flow, and the peak is a gaping, jagged shadow of its former
self.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Camping sites are available in the monument, with prices ranging
from $11 to $20, according to a spokeswoman at the visitors center.
The main information number is (360) 247-3900. On the Web,
information can be retrieved at www.fs.fed.us./gpnf/mshnvm. Two
other sites with tourism information about the area are

AUTHOR'S DREAM TO HELP ILL CHILDREN TURNS INTO LEGAL NIGHTMARE

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1992, author Tom Clancy embarked on a philanthropic mission
worthy of Jack Ryan, the idealistic hero of his popular
techno-thrillers.
</P>
<P>
   Clancy wanted to help children who had cancer and other grave
illnesses use the nascent technology of the Internet to talk with
one another and learn about their diseases.
</P>
<P>
   The children's health network he imagined would also enable
parents to search out the best doctors, no matter how disadvantaged
or isolated the family might be. And it would let doctors tap into
the same worldwide database to share their expertise and find the
latest research.
</P>
<P>
   Clancy's inspiration was a 6-year-old Long Island, N.Y., boy,
Kyle Haydock, who sent him a fan letter while the boy lay in his
bed at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York City,
ravaged by sarcoma. At the height of his fame, Clancy fell hard for
Kyle and befriended him. He showered the boy with gifts, visited
his hospital room and even wheeled him around Disney World. ``This
little guy was a fighter,'' he later wrote in an essay.
</P>
<P>
   After Kyle died in 1991, Clancy set up a foundation and named it
for the boy. He donated more than $4 million from his fortune and
committed one-third of the proceeds from his next Jack Ryan movie,
according to his lawyer and foundation records.
</P>
<P>
   Clancy also used his fame and political connections to persuade
others to donate several million dollars more in cash and services.
The captains of powerful companies like Viacom joined the
foundation's board, as did big-name friends like the actor Tom
Selleck.
</P>
<P>
   But seven years later, Clancy is scuttling the Kyle Foundation,
which despite having spent more than $5 million on travel,
salaries, fund raising and furniture did not even have a Web site
to show for its efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The demise of one of the nation's more than 700,000 charities
typically unfolds without public scrutiny. Nameplates are removed
from doors, checking accounts are closed, and the directors move on
without comment. But the legal mud fight that has broken out in a
Denver courtroom over the failure of the Kyle Foundation offers a
rare glimpse at the inner workings of a celebrity charity.
</P>
<P>
   What went wrong is a matter of heated dispute. Clancy, in court
papers, accuses the woman he hired to run the foundation of
mismanagement and improper expenditures. She vehemently denies that
accusation and says Clancy killed off the project at the very
moment it was about to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual step, the IRS is examining the charity's financial
records to decide whether to revoke its tax-deductible status.
Donors would have to pay back taxes on their gifts if they had
reason to know the foundation was not performing its mission.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS, Clancy has said in a letter to the foundation's board,
is ``citing long delay in product rollout, limited charitable work
to date, high foundation expenses for salaries, travel and fund
raising.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends and associates say they do not blame Clancy for
undertaking what they see as a visionary project. Several, however,
faulted him for failing to keep a closer eye on a venture whose
success hinged on the deft use of an infant technology.
</P>
<P>
   A board member who ran a $29 billion computer company said he
twice told Clancy in 1997 that the foundation was floundering and
that its management was weak.
</P>
<P>
   The 53-year-old writer, who is completing his 11th novel,
brushed aside such warnings and did not act until last summer, when
he dispatched an accountant and then a retired Navy vice admiral to
take a closer look at the operation, board members said.
</P>
<P>
   Their reports in hand, Clancy sprang into action.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 11, a Friday morning, he summoned the foundation's
executive director, Katherine Gorshow, to his Maryland home and
demanded that she resign, according to court papers. Then, before
she could fly back to its offices in Englewood, Colo., he sent a
team of former agents from the FBI to secure the premises and
change the locks.
</P>
<P>
   It was an abrupt ending to a partnership that grew from a chance
meeting on the Internet to Gorshow's participation last year as
bridesmaid in Clancy's wedding.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Gorshow is suing the foundation, accusing it of breach of
contract in a state court in Denver, saying in court papers that
she had made ``significant progress'' toward taking the health
network online later this year. Indeed, new backers of the
foundation, including Sybase Inc., a software company, continue to
express enthusiastic support for the project.
</P>
<P>
   Clancy replied in court filings this month that Gorshow misused
foundation money for private purposes, including personal travel.
Gorshow denied the accusations through her lawyers. Clancy declined
to be interviewed for this article, saying, ``I'm gagged.''
</P>
<P>
   Kyle's mother, Eileen Haydock, of Baldwin, N.Y., said she began
having doubts about the foundation several years ago and
discouraged her friends from contributing. Still, Haydock said she
had nothing but admiration for Clancy and his efforts to honor her
son and help sick children. ``I think he felt that he had let down
my son,'' she said, ``and that's not true.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   There was little about Clancy's life that prepared him for
starting a multimillion-dollar foundation. He majored in English at
Loyola College in Baltimore, then sold insurance to tobacco and
corn farmers on the Chesapeake Bay.
</P>
<P>
   The unexpected success in 1985 of his first novel, ``The Hunt
for Red October,'' began a lucrative career that led to a string of
best-selling novels and popular movies made from them.
</P>
<P>
   His financial empire grew to include more than a dozen
businesses that have produced not only his major books like
``Patriot Games'' and ``Clear and Present Danger,'' but also
videogames, military manuals and serial novels written with others.
He bought a share of the Baltimore Orioles baseball team, and under
his latest deal with Putnam Publishing he earns $19 million for
each novel completed, according to court records.
</P>
<P>
   Associates say Clancy's considerable fortune has attracted
people with a host of causes and offbeat investment opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a very, very trusting man,'' said Diana Patin, Clancy's
former, longtime secretary. ``He accepted people as they put
themselves to him.''
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1990s, Clancy and his first wife, Wanda, lost $1.3
million to a coin dealer who was recently convicted of defrauding
them and dozens of other Maryland residents. In 1996, Clancy put $1
million into a company building a space vehicle that uses a
propeller to land like a helicopter. The company has since scaled
back its operations because of a lack of money.
</P>
<P>
   And, more recently, Clancy has helped a former CIA operative
turned cartoonist, Chip Beck, finance his investigation into
whether the U.S. government abandoned some of its troops taken
prisoner in wars fought this century. ``He gives people the chance
to prove themselves,'' Beck said.

<P>
   ``The government did not fall, and I am continuing on to Camp
David,'' Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak said Monday after
surviving a no-confidence vote in the Knesset, Israel's parliament.
</P>
<P>
   It was the former general's way of saying that neither
defections from his government's majority nor the tally in the
failed no-confidence vote (54 in favor, 52 against, short of the 60
needed to pass) would deter him from pursuing peace with the
Palestinians, as he had promised a year ago in his electoral
campaign. Admirable as Barak's resolute stance may be, he
nevertheless arrives at Camp David for what he calls ``the moment
of truth'' in a politically weakened condition.
</P>
<P>
   Everything will depend on the terms of any accord reached in the
coming days of top-level negotiations with Yasser Arafat and
President Clinton. If Barak does return home with the text of a
deal, he may present the agreement for a vote in the Knesset, and
then, if the Knesset endorses the deal, it would be put to a
national referendum. Barak could also choose to deposit the text of
an accord with the Knesset but then proceed directly to a national
referendum without asking Knesset members to endorse it.
</P>
<P>
   In either case, the rest of Israel will have to ratify any
agreement Barak strikes with Arafat. The effect of the defections
from his coalition and the close no-confidence vote is to reduce
his margin for maneuver at Camp David and perhaps diminish his
ability to draw on his reputation as Israel's most decorated
soldier when the time comes to market a peace deal to the Israeli
public.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat, who has his own critics to worry about, will also have
to make compromises if any deal is to be struck. More than ever
now, any such deal will have to pass muster with a majority of
Israelis. Barak must come away with an accord that protects
Israel's long-term security. Accordingly, it may be easier for
Israelis to accept revised municipal boundaries for Jerusalem than
a complete ceding of sovereignty in the Jordan River valley.
</P>
<P>
   A success at Camp David is still possible, but historic
compromises are best made by leaders who are not politically weak
at home.

 UNDATED: Beck said. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Clancy had become a fixture on the best-seller list by 1990 when
Kyle caught his attention. The boy's grandfather had read him
Clancy's first novel, and then he ``just about memorized'' a video
of the resulting movie, Clancy wrote in an essay encouraging others
to befriend a sick child. ``Each of them, however ill, is alive and
needful of the same things that we all need: love, friendship,
conversation,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   One of his first acts after creating the Kyle Foundation was to
hire Gorshow, whom he had met online in a discussion group run by
America Online, where she was a volunteer. He had a computer
glitch; she had the solution.
</P>
<P>
   Gorshow had been a college instructor and school administrator,
and she owned a mail-order, bulk-food distribution concern.
</P>
<P>
   In a chronology filed in Denver District Court, Gorshow
describes the foundation, in her first three years with it, as a
shoestring operation run from her home in Oroville, Calif., and
dogged by false starts. But by 1996, her starting salary of $43,000
had risen to $120,000, and fund raising took off when Clancy signed
a pledge to give $5 million in 10 installments, as well as the
future Jack Ryan movie proceeds.
</P>
<P>
   Clancy's enthusiasm for the project helped attract other big
gifts, including $1 million from Viacom, and $750,000 from Lew
Wasserman, the founder of MCA, and the MCA foundation. Aboard a
110-foot yacht off the coast of Vancouver, British Columbia, Clancy
secured $100,000 from John McCaw, cofounder of McCaw Cellular.
</P>
<P>
   While most of the money appears to have come from his
well-heeled friends, Clancy did use his fame to reach out to the
public as well. In November 1997 he appeared on ``Jeopardy,'' where
he announced he would donate his $10,000 consolation prize to the
foundation.
</P>
<P>
   But there were bumps on the implementation side. As the
foundation's executive director, Gorshow said she labored at a wide
range of activities _from securing an Internet address for the Web
site to building a prototype database of information about
pediatric oncology, which involved hiring college students to
translate some foreign-language documents.
</P>
<P>
   One major endeavor turned into a dead end. The foundation had
wanted to put computers in the homes and hospital rooms of sick
children. Gorshow said she discovered that other charities were
trying to do the same thing, and that pilot projects had turned up
a concern: There was not enough time to teach very ill children how
to use the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Other aspects of the original concept fell by the wayside,
including the notion of having cartoon characters answer questions
from children. But even the basic mission _ building a one-stop
directory to a million or so places to get health information _
began to seem elusive to the board.
</P>
<P>
   David R. Dukes, then the co-chairman of Ingram Micro, the
nation's largest wholesale distributor of computers, said he became
so convinced the foundation would not succeed that he resigned from
the board in mid-1997, rather than help the foundation raise more
money.
</P>
<P>
   Dukes said he told Clancy _ in person and later on the phone _
that with Gorshow as the foundation's leader, ``it became clear
this thing would not be able to go forward the way that it ought
to.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But, back at the time,'' Dukes said, ``I think, he was still
very enamored with her, and I'm not sure he wanted to hear that.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Kyle's mother was mystified. She said the foundation did
not respond to her e-mail messages inquiring about its progress,
and that it had become such a puzzle to her that she suggested that
friends seeking to honor Kyle donate to other charities.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Clancy's personal life began intersecting with the
foundation in unusual ways. When he ended a 1995 affair with a
woman he met online, the Manhattan penthouse they had shared was
cleared out by Gorshow and the foundation's director of operations,
according to foundation records.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, another woman he met online unsuccessfully
sued him for breaking off their engagement. She then alerted
federal and state officials in California to possible mismanagement
of foundation funds, the officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, Clancy's new wife, Alexandra Llewellyn, began
raising her own concerns about the foundation, prompting him to
send her family's accountant to examine the books, an associate of
Clancy said.
</P>
<P>
   The accountant delivered his report in February. Clancy, in his
Feb. 24 letter to the board, listed some of its highlights:
$636,628 spent on travel through 1998, $700,000 on consultants and
$100,154 on a one-time payout last year to Gorshow for accrued
vacation and sick pay.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation, the accountant discovered, had been fined
$20,000 by the IRS for tardy filing of its 1997 tax returns.
</P>
<P>
   Gorshow, in her letter to the board, defended the expenditures,
saying the travel was legitimate and the sick pay was suggested by
a consultant.
</P>
<P>
   Clancy asked a retired vice admiral, William McCauley, to assess
whether it was worth putting more money into the Kyle Foundation.
McCauley said he concluded that other medical Web sites had
eclipsed Clancy's dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got co-opted,'' McCauley said.
</P>
<P>
   Others disagree. In January, Sybase had agreed to give the
foundation its novel Web site portal program and the services of
seven engineers to get it online, and as late as March the company
was formulating a commitment it valued at $1 million a year for as
long as a decade. At the same time, a design concern had come up
with a foundation logo and was midway through its $500,000
commitment to creating a Web site for the foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Internet venture experts say that despite the proliferation of
medical information sites in recent years, the idea behind the Kyle
Foundation remains not only viable, but potentially profitable as
well. ``There is definitely need and demand for this type of
project,'' said Deborah Buresh, a director at Shattuck Hammond
Partners, the health care investment-banking division of
PricewaterhouseCoopers Securities.
</P>
<P>
   About $700,000 in foundation money remains, and Clancy has come
up with a much simpler way to spend it. He now plans to endow a
pediatric oncology research chair at the Johns Hopkins University
School of Medicine, to be named after Kyle. Clancy entered into an
agreement with Johns Hopkins that calls for him to add to that sum
until it reaches $2 million over the next three years, the
institution said.

   No future movie proceeds are involved.

SOUTH AFRICAN'S OBSTINACY ON AIDS DISAPPOINTS EXPERTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also SCI-AIDS-CONFERENCE.) 
 By RACHEL L. SWARNS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DURBAN, South Africa _ Striking a defiant and combative tone,
the South African government on Monday lashed out at its
increasingly vocal critics at the 13th International Aids
conference, saying there was no need for President Thabo Mbeki to
affirm that the human immunodeficiency virus, HIV, causes AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   The government was responding to the chorus of criticism from
prominent scientists, physicians and activists here who on Monday
expressed their disappointment with Mbeki. He opened the conference
on Sunday night with a speech in which he described extreme
poverty, rather than AIDS, as the biggest killer in this country.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, Mbeki has consulted with two American
researchers who argue that poverty and malnutrition _ and not HIV _
cause AIDS, an argument that most established scientists say was
debunked years ago. Monday, in panel sessions and interviews,
several participants said the president had squandered a golden
opportunity to clarify his position and to take a leadership role
in fighting the disease and preventing the spread of the virus,
which has infected 4 million people here.
</P>
<P>
   Health Minister Manto Tshabalala-Msimang dismissed the criticism
and accused the news media of distorting Mbeki's message. ``The
president of this country has never denied either the existence of
AIDS nor this causal connection between HIV and AIDS,'' she said at
a news conference Monday afternoon. ``But we reiterate our view
that it is inappropriate to blame everything around this epidemic
on the HIV virus.''
</P>
<P>
   Tshabalala-Msimang added that ``clearly, the relationship
between HIV and other social ills afflicting our society such as
poverty and disease'' is complex.
</P>
<P>
   But in the corridors and halls of the conference here, many
participants remained perplexed and confused by the president's
reluctance to say what so many people wanted to hear. Some wondered
whether he was too proud to back down. Others wondered whether
Mbeki, who is an economist and an intellectual, simply remained
unconvinced of the links between HIV and AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   No one disputes the link between poverty and HIV and AIDS.
Prostitutes, migrant laborers, the uneducated and victims of sexual
violence are more vulnerable to infection. And poor people
typically lack access to drugs that might prolong their lives.
</P>
<P>
   But scientists and researchers fear that Mbeki's heavy emphasis
on poverty may confuse people and cause them to continue risky
sexual behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Wainberg, the president of the International Aids Society,
the co-organizer of this conference, described Mbeki's speech,
which was broadcast live on national television, as a ``lost
opportunity.'' American officials said privately that they feared
that Mbeki had raised broader questions about the quality of his
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   A South African judge, Edwin Cameron, received a standing
ovation after he delivered the conference's opening speech Monday
and condemned Mbeki for wasting time on discredited theories while
people were dying.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has shaken almost everyone responsible for engaging the
epidemic,'' Cameron, who is infected with HIV, said of Mbeki's
stance. ``It has created an air of unbelief among scientists,
confusion among those at risk of HIV, and consternation among AIDS
workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally yearned for an unequivocal assertion by our
president of HIV as a virally specific condition, a specific
condition that is sexually transmitted.''
</P>
<P>
   The health minister emphasized Monday that Mbeki was committed
to combating the disease vigorously by encouraging safe sex and by
sponsoring research on drug therapies and a possible vaccine, which
has been applauded by researchers here.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Awa Coll-Seck, the director of the United Nations'
department of AIDS policy, said she was encouraged to hear Mbeki
mention the program in his speech on Sunday night. But Coll-Seck,
who is from Senegal, said she feared that the safe-sex message
might get lost in the emphasis on poverty.
</P>
<P>
   And she said she had hoped for more from Mbeki, who helped lead
the battle against apartheid and now champions the causes of an
African continent threatened by AIDS. ``I was discouraged,''
Coll-Seck said. ``We were expecting him to be a leader.''

MBEKI'S BLINDERS ON AIDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The tragedy of President Thako Mbeki's speech Sunday is that it
reinforces a culture of denial and confusion in South Africa that
will impede efforts to prevent the spread of AIDS. Twenty percent
of adult South Africans are living with the HIV virus, which causes
AIDS, and many more will become infected because the government is
unwilling to make HIV prevention a national crusade.
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki, in his speech before an international conference,
acknowledged the link between HIV and AIDS, but he insisted that
extreme poverty was the greatest public health problem facing his
country and the rest of Africa. Poverty is endemic through the
continent, but it is not the reason that many people fear a
population decline in some of the most fecund nations on earth.
Beyond the horror of killing people, AIDS will exacerbate poverty
by striking down millions in their most productive years.
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki has raised doubts about AZT and other drugs that have been
effective controlling the virus in wealthy nations. He is right
that these medicines are too expensive and the regimen too complex
for the limited public health infrastructure of his country. And it
would be a triumph for humanity if scientists could develop a
vaccine against HIV, as he proposes, but many doubt one will be
available soon.
</P>
<P>
   However, Mbeki ignores the reality that AIDS exists independent
of economic circumstances. American gays were as affluent as the
rest of US society in the 1980s, when the virus raced through their
ranks. When it become clear that the disease could be prevented,
they conducted an effective public health campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The opening of South Africa after the dismantling of apartheid
has encouraged the spread of HIV among heterosexuals. The ``safe
sex'' message of the 1980s among gay Americans needs to be adapted
to South African society. Uganda's success in limiting infection
rates ought to provide a model.
</P>
<P>
   More foreign aid for prevention is needed, but extra money will
be ineffective if the government does not have a sound strategy to
use it. Unless Mbeki mobilizes his government to educate his
people, millions are doomed to die in their prime.

TO FOIL A THIEF: TIMES CORRESPONDENTS IN 8 CITIES TELL HOW TO AVOID
PETTY CRIME 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, July 16) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Don't wear a Rolex, unless it's the sidewalk-sale type
</P>
<P>
   It's making headlines in Hampstead: the Rolex muggers are back.
</P>
<P>
   Like any other metropolis, London has its share of petty
criminals, from pickpockets to purse snatchers. But of late,
nothing has seemed to seize attention in the tonier parts of town
as much as thieves whose stock in trade is to grapple a fancy watch
or item of jewelry off the wrist of someone wealthy enough to
afford the ostentation.
</P>
<P>
   And nothing seems to attract the thieves as much as the high-end
versions of Rolexes and other high-class timepieces: the latest to
be reported missing was on the wrist of a millionaire soccer-club
owner, George Reynolds, whose Rolex was said to be worth $61,500.
</P>
<P>
   The police routinely advise people to avoid wearing expensive
jewelry _ or at least avoid making a show of it _ particularly in
such areas as Hampstead, Knightsbridge and Regent's Park, where
small gangs lie in wait for people they know to be wearing
expensive accouterments. Reynolds, for instance, was followed from
a restaurant in Hampstead before he was accosted.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, among those whose budget runs more to a Swatch or
Timex, there is some Schadenfreude at such assaults on the rich.
But thievery makes no such social distinctions. Recently, the
police warned travelers on London's subway to be alert for gangs of
child pickpockets _ a throwback to ``Oliver Twist,'' without the
charm of the musical. And crowded parts of the capital,
particularly Leicester Square, Piccadilly Circus and Oxford Street,
are haunts of thieves acting in groups of three _ one to distract a
passer-by, another to pick the pocket or purse and the third to
receive the stolen item and melt into the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Late at night, though, street-savvy Londoners are on the lookout
not just for thieves. Especially in Soho and the West End, women in
particular are advised by police to avoid curb-crawling drivers
offering their vehicles as unlicensed taxis: there have been a
series of sexual assaults on people who took up the offer. Young
people hitting the city's all-night clubs are also advised to
ensure they have enough money for a cab home from a reputable
company whose drivers and cars can be traced.
</P>
<P>
   The patterns behind London's crime are more opaque. Last year,
the Metropolitan Police changed the categories and time-scale of
its crime statistics, making comparisons with previous years
difficult. But some crimes such as burglary _ which do not directly
affect hotel-based visitors _ seemed to be on the increase, with
127,701 incidents reported in 1999, slightly more than in 1998.
Thefts of everything from automobiles to bicycles (not to mention
Rolexes) also seemed to be increasing, with 415,019 cases, 22,357
involving pickpockets, reported to the police last year _ around 10
percent higher than a year earlier.
</P>

York Times.

<P>
   AMSTERDAM
</P>
<P>
   Bike thefts, cons and drugs, and other causes for red lights
</P>
<P>
   Few cities in Europe feel as laid back as Amsterdam, with its
preference for pedestrians and bikes, its outdoor cafes and
easygoing policies on drugs and sex. But amid the strollers are
more than flower children. Pickpockets and bag snatchers thrive
precisely because people seem so much at ease and distracted.
</P>
<P>
   They operate of course where most of the tourists are: the tram
lines (especially Nos. 1, 2 and 5), which go to the main museums;
on the train connecting Schiphol Airport and the city; in and
around the Central Station, and at waiting lines for tour boats or
ferries. Groups of two or three young people are likely to use a
classic technique: one asks for directions, while another reaches
for your bag or backpack.
</P>
<P>
   This city may well have the greatest bicycle density of any
European capital, but it does not mean people won't steal yours.
Bicycle theft is so common that anyone renting a bike should
automatically take out insurance. Similarly, leaving property
visible inside a parked car can be an invitation for trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Amsterdam's police offer other warnings. You will never win if
you are talked into playing Balletje, the Dutch version of the game
where a ball is hidden under one of three cups: here it is a paper
ball and three matchboxes. The main player usually tricks you with
the help of accomplices. And for all the Netherlands' supposed
permissiveness toward soft drugs, it is only marijuana that is
legal. The police note that not only are cocaine, heroin, ecstasy
and the like illegal, but also that tourists are frequently sold
fake drugs. Buying drugs on the streets is one of the biggest
tourist traps, the police say, adding that the fake drugs may be
soap powder, sugar, rat poison or at best crushed vitamin C.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even respectable tourists often cannot resist visiting
the red light district, if only to peer at the garish display of
young women in their windows awaiting customers. But again there
are perils. Some of the prostitutes are transvestites. Moreover,
loud protests can provoke the ire of muscular pimps. Still, there
are police around who are willing to help _ and all speak English.
And if you have been using the offered services, don't play the
innocent. As the local police point out, they know why you're here
and you can hardly surprise them anymore. One useful source for
misplaced items is the Lost and Found Station, Stephensonstraat 18,
telephone (31-20) 5593005; open on weekdays. The general emergency
number is 112.

</P>
<P>
   A long-running crime story entitled `Taxi Driver'
</P>
<P>
   Coming to Prague is like visiting a movie set, but you can find
yourself with a bit part in a cliched story about stolen wallets,
pilfered passports and outrageous overcharging, especially for
taxis. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Prague has never managed to regulate taxi charges or meters, and
it's buyer beware _ or bemoan. Last year, even the British
ambassador, David Broucher, complained to Prague's mayor, Jan Kasl,
that his wife had been swindled by a taxi driver who charged 420
crowns (then about $14) for a ride of less than a mile and a half
and refused to provide a receipt. The ride should have cost 80
crowns. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even worse, some taxi drivers have been known to lock their
passengers in the back seat when they object to the fast-spinning
meter, then steal their wallets in the confusion. The police here
are polite but generally helpless, because most of the victims are
too upset to note license plate numbers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The scams are so notorious _ especially from seemingly
legitimate taxi ranks in tourist meccas like Old Town Square, Mala
Strana and near Prague Castle _ that one well-known Czech
expatriate, the film director Milos Forman, and William Luers, a
former U.S. ambassador to the country, sent an open letter of
complaint to Kasl's predecessor.

FTC SEEKS INJUNCTION AGAINST TOYSMART 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEPHANIE STOUGHTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Federal Trade Commission filed a complaint against
Toysmart.com Inc. Monday, seeking to block the bankrupt online
retailer from selling confidential information on its consumers.
</P>
<P>
   In a strongly worded statement, the federal agency accused the
Waltham, Mass. toy seller of violating federal law by putting its
customer list up for sale after vowing it would never share that
information.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even failing dot-coms must abide by their promise to protect
the privacy rights of their customers,'' FTC Chairman Robert
Pitofsky said. ``The FTC seeks to ensure these promises are kept.''
</P>
<P>
   The agency's five commissioners voted unanimously on Friday to
approve a staff recommendation that the FTC attempt to prevent the
sale. The agency's complaint was filed in U.S. District Court in
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Though Pitofsky's tough statement appears to leave little wiggle
room, a source close to the discussions said the two sides have
talked about a settlement in which Toysmart.com can sell the data
if ``appropriate protections'' are put in place.
</P>
<P>
   FTC and Toysmart.com officials declined to commment on the
specifics of ongoing discussions. ``I think the complaint speaks
for itself,'' said Eric London, an agency spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Murphy, a Boston attorney representing Toysmart.com, was
similarly vague. ``We are in negotiations with the FTC to resolve
everyone's concerns,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer privacy advocates are unlikely to be pleased with any
sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would encourage the FTC to enforce the privacy statement
that Toysmart has issued, which said no information would be shared
with any third party,'' said Dave Steer, a spokesman for TRUSTe, an
e-commerce industry watchdog in San Jose, Calif. ``Anything shy of
that promise is a compromise.''
</P>
<P>
   After receiving an anonymous tip, TRUSTe asked the federal
agency to take a closer look at Toysmart.com's actions. TRUSTe
offers a privacy-seal program that includes 2,000 Web sites as
members. But companies can display TRUSTe's logo only if they
comply with certain guidelines designed to protect consumer's
privacy.
</P>
<P>
   As of Monday, Toysmart.com had not removed TRUSTe's seal from
the bottom of its Web home page.
</P>
<P>
   Toysmart.com announced in May that it would collapse after its
majority investor, Walt Disney Co., pulled its support. Last month,
the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. And now, it
hopes to sell its assets, including its customer information, to
pay back more than $20 million in debt.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear how many customer records Toysmart.com had in its
database, but the company's Web site has attracted millions of
visitors.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC's court actions are being closely monitored by consumer
advocates and state authorities worried that Web businesses are
learning too much about their shoppers _ and are not properly
protecting that information.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer privacy advocates hope to prevent failed Web retailers
from selling the names, home addresses, e-mail addresses and
shopping habits of customers. That trend, however, is expected to
continue as the dot-com shakeout continues.
</P>
<P>
   TRUSTe officials have also looked into Craftshop.com, Boo.com
and several other dot-com failures. But they decided to target
Toysmart.com after the online retailer purchased a newspaper
advertisement to announce the sale of its assets.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been very public about their intentions,'' Steer said.

 UNDATED: Kasl's predecessor.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Little has been done, partly because of high levels of
corruption. Preying on tourists is such a popular pastime that one
gang robs people on the tourist trams _ including Nos. 9 and 22,
which run between Narodni Trida and Malostranska _ in daylight. A
pregnant woman may ask for a tourist's seat, then the foreigner
will be surrounded by four or five large men, who rifle the
victim's pockets and hand over the goods to a young accomplice, who
leaps off the tram while the tourist is detained until the next
stop. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last year, city residents and tourists reported a loss of more
than $2 million from more than 8,000 pickpocketed wallets. Those
figures account for the people who bother to sit in the police
station for up to an hour _ presuming they have an interpreter with
them _ and file a report. Last year, police made just 420
pickpocketing arrests. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The taxi scam is easier to avoid: Call a radio taxi company. The
most reliable are AAA (telephone 333-22-333), Profi Taxi
(6131-4151) or Halo Taxi (4411-4411). They all have operators who
speak English, will take your name and address and will tell you
what brand and color of taxi is coming and roughly when it will
arrive. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Those travelers without European mobile phones can use telephone
booths, which cost 5.40 crowns a minute (14 cents, at 37.50 crowns
to $1). Most now only take telephone cards that you can buy at
newsstands, grocery stores and tobacco shops.

   MOSCOW
</P>
<P>
   A violent image is unfounded, but watch the traffic police
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans seem to think that Moscow is the wild, wild East,
a land of mafia shootouts, bombings and rampant crime. But while
that may be the Moscow depicted in American films, it is not the
city that my family and I have lived in for more than four years.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow is safer than New York and most other American cities.
When Russians say they are taking a taxi, they plan to go out to
the street, hail a car driven by a stranger and pay him 50 rubles
(a little less than $2) for a ride home. Young women do this all
the time and there are rarely incidents.
</P>
<P>
   The kind of random violence that seems to haunt the United
States _ shootings by frustrated investors or alienated children _
is virtually unknown here. There are killings in Moscow, but most
of them are very selective. Shootings are Russia's substitute for
litigation. And if you do not have a business dispute involving
large sums of money, you generally do not have to worry about being
a target.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as in any large city (nearly 11 million people live
here), there is crime and it is useful to take a few precautions.
For one thing, you should watch out for pickpockets. They are not
nearly as bad as in London or Rome, but they can slit open your
backpack on the subway and take your purse or wallet before you
know it. It is also good to carry some small bills, so that if you
decide to give money to a panhandler or make a small purchase you
do not have to whip out your entire wad of cash on the street.
</P>
<P>
   Be careful about the taxi drivers at the airport. Don't pay more
than $50 for a ride to the center of town from the Sheremetyevo
airport. And it is possible with only a little negotiating to pay
considerably less.
</P>
<P>
   Another prudent measure is to avoid isolated streets or
underground passageways late at night. The main thoroughfares in
the city center, however, seem to be safe at all hours; Russians
are night people, so the streets are populated until the early
hours of the morning.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow is full of nightclubs and casinos. Many of them are not
mafia hangouts but they can be on the wild side. So if you meet any
of the clientele keep an eye on your drink and on your wallet.
</P>
<P>
   If you rent a car, you will soon learn that the traffic police
are worse than the crooks. In a city where left turns are almost
entirely outlawed, yellow caution lights seem to last a millisecond
and gridlock is a natural state of affairs, it is easy to commit an
unintended infraction.
</P>
<P>
   And the traffic police often stop drivers for no reason at all,
demand to see their documents and manufacture some kind of offense.
A small ``fee,'' say 50 or 100 rubles (about $1.80 to $3.60), is
usually enough to resolve most situations. But driving while
intoxicated is a serious offense and can cost you $100. The best
advice is to be careful, stay sober and if stopped insist that you
do not understand a word of Russian. Try saying, ``Ya nye
ponedelnik.'' That usually frustrates the bribe-takers so much that
they give up and let you go.

<P>
   Plenty of pickpockets, and sobering bar bills
</P>
<P>
   Istanbul is not a violent city. There are remarkably few
assaults or robberies in which guns or knives are used. Street
crime usually takes a more subtle form.
</P>
<P>
   Pickpockets work in tourist areas, particularly around Taksim
Square and the Galata Tower. Some are quite skilled, even able to
grab wallets from front pockets. Often they use the bump technique,
pretending to run for a bus or chase a friend and bumping into
their victim. By the time the target realizes that the bump was no
accident, a wallet or purse is gone.
</P>
<P>
   On some streets, shoeshine boys will strike up a conversation to
distract a mark while a partner picks his pocket. In fast-food
restaurants at shopping malls, a young woman may approach a
foreigner saying she wants to practice her English. This may be a
diversion aimed at giving a partner the chance to grab a wallet or
purse.
</P>
<P>
   There have been several reports of visitors' being given drinks
mixed with a substance that makes them drowsy or even unconscious.
When the victim begins to feel sick, he or she is relieved of money
and other valuables. In another variation, a seemingly solicitous
individual offers to take the woozy victim back to his or her hotel
room, and then cleans out whatever valuables are there.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most common scams is actually legal. The victim
either drifts into a bar or is steered to one by an apparently
friendly fellow on a busy street like Istiklal Caddesi, the city's
main pedestrian drag. Once there, he (this one is usually aimed at
men) meets some other friendly folks, often female, who order
drinks. The bill comes to several hundred dollars. Victims who are
reluctant to pay find themselves surrounded by tough-looking
characters who make paying seem like the wise course.
</P>
<P>
   The way to avoid this, according to the police, is to ask to see
a price list before ordering a drink. If patrons do not do so, the
host is entitled to charge even the most outrageous price. To
complete the aura of legality, these bars scrupulously provide
their victims with receipts for the total cost.

GORE SAYS GOP HAS FAILED TO HELP THE PEOPLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW BRITAIN, Conn. _ Vice President Al Gore berated the
Republican-controlled Congress Monday for doing ``nothing for the
people'' and for refusing to act on the Clinton administration's
domestic agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, sounding a campaign theme he plans to develop in the days
ahead, accused the Republican Party of serving special interests at
the expense of the American people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless this Congress starts doing its job now, this will be
remembered in history as the Congress that blocked progress for
people all across the board,'' Gore told students and faculty at
Central Connecticut State University.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't just take it from me,'' admonished Gore, the presumptive
Democratic presidential nominee. ``As one Republican staff member
in the Senate just admitted, `You couldn't get a Mother's Day
resolution through Congress right now.' Let's face it: never has so
little been done, in so much time, to benefit so few.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore is on a seven-state campaign swing this week, during which
he will appear publicly with the man he defeated in the Democratic
primary, former New Jersey senator Bill Bradley. Monday's trip to
Connecticut _ where polls now show Gore in a close contest _ was
his first visit to the Nutmeg State since his Super Tuesday primary
sweep that clinched his nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Democratic California Governor Gray Davis, one of
Gore's most enthusiastic supporters, announced Monday he would
almost certainly refuse the vice presidential slot if offered it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say no,'' Davis told the Associated Press. The
California governor said he has had ``conversations with the powers
that be'' and has suggested a few names to Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Gore aides refused to discuss vice presidential possibilities.
``We've all taken a vow of silence,'' added Senator Joseph
Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut, who was traveling Monday with
Gore and has been mentioned as a possible vice presidential choice.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has, in recent weeks, been seeking to sharpen the contrast
between himself and Bush by attacking major business and other
monied interests whom he accuses Republicans of coddling. First he
accused pharmaceutical companies of price-gouging and then went
after ``Big Oil'' by calling for a federal investigation of
escalating gasoline prices.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Gore trained his attack on Congress for failing to pass
a Patient's Bill of Rights, or a bill that would ``guarantee basic
paycheck fairness for women,'' or to raise the minimum wage. He
repeatedly referred to Capitol Hill lawmakers as the
``do-nothing-for-the-people-Republican Congress,'' stressing each
syllable of the the cumbersome phrase.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big, wealthy special interests are the ones they are
taking their instructions from,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president expanded the blame to his presumed Republican
opponent, Texas Governor George W. Bush, whom Gore said ``aids and
abets'' congressional inaction by his silence.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign reply was derisory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an amazing lack of leadership for the sitting vice
president to call on the governor of Texas to accomplish what he
has failed to do,'' said Bush campaign spokesman Dan Bartlett.
``Instead of calling on George Bush, Al Gore should phone home.''
</P>
<P>
   Attacks on Congress or the Washington establishment are not
uncommon among presidential candidates. What makes Gore's tactical
turn stand out is that the candidate making the attack is himself
so identified with that establishment, having spent the last 23
years of his life in the House, Senate and the Clinton
administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little tricky, since he is, constitutionally, the
presiding officer of the United States Senate,'' said Stephen Hess,
an analyst with the Brookings Institute. ``The public isn't
terribly interested in Congress at this time,'' Hess said. ``It's
awfully hard to go down Main Street to pick a fight over what
Congress is doing.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Gore's early appearances when he was took office as vice
president in 1993 was to stand among Republican and Democratic
members of Congress in the Capitol, promising to put partisanship
aside and work in tandem for the American public.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship between the White House and Congress has been
poor since the Republicans won control of the House and Senate in
1994 and deteriorated further during the impeachment and trial of
President Clinton in 1998-99. Aside from free trade legislation,
Clinton has been largely unable to get his domestic agenda passed.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, commenting about Gore's assault on Congress, said he
thought the attack was valid. ``Unfortunately, I think it's the
fact, so it doesn't bother me,'' he said.

<P>
   ROME
</P>
<P>
   It's a jubilee year for purse snatchers, too
</P>
<P>
   Rome has far less severe crime _ homicides, rapes or violent
robberies _ than such other European capitals as Berlin or London.
But petty crime, always a danger for tourists, is something to be
particularly careful about during this Jubilee year, when
pickpockets and scam artists swarm around pilgrim sites near the
Vatican or the major basilicas, alert for easy prey. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tourists have been accosted by bands of urchins who swarm around
their victims, poking them with rolled-up newspapers or pieces of
cardboard, while others grab the wallet and pass it to an
accomplice. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Romans, known for demonstrativeness, sometimes serve as early
warning alarms in public places. When gangs of small children board
a bus, strangers shout out to one another to watch their wallets
and purses (``Attenti al portafoglio'' or ``Attenti alla borsa''
are the most frequent warning signals). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The most dangerous time is boarding or getting off the bus, when
jostling can mask a pickpocket at work. But even on the bus,
thieves have been known to slit open purses and backpacks with a
knife; the No. 64 bus, which goes from the Termini train station to
the Vatican, is particularly notorious. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The train station itself, once rundown and poorly policed, has
been spruced up and completely renovated for the Jubilee, and
private security forces now patrol the lower-level mall alongside
regular police officers. But the streets around it should be
avoided after dark. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Porta Portese, a crowded and colorful Sunday flea market in
Trastevere, lures tourists and also pickpockets. The prostitutes
who years ago lined the Via Appia Antica have moved on, forced out
by a renovation that has turned the ancient Roman road into a vast
archaeological park, reserved for pedestrians on Sundays. But
travelers driving between Rome and Tuscany or Umbria will spot
prostitutes along the highway.
</P>
<P>
   Airports and train stations are jammed with freelance drivers,
baying at arriving tourists, offering cheap rides. They should be
avoided, as many overcharge extravagantly. Even regular taxi
drivers should be closely watched. Some can get around the meter by
taking huge and costly detours. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As in any major city, it is foolish to leave suitcases, cameras
or even radios locked inside a car. Though many Roman parking lots
that have been set up for the Jubilee have security, there are no
guarantees. Rome has one of the highest rates of car theft in
Europe, so rental cars should not be parked unattended for long. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Consulate in Rome said that over the past few years, it
has received fewer tourist reports of motorino theft _ incidents
involving thieves on motorbikes who slash the straps of a
pedestrian's bag and zoom away with it. That could be a result of
tougher police enforcement, or perhaps the fact that traffic in
central Rome has grown so clogged, even thieves on two wheels
cannot be sure of a quick getaway.
</P>
<P>
   _ALESSANDRA STANLEY is chief of the Rome bureau of The New York
Times.
</P>
<P>
   PARIS
</P>
<P>
   Cell phones join thieves' hit list
</P>
<P>
   In many Paris train and metro stations these days, the
loudspeakers play warnings in both French and English that
pickpockets are about. Pay attention to your belongings, the
recording says.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Paris remains a great city to stroll and explore, a place that
is alive and quite safe into the wee hours. But crime has been
creeping up here for several years, and the crime directed against
tourists is the kind that can ruin a vacation: stolen wallets,
stolen baggage, credit card fraud.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Police officials say that added to these old regulars is the
newest crime on the upswing: the theft of cellular phones, which
are often whisked off cafe tables or even snatched while people
hold them up to their ears.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``These are very rapid, very furtive thefts,'' said Frederic
Dupuch, who is in charge of the police department's crime
prevention service. ``The only thing we recommend is to keep the
phones tucked away when you aren't using them. And be aware of your
surroundings when you are.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Visitors, Dupuch says, are prey in all the tourist areas, from
the steep steps of Montmartre to the lines at the Eiffel Tower and
the platforms in the Gare du Nord, though these are not the city's
worst crime areas. Nor is there much violence. Last year, just 0.75
percent of the crimes reported in Paris involved tourists; of
those, less than 1 percent included any sort of assault.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Most of Paris' crime problems are attributed to years of high
unemployment and growing restlessness among poor youth who have
grown up in the outskirts of the city.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Unlike American cities, where the rich tend to flee to the
suburbs, French cities have built their public housing outside of
the downtown areas, relegating the poor and the immigrants to
sometimes dreary and dangerous projects far from jobs. Not
surprisingly, the Paris neighborhoods hit hardest by crime are
those on the outskirts of the city.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Visitors should also be aware that their rental-car license
plates often signal that they are tourists. Many of France's rental
cars are registered in the Marne region for cost reasons and
therefore have license-plate numbers ending with 51. Those who rent
such cars should avoid leaving their belongings in a car whenever
possible.

   MADRID
</P>
<P>
   Petty crime is on the rise, and violence more common
</P>
<P>
   With the bars, restaurants and streets of downtown Madrid
bustling with life into the early hours of the morning, it may be
hard to sense danger. But the city's pickpockets, muggers and scam
artists are skilled at choosing their victims, and tourists are
their preferred targets. Increasingly, city officials and foreign
embassies are urging tourists to beware in Madrid. Petty crime is
on the rise. Still more worrisome, the use of violence by muggers _
albeit brandishing knives, not guns _ is becoming more common.
</P>
<P>
   Some cons are old hat, such as squirting mustard on the shirt of
a passer-by or dropping keys at a tourist's feet or simply asking
directions _ any distraction while a pickpocket goes to work.
Others are more original: criminals may surreptitiously slash a
rental car's tires with razors attached to their shoes, then step
forward to offer help in changing the tire _ and, while the trunk
is open, make off with luggage (a variation of this involves
so-called ``highway pirates'' who persuade tourists to halt by
pointing to a supposedly flat tire).
</P>
<P>
   Unsurprisingly, tourists arriving at airports, railroad stations
or bus terminals are advised to watch their bags with special care,
not to be wooed into conversation with strangers and not to take
``pirate'' cabs. Once in Madrid proper, it's a good idea to keep
your passport, credit cards, traveler's checks and any large
amounts of cash in the hotel safe. (The Japanese Embassy warns that
there is a flourishing local market for stolen Japanese passports.)
</P>
<P>
   Still, if it were just a question of avoiding rough
neighborhoods, things would be simple. But petty criminals
logically operate where tourists hang out, that is, in the most
attractive and lively parts of the city, such as the Plaza Mayor,
the Plaza de Santa Ana, the Plaza de Espana, the area around the
Prado Museum and the Retiro Park. The answer is to take some
minimal precautions, such as keeping away from the Puerta del Sol,
a square now favored by drug dealers, or taking a taxi back to the
hotel after enjoying a late show in a flamenco bar, or (can this
repeated enough?) not carrying anything too valuable.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Thirty-five years after the dismantling of legalized
segregation, a majority of Americans maintain that race relations
in the United States are generally good, but blacks and whites
continue to have starkly divergent perceptions of many racial
issues and they remain largely isolated from each other in their
everyday lives, according to a nationwide poll by The New York
Times.
</P>
<P>
   The poll reflects some of the same complex tensions that
surfaced in the Times' six-week examination of contemporary race
relations, ``How Race is Lived in America.'' The series portrayed a
stubbornly enduring racial divide, and the poll suggests that even
as the rawest forms of bigotry have receded they have often been
replaced by remoteness and distrust in places of work, learning and
worship.
</P>
<P>
   The poll, which surveyed 2,165 adults, detected some signs that
both blacks and whites believe that race relations are improving.
The proportion of those surveyed who said that race relations in
the country are generally good _ 57 percent _ is at its highest
mark in 10 years, a full 16 percentage points higher than in 1990.
Large majorities of both races _ 63 percent of whites and 79
percent of blacks _ said they approved of interracial marriage,
compared to only 44 percent of whites and 70 percent of blacks who
said so in a 1991 poll.
</P>
<P>
   And the percentage who said the country has made real progress
in reducing racial discrimination _ 74 percent, including 78
percent of whites and 58 percent of blacks _ is about 25 percentage
points higher for each group than in May 1992, just after the
deadly rioting that followed the acquittal of four police officers
in the beating of a black California motorist. The percentage of
blacks who see progress has doubled in that period.
</P>
<P>
   But in question after question the poll also revealed a core of
blacks _ about four in 10, many of them college-educated _ who find
little to celebrate even today. Those blacks, for instance, said
they thought that race relations in the country were generally bad
and that there had been no real progress in eliminating racial
discrimination since the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   On many questions, particularly those related to whether blacks
are treated equitably and whether race plays too large a role in
the national discourse, blacks and whites seem to be living on
different planets. Indeed, one of the few areas where blacks and
whites are most in agreement is in their perceptions of racial
hostility. Similar percentages _ 39 percent of whites and 45
percent of blacks _ said they think that either many or almost all
white people dislike blacks. And 45 percent of whites and the same
percentage of blacks said they think that either many or almost all
black people dislike whites.
</P>
<P>
   The continuing complexity of racial attitudes, and the
awkwardness of discussing them forthrightly, came through clearly
in the poll results. Taken as a whole, the respondents' answers
offer a far more nuanced view of race than was apparent during the
height of the civil rights struggle, when battle lines were more
clearly drawn and bigotry was more clearly expressed.
</P>
<P>
   Befitting the subject matter, the poll is rife with seeming
contradictions. Most striking, perhaps, is a telescopic pattern in
which people of both races depict themselves as far more sanguine
about race relations in their own communities, and far more
sensitive in their own views, than they believe to be the case
elsewhere. Susceptible perhaps to the pressures of political
correctness, they seem to strive to depict themselves and their
neighbors as open-minded and accepting, while projecting less
enlightened views on the rest of the country. And the farther from
home, the worse things seem.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, 88 percent of whites and 82 percent of blacks said
that race relations were generally good in their neighborhoods.
Similarly large majorities of both whites and blacks said that race
relations were generally good where they worked and at their
children's schools.
</P>
<P>
   But the numbers dropped when people were asked to characterize
race relations in their communities, and they dropped more
precipitously when they were asked about race relations in the
country. Only 58 percent of whites and 51 percent of blacks said
that race relations in the country were generally good, while 30
percent of whites and 40 percent of blacks said they were generally
bad.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, nearly all respondents _ 93 percent of whites and 95
percent of blacks _ said they would vote for a qualified black
presidential candidate if one was nominated by their political
party. And yet, most of those surveyed _ 55 percent of whites and
62 percent of blacks _ agreed that the country is not ready to
elect a black president.
</P>
<P>
   In another example, 85 percent of whites said they did not care
whether they lived in an area where most of their neighbors were
white or where most were black. But two-thirds of the whites said
they think that most white people prefer to live in white areas.
And perhaps most telling, 85 percent said they actually live in
areas where they have no or few black neighbors, the same
percentage that said they had no preference.
</P>
<P>
   The poll, which was conducted June 21-29, surveyed 1,107 people
who said they are white and 934 who said they are black. It has a
margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points for
each racial group.
</P>
<P>
   To determine the views of the country as a whole, the responses
of blacks were weighted to comprise 11 percent of the total, the
proportion used by the Census bureau. According to the Current
Population Survey, 11 percent of Americans are black, and 89
percent are nonblack. With the exception of the prevailing
pessimism expressed by college-educated blacks, the poll turned up
few variations in responses based on geography, education level,
age or income among blacks.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   All in all, both blacks and whites seem to feel that these times
of relative peace and prosperity are good ones. Seventy-three
percent of those questioned, including 73 percent of whites and 80
percent of blacks, said that their opportunities for success in
life are better than those of their parents. And 40 percent,
including 39 percent of whites and 44 percent of blacks, said they
think the next generation of Americans will have a better future
than their own. The proportion that said they believe that things
will get worse _ 31 percent, including 30 percent of whites and 35
percent of blacks _ is substantially lower than in past polls by
The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   But when questions focused more specifically on racial issues, a
schism quickly emerged. Asked whether whites or blacks have a
better chance of getting ahead, for example, 58 percent of whites
said that the playing field was now level, a view shared by only 39
percent of blacks. Fifty-seven percent of blacks said whites still
have advantages, compared to only 32 percent of whites.
</P>
<P>
   There were similar gaps in black and white perceptions of how
blacks are treated in various circumstances. Blacks were roughly
four times more likely than whites to say they thought blacks were
treated less fairly in the workplace, in neighborhood shops, in
shopping mall stores and in restaurants, theaters, bars and other
entertainment venues.
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds of blacks said that blacks were treated less
equitably by the police, a view shared by only a quarter of whites.
Forty-two percent of blacks said they felt they had been stopped by
the police simply because of their race, compared to only 3 percent
of whites.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blacks are still having the same problems,'' said a
79-year-old retired black woman from Long Beach, Calif., who
responded to poll questions and a follow-up interview but did not
want her name published. ``Being black, you're discriminated
against when you try to buy something you want unless you assert
yourself. If the store is crowded, you're pushed aside because the
sales clerks would rather wait on someone else. Progress means
being considered on the same level with any other race.''
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, the variation in attitudes about equal opportunity
and treatment gives rise to differing views about programs that
make special efforts to help minorities get ahead. Blacks favored
such programs by a margin of 76 percent to 11 percent, while whites
were ambivalent, with 46 percent saying they favored them and 44
percent saying they opposed them.
</P>
<P>
   The poll detected a surprising degree of social interaction
between blacks and whites. Large proportions of both races said
they had close friends of another race, 76 percent of whites and 84
percent of blacks. Similarly large numbers _ 69 percent of whites
and 84 percent of blacks _ said they had socialized with someone of
another race outside their homes during the last month. Forty-three
percent of whites and 58 percent of blacks said people of another
race had visited their homes socially in the last month.
</P>
<P>
   George Norris, 44, a black man from Baltimore, said he gets
together every other month or so with colleagues from the moving
company where he works. ``We shoot pool, have some drinks, have a
cookout or watch some movies,'' he said. ``It's basically the same
group of folks, white and black. They come over to my house or I go
to theirs.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet the poll made it clear that most Americans do not live,
work or worship with those of other races. Eighty-three percent of
whites said they worked with only a few blacks or none at all.
Ninety percent of whites who attended religious services at least
once a month said that none or only a few of their fellow
congregants were black, while 73 percent of blacks said that almost
all of their fellow congregants were black.
</P>
<P>
   In general, whites expressed a certain fatigue with racial
issues. More than half _ 54 percent _ said the media devotes too
much time to race. A 44 percent plurality of blacks, by contrast,
said that the media talks too little about race, while 28 percent
said the media talks too much about it and 23 percent said the
media devotes an appropriate amount of attention to it.
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds of blacks also said that politicians talk too little
about race, and the same number of blacks said that improving race
relations is one of the most important challenges facing the
country. Only one-fourth of whites said it was one of the most
important challenges, while 65 percent said it was important, but
so were other issues. And whites were more than three times as
likely as blacks _ 33 percent to 10 percent _ to say that too much
has been made in recent years of the problems facing black people.

<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ After narrowly surviving an attempt Monday to topple
his government, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak immediately
boarded a jet to take him to an historic summit with Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat Tuesday at Camp David.
</P>
<P>
   The talks in the woods of the Maryland retreat, hosted by
President Clinton, offer what is widely seen as the last best
chance for the peace process to succeed and a momentous opportunity
to draw final borders between Israel and an emerging Palestinian
state.
</P>
<P>
   ``The moment of truth is upon us,'' Barak said as he battled to
survive a ``no confidence'' vote in the Israeli parliament during a
debate that was unruly and emotionally charged even by Israeli
standards.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition Likud Party received more votes _ 54-52 in favor
of bringing down Barak's One Israel coalition government _ but fell
short of the 61 votes required to carry the motion in the
120-member Knesset. Seven legislators abstained, and seven were
absent.
</P>
<P>
   Shouting over hecklers from Likud and from the conservative and
religious parties who had defected from his coalition, Barak said,
``Just a year ago the public gave us a mandate to lead, not to
protect what exists, but to change the reality from its core and to
assure the future of Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not going alone,'' Barak added. ``With me are almost two
million voters, citizens who want peace.''
</P>
<P>
   But Barak departed for Maryland with his coalition in tatters
and early elections on the horizon. Even if he can hammer out a
peace deal with Arafat, he will have to live up to a campaign
promise to bring the accord to the voters before he signs it.
</P>
<P>
   Likud leader Ariel Sharon, a leading hawk in the Knesset,
thundered that Barak ``wanted to prime minister of everybody.
Within a year, he is prime minister of almost no one.
</P>
<P>
   ``A prime minister who can't make peace in his nation, let alone
his own government, can't make peace with the Arabs.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak finds himself in a position not unlike the one faced last
year by his predecessor and rival, former prime minister Benjamin
Netanyahu of Likud, who battled through four no-confidence votes
before being ousted by a coalition of increasingly rabid opponents.
Netanyahu was forced to call early elections and lost to Barak one
year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Although political observers said Barak has little reason to
fear early elections because Likud is in disarray and the aging
Sharon does not pose a serious threat, the political turmoil left
the prime minister badly weakened.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, his carefully constructed coalition unravelled with
surprising speed when three rightist parties bolted within hours
and left him with a minority government in parliament. A former
general who was Israel's most highly decorated soldier, he has been
criticized for arrogance and for his failure to marshall broad
support on the eve of the summit. Wearing the tight-lipped, almost
smug smile that has become his signature expression, he sat in the
Knesset Monday surrounded by the ministers who had resigned.
</P>
<P>
   But even on this seemingly bleak political terrain, there were
signs that Barak could yet steer a path through the fractious
politics of the parliament and find support with the voters who
elected him last year in a landslide, based largely on his pledge
to obtain a fair peace with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   A poll published in Israel's largest newspaper, Yediot Ahronot,
found that 55 percent of respondents felt Barak should go to Camp
David despite the political uproar. And 53 percent said they felt
Barak has a mandate to make concessions that would return West Bank
land captured from the Palestinians during the 1967 Six Day War in
order to achieve a peace deal.
</P>
<P>
   Several Israeli analysts said the situation is not unlike some
of the most decisive moments that past Israeli leaders have faced.
Prime ministers David Ben Gurion, Menachem Begin, and Yitzhak Rabin
all faced strident opposition as they embarked on fateful
decisions, they noted.
</P>
<P>
   Hirsh Goodman, a senior political analyst for the Jaffee Center
for Strategic Studies in Tel Aviv, said Ben Gurion, Israel's
founding father, had the support of only five of the 11 members of
the ruling council when he set out to declare statehood for Israel
in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   It was then that he made the now-famous statement: ``I don't
know what the people want, I know what they need.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodman said the summit may prove to be the most decisive moment
since the Jewish state was born 52 years ago:
</P>
<P>
   ``What is happening at Camp David is the most profound decision
any prime minister will have to make since the establishment of the
state,'' he said in an interview. ``There was peace with Jordan,
but there was no uprooting of settlements. There was peace with
Egypt, but there was no emotional attachemnt among Israelis to the
Sinai. But now emotionally and ideologically, we are divided. We
are talking about defining the border of Israel, and no amount of
money is going to satisfy those who have to give up their homes in
the West Bank.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak took time Monday to reiterate his core beliefs going into
the talks: that Israel will not completely withdraw to pre-1967
borders; that a united Jerusalem must remain under Israeli
sovereignty; and that Israel would ``not take a moral or legal
responsibility'' for Palestinian refugees who wish to return home
after fleeing or being uprooted during the wars of 1948 and 1967.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat went into the summit talks with pressures of his own. The
Palestinians, who now have full or partial control of only pockets
of West Bank territory, are demanding a contiguous swath of the
West Bank for a future state. He has vowed to declare a Palestinian
state in mid-September whether the peace process has moved forward
or not, and he insists that the capital of the future state must be
in East Jerusalem, which was captured in 1967 and later annexed by
Israel. Arafat has been less clear about demanding a so-called
``right of return'' for the estimated 3 million Palestinian
refugees scattered throughout the Arab world, many still living in
squalid refugee camps.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Thirty-five years after the dismantling of legalized
segregation, a majority of Americans maintain that race relations
in the United States are generally good, but blacks and whites
continue to have starkly divergent perceptions of many racial
issues and they remain largely isolated from each other in their
everyday lives, according to a nationwide poll by The New York
Times.
</P>
<P>
   The poll reflects some of the same complex tensions that
surfaced in The Times' six-week examination of contemporary race
relations, ``How Race is Lived in America.'' The series portrayed a
stubbornly enduring racial divide, and the poll suggests that even
as the rawest forms of bigotry have receded they have often been
replaced by remoteness and distrust in places of work, learning and
worship.
</P>
<P>
   The poll, which surveyed 2,165 adults, detected some signs that
both blacks and whites believe that race relations are improving.
The proportion of those surveyed who said that race relations in
the country are generally good _ 57 percent _ is at its highest
mark in 10 years, a full 16 percentage points higher than in 1990.
Large majorities of both races _ 63 percent of whites and 79
percent of blacks _ said they approved of interracial marriage,
compared to only 44 percent of whites and 70 percent of blacks who
said so in a 1991 poll.
</P>
<P>
   And the percentage who said the country has made real progress
in reducing racial discrimination _ 74 percent, including 78
percent of whites and 58 percent of blacks _ is about 25 percentage
points higher for each group than in May 1992, just after the
deadly rioting that followed the acquittal of four police officers
in the beating of a black California motorist. The percentage of
blacks who see progress has doubled in that period.
</P>
<P>
   But in question after question the poll also revealed a core of
blacks _ about four in 10, many of them college-educated _ who find
little to celebrate even today. Those blacks, for instance, said
they thought that race relations in the country were generally bad
and that there had been no real progress in eliminating racial
discrimination since the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   On many questions, particularly those related to whether blacks
are treated equitably and whether race plays too large a role in
the national discourse, blacks and whites seem to be living on
different planets. Indeed, one of the few areas where blacks and
whites are most in agreement is in their perceptions of racial
hostility. Similar percentages _ 39 percent of whites and 45
percent of blacks _ said they think that either many or almost all
white people dislike blacks. And 45 percent of whites and the same
percentage of blacks said they think that either many or almost all
black people dislike whites.
</P>
<P>
   The continuing complexity of racial attitudes, and the
awkwardness of discussing them forthrightly, came through clearly
in the poll results. Taken as a whole, the respondents' answers
offer a far more nuanced view of race than was apparent during the
height of the civil rights struggle, when battle lines were more
clearly drawn and bigotry was more clearly expressed.
</P>
<P>
   Befitting the subject matter, the poll is rife with seeming
contradictions. Most striking, perhaps, is a telescopic pattern in
which people of both races depict themselves as far more sanguine
about race relations in their own communities, and far more
sensitive in their own views, than they believe to be the case
elsewhere. Susceptible perhaps to the pressures of political
correctness, they seem to strive to depict themselves and their
neighbors as open-minded and accepting, while projecting less
enlightened views on the rest of the country. And the farther from
home, the worse things seem.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, 88 percent of whites and 82 percent of blacks said
that race relations were generally good in their neighborhoods.
Similarly large majorities of both whites and blacks said that race
relations were generally good where they worked and at their
children's schools.
</P>
<P>
   But the numbers dropped when people were asked to characterize
race relations in their communities, and they dropped more
precipitously when they were asked about race relations in the
country. Only 58 percent of whites and 51 percent of blacks said
that race relations in the country were generally good, while 30
percent of whites and 40 percent of blacks said they were generally
bad.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, nearly all respondents _ 93 percent of whites and 95
percent of blacks _ said they would vote for a qualified black
presidential candidate if one was nominated by their political
party. And yet, most of those surveyed _ 55 percent of whites and
62 percent of blacks _ agreed that the country is not ready to
elect a black president.
</P>
<P>
   In another example, 85 percent of whites said they did not care
whether they lived in an area where most of their neighbors were
white or where most were black. But two-thirds of the whites said
they think that most white people prefer to live in white areas.
And perhaps most telling, 85 percent said they actually live in
areas where they have no or few black neighbors, the same
percentage that said they had no preference.
</P>
<P>
   The poll, which was conducted June 21-29, surveyed 1,107 people
who said they are white and 934 who said they are black. It has a
margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points for
each racial group.
</P>
<P>
   To determine the views of the country as a whole, the responses
of blacks were weighted to comprise 11 percent of the total, the
proportion used by the Census bureau. According to the Current
Population Survey, 11 percent of Americans are black, and 89
percent are nonblack. With the exception of the prevailing
pessimism expressed by college-educated blacks, the poll turned up
few variations in responses based on geography, education level,
age or income among blacks.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   All in all, both blacks and whites seem to feel that these times
of relative peace and prosperity are good ones. Seventy-three
percent of those questioned, including 73 percent of whites and 80
percent of blacks, said that their opportunities for success in
life are better than those of their parents. And 40 percent,
including 39 percent of whites and 44 percent of blacks, said they
think the next generation of Americans will have a better future
than their own. The proportion that said they believe that things
will get worse _ 31 percent, including 30 percent of whites and 35
percent of blacks _ is substantially lower than in past polls by
The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   But when questions focused more specifically on racial issues, a
schism quickly emerged. Asked whether whites or blacks have a
better chance of getting ahead, for example, 58 percent of whites
said that the playing field was now level, a view shared by only 39
percent of blacks. Fifty-seven percent of blacks said whites still
have advantages, compared to only 32 percent of whites.
</P>
<P>
   There were similar gaps in black and white perceptions of how
blacks are treated in various circumstances. Blacks were roughly
four times as likely than whites to say they thought blacks were
treated less fairly in the workplace, in neighborhood shops, in
shopping mall stores and in restaurants, theaters, bars and other
entertainment venues.
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds of blacks said that blacks were treated less
equitably by the police, a view shared by only a quarter of whites.
Forty-two percent of blacks said they felt they had been stopped by
the police simply because of their race, compared to only 3 percent
of whites.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blacks are still having the same problems,'' said a
79-year-old retired black woman from Long Beach, Calif., who
responded to poll questions and a follow-up interview but did not
want her name published. ``Being black, you're discriminated
against when you try to buy something you want unless you assert
yourself. If the store is crowded, you're pushed aside because the
sales clerks would rather wait on someone else. Progress means
being considered on the same level with any other race.''
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, the variation in attitudes about equal opportunity
and treatment gives rise to differing views about programs that
make special efforts to help minorities get ahead. Blacks favored
such programs by a margin of 76 percent to 11 percent, while whites
were ambivalent, with 46 percent saying they favored them and 44
percent saying they opposed them.
</P>
<P>
   The poll detected a surprising degree of social interaction
between blacks and whites. Large proportions of both races said
they had close friends of another race, 76 percent of whites and 84
percent of blacks. Similarly large numbers _ 69 percent of whites
and 84 percent of blacks _ said they had socialized with someone of
another race outside their homes during the last month. Forty-three
percent of whites and 58 percent of blacks said people of another
race had visited their homes socially in the last month.
</P>
<P>
   George Norris, 44, a black man from Baltimore, said he gets
together every other month or so with colleagues from the moving
company where he works. ``We shoot pool, have some drinks, have a
cookout or watch some movies,'' he said. ``It's basically the same
group of folks, white and black. They come over to my house or I go
to theirs.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet the poll made it clear that most Americans do not live,
work or worship with those of other races. Eighty-three percent of
whites said they worked with only a few blacks or none at all.
Ninety percent of whites who attended religious services at least
once a month said that none or only a few of their fellow
congregants were black, while 73 percent of blacks said that almost
all of their fellow congregants were black.
</P>
<P>
   In general, whites expressed a certain fatigue with racial
issues. More than half _ 54 percent _ said the media devotes too
much time to race. A 44 percent plurality of blacks, by contrast,
said that the media talks too little about race, while 28 percent
said the media talks too much about it and 23 percent said the
media devotes an appropriate amount of attention to it.
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds of blacks also said that politicians talk too little
about race, and the same number of blacks said that improving race
relations is one of the most important challenges facing the
country. Only one-fourth of whites said it was one of the most
important challenges, while 65 percent said it was important, but
so were other issues. And whites were more than three times as
likely as blacks _ 33 percent to 10 percent _ to say that too much
has been made in recent years of the problems facing black people.

HOW THE POLL WAS CONDUCTED 
</HEADLINE>
   (With RACE-POLL) 
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The latest New York Times Poll is based on telephone interviews
conducted June 21 through 29 with 2,165 adults throughout the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Black Americans were sampled at a higher rate than normal in
order to permit analysis of black attitudes in greater depth. From
all national polls completed by The Times and CBS News since
October 1998, every household in which a black respondent had been
interviewed was recalled for the new poll, as well as one-twelfth
of the households in which a nonblack respondent had been
interviewed earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Of the total in the new poll, 1,107 said they were white and 934
said they were black. There were too few respondents of other races
to show their results separately.
</P>
<P>
   The original samples of telephone exchanges had been randomly
selected by a computer from a complete list of more than 42,000
active residential exchanges across the country. Within each
exchange, random digits had been added to form a complete telephone
number, thus permitting access to both listed and unlisted numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Within each household, both in the original polls and the new
poll, one adult was designated by a random procedure to be the
respondent for the survey.
</P>
<P>
   The results of the new poll have been weighted to account for
household size and number of telephone lines into the residence and
to adjust for variations in the sample relating to geographic
region, sex, age, marital status and education. Blacks and
nonblacks were then weighted back to their proper proportion of the
overall population.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, in 19 cases out of 20, the results based on such
samples will differ by no more than 3 percentage points in either
direction _ for blacks or whites _ from what would have been
obtained by seeking out all American adults.
</P>
<P>
   For smaller subgroups, the margin of sampling error is larger.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of
conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources
of error into the poll. Variations in the wording and order of
questions, for example, may lead to somewhat different results.

BOTH SIDES AT HISTORIC TALKS READY FOR THE WORST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ In the weeks leading up to the make-or-break summit
set to get under way Tuesday at Camp David, it has sometimes seemed
as if Israelis and Palestinians were preparing for a battle, not a
peace signing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   The unprecedented saber rattling by both Palestinian and Israeli
military establishments has underscored just how decisive the Camp
David summit is expected to be, and how close the sides were to
despair before President Clinton announced the summit last week. If
the talks fail, many observers believe a steep escalation of
violence will be inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   To prepare, Israelis have been training army troops how to take
over mock Palestinian villages and readying tanks and machine-gun
helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   They also for the first time began distributing ``rubber
bullets,'' which are steel bullets cased in hard plastic, to Jewish
settlers in the West Bank, military officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have reached the end of the corridor with the
Palestinians,'' was the way Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, a
former general, put it recently. Failure to reach an agreement will
launch a ``countdown toward a bloody conflict,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gauging by their actions, Palestinian security officials seem to
agree.
</P>
<P>
   In Palestinian-ruled areas of Ramallah and Gaza City, police
forces, which Israeli analysts say have the size and look of
several army divisions, have been undergoing formal military
training.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinian forces, clad in blue combat fatigues, are
purportedly beefing up their supply of machine guns, anti-tank
missiles, armored vehicles, and even transport helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called ``Fatah Tanzim,'' fighters who number in the
hundreds and are aligned with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's
powerful Fatah party, have been stockpiling MP-5 sub-machine guns.
In a briefing for foreign reporters, Israeli security officials
said the weapons were smuggled in from Egypt and Jordan in
violation of the interim peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat raised the stakes by saying
that he will declare a Palestinian state in September or the end of
the year, regardless of where the peace negotiations stand.
</P>
<P>
   If that happens, Israel has vowed to respond by annexing parts
of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   If that scenario plays out, it would almost certainly begin a
convulsive cycle of violence. Saeb Erekat, one of the key
negotiators at the talks, reflected the Palestinian frustration
after six years of arduous negotiations in an unusually combative
interview with Israeli television Friday night. He labeled Israel a
society of ``fascists and racists'' and suggested that Palestinians
are at the end of their rope.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sick and tired (that) when I want to travel to Jordan, I
still have to have your permission to exit or to use the Gaza
airport,'' Erekat told the Israeli interviewer. ``I'm sick and
tired of you in your uniforms. I'm sick and tired of Israelis with
their guns.''
</P>
<P>
   The frayed emotions and looming threat of conflict may have, at
least for now, one beneficial effect: they serve as a stark
reminder to the negotatiators at Camp David that compromise now may
be the only way to avoid a new spiral of violence.

LOOKING FOR A HOT INVESTMENT TIP? HAVE A SEAT
</HEADLINE>
  By DARYL LEASE   
 Herald-Tribune, Sarasota, Fla.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now that the hi-tech boom has fizzled out and all the dot.com
geniuses are back to serving me my fries, I'm actively looking for
places to invest the $1.86 I have left in my 401(k).
</P>
<P>
   One afternoon last week, I was ready to hand everything over to
that Russian fellow, Roman Kunikov, who says he's invented
gasoline-powered boots. Perhaps you saw the news coverage:
Supposedly you can strap these boots on _ they look like one-foot
tall metal stilts _ and hover your way down the sidewalk at speeds
up to 25 mph.
</P>
<P>
   At first, this sounded like a wonderful spot to sink my life
savings, but I'm not so sure. For one thing, I'm troubled by
visions of SUV drivers smugly punching buttons to wash these
hovercrafts off their windshields. Plus, none of the stories I read
about these George Jetson boots said anything about gas mileage. As
soon as I invest, I just know I'll start seeing people clomping
down the side of the road in their funny little stilts, looking to
borrow gas from guys with weed-eaters.
</P>
<P>
   I'm really kicking myself for not getting rich off the Internet
when it was still possible. Mike, a friend of mine, used to drop by
my house years ago _ long before Al Gore ``invented'' the Internet
_ and talk excitedly about a new global computer network he'd seen
in grad school.
</P>
<P>
   Like dolts, we blathered on and on about the educational value
of this network.
</P>
<P>
   An information revolution! Like Gutenberg and the printing
press! Power to the people! Yadda yadda yadda.
</P>
<P>
   The really big money, of course, would be in (a) pornography,
(b) Webcams focused on people's toilets, and (c) Web sites where
you can quickly buy and sell stocks for companies that peddle
pornography and videostreams of people sitting on their toilets. If
only we'd known.

<P>
   Mike now lives in Japan, where he periodically alerts me to
bizarre Pokemon-like trends that might be headed this way. I'm free
to use this information to flee in horror or _ if I'm feeling
adventurous _ invest.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, for instance, he tipped me off to armpit art.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Japan Times, the hottest new beauty trend in
the Land of the Rising Sun focuses on ``an often-ignored erogenous
zone _ the armpit.''
</P>
<P>
   (Remember, you read it here first.)
</P>
<P>
   For 10,000 yen, the Times reports, young ladies can walk into
beauty shops, defuzz their underarms and ``highlight them with
everything from floral designs to sparkling glitter.'' The service
also includes a spritz of deodorant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Designs on smooth, hair-free armpits will really make an
impact,'' says Emiko Ozaki, a spokesman for a chain of 200 beauty
shops. ``In 2000, we will really see skin evolving as a fashion
accessory.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike, my investment counselor, also sent word of a trend a
little closer to home _ an amusement ride that recreates, sort of,
the experience of sitting in an electric chair.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Post reports that people are eagerly lining up to
hop into the ``Original Shocker,'' an oversized oak throne at a
mall in Rockville, Md.
</P>
<P>
   The chair has, according to The Post, ``leather limb restraints
and a numbing vibration system that seeks to simulate the `13,200
volts' threatened on the side.''
</P>
<P>
   The ride also features a ``heart monitor,'' complete with the
sounds of a beating heart. At the end of the zapping session, the
line on the monitor goes flat and a wisp of smoke drifts up from
beyond the rider's head. (No mention, alas, of whether your armpits
are defuzzed.)
</P>
<P>
   An English company called Nova manufactures the rides, and
they've popped up in various places around the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Now, some folks might call this utterly tasteless _ did I
mention the rider's feet jerk and shake to the sounds of crackling
electricity? _ but you can't argue with success. Plus, as several
onlookers noted, the ride could turn out to be a valuable
educational tool. Giggling kids might walk away with the lesson
that crime doesn't pay.
</P>
<P>
   And that weirdness does. Over the Fourth of July weekend, an
estimated 2,000 people sat in the chair at the Maryland mall. At $1
a ride, I'd say Nova is a sizzling hot investment.
</P>

   CHINA-U.S.-FLIGHTS (Washington) _ The long rivalry between New
York and Chicago has a new front: the Transportation Department is
expected to decide this summer which city will become the take-off
point for a lucrative set of new flights to China. The decision has
added importance because of the increase in travel that is expected
follow China's likely entrance into the World Trade Organization.
Doing New York's bidding is Delta Air Lines, which wants to fly to
Beijing from JFK. Delta executives argue that New York's size and
economic importance so outweigh Chicago's as to make the decision
an easy one. American Airlines, which would fly from O'Hare to
Shanghai, responds that Chicago's location trumps demographics.
This contest, however, comes with a twist: Chicago and New York
could both end up losing, and the airlines' carping may be hurting
both of their cases. By David Leonhardt.

   LOS ANGELES _ Question: I joined this company a few weeks ago,
and the two people who interviewed me just announced they are
leaving. One is my direct supervisor, and the other one is one of
the key people in the department. I interpret this as a bad sign,
and I am wondering what you suggest. C.L.
</P>
<P>
   Answer: It is never pleasant to find that your first days on the
job are the last days for the people who hired you. This may indeed
be a bad sign, or it might not be much of a sign at all.
</P>
<P>
   In this type of situation, it would have been preferable for
both the soon-departing individuals to let you know more about what
is happening. Since they did not take this step, your next step is
to meet with them.
</P>
<P>
   Let them know you are concerned about their departure,
particularly in light of the positive comments they made about the
company when they were interviewing you. If they are willing to
discuss the matter, you may learn they are leaving because of
significantly better offers elsewhere, or perhaps they are leaving
for strictly personal reasons. In these types of scenarios, there
is no indicator of serious problems in your company, and no reason
for major concern on your part.
</P>
<P>
   However, they may be leaving because of company problems which
they are not willing to discuss with you. If you sense there is
more to their departure than meets the eye or ear, take a look
around the rest of the organization. If it looks like a fire drill,
you have your answer.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am going on a job interview next week, and I am supposed to
be interviewed by a panel of four people. I have never had this
type of interview before, and I am somewhat nervous about it. Are
there any hints?
</P>
<P>
   A: Although this type of interview sounds like a 4 on 1
breakaway, its objective is not to fire a barrage of verbal shots
against a hapless applicant. Rather, companies that conduct these
types of interviews are typically serious about hiring and are
committed to devoting considerable resources in order to make the
right decision. This type of screening technique does not call for
much of a change in your interview strategy.
</P>
<P>
   As in any job interview, obviously, you should be honest, clear,
and succinct, and you should have a solid understanding of the
industry, company and potential position. When you are introduced
to the group, try to remember the names and titles of each person.
And, when a question is asked, address the individual by name and
try to tailor your response to fit his or her position in the
company.
</P>
<P>
   While answering one interviewer's question, be sure to make eye
contact with him or her, as well as with each of the others. If the
interviewers start talking among themselves, do not interrupt. Even
with this group format, remember the adage that the more the
interviewers talk, the more they like the applicant.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have been very patient with my son-in-law, but he is not
working out in our business. I don't want to fire him, but it's
apparent to just about everyone that he is still around because he
is family, and people are getting upset about this. How do I fire
my son-in-law and not ruin my relationship with him and my
daughter? F.J.
</P>
<P>
   A: If you simply fire your son-in-law, your daughter may sense
she is being fired, too. At the same time, if your son-in-law is
truly a bad match for the job, there are some steps to take.
</P>
<P>
   In the first place, although you indicated you have been
patient, he may be in the wrong position altogether. Perhaps there
is another job within the firm that is a better match for his
skills, abilities, drive and expertise.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to considering other job opportunities within the
company, it is also worthwhile to explore the possibility of
providing him with more training, guidance, and opportunities for
growth and development. If you have already taken these steps, and
he has still failed to perform successfully, then it may well be
time for you to make a move, and for him to make one, too.
</P>
<P>
   However, this move should be focused more on outplacement than
termination. With this approach, you should arrange for him to
receive some career guidance, planning and related support to help
him find a position that is a better match. Unless he is completely
out to lunch, he knows he is failing on the job. In fact, he and
your daughter may be wondering how he can leave without ruining
their relationship with you.

EXPERTS DEBATE ROLE OF CIRCUMCISION IN PREVENTING AIDS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., Md., N.M., Mich.)  (See also SAFRICA-AIDS) 
 By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DURBAN, South Africa _ Scientists at the 13th international
conference on AIDS here debated Monday what to do about one of the
most puzzling but potentially important findings in AIDS, namely
that circumcised men are much less likely to become infected with
the AIDS virus than uncircumcised men.
</P>
<P>
   The finding was first made in Africa more than a decade ago and
has been noted in more than 40 studies since then. Now many
scientists have come to suspect that circumcision is an important
factor in the vast differences among African countries in rates of
infection from HIV, the AIDS virus. In many countries in southern
Africa the rates of HIV infection among adults exceed 20 percent
while among central and west African countries the rates are lower,
some below 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   No one believes that circumcision, which has been widely and
traditionally practiced in Africa, could be the sole explanation of
such differences in HIV rates. Differing rates could be caused by
other factors, like better hygiene or other cultural or religious
practices.
</P>
<P>
   Yet compelling evidence from epidemiologic studies has led
scientists to debate whether to promote large-scale circumcision
programs as a means to help stop the AIDS epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   While discussion at the session devoted to circumcision was
largely academic, one participant, Dr. Daniel T. Halperin, an
anthropologist at the University of California at San Francisco,
addressed the reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's not fool ourselves into thinking that we experts will
decide whether men will get circumcised,'' Dr. Halperin said. ``It
is happening right now'' as a small number of clinics have sprung
up in Africa to offer circumcision to adult men, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In studying the Luo people in Kenya, who do not practice
circumcision, Dr. Robert C. Bailey of the University of Illinois at
Chicago said he found that most Luo men and women perceived that
sex would be more pleasurable if the man was circumcised and that
most men would prefer to be circumcised.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Bailey and other experts expressed concern about the safety
of the procedure in Africa because many of those performing it
lacked medical expertise. Hygiene is a problem, and only one of
eight clinics surveyed had all the instruments needed to perform a
circumcision safely, Dr. Bailey said.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Buve of the Institute of Tropical Medicine in Antwerp,
Belgium, studied two African cities with high HIV rates and two
with low rates. In Yaounde, Cameroon, and Cotonou, Benin, where the
HIV prevalence among sexually active men was 3.8 and 4.4 percent,
99 percent of the men were circumcised. The practice was less
common in Kisumu, Kenya, and Ndola, Zambia, where infection rates
were 26.8 percent and 25.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ronald Gray of Johns Hopkins University School of Public
Health expressed reservations about recommending circumcision based
on his team's studies in Rakai, Uganda. A rigorous type of study,
known as a randomized controlled trial, is needed to scientifically
determine the degree of protection from circumcising males at birth
and as adults, Dr. Gray and others said.
</P>
<P>
   Such trials could determine whether religious, cultural,
behavioral and hygienic factors account for an important part of
the protection that seems related to circumcision. But the impact
of rigorous trials on the epidemic could be limited because answers
might not come until 15 to 20 years after they are started.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers must decide between scientific rigor and reality,
said Dr. Roy M. Anderson of Oxford University at a separate session
about the general problem of conducting research in the face of the
AIDS pandemic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rigor should be adopted in some instances, particularly where
controversy exists about cost-effectiveness,'' he said. ``But
common sense argues that rough and ready observational studies
should be used in high incidence regions with limited resources.''
</P>
<P>
   In providing a possible biological explanation, a paper in a
recent issue of the British Medical Journal said that the inner
surface of the foreskin contains so-called Langerhans cells that
have an area on their surface that allows the entry of HIV.
</P>
<P>
   And in a new report, the Population Council in New York City
urged more research to determine the cost-effectiveness of male
circumcision.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, 40,000 people become infected with HIV
each year, a rate that the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention considers unacceptably high.
</P>
<P>
   CDC officials gave a more encouraging view of the HIV epidemic
in the United States, where it said teen-agers were heeding the
warnings about the virus. Surveys found that in 1999, 50 percent of
teen-agers reported having had sex at least once compared with 54
percent in 1991. And 58 percent of teen-agers said they used a
condom the last time they had sex, up from 46 percent.
</P>
<P>
   HIV infection rates among women fell by 9 percent from 1994 to
1998. However, the number of women 21 to 25 years old had more than
doubled in that period, suggesting that the downward trend among
women overall may be masking increases in incidence among young
women, Dr. Rob Janssen said.
</P>
<P>
   But in Jersey City, N.J., 2.5 percent of blacks had HIV or AIDS,
a rate 13 times as high as that of blacks in Flint, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   In Newark, 0.7 percent of Latinos had HIV or AIDS, a rate five
times as high as Latinos in Albuquerque, N.M.

   SALVADOR-GARDEN (San Salvador, El Salvador) _ Like a testament
to life's stubborn triumph, a rose garden filled with thick,
fragrant blossoms rises at the site where soldiers killed six
Jesuit priests at the Jose Simeon Canas Central American University
in 1989. Nearby, a votive candle flickers in the room where the
soldiers then killed a housekeeper and her daughter, hoping to
eliminate any witnesses. It did not work. One woman saw the crime
and helped build a case against the gunmen. More important, more
than a decade since the killings, tens of thousands of people from
around the world have sought out the Jesuit residence's tiny garden
to bear their own witness to the faith of eight people they
consider martyrs who defended the poor during this country's civil
war. A foreign journal by David Gonzalez. (1375 words)

   TURKEY-POLITICS (Istanbul) _ The increasing likelihood that a
73-year-old former prime minister will go to prison for remarks in
a political speech six years ago is sending a chill through
Turkey's political elite and bringing widespread calls to relax
laws that restrict freedom of speech. An appeals court last week
upheld the one-year sentence and lifetime political ban imposed on
former Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan on the charge of
``provoking hatred'' in a 1994 speech. Since the ruling, political
leaders have scrambled to diminish the decision's impact on
Turkey's efforts to portray itself as a modern democracy and to
join the European Union. By Douglas Frantz.

<P>
   CANADA-POLITICS (Calgary, Alberta) _ Stockwell Day, the new
leader of Canada's official opposition, offers a conservative face
rarely associated with Canadian politicians: support for a flat
income tax, tougher sentencing for criminals, and beefed up
military spending. But his sudden sweep to national prominence,
culminating with his decisive election Saturday night as leader of
the new Canadian Alliance, seems vaguely familiar, leading some
press commentators to call him the ``Pierre Trudeau of the Right.''

   SCI-AIDS-CONFERENCE (Durban, South Africa) _ Scientists at the
13th international conference on AIDS here debated Monday what to
do about one of the most puzzling but potentially important
findings in AIDS, namely that circumcised men are two to eight
times less likely to become infected with the AIDS virus than
uncircumcised men. The finding was first made in Africa more than a
decade ago and has been noted in more than 40 studies since then.
Now many scientists have come to suspect that circumcision is an
important factor in the vast differences among African countries in
rates of infection from HIV, the AIDS virus. By Lawrence K. Altman.

<P>
   We all have our embarrassing little secrets. Mine is that I read
children's books.
</P>
<P>
   I started when I was a small boy, raiding our tiny elementary
school library for such kinder classics as Roy Chapman Andrew's
(beginitalic)All About Dinosaurs, (enditalic)and have continued to
this day.
</P>
<P>
   It was never the fictional or fairy tale books I latched onto
but the histories, biographies, science and natural history books.
Herbert S. Zim was my god.
</P>
<P>
   The books were filled with the answers to the questions I had
when I was in third grade. Why do some whales have teeth and others
baleen? How does an airplane stay in the air? Why is an egg shaped
that way?
</P>
<P>
   I still have questions, and books still provide answers. Or when
they don't give me answers, they show me the path to find my own
answer.
</P>
<P>
   But sometimes jumping straight into a serious adult tome is
confusing. The experts who write them know much more than I do. And
they don't care about my ignorance. As a result, they can write
well beyond my poor ability to understand them on first go-round.
They are either written with the assumption that you already have
the rudiments, or they are polemical and assume you know the
disputed territory, or they are specialist books filled with a new
vocabulary you haven't learned yet.
</P>
<P>
   That's where children's books come in.
</P>
<P>
   Children's books give you the simplified, coherent version that
the adult books won't deign to provide.
</P>
<P>
   I am aware that the version the children's book gives is often
distorted, grotesquely simplified and sometimes just plain wrong.
But that doesn't matter: They provide a start, a map to the subject
at hand and give you an orientation that can later be fleshed out,
made more subtle and transcended. But you have to begin somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   It is important to realize that knowledge is not merely a
collection of facts. We are bombarded with facts daily, and it
hasn't made any of us smarter. It just means we have more to
forget. And we do.
</P>
<P>
   Knowledge is a set of interrelationships between facts. The
interrelationship has a shape and coherence that cannot be
constructed from the facts alone.
</P>
<P>
   I am reminded over and over about Einstein and facts. ``If I
need a fact, I can look it up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   You can understand information by two different metaphors. I
choose what I call the ``tree of knowledge.'' It has roots and
branches and creates a unified, simple idea. There may be many
leaves on the tree, but if you keep the shape of the tree in mind,
the leaves - the facts - will turn out to be just where they need
to be.
</P>
<P>
   The other metaphor - the one we come across daily in TV
newscasts, magazine articles and written driving exams - is what I
call ``fact confetti.'' This is the blizzard of unconnected data
that piles up across our road. Get me a snowplow.
</P>
<P>
   If you think of history as a bunch of dates and names - 1588,
1492, June 6, A.D.79 - it's no wonder you have trouble remembering
it. But if you know the great flow, the big picture, all the
details make sense where they come.
</P>
<P>
   They are more than merely dates associated with the Spanish
Armada, the expulsion of Jews from Spain, D-Day or the destruction
of Pompeii, they are part of the inevitable flow of history.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a systemic view of anatomy, no bone will be
unconnected to its neighbor. If you know the division between
bivalves and univalves, the shells you find at the beach have an
instant home - a kind of mailbox in your brain - where they belong
and fit comfortably.
</P>
<P>
   I often have found that if I have forgotten a fact, I can
re-create it accurately by knowing its context. It is better to
know how the French Revolution fits into the change from the Age of
Enlightenment to the Age of Romanticism. If you feel the larger
flow, then you remember that the French Revolution (beginitalic)has
(enditalic)to come after the American one.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, once you have created enough of these ``trees of
knowledge'' on a large number of subjects, then you start seeing
the forest instead of the trees, and it becomes easier and easier
to fit a new shrub into the even larger system. All with almost
none of the pain of trying to learn facts by rote.
</P>
<P>
   Children's books give you a sense of the flow and very few
facts. If later you discover that the tree of knowledge you gained
from the kid's book is flawed, you can trim it or replant it, but
it has served its purpose. It has got you in the door.
</P>
<P>
   And, if you never get beyond a children's book, well, you still
know more than most people.

 &HT;    He's 82, and Ted Williams still can talk about hitting
 &HT;    By Paul Reid
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. - You see Ted Williams sitting there in
his kitchen bathed in the white, blinding light of a Florida
morning, and you grasp all the symbolic transcendent stuff baseball
fans take away from the game.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, baseball's just a game. Our game. And Ted Williams is a
legend. Period.
</P>
<P>
   He's almost 82. It's been 40 years since he took his last swing,
a home run of course. It's been almost 60 years since he set a
record that may never fall: batting .406 in 1941. That's a fair
spell ago. He hit .344, lifetime. If a modern hitter hit .344 once
in his career he'd consider it a year to remember. Williams won all
the awards, was named one of the top athletes of the century in all
the millennium polls.
</P>
<P>
   You see Williams sitting there, squinting into the sun, eyes
clear, chin set, and you can't help but hear old voices, see old
scenes, black and white and grainy at the edge. Old names: Ruth,
Foxx, Gehrig, Hornsby, Cy Young. Mantle, Mays and DiMaggio.
</P>
<P>
   And him. The guy eating a breakfast of fresh melon, fresh mango,
grapefruit, scrambled eggs and sausage, links and patties, big
glass of fresh orange juice, frothy.
</P>
<P>
   Come in, he says. Sit down. Have some breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   Clear voice. Great radio voice. So powerful he wouldn't need
much of a transmitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We make the sausage right here, got a French chef,'' he says
``And the freshest juice in Florida. Sit down. Eat.''
</P>
<P>
   He sweeps a hand toward a chair. Long fingers. Beautiful hands.
Piano hands. Steady.
</P>
<P>
   Sit down, he says. Tell me about yourself.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, oh.
</P>
<P>
   You have been forewarned by George Carter, Williams' houseman,
helper, caregiver. Pal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ted likes to engage you,'' Carter had cautioned. ``He likes a
good discussion. If you show any weakness he'll eat you up. He's
interested in everything, so you better be prepared. The stroke
slowed him down. He tires easily. But watch out.''
</P>
<P>
   Everybody wants a piece of the legend. So George - ex-cop and
ex-sergeant major, U.S. Army - guards the gate. He's built like a
bombard tower. Only someone really dumb or someone Carter truly
loves would ever call him a name. Like Porky, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Porky,'' says Williams, ``I'm gonna have more of this
wonderful sausage this morning, and I don't want to hear anything
about it being bad for my diet.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter smiles.
</P>
<P>
   Williams sits back, squints hard, like a pitcher about to
deliver something nasty. The chin is set. The gaze. Here it comes.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, you know a lot about baseball?'' he asks, and stabs a
sausage link.
</P>
<P>
   The question blows by like a rising fastball. You think, what
kind of fool would answer, sure, Ted. Tons. I know tons about
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Tell me about baseball, you say.
</P>
<P>
   And he does. And more. With the extra sausage links arriving and
Carter pulling his chain, the legend becomes flesh and blood,
human. You get an old man reflecting on a life well lived. But you
don't for a minute forget who's talking here.
</P>
<P>
   On baseball: ``I was in the right place at the right time. I
could swing a bat. I was a lucky kid. This was the Depression, you
know, late '30s. Boy, was I lucky. Did I want to be the greatest
hitter of all time? Yes. Of course. Why do anything if you don't
want to be the best.''
</P>
<P>
   On fishing: ``I was a hunter before I was a fisherman. I think
the most peaceful times of my life were spent at dawn, in a duck
blind somewhere. Manitoba. Minnesota. You wait for the flocks, it's
quiet, a breeze maybe. So quiet. So majestic. But then the great
bird migrations got not so great. The birds disappeared. People did
that, yes? Not hunters, but mankind. What a whacky bunch we humans
are.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started fishing more. I discovered the Atlantic salmon. Now
let me tell you, the Atlantic salmon is an incredible creature. It
swims thousands of miles back to the stream where it was born,
thousands of miles. The young are in danger from day one. Bears,
otters, mink. An epic struggle. And then, off they go to the far
oceans, thousands of miles. Until something tells them it's time to
go home again. Isn't that a miraculous life cycle? Sure, you got
your African lion. Big deal. They hunt, they kill stuff, they eat
stuff, they sleep. I'm not knocking lions, but for all the beauty
and mystery of life, give me an Atlantic salmon.''
</P>
<P>
   It fast becomes obvious that the wonder years never ended for
Williams. He speaks with a childlike sense of curiosity and
amazement. Not because he's an old guy, but because he's young
where it counts. Everything goes under his microscope. There is an
intense concentration about him, perhaps born of being on the
receiving end of more than100,000 major league pitches. Or perhaps
it was there all along, which is why he sent so many of those
pitches into the bleachers. He scrutinizes words and ideas as if
they were sinking curve balls.
</P>
<P>
   On history: ``Tell me. Who was the most influential American of
the century, other than FDR? Come on now. Who? Douglas MacArthur.
He set the pace for the entire postwar world. Imagine if he had
gone into Japan intent on revenge. Imagine Japan collapsing into a
new dictatorship after the war. Sure, he was pompous. But he was
wise. Wise. That's the ticket.''
</P>
<P>
   On heros: ``My heros? Navy and Marine flyers, World War II,
Korea. Joe Foss. On Guadalcanal he went up daily for over a month.
Shot down, what, 20, 25 Jap fighters and bombers. It was just pure
guts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The proudest moment of my life was the day I earned my Navy
wings. What an honor. The best bunch of guys in the world, and I
was one of them. And later, in Korea, with John Glenn. I was his
wingman. I went from props to jets - F-9s - because this guy told
me, Ted, the jets are just so easy to fly. Well, they're easy to
fly unless you're hit, then they drop like a rock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Combat? I was lucky. Sure, I gained perspective. You have to.
It's combat. But don't get me wrong. I didn't come back and play
baseball and think, this is just a game, this isn't combat. It is,
especially when a pitcher is trying to hurt you. You know, every
experience in life has a lesson that can be applied somewhere else
in life. You gotta just keep learning the lessons.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams speaks, remembers, reflects. On jet engines, history,
hunting, hitters, pitchers. Carter tops off the orange juice.
Clocks in the big house chime the hour. Chirp the hour, actually.
Williams loves birds, and his clocks sing the hour -- bluebirds at
10, robins at 11, finches, parakeets, owls. On the hour the house
sounds like an aviary at feeding time. You appreciate bird song
more as you get older, says Williams.
</P>
<P>
   On old age: ``The so-called golden years. What a lot of bull. I
think you ought to get a pill when you turn 72, a pill to take if
and when you think it's time. I call it the Kevorkian pill.''
</P>
<P>
   On the press: ``Those Boston writers could be a bunch of
S.O.B's. And they went after Curt Gowdy, too. They thought Curt
didn't root hard enough for the Red Sox. Well, hell, he was an
announcer not a cheerleader. I forget the names of some of those
writers. But I'll never forget Curt. What does that tell you?
What's important in life? Your friends.''
</P>
<P>
   This from the guy once considered to be testy, aloof and
downright nasty by the Boston press.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm just a lovable old guy, now,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   And the last of the baseball giants. Most have been gone for a
half century or more.
</P>
<P>
   You see him sitting there and you can't help but dream old
dreams. Legends are catalysts: Take a simple game like baseball,
add a kid, add a million kids. Then mix in a legend. You get a
million dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Williams made dreams.
</P>
<P>
   And, he made the most exciting event in baseball look like
ballet. The home run. A Williams home run was an Odyssean event,
parable, biography. The ball lived, soared. Died.
</P>
<P>
   He had to hit a home run in his last at bat. And he did.
September 28, 1960. His last at bat of the game, his season, his
career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jack Fisher was the Baltimore pitcher,'' says Williams. ``I'd
been hitting the ball hard, had already hit a long fly, 380-feet. I
felt pretty good. But the weather was wrong. Misty. Damp wind
blowing a little bit to the east. First pitch, ball one. Then I get
a pitch I know I can hit out. But I missed. Now I'm a little
worried. How could I miss that pitch? But I notice Fisher is
anxious to get that ball back. He's out there on the mound and he
wants that ball. That tells me something. Tells me he's in a hurry
to give me the same pitch. I know it's coming. And sure enough,
here it comes. And there it goes. Goodbye.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodbye it was. He loped around the bases and into the dugout
and was gone. He said goodbye with his bat.
</P>
<P>
   You heard Red Sox radio announcer Curt Gowdy a hundred times in
your youth, imagined that it was your crushing blow he was calling:
``Williams hits a looonng fly ball, deeep to center field. The
outfielders are just looking up at this one. This ball is going,
going...It's...gone.''
</P>
<P>
   You still hear those words when you're at a ball game. You're
grown, you have kids, but you still hear the words.
Going...going.... And you want someone to smack one out of there,
just for the sake of your kid, of course, so your kid can feel the
magic.
</P>
<P>
   A pitch, a swing. By the time you hear the crack of the bat the
ball is already halfway out of the park. You search for it in the
night sky, and there it is, bathed in a million watts of light,
floating lazily toward the black oblivion that waits beyond the
light towers. You have time to savor its flight, time even to
glimpse the offended pitcher as he kicks the dirt. Time to turn to
your kid and ask, do you see it? Time to turn back and behold the
ball as it wanders across the night sky, toward the blackness, then
into it. Going...going....
</P>
<P>
   It's gone, and like childhood or life itself, it was too short.
</P>
<P>
   You tell your kid: Nobody hits them like Williams.
</P>
<P>
   So now, you look at Williams in his kitchen in the glare of a
Florida morning as he, in turn, grasps a ball in his right hand and
beholds it with all the intensity of Hamlet with Yorik's noggin.
Williams sighs and rolls the ball across the table and says: ``I
was a ballplayer.''
</P>
<P>
   That's all: I was a ballplayer.
</P>
<P>
   Like a Ferrari is a car, Ted.
</P>
<P>
   He smiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was lucky,'' he says. ``A kid in the right place at the
right time.''
</P>
<P>
   And then you think a terrible thought. He's almost 82. The
stroke, the maladies of advancing age, the pills and doctors. This
long graceful flight is nearing an end. And those words of long
ago, Going., going...gone take on new and not so pleasant meaning.
</P>
<P>
   It is no consolation that we're all going, going, that sooner or
later we'll all be...ah, but you forgot the obvious. Of course:
Unlike the rest of us, Ted Williams will never, ever, be... gone.
</P>
<P>
   Williams leans across the kitchen table, stabs another sausage
link..
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you want to hear about the time Rogers Hornsby gave me
advice on the art of hitting?'
</P>
<P>
   Anytime, Ted. Anytime.

   Over and over, old friends and new acquaintances, using phrases
like ``rotten'' and ``crooked,'' told me that, fundamentally,
nothing has changed in Lebanon; that politics and economics remain,
as one put it, ``parasitical, feudal and entirely rapacious.''
</P>
<P>
   But of course some things have changed in the decade since the
war ended. By 1990, the paroxysm of violence that had torn Lebanon
since the mid-1970s had turned on itself, so badly that many
Lebanese were desperate to restore an ordinary sense of business
and life. So they welcomed the calm that Syrian control brought
them.
</P>
<P>
   Today, most visibly, the presence of armed militias in which
gunmen ruled has been ended, and that is no small thing. (They are
officially disarmed, except for Hezbollah in the South, although
much of the weaponry is just hidden away.) The remaining
Palestinians are disenfranchised, confined to their camps. The
ability of the Maronite Catholic elite to either dominate the
country or to establish an autonomous entity has been ended.
Perhaps most important for the future is the rise of the Shiite
Muslim movement Hezbollah, or Party of God, to power and
respectability. Politically, Syria calls all the shots now.
</P>
<P>
   But what has not changed is the strict division along religious
lines that defines _ and essentially undermines _ Lebanon as a
country.
</P>
<P>
   When modern Lebanon was formed in 1943 out of a French mandate
granted after World War I, power was apportioned by religion,
mainly to protect the Maronites; they were to hold the presidency,
with other offices apportioned to Sunni Moslems, Shites, Druse and
13 smaller sects.
</P>
<P>
   And that has always been the paradox of Lebanon: What has
enabled its people to survive and even prosper through unbelievably
difficult times, like the civil war, are the tight bonds of family,
village, clan and religion. But the same narrow loyalties prevent a
national social contract.
</P>
<P>
   The headquarters for the small band of foreign journalists
throughout those war years was the shabby, beloved Commodore Hotel,
presided over by its suave, impeccably-dressed manager, Fouad
Saleh, who could accomplish anything. The parrot at the bar
imitated incoming shellfire, Fat Tommy the cat slept wedged in the
warmth between the Associated Press and Reuters news wires, and the
telexes, magically, always worked. Guests checking in were asked,
``Shelling side or sniper side?''
</P>
<P>
   One night during the Israeli siege of Beirut in 1982, a
desperately needed truckload of bottled water materialized, bribed
through Israeli lines near the airport. ``You see, we are really
all Levantine together,'' smiled the man from the Democratic Front
for the Liberation of Palestine next to me at the bar.
</P>
<P>
   But in the final five years of the war, when erstwhile allies
turned on each other in a frenzy _ Shiites against Palestinians,
Hezbollah against its Shiite rival Amal, Christians against
Christians, the Lebanese army against Christians _ the Commodore
was destroyed in street fighting between the Druze and a Sunni
militia, the Murabitoun. A Druse gunman carried off the parrot to
an unknown fate.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Commodore has been rebuilt as a fancy Meridien, with a
Benihana Japanese steakhouse. Just off the lobby is a place called
the ``News Bar,'' with a carpet embroidered to imitate newspaper
front pages. When I looked in the other day, it was empty.
</P>
<P>
   Fouad Saleh died a few years back, I was told, and, because of
his mixed marriage, neither the Muslim nor the Christian cemetery
would accept his body. Fouad, the ultimate fixer, had been beaten
at last by Lebanon.

PIAZZA PIE IN THE SKY ABOUT CLEMENS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOARD MANLY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Give Mike Piazza some credit.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Clemens hits him in the head with a pitch, and though
visibly dazed from a concussion, Piazza tells the media he thought
Clemens was a great pitcher but he didn't have respect for him.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Piazza thought the beaning was intentional. But
that's not the point.
</P>
<P>
   Clemen's Yankee teammates were noticeably quiet.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees weren't so quiet two years ago when Clemens pitched
for the Toronto Blue Jays.
</P>
<P>
   During a September game in 1998, Clemens hit New York's Scott
Brosius in the back after the Yankees scored three runs in an
inning. The Yankees were already troubled by Clemens hitting Derek
Jeter in spring training and again during the regular season.
Monday, Newsday reprinted comments made by Jeter and Yankees
manager Joe Torre after that 1998 game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt it was on purpose,'' Torre said. ``Roger gets certain
privileges for what he has done for the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Jeter, ``He does it every time. It's no secret. He's been
doing it for years.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemens defended his inside pitching to the New York Post and
said that he has never aimed the ball at a batter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned very young that you don't aim the ball,'' Clemens
said. ``I used to aim it and the ball ended up on the Mass Pike.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the injury, Piazza won't play in the All-Star Game,
but he was a commentator for Home Run Derby on ESPN Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   It's been that kind of season.
</P>
<P>
   Weird.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pregame analysis
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ESPN analyst Joe Morgan had a lot to say _ naturally _ about the
All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine Frank Thomas not being on this team when his
team has the best record in baseball,'' Morgan told reporters last
week. ``He's not on this team and he's having a great year. He
would get some MVP votes if people voted today. Winning teams
should have the most players. That's the way I feel because that's
what the game is about. The White Sox have the best record in
baseball and they should be represented that way. The fans this
year did a pretty good job, but you're always going to have some
hiccups _ it's impossible not to.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hall of Fame second baseman did have something positive to
say about the injury-riddled All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always felt that second basemen never get the credit
they're due because they're overshadowed by guys who hit 50 home
runs, but now you have some second basemen who are in that same
vein,'' Morgan said. ``Guys like Craig Biggio, guys who are usually
All-Stars, are not having their usual types of years. If you look
at Jose Vidro, you have to say this guy is unbelievable the way he
has hit and fielded. But it's a tough call to say who's the best.
It's the best crop I've ever seen.
</P>
<P>
   NBC's Bob Costas, who will work his fourth All-Star Game
Tuesday, told reporters that he was a National League years back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really remember beginning in the early '60s and into the
early '70s that the National League was much quicker and much more
progressive about signing black and Latin American stars than the
American League,'' Costas said. ``I was a Yankee fan and I loved
Mickey Mantle, but I always found myself rooting for the National
League in the All-Star Game, because you could just look at it and
see that these guys were fairer. They represented something that
was worth rooting for more than the American League did then. I
think it stood for something symbolically.''
</P>
<P>
   Costas said there is less passion for the All-Star Game these
days.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no one's fault,'' he said. ``It's just a product of all
the changes that have taken place in the game.''

 c.2000 New York Times    
<TEXT>
<P>
   EGREMONT, Mass. _ We called it ``chin music,'' the high inside
fastball that would flip a batter onto his back and get him
thinking. It was also known as a ``beanball'' or ``purpose pitch''
because it had so many purposes: intimidation of a hot hitter,
retaliation for having had one of your players ``dusted off,''
behavior modification for showboats and hot dogs. The nicknames
alone testify to its significance. In the 1950s, Sal ``The Barber''
Maglie of the New York Giants was famous for giving hitters ``a
close shave.''
</P>
<P>
   Compared with the high inside throwers of my era like Don
Drysdale and Bob Gibson, I was a sissy, even though I threw hard.
Pitching for the Yankees against the Kansas City A's in 1963, I
broke Wayne Causey's wrist with an inside fastball and ran up to
home plate to see how he was. My teammates told me afterward that
this was bad form. Even if it was an accident, they said, you
should never let the other team know. It never hurts to let them
think about it.
</P>
<P>
   Could that be why Roger Clemens didn't rush to home plate to
check on Mike Piazza's condition after he hit the Mets catcher in
the head on Saturday night? Maybe Clemens didn't care, but maybe he
was just following the code. Too often in sports, any sign of
humanity is perceived as weakness.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets' players and fans accused Clemens of deliberately
throwing at Piazza's head but Clemens insisted that he was only
trying to brush Piazza back from the plate. How do you know if a
pitcher is intentionally throwing at a batter? Sometimes it's
obvious to umpires and other close observers by the demeanor of the
players or the context. Most of the time it's not obvious, and the
pitcher gets away with it.
</P>
<P>
   During my career, I only threw at one hitter on purpose. This
was during my first year, pitching for the Kearney Yankees in the
Class D Nebraska State League. Everybody on the team, including our
kindly old manager, wanted to nail a guy on the Holdredge White Sox
who actually played with file-sharpened spikes and who we caught
lobbing balls into the air during our infield practice that would
land among us like mortar shots.
</P>
<P>
   On our clubhouse wall someone had drawn the outline of this
player in a batting stance, with sections marked like the cow
illustration in the butcher shop. It was a contest for the
pitchers, with certain areas being worth more points. I faced him
only once, in relief, and threw the first pitch behind his head,
which is what you do when you're serious, because the hitter's
first move is usually back. But the guy froze and the ball hit his
bat and came bouncing back to me for an easy out.
</P>
<P>
   I've never had much respect for pitchers who use high inside
fastballs to intimidate hitters, especially in the American League,
where the designated hitter allows a pitcher to avoid the rough
justice of a turn at bat.
</P>
<P>
   Was Clemens trying to intimidate Piazza or, even worse, trying
to hit him? We know the context was that Piazza had gotten seven
hits, including three home runs, in 12 at-bats against Clemens in
their previous confrontations. Without Piazza in the lineup, the
Mets lost to Clemens for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   But evidently the umpires didn't feel they had enough evidence
to eject Clemens, or even warn him at the time. Everyone has an
opinion about what happened on Saturday night. But only the pitcher
knows for sure.
</P>

and is the author of ``Ball Four.'')

 By ROBERT B. REICH    
 c.2000 New York Times    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Thomas Lepuschitz, one of 46 Austrians
recruited by New York City to help ease the shortage of math and
science teachers, told a New York Times reporter recently that he
thought it strange that the state required even the slowest
students to take math and science in order to graduate.
</P>
<P>
   It's different in Austria. ``Our school system divides people
who can do certain things and people who can't,'' he explained.
``The people who can't are not lost; it's just a slower track.''
</P>
<P>
   Lepuschitz has touched a raw nerve. Standardized tests _
increasingly linked to grade promotion, graduation, even teachers'
salaries and the tenure of principals _ are the single biggest
thing to have hit American education since Sputnik. Responding to
the understandable demands for more ``accountability,'' almost
every school in the land is morphing into a test-taking factory.
Both Al Gore and George W. Bush have touted proposals linking
federal dollars to scores on standardized tests.
</P>
<P>
   There are obvious benefits. Uniform tests present clear goals
and give students, parents and schools ways to measure progress
toward meeting them. But standardized tests are monstrously unfair
to many kids. We're creating a one-size-fits-all system that
needlessly brands many young people as failures, when they might
thrive if offered a different education whose progress was measured
differently.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, we're embracing standardized tests just when the
new economy is eliminating standardized jobs. There's one certainty
about what today's high school students will be doing a decade from
now: they won't all be doing the same things, and they won't be
drawing on the same body of knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   Jobs in the old mass-production economy came in a few standard
varieties (research, production, sales, clerical, managerial,
professional), but this system has fragmented. Computers, the
Internet and digital commerce have exploded the old job categories
into a vast array of new niches, creating a kaleidoscope of ways to
make a living.
</P>
<P>
   Musicians, artists, writers and performing artists are
discovering multimedia outlets for their talents. Tens of thousands
of people are starting their own Web-based businesses and auction
houses. People who had been clerks and secretaries are turning into
spreadsheet operators, desktop publishers and Web-based inventory
control managers. Salespeople are becoming specialty technicians,
finding or creating products to meet particular customer needs.
</P>
<P>
   We're also seeing an increasing demand for people who provide
personal attention and comfort. There's an upsurge in advisers,
counselors, coaches and trainers. Physical and occupational
therapists are needed. Home health-care workers, elder-care
assistants and child-care workers are all in short supply. And we
have a chronic need for teachers at all levels.
</P>
<P>
   Success in these jobs doesn't depend on mastery of one uniform
body of knowledge as measured by standardized tests. Instead, many
of them require an ability to learn on the job _ to discover what
needs to be known and to find and use it quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Some depend on creativity _ on out-of-the-box thinking,
originality and flair. Others depend on the ability to listen and
understand what other people are feeling and needing. Most require
``soft skills'' like punctuality and courtesy, although some geeks
succeed wildly without even these rudiments.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, people need to be able to read, write and speak clearly.
And they have to know how to add, subtract, multiply and divide.
But given the widening array of possibilities, there's no reason
that every child must master the sciences, algebra, geometry,
biology or any of the rest of the standard high school curriculum
that has barely changed in half a century. Nor is it necessary that
every child graduate from high school ready to qualify for a
four-year liberal arts college.
</P>
<P>
   This doesn't mean that ``slower students'' should be relegated
to trade schools, as they are in much of Europe. In the new
economy, specialized vocational skills soon become obsolete.
Besides, the whole notion of faster or slower learning is
irrelevant when there are so many new options for how and what to
learn.
</P>
<P>
   In our headlong rush toward ``accountability,'' we seem to be
veering toward two extremes _ either expecting every child to pass
the same test or assuming that certain children are uneducable,
relegating them to a vocational track.
</P>
<P>
   Our challenge is to find different measures of the various
skills relevant to the jobs of the new economy. It's our job not to
discourage our children, but to help them find their way.

WOODWARD CASE LESSONS APPLIED TO RINK MANSLAUGHTER CHARGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SACHA PFEIFFER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Two killings, two totally different charges.
</P>
<P>
   When baby Matthew Eappen was shaken to death, Louise Woodward,
was accused of first-degree murder, a charge many thought didn't
fit the crime. In the end, the judge in the case reduced the
British au pair's conviction to involuntary manslaughter.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the same district attorney's office -- led by a different
district attorney -- is faced with another crime in which the
killing appears not to have been intentional: the beating death of
Michael Costin by Thomas Junta at a hockey rink in Boston's Reading
suburb.
</P>
<P>
   And this time, Middlesex District Attorney Martha Coakley, one
of the prosecutors in the Woodward case, has charged Junta with
manslaughter, not murder.
</P>
<P>
   It's a decision praised by many defense attorneys, who see the
Reading case as a rare instance of prosecutors resisting the
temptation to ``overcharge'' -- accusing a defendant of the most
serious offense possible to strengthen their position if plea
bargaining enters the picture.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the manslaughter charge has puzzled some of those same
lawyers, who wonder if the facts in the Reading case actually may
have supported a more serious charge. And it has led some legal
observers to conclude that Coakley applied lessons learned in the
Woodward case -- such as the perils of overcharging -- to the
Reading death.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before a prosecutor, particularly in Middlesex County, goes
forward with a higher charge, I think he or she may be inclined to
think long and hard about the appropriateness of the charge because
of the impact of Louise Woodward,'' said Marc Perlin, an associate
dean and professor of law at Suffolk University Law School.
</P>
<P>
   ``So one certainly could conclude that the Louise Woodward
legacy lives on,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Coakley, through a spokesman, insists that ``there
is no connection'' between the Woodward and Junta charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had absolutely nothing to do with each other,'' said the
spokesman, Anson Kaye. ``Every charging decision is based on the
facts and circumstances of the case at hand.''
</P>
<P>
   The investigation of the Reading case is still in its infancy,
and many of the facts in the case are still under wraps.
</P>
<P>
   Several lawyers interviewed Monday noted that deaths resulting
from fistfights, which is how Costin died, often result in
manslaughter charges.
</P>
<P>
   But Boston attorney Harvey Silverglate, who was a member of
Woodward's defense team, has a different viewpoint.
</P>
<P>
   That the Middlesex DA's office decided to charge Junta with
manslaughter ``is a recognition that they made a mistake charging
Louise with first-degree murder,'' Silverglate said.
</P>
<P>
   He noted, for example, that Coakley said Junta was charged with
manslaughter because there was no indication he intended to kill
Costin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, even in its wildest moments, the DA's office never
claimed, much less believed, that Louise tried to kill the baby,''
Silverglate said. ``So I think that the overcharging legacy of that
case has had some influence.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This certainly does look and smell like a manslaughter case,''
added Boston defense attorney James Sultan, ``but it seems unusual
to me that, given what was apparently a deliberate beating
resulting in death, the DA would charge that right off bat as
manslaughter rather than murder.''
</P>
<P>
   By law, murder is defined as an unlawful killing accompanied by
malice. To prove malice, prosecutors must show one of three things:
intent to kill, intent to cause grievous bodily injury, or intent
to cause an action that a reasonable person would know creates a
substantial likelihood of death or grievous bodily harm.
</P>
<P>
   Murder rises to the level of first-degree if it is done with
deliberate premeditation, extreme atrocity or cruelty, or during
the commission of a felony punishable by life imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   Manslaughter is an unjustifiable killing that occurs without
malice, such as a death that arises during the heat of passion,
after reasonable provocation, or because of the excessive use of
force or defense. Involuntary manslaughter is a killing that
results from willful, wanton or reckless conduct.
</P>
<P>
   In deciding how to charge Junta, prosecutors had to weigh
allegations that he was ordered out of the rink but returned to
fight with Costa, indicating possible premeditation. Junta is also
alleged to have smashed Costin's head repeatedly on the rink floor,
indicating possible extreme atrocity or cruelty.
</P>
<P>
   Technically, a grand jury could still indict Junta for murder,
``but from a public relations standpoint that would really raise a
tremendous number of questions,'' Sultan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lesson learned from Woodward is that overcharging isn't
always the safe way to go,'' he added. ``It really can mess up the
effective and fair operation of criminal justice system, and there
may well be an attempt here to avoid same mistakes committed
there.''

 &HT;    Williams sisters finish at Wimbledon with doubles title
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Clarke
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WIMBLEDON, England - Venus wore lavender and Serena wore pink,
and after spending more than two hours getting ready for the
Wimbledon Champions' Dinner, they spent just an hour at the Savoy
Hotel in central London.
</P>
<P>
   They still had work to do Monday after all - rain pushed
Wimbledon into a third week for the women's doubles final - and
needed to get some sleep before playing fourth seeds Ai Sugiyama
and Julie Halard-Decugis at noon.
</P>
<P>
   Venus admitted they've never stayed up later the night before a
final than they did Sunday night. But they don't expect the 2 a.m.
bedtime to become a habit - even though they did win 6-3, 6-2 just
before the rains returned at the All England Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad had left and before I knew it, I said, 'Now Serena, you
need to go to bed as soon as possible,' `` the singles champion
said, giggling, after the doubles match.
</P>
<P>
   ``She took over as the parent,'' sidekick Serena agreed,
laughing.
</P>
<P>
   It was a fun day for the Palm Beach Gardens, Fla., sisters, as
they entertained the crowd on-court for 70 minutes, carried a
silver trophy around for a few more minutes, then signed a few
autographs, did a few interviews, grabbed a check for about
$285,000 and headed to the airport to catch a flight home to
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great because it's a millenium Wimbledon,'' Venus said,
smiling. ``There will not be another millenium Wimbledon for
another millenium.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was a serious day, too.
</P>
<P>
   Winning Wimbledon's singles and doubles crowns together has been
a lifelong goal. They'll add the trophies to Serena's U.S. Open
singles title, and their 1999 U.S. Open and French Open doubles
victories.
</P>
<P>
   They also became the first sisters and the first all-black team
to win women's doubles at Wimbledon. Etienne Dumas, who has worked
with the family for about 10 years, remembers many conversations
with Richard Williams about this day. And he remembers many
practice sessions with the girls when he said, ``OK, you're in the
final of Wimbledon.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very proud at this moment, very very proud,'' Dumas said
after the doubles win. ``History's been made and that's what we
wanted from the beginning. that's what we talked about: We are
going to change history.''
</P>
<P>
   That was apparent in the Centre Court stadium Monday.
Ticketholders from Sunday were admitted, but most returned to work
or simply didn't bother showing up for women's doubles.
</P>
<P>
   The club anticipated that and admitted thousands of others for
just 5 pounds, about $7.50, for the women's doubles and girls'
doubles finals. All the money -- about $40,600 -- will go to a
children's charity.
</P>
<P>
   Fans lined up for the ``People's Monday'' beginning early in the
morning. By 11:30 a.m., they were racing around the grounds,
worried they wouldn't get in. But no one was turned away. And the
tournament's most diverse group of fans was allowed to fill in all
empty seats in the lower bowl 15 minutes before the start of the
match.
</P>
<P>
   They whooped, hollered, did the wave - even getting those in the
Royal Box to join in - and yelled out for Venus and Serena
throughout the match, prompting the umpire to instruct them not to
call out just before the players' serve.
</P>
<P>
   ``People here really support the sport. They're here the first
day and the stadium is packed 'til the last day,'' said Serena, who
wasn't surprised by the crowd. ``It's not like America - where they
come only for the finals, the semis. It's really different.''
</P>
<P>
   After becoming the first doubles team to win on a wild card, the
Williams' now will be ranked in the mid-20s and shouldn't need
another wild card for a long time. But they will be eager to hear
whom Olympics coach Billie Jean King selects to play doubles in
Australia in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Venus, who will be selected to play singles, admitted it would
be hard for her to go if Serena wasn't chosen to play too.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of whether they play in the Olympics, they certainly
look like the future of women's tennis. They burst onto the scene
three years ago with more splash and attitude than game and
aptitude. Now that they've each won a Grand Slam and shown they can
dominate doubles whenever they chose, Chris Evert admits she
worries about the health of the rest of the WTA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   The sisters can understand why.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really amazing because I hadn't played in two months;
Venus has only played four tournaments this year and for us to come
back like this, I can only imagine what people are thinking,''
Serena said. ``Obviously they're probably going to go home and
practice harder, but you know what? We are too. We're really
serious and we mean business.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Venus: ``It's getting pretty scary.''
</P>
<P>
   But they still remain relatively inexperienced. Just 20 and 18,
Venus and Serena haven't played nearly as many matches or
tournaments as their peers. Their games will get so much better
when they reduce their errors, harness their power and master the
mental game.
</P>
<P>
   They can't attain No. 1 in the rankings this year because of the
time they've missed, but they can get into position to pounce on
the spot early next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was one of our goals since we were younger, not just to
win Slams, but to be the best in the world and see our name next to
the No. 1 ranking,'' Serena said. ``That's a personal goal that we
both really want to accomplish in our careers.''
</P>
<P>
   Venus is closer, matching a career-high No. 3 in Monday's
ranking. Serena improved one spot to No. 7. Until they can reach
numbers 1 and 2 (assuring they couldn't meet until a tournament
final), they plan to collect as many rankings points and titles as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're both out to get all we can get,'' Serena said. ``We're
both really greedy.''

IN REFERENDUM ON BASHAR, SOME IN SYRIA VOTE WITH THEIR BLOOD

 By JOHN KIFNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
  BEIRUT, Lebanon _ Syrians lined up to vote Monday in a referendum
to confirm Bashar Assad as president.
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was hardly a cliffhanger. Indeed, Assad was the sole
candidate, and the swearing-in was already scheduled for Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   He is the son of Hafez Assad, who ruled with an iron fist for 30
years. The election Monday was part of a programmed process by the
governing Baath Party and an inner circle of the late president to
provide the trappings of legitimate succession. Portraits of Bashar
Assad, once a little-known eye doctor, flooded Damascus on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In quick tempo after Assad's death on June 10, the constitution
was amended to make the minimum age for the presidency 34, Bashar
Assad's age. He was also promoted to lieutenant general and
commander of the army, named head of the Baath Party Regional
Command and endorsed for president by acclaim in a parliamentary
session that ran an extra day because so many people wanted to be
recorded in support.
</P>
<P>
   As Prime Minister Mohammed Miro, who was appointed in March with
Bashar Assad's backing, voted, he told reporters, ``The people gave
their opinion before the referendum by choosing Bashar as
president.''
</P>
<P>
   A long-serving previous prime minister, Mahmoud Zubi, committed
suicide on May 21 as security forces arrived to arrest him in what
was generally described as an anticorruption drive spearheaded by
Bashar Assad that purged a number of formerly powerful officials.
</P>
<P>
   The voting Monday _ extended, officials said, for popular demand
_ consisted of marking a ballot in a green circle signifying
approval of Assad or a negative gray circle.
</P>
<P>
   A number of polling places provided an unusual electoral
accessory, an array of safety pins or sewing needles with which
voters could prick their thumbs and mark the circles in blood.
</P>
<P>
   Basil Hassan, 18, voting at a school where he was taking a free
15-day computer course sponsored by Bashar Assad in his only
previous official role as head of the Syrian Computer Society,
marked his ballot with a bloody thumbprint.
</P>
<P>
   ``We already sacrificed a lot of blood for our country in peace
and war,'' Hassan said. ``We will sacrifice more of our blood and
our country for Dr. Bashar. He is a student in his father's school,
and he will continue in his footsteps.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials in one voting place open to foreign reporters looked
shocked when a women marked her ballot in blood in the gray ``no''
circle instead of the green approval circle. She quickly realized
her error, however, and was given another ballot to commend the new
government.
</P>
<P>
   In the polling place where Miro voted, an official assured
reporters that not one of the 435 votes cast in the first four
hours of the referendum had been negative.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister Farouk Shara said to reporters after casting
his ballot: ``There has been a lot of betting on the succession,
that the absence of Assad would lead to instability and ambiguity.
We thank God that all these bets have failed.''

FOR INVESTORS, STRONG EARNINGS MAY NOT OFFSET INTEREST RATE
JITTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the second-quarter earnings season gets into full swing this
week _ with reports expected from General Electric, International
Paper, Motorola, Yahoo and  &UR; J. &LR; P. Morgan _ the outlook is the best
it has been in years.
</P>
<P>
   But a look back at 1994 shows that even great earnings news may
not lift stock prices much when the Federal Reserve is still intent
on raising interest rates to slow an overheating economy.
</P>
<P>
   Earnings picked up steam through most of 1994, and the companies
in the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index finished the year with a
16.4 percent gain in operating earnings, well above the average for
the the '90s. Meanwhile, the stock market flagged. The Dow Jones
industrial average eked out a 2.1 percent gain, while the S&AMP;P 500
fell 1.5 percent and the Nasdaq composite dropped 3.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, the outlook for earnings is even better than
it was then. In the first quarter, profits surged 23.6 percent from
the year-earlier quarter, the strongest performance since the last
three months of 1993, according to First Call/Thomson Financial,
which collects Wall Street forecasts for the 500 companies in the
S&AMP;P index. For the second quarter, earnings are expected to
increase 19.2 percent, First Call says. And for the full year,
analysts are forecasting 19.2 percent earnings growth, which would
make this year's gain the strongest since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the three major stock indexes are down or flat for 2000,
after hitting new highs earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed's interest rate increases have taken the rally out of
the market, as they did in 1994. Rising rates threaten to slow
economic growth and, therefore, cut into corporate earnings. They
also can raise borrowing costs for companies. And higher interest
rates, when plugged into many Wall Street valuation formulas,
immediately make stocks look more expensive when compared with
their projected earnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market hasn't made much headway because investors had an
eye on the Fed,'' said Thomas Galvin, chief investment officer of
Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette. Although Galvin says that this year's
stock market performance would have been worse if profits had not
been as strong, he now expects the market to be in a holding
pattern until investors sense that the Fed has taken its foot off
the brake.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is still a fair amount of skepticism that the cool-down
in the economy is not enough for the Fed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The power of the Fed to stymie the market is remarkable given
that the projected earnings growth for this year is stronger than
the actual growth proved to be in each year of the 1995-to-1999
run, when the Nasdaq and the S &AMP; P 500 rose 20 percent or more each
year and the Dow climbed 20 percent or more in four of the five.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Liro, chief economist at Stone &AMP; McCarthy Research
Associates in Princeton, N.J., warns that although earnings growth
will be strong this year, the pace will slow at the end of the year
and will decelerate further early next year. ``I have been fairly
optimistic about earnings and remain so,'' he said. ``But it may
not be good enough for investors to get excited about.''
</P>
<P>
   Another factor that could continue to undermine the stock market
is inflation, which some analysts expect to rise even as the
economy slows. During the stock market rallies since 1995, the rate
of core consumer inflation, which excludes the cost of energy and
food, was in decline. It fell to an annual increase of 1.9 percent
last year from 3 percent in 1995. But for the three months through
May, core inflation rose at a 3.2 percent annual rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the long haul, what is the most important thing for stock
prices in any given quarter or any given year is the trend in
inflation and the bond yield,'' said Douglas Cliggott, U.S. equity
strategist at J.P. Morgan Securities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Earnings were great in the first quarter and will be darn good
in the second quarter,'' he said. ``But the reason the market
indexes are slightly down is the inflation trend.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas McManus, equity strategist at Banc of America Securities,
sees another dark cloud in the outlook. Wall Street analysts are
overestimating the strength in earnings for the rest of the year,
he says, because they do not realize how far the Federal Reserve
will go to slow the economy and curb inflation.
</P>
<P>
   He is forecasting that the earnings growth rate will decline
sharply this year, falling to 9 percent by the final quarter and to
zero in the first quarter of 2001. That would bring earnings growth
well below the 11 percent average so far in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing that is going to bring inflationary pressures
down is to break through that trend line,'' McManus said. ``And
that is not currently baked into analysts' forecasts.''
</P>
<P>
   But while strong earnings may not be able to drive the stock
market much higher in the face of expected Federal Reserve rate
increases, they are still a good guide to those picking stocks.
McManus says investors should stick to what he calls the
predictable earnings sectors, including utilities, health care,
consumer products and, to a lesser extent, financials.
</P>
<P>
   Galvin urges investors to consider health care and technology
stocks because they performed the best after the Fed took its foot
off the brakes in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Earnings performance is far more important for stock pickers
this year than it was last year, Galvin says. In 1999, companies in
the Nasdaq composite index that reported operating losses had an
average stock gain of 115 percent for the year. Among the companies
that reported profits, the average stock gained 51 percent. So far
this year, companies with losses have stock declines of 11 percent
on average while companies with profits have stock gains of 10
percent on average.
</P>
<P>
   There is some good news in this look back at 1994. It is what
happened in 1995. The Dow average surged 33.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Once it is clear that the Federal Reserve has finished raising
interest rates _ as long as the economy has not been slowed to the
brink or even into a recession _ nice earnings ought to help the
stock market forge ahead again.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is, while some analysts think the pace of economic
growth is slowing enough for the Fed to take its foot off the
brakes, Federal Reserve officials have not given an all-clear
signal yet.

CITING COSTS, HONEYWELL EXPECTS ADDITIONAL LOWER EARNINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Honeywell International, citing high raw material costs in some
businesses, slow growth in others and high interest rates in all of
them, told investors Monday that its second-quarter profit would be
75 cents a share, about 3 cents less than the company had predicted
earlier this year. The company also lowered its earnings estimates
for the full year and for 2001.
</P>
<P>
   On June 19, Honeywell warned analysts that the quarter's
earnings would fall short of their expectations. That time,
surprised and angry investors sent Honeywell's shares plummeting by
more than 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   This time, investors seemed to simply shrug as shares of
Honeywell rose 37.5 cents, to $35.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investors priced their disappointments into the stock on June
19, and now they want to take a breather and see what happens,''
said David A. Kiefer, a portfolio manager at Prudential Global
Asset Management, which holds Honeywell stock.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, most analysts kept strong buy recommendations on the
company, in part because the stock is now so cheap.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given where earnings are, and the company's ability to
generate results, the shares should be trading in the mid-40s,''
said Howard A. Rubel, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   The earnings shortfall and lagging stock come at an unpropitious
time for Michael R. Bonsignore, Honeywell's chief executive.
Honeywell International was formed last year when Honeywell Inc.,
the Minneapolis company that Bonsignore ran, merged with Allied
Signal Inc. Part of the deal was that Bonsignore would run the
merged company when Lawrence Bossidy, Allied's well-regarded chief,
retired.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our fundamentals are strong,'' said Bonsignore, who became
chief executive in December and chairman in April. But he added
that this was a difficult was for him to get started.
</P>
<P>
   Bonsignore inherited many of the company's problems. Bossidy
invested heavily in pharmaceutical and chip-packaging businesses,
both of which have been bottom-line disasters.
</P>
<P>
   But the merged company has also had disappointing growth in
industrial controls and fire security systems, two businesses that
the old Honeywell brought to the party. And it has not been able to
offset tripling oil prices with price and volume increases in its
chemicals businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are problems on both sides of the portfolio,''
Bonsignore acknowledged Monday. ``And if we hadn't been so
distracted by melding cultures and otherwise making this merger
work, we might have reacted more quickly to oil prices.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts are giving him the benefit of the doubt, at least for a
while. ``We aren't ready to hang him yet,'' said David Bleustein,
an analyst with PaineWebber. ``But if problems surface in 2001,
they will clearly be on Michael Bonsignore's watch.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Bonsignore described several plans to keep that from
happening. He said he would close the chip operation, taking a
charge of $59 million, and would divest pharmaceuticals and
friction materials. Most analysts think he is already negotiating
sales of both.
</P>
<P>
   He said he might spin off part of Honeywell's new microturbine
business to shareholders, a move that could generate a huge amount
of cash. Last month Capstone Microturbine, which also makes
microturbines _ small, clean-burning power generators _ went public
at $16; it now trades in the $60s.
</P>
<P>
   Bonsignore also promised to reduce costs by an additional $100
million a quarter over the next two to three years and to use
attrition to trim 5,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Bonsignore would use the resulting cash to reduce Honeywell's
debt-to-capital ratio, now a troubling 42 percent. He would like to
flesh out the company's core aircraft parts and industrial controls
businesses with more acquisitions. And he wants to buy back stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this price, a share buyback would certainly be a
compelling, high priority use of our cash,'' Bonsignore said.

FRENCH KILLER IN PIVOTAL CASE TO STAY IN JAIL 
</HEADLINE>
   By SUZANNE DALEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Patrick Henry, whose trial in 1977 for killing a
7-year-old boy helped lead to abolition of the death penalty in
France, has been refused parole.
</P>
<P>
   In the earlier case, Henry had a passionate young lawyer who put
the guillotine on trial instead. In the end, Henry got a life
sentence and, soon after, France abolished the death penalty
altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, Henry has been back in the headlines, at the heart of a
new debate over whether someone who has committed such a heinous
crime can be rehabilitated.
</P>
<P>
   Now 46, Henry says he is a changed man and he has mustered all
kinds of supporters. When France's justice minister, Elisabeth
Guigou, started considering the case last month she indicated that
she might act in his favor. Monday she said no.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief statement turning down the request, her office said
that she had done an ``in depth'' study of the case, asking for
``numerous opinions'' before making her decision.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the case underscores how far the country has come
in 20 years and how much the eye-for-an eye notions of punishment
have been replaced by a debate over the uses of incarceration and
the best ways to rehabilitate criminals, even those convicted of a
horrible crime.
</P>
<P>
   One of Henry's lawyers in 1977, Robert Bocquillon, said he was
convinced that Henry had completely remade himself in prison,
earning his baccalaureate, a mathematics degree and a degree in
computer programming. He has a job waiting for him when he gets
out.
</P>
<P>
   But by refusing to parole him, Guigou, a socialist, can avoid
what is still a difficult political decision. Polls indicated that
French citizens were, though by only a slight margin, still opposed
to his release.
</P>
<P>
   Henry kidnapped Philippe Bertrand, 7, from outside of his
school, strangled him and took the body to a room he had rented. He
wrapped the body in a blanket and stuffed it under the bed. Within
hours, he called the boy's parents and demanded a ransom of 1
million francs, which they could not pay. During the search for the
boy, Henry even appeared on national television saying people who
kidnap children deserve death.

   LOS ANGELES _ Question: I joined this company a few weeks ago,
and the two people who interviewed me just announced they are
leaving. One is my direct supervisor, and the other one is one of
the key people in the department. I interpret this as a bad sign,
and I am wondering what you suggest. C.L.
</P>
<P>
   Answer: It is never pleasant to find that your first days on the
job are the last days for the people who hired you. This may indeed
be a bad sign, or it might not be much of a sign at all.
</P>
<P>
   In this type of situation, it would have been preferable for
both the soon-departing individuals to let you know more about what
is happening. Since they did not take this step, your next step is
to meet with them.
</P>
<P>
   Let them know you are concerned about their departure,
particularly in light of the positive comments they made about the
company when they were interviewing you. If they are willing to
discuss the matter, you may learn they are leaving because of
significantly better offers elsewhere, or perhaps they are leaving
for strictly personal reasons. In these types of scenarios, there
is no indicator of serious problems in your company, and no reason
for major concern on your part.
</P>
<P>
   However, they may be leaving because of company problems which
they are not willing to discuss with you. If you sense there is
more to their departure than meets the eye or ear, take a look
around the rest of the organization. If it looks like a fire drill,
you have your answer.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am going on a job interview next week, and I am supposed to
be interviewed by a panel of four people. I have never had this
type of interview before, and I am somewhat nervous about it. Are
there any hints?
</P>
<P>
   A: Although this type of interview sounds like a 4 on 1
breakaway, its objective is not to fire a barrage of verbal shots
against a hapless applicant. Rather, companies that conduct these
types of interviews are typically serious about hiring and are
committed to devoting considerable resources in order to make the
right decision. This type of screening technique does not call for
much of a change in your interview strategy.
</P>
<P>
   As in any job interview, obviously, you should be honest, clear,
and succinct, and you should have a solid understanding of the
industry, company and potential position. When you are introduced
to the group, try to remember the names and titles of each person.
And, when a question is asked, address the individual by name and
try to tailor your response to fit his or her position in the
company.
</P>
<P>
   While answering one interviewer's question, be sure to make eye
contact with him or her, as well as with each of the others. If the
interviewers start talking among themselves, do not interrupt. Even
with this group format, remember the adage that the more the
interviewers talk, the more they like the applicant.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have been very patient with my son-in-law, but he is not
working out in our business. I don't want to fire him, but it's
apparent to just about everyone that he is still around because he
is family, and people are getting upset about this. How do I fire
my son-in-law and not ruin my relationship with him and my
daughter? F.J.
</P>
<P>
   A: If you simply fire your son-in-law, your daughter may sense
she is being fired, too. At the same time, if your son-in-law is
truly a bad match for the job, there are some steps to take.
</P>
<P>
   In the first place, although you indicated you have been
patient, he may be in the wrong position altogether. Perhaps there
is another job within the firm that is a better match for his
skills, abilities, drive and expertise.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to considering other job opportunities within the
company, it is also worthwhile to explore the possibility of
providing him with more training, guidance, and opportunities for
growth and development. If you have already taken these steps, and
he has still failed to perform successfully, then it may well be
time for you to make a move, and for him to make one, too.
</P>
<P>
   However, this move should be focused more on outplacement than
termination. With this approach, you should arrange for him to
receive some career guidance, planning and related support to help
him find a position that is a better match. Unless he is completely
out to lunch,HLRpkW.HZYHk$V,Z[Kk$JhK-YHkK

CITING SHORTAGE, PENTAGON CUTS BACK ON ANTHRAX VACCINATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich.)   By ELAINE SCIOLINO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Secretary of Defense William Cohen has decided to
drastically reduce the inoculation of American military personnel
against anthrax because of concerns that the country's supply of
the vaccine is running out, senior Pentagon officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was made after a test of a stockpile of 194,000
doses on guinea pigs in recent weeks indicated that the vaccine had
lost much of its potency and might not be fully effective, they
added.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon will now inoculate only those most at risk of
facing attack by the deadly biological weapon: those who serve on
the ground in South Korea and Kuwait. Both North Korea and Iraq are
believed to have stockpiles of anthrax.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've reached the point where we cannot continue the program
at its current pace,'' said Marine Maj. Gen. Randall L. West, a
senior Pentagon adviser on chemical and biological defense, in a
telephone interview. ``I'm very disappointed we have to slow down
the program. There is still a threat and we are very, very
concerned about it. We need to vaccinate our whole force so that
all of our forces have protection all of the time.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision to limit the anthrax inoculation program coincides
with a firestorm of criticism from members of Congress who have
called for an indefinite suspension of the program, calling it
untested, ineffective and dangerous. On Wednesday, the Senate Armed
Services Committee, and on Thursday, a subcommittee of the House
Armed Services Committee will hold hearings on the vaccination
program.
</P>
<P>
   Between 200 and 300 military personnel have refused to be
vaccinated since the program began and several have been
prosecuted. In March, Air Force Maj. Sonnie Bates was discharged
from the military with a general, but not an honorable, discharge
after he questioned the safety of the anthrax vaccine and refused
an order to take it. Initially he faced a court-martial for
refusing an order.
</P>
<P>
   Some people who have received the vaccination have complained of
fever, muscle pain and dizziness. But the Pentagon and the Food and
Drug Administration insist that the vaccine is both safe and
effective.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to curtail the vaccination program is an
embarrassment both for the Pentagon and Cohen himself. In late
1997, he ordered all 2.4 million active and reserve military
personnel to take the anthrax vaccine by 2003, demonstrating his
personal belief in its safety and efficacy by rolling up his own
sleeve for a vaccination. He, like Gen. Hugh Shelton, the chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and other senior Pentagon and
military officials, have received all six doses of the anthrax
vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, about 1.8 million doses of the vaccine have been
given to 445,000 American service personnel. Six vaccinations are
needed to offer full protection.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, the Pentagon administers about 75,000 doses of
the vaccine a month. The number of inoculations will probably come
down to fewer than 20,000 a month, West said.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon has only 165,000 doses of the vaccine left in which
it has ``complete confidence'' and that have passed the test in all
areas, West said. At the current rate of inoculation, the nation's
supply would have run out in about 40 days.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturing of the vaccine was halted in December after the
Food and Drug Administration found 30 violations in safety,
consistency, record-keeping and sterility in an inspection of the
only plant in the country that makes it.
</P>
<P>
   The financially troubled plant, BioPort Corp. in Lansing, Mich.,
is now scheduled to restart production when the FDA gives final
approval, which is expected to come by the end of the year. Until
mid-1998, the plant was owned by the state of Michigan; it was then
bought by BioPort, a bio-pharmaceutical company. Adm. William J.
Crowe Jr., the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and an
unpaid member of the board of directors of the corporation, has an
11 percent interest in the corporation.
</P>
<P>
   According to an internal Pentagon audit completed in March,
BioPort officials predict a possible $18 million cash shortfall in
2000. Initially, the plant sold the vaccine to the Pentagon for
$2.26 or $4.36 a dose, depending on its year of manufacture. The
price jumped to $10.64 a dose in August as part of a package that
increased the Pentagon's contract with BioPort by $24 million,
including an $18 million advance to help keep the company afloat.
</P>
<P>
   After production was halted, Cohen ordered the vaccinations to
continue, saying that it would be irresponsible to send soldiers
into combat unprotected. The anthrax bacteria generally afflicts
animals, especially sheep and cattle, but dry anthrax spores can be
weaponized. What makes anthrax so dangerous is that it is a
colorless, odorless, tasteless agent that can kill after only one
inhalation.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen has informed Shelton, the chairman of the joint chiefs, of
his decision to curtail the program. The final decision of how much
to cut it will be made in consultation with his top generals and
admirals in the field, a senior Pentagon official said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the ways the Pentagon plans to ration the vaccine is to
stop giving it to service personnel after they have left the Korean
and Persian Gulf areas even if they have not completed the full
series of vaccines, West said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the BioPort plant has other old lots of anthrax vaccine
besides the one that was most recently tested, it takes so long to
test them fully that the FDA has advised the Pentagon to focus its
efforts on helping to get the BioPort plant into production again,
not on testing and re-testing old stockpiles.

TAINTED BY FINANCIAL MISDEALINGS, WEIZMAN QUITS AS ISRAELI
PRESIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOEL GREENBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
  JERUSALEM _ President Ezer Weizman of Israel resigned Monday,
lowering the curtain on a public career that spanned more than half
a century of war and peacemaking but ended tainted by scandal.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Weizman's letter of resignation was delivered to the speaker of
Parliament, Avraham Burg, who will fill the largely ceremonial post
until Parliament chooses a new president on July 31.
</P>
<P>
   Shimon Peres, a former prime minister and a Nobel Peace Prize
laureate, is the candidate of the governing One Israel Party. His
opponent, representing the rightist Likud Party, is Moshe Katzav, a
former cabinet minister and a longtime legislator.
</P>
<P>
   Weizman, 75, whose second term as president was to have ended in
three years, stepped down early after a report by state prosecutors
that harshly criticized him for financial misdealings and a warning
from Burg that the legislature could move to dismiss Weizman.
</P>
<P>
   The report by the attorney general, issued in May, found that
Weizman had acted improperly when he accepted more than $300,000 in
unreported cash from two executives from 1985 to 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The report said insufficient evidence and the statute of
limitations prevented prosecution for suspected bribery, fraud and
breach of trust. But it asserted that Weizman, who was a minister
and a lawmaker when he received the money, had violated disclosure
rules for officials.
</P>
<P>
   Although he is leaving under a cloud, Weizman, crusty and
outspoken, enjoyed wide popularity in his seven years in office. He
often stepped beyond the bounds of his apolitical post to dispense
advice on peace efforts and to sound off on matters like
homosexuality and the role of women, setting off lively debates.
</P>
<P>
   A hawk-turned-dove who is a former air force chief and defense
minister, Weizman was an architect of the Camp David peace accords
with Egypt in 1978. He advocated talks with the Palestine
Liberation Organization years before the Oslo accords of 1993.
</P>
<P>
   A nephew of Chaim Weizmann, Israel's first president, and a
member of Israel's pioneer generation, Weizman served in the
British Air Force in World War II and helped organize the air wing
of the Haganah, the Jewish armed force during the British Mandate
in Palestine. He commanded the Israeli air force from 1958 to 1966,
building the squadrons that destroyed Egyptian air power on the
first day of the Arab-Israeli war in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving the army, he joined the rightist Herut Party, a
forerunner of Likud. As the Likud's campaign manager in 1977, he
directed Menachem Begin's upset victory, ending 29 years of Labor
Party government.
</P>
<P>
   The landmark visit to Israel of President Anwar el-Sadat of
Egypt in 1977 was the start of Weizman's conversion from hawk to
dove. As defense minister in Begin's cabinet, Weizman played a
pivotal role in the Camp David talks, establishing a quick rapport
with Sadat and prodding fellow Israeli ministers to show more
flexibility in the negotiations, which led to a formal peace treaty
in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Weizman left Begin's government in 1980, dissatisfied with what
he considered the slow pace of peace efforts, particularly talks on
planned Palestinian autonomy in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. In
1984, he ran in elections at the head of a small party that merged
with the Labor Party two years later.
</P>
<P>
   As a minister in a Labor-Likud government in 1989, Weizman
clashed with Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir over meetings that he
reportedly held abroad with the PLO, and he was stripped of his
membership in the decision-making ``inner cabinet.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Weizman announced his retirement from politics, saying
that he could ``no longer contribute'' to peace efforts and that
the Likud government was leading the country toward war. He was
chosen as president a year later.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, hours before he sent off his resignation letter, Weizman
dispensed one last piece of political advice, urging Prime Minister
Ehud Barak to forge ahead with the summit meeting this at Camp
David, Md., with the Palestinians, despite the collapse of Barak's
governing coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Weizman, a former fighter pilot, described peacemaking as a
battle. ``The prime minister,'' Weizman said, ``is acting like a
commander in the field who knows that he may not have enough
troops, but he has a goal to achieve, and he runs forward.''

they heard his name and caught on that he was that anti-war Sen.
Albert Gore's son, just out of Harvard. No less than the Army's
highest-ranking officer, Gen. William Westmoreland, singled him out
during a visit to Fort Rucker, Ala., where Pvt. Gore was stationed
for more than a year. Yet there is no evidence that Gore sought
special treatment, or that the extra notice he got anyway provided
any real protection. On the contrary, within the parameters of his
job as an Army journalist, Gore probably assumed more risk than he
had to. By Melinda Henneberger. (Scheduled to move by 9 p.m. ET in

FIBEROPTIC MERGER UNITES TWO LEADERS IN MARKET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Leading fiber-optic device maker JDS Uniphase Corp. announced a
$41 billion takeover of Silicon Valley neighor SDL Inc., in a deal
that underscores the superheated market for the basic building
blocks of optical telecommunications networks.
</P>
<P>
   JDS Uniphase is already one of the largest customers for SDL's
so-called pump lasers, which generate light signals used to carry
voice and data calls over strands of glass fiber.
</P>
<P>
   With fiber-optic growth constrained by limited supplies of the
basic pieces of optical networks, the $41 billion acquisition will
help JDS intensify efforts to compete with significant players such
as Corning Inc., Lucent Technologies, and Nortel Networks. The deal
faces probable antitrust scrutiny by US Justice Department
regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Excitement over the prospects for using fiber-optic systems to
meet the Internet age's exploding demands for telecommunications
has boosted Chelmsford-based switch and network builder Sycamore
Networks to a $30 billion-plus market valuation. It also has
spurred the creation of over a dozen optical networking companies
in Massachusetts alone.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent months, ``The attention seems to be turning to
these components guys because there are so few of them,'' said Andy
McCormick, an industry analyst with Aberdeen Group in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Already, tiny companies such as NetOptix in Natick, Mass. and
Coretek in Wilmington, Mass. have fetched over $1 billion apiece in
acquisitions by Corning and Nortel.
</P>
<P>
   The New England optical cluster includes a handful of emerging
component makers, such as Axsun Technologies in Billerica,
Precision Optics in Gardner, and Lightchip Optical Networking in
Salem, N.H. But, McCormick said, ``I don't know of anyone around
here who does anything comparable to what SDL does.''
</P>
<P>
   Todd Dagres, general partner with Battery Ventures in Wellesley,
said the JDS-SDL deal, by underscoring the value of component
makers generally, could help boost those companies' profiles,
valuations, and ability to raise venture capital.
</P>
<P>
   But, Dagres said, ``I don't see any of the guys around here as
having significant intellectual property, and there's nobody around
here who has the product breadth that SDL does.'' SDL holds more
than 120 patents for optical devices.
</P>
<P>
   The deal also was read as validating the roughly $5 billion
Corning has poured into buying up Massachusetts-based optical
component companies in the last two years, including the former
Lasertron in Bedford and NetOptix in Natick.
</P>
<P>
   Corning has been seen as a possible bidder for SDL, and SDL
officials confirmed they were in talks with another company, which
they would not name, before they approached JDS about doing a deal.
Corning is both a customer of and competitor with JDS and SDL in
various markets.
</P>
<P>
   Corning's vice president for corporate communications, Dan
Collins, would not comment on whether Corning had been looking at
SDL. ``We think we are well placed in this marketplace regardless
of this deal,'' Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   The Corning Lasertron plant in Bedford, Mass., which makes pump
lasers that compete with SDL products, is undergoing a $45 million
expansion that is expected to add 300 jobs this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is exploding, and we really do think that this deal
announced today really underscores the valuation of Lasertron. If
there were any questions about why we were doing''
multibillion-dollar expansions in Massachusetts, Collins said,
``the market has really validated it today.''
</P>
<P>
   The JDS bid for SDL represents a 50 percent premium over SDL's
closing value Friday. The deal calls for SDL owners to get 3.8
shares for each SDL share, valued at just over $440 Friday before
JDS stock slipped in trading Monday.
</P>
<P>
   John Butler, a Prudential Securities Inc. analyst, told
Bloomberg News that the deal reflects ``a need for suppliers in
this industry to scale up quickly in size to meet demand. The best
way to do that is by acquisition. Of the players that are left, the
combination of SDL with JDS Uniphase is the most natural.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Dagres: ``This is two of the bigger players getting
together and trying to establish themselves as a dominant leader in
the market before it matures.''
</P>
<P>
   Shares of JDS, a former maker of gas lasers that has bought over
15 companies in the last five years, have quintupled in value in
the last year, making it the fourth biggest stock in the Nasdaq 100
Index by market valuation. Both JDS and SDL are based in San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   Among other ramifications, the SDL acquisition was seen as
helping JDS become more competitive with Corning in the field of
optic amplifiers, which are placed about every 50 miles on
continental optical networks to boost signals. SDL also is seen as
a leader in developing a new device called Raman amplifiers that
can extend transmission distances on fiber networks.
</P>
<P>
   SDL, which recorded a $29.9 million profit last year, said it
expects sales this year to more than double from last year to just
under $450 million.

<P>
   SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador _ Like a testament to life's stubborn
triumph, a rose garden filled with thick, fragrant blossoms rises
at the site where soldiers killed six Jesuit priests at the Jose
Simeon Canas Central American University in 1989. Nearby, a votive
candle flickers in the room where the soldiers then killed a
housekeeper and her daughter, hoping to eliminate any witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   It did not work. One woman saw the crime and helped build a case
against the gunmen. More important, more than a decade since the
killings, tens of thousands of people from around the world have
sought out the Jesuit residence's tiny garden to bear their own
witness to the faith of eight people they consider martyrs who
defended the poor during this country's civil war.
</P>
<P>
   Invariably, these pilgrims also trek across town to the chapel
at the Divine Providence Hospital where Archbishop Oscar Arnulfo
Romero, a vocal opponent of the elite and the violent, was shot
dead while celebrating Mass.
</P>
<P>
   They walk through his modest three-room house, where his
bloodied vestments hang in the closet and his bedroom calendar is
forever turned to the month he was killed _ March 1980. Others go
to the countryside to visit the spot where four American
churchwomen were also killed by soldiers in December of that year.
</P>
<P>
   Centuries ago, Spanish conquistadors came here for glory, gold
and God. Now many visitors come to this nation whose name means the
Savior searching for a more elusive treasure along modern-day
Stations of the Cross. They come to conquer their own spiritual
doubts, looking for lessons from priests, nuns and laity whose
embrace of liberation theology's blend of religion and social
activism exacted such a brutal price.
</P>
<P>
   One recent afternoon, the shuffling steps of a dozen Americans
from the University of Scranton blended in with the everyday sounds
of barking dogs, tinny music and food sizzling in the kitchen of
the Jesuit residence.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, the visitors encircled the garden, where the Rev.
Brendan Lally, the Roman Catholic priest leading the group, quietly
knelt in prayer. Afterward, he plucked a tiny sprig of clover and,
as though it were a relic, tucked it into his pocket.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a sacred place where people gave their lives for
Christ and the Gospel,'' Lally said, ``and their deaths make this a
holy place and an eternal symbol of the work for justice. This is a
faith journey. But it is also an attempt to help us as Catholics
understand more deeply our mission by coming to listen deeply to
the experiences of our brothers in El Salvador and the stories of
the people of El Salvador.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a heartening sight to the Rev. Dean Brackley, a American
theologian who came to El Salvador to replace his fallen Jesuit
brothers at the Central American University. He sees it as a
resurrection of sorts, one that is reflected in the experiences of
the dozens of delegations he ushers through here each year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This place, we export more hope than coffee,'' he said. ``With
all the violence, we still export hope. That is why people still
come.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet as strong as the attraction is for visiting delegations, the
religious movement that attracts them has lost ground here. The
popular church, formed of communities that grounded their political
and social activism for the poor in Scripture, was once virtually
the only nonviolent voice speaking out against the government
during the war. Now it competes to be heard.
</P>
<P>
   The killings of the Jesuits and the two women drew international
scorn for the government and helped to propel the peace effort that
ended the war. But the popularity and influence of the grass-roots
church has since waned.
</P>
<P>
   Former guerrilla leaders now speak freely and have entered
elective politics, evangelical Protestants have recruited thousands
of Salvadorans wary of an activist Catholic clergy and skeptical of
political engagement, and a conservative Catholic hierarchy looks
at adherents of liberation theology as sick brethren in need of
more orthodox spiritual healing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hierarchy represents a line of thinking that does not look
for repercussions or any social or political change,'' said the
Rev. Rafael de Sivatte, chairman of Central American University's
theology department. ``It represents a religion that only deals
with personal change and repentance of sins. It is an internal
religion that looks at the individual with a spirituality that is
very much in the air without reference to reality.''
</P>
<P>
   The church's challenge in peace, he said, is to find the unity
that was forged and tested to the breaking point during the civil
war from 1979 to 1992. Although the conflict has ended, he said,
many Salvadorans still lack jobs, housing and medical care.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to be even firmer than before,'' he said. ``People
have lost their aspirations and are happy with small economic
advances. We have to tell people not to be content with any little
thing. People say if they are working and have a little money, why
should they struggle for others to work? That was a great value we
had in the war. But it is being lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Enough of the popular movement remains in parishes like San
Bartolo in the town of Ilopango, where teachers from the Central
American University offer theology classes to the congregation. The
students, mostly working adults, take part in discussions of social
justice, grounded in the Bible.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to read the newspaper, too, if you read Scripture,''
said Felipe Miando, a truck driver who recently enrolled in the
class. ``We went through a war.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Bible, the Israelites were subjected to the Roman
Empire,'' he said. ``We were subjected to the empire of the United
States and the rich of El Salvador.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The movement for a more socially relevant religion has also been
buoyed in recent months by the huge crowds that came to San
Salvador to mark the 20th anniversary of Archbishop Romero's
assassination, as well as to commemorate the killings at the
university. Their visits are familiar to Sister Rosa Avalos, who
tends to the chapel where Romero was killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes they come here right from the airport,'' she said.
``They want to know where a prophet, saint and martyr lived.
Sometimes they come to thank God after asking Bishop Romero's
intercession in everything from health, work or some difficulty
they have. Their only recourse is to ask God through him.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside the archbishop's former home, beside a mural of him
smiling by the shore of a lake, dozens of stones are embedded in a
wall, each one thanking the archbishop for answered prayers. But
there are more everyday miracles to be found among the pilgrims who
come here.
</P>
<P>
   For them, the survival of the popular church has been imbued
with a deep meaning that can be personal, political or both. They
go to parishes in poor communities where people share their many
stories and limited food with them. They stand in silence at the
relics of the Jesuit martyrs, including a book whose blood-stained
cover reads ``The Crucified God.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What I want to bring back to Pennsylvania with me is this
spirit of community,'' said Sean Farry, a college administrator who
was making his second trip to El Salvador. ``Here titles are
dropped and you get to know the Salvadoran people. What I find
about them is their spirituality. It strikes me as being part of
their everyday lives and how they rely on their faith. When there
is nothing else to depend on, they can't depend on the government
to help them. They have to turn to God.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Rowland stood inside the university's museum, which is
dedicated to the slain clergy and laity, shaking her head as she
looked at the threadbare clothes, now darkened with blood, that the
Jesuits were wearing when they were shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goodness,'' she whispered. ``They took the time to get
dressed. Good for them.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she had to come here. ``Hopefully, this will make me
more sensitive to other people,'' she said. ``I want to trust
people in a straightforward way. I know I fail miserably in that.''
</P>
<P>
   She looked at a case where tiny jars were filled with soil from
where the priests died.
</P>
<P>
   ``This should never happen again.'' She said. ``But it will.''

  Brightness and stained glass create 
a kaleidoscope of color at Getty Museum 
(For use after Wed., July 12, 2000, by NYTimes News Service
clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
By ELIZABETH SMILOR

Light is an instrument of discovery.
</P>
<P>
   When light shines through a window, it illuminates a room's
furnishings and details such as books or paintings, which define
not only the space but those who use it.
</P>
<P>
   The soft light shining through stained glass windows now on
display at the J. Paul Getty Museum illuminates both sacred symbols
and detailed scenes of everyday life during the Renaissance era in
Germany and Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost like television, we can view an aspect of life then,''
explains Lee Hendrix, co-curator of ``Painting on Light: Drawings
and Stained Glass in the Age of Durer and Holbein.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking at one plate-size glass panel, she marvels at how the
intricate drawings reveal hunting and fishing techniques of that
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``This expands our vision of what they were doing then,'' she
says, ``and the art they wanted to see in their daily lives.''
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit, on view until Sept. 24, includes more than 60
centuries-old glass panels and approximately 80 preparatory
drawings from collections in the United States, Germany,
Switzerland and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   A few of the figures on glass are nearly life-size, but most of
the panels are smaller round or rectangular panes that would have
been placed within larger windows in homes, town halls or churches.
Some windows are paired with the cartoonlike drawings on which they
are based.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition begins with works by Albrecht Durer of Nuremberg,
Germany, who is more widely known for his woodcuts, along with
works by his followers. It ends with panels and drawings by Hans
Holbein the Younger of Basel, Switzerland, who is more famous for
his portraits of King Henry VIII.
</P>
<P>
   The two artists, who lived a generation apart, left distinct
marks on the art of painting on glass. Durer (1471-1528) developed
his own style when he was commissioned to design windows for
chapels, the Bishop of Bamberg and Nuremberg's Carmelite monastery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Durer changed the language of drawing, creating a new,
inventive vocabulary of lines and graphic details,'' Hendrix
explains.
</P>
<P>
   Hans Holbein the Younger (1497/98-1543) worked on a much smaller
scale than Durer, but added depth to his works, giving them a
three-dimensional look. In many cases, Holbein used arches in the
foreground to give the work dimension and create a sense that
viewers are peering into the painted scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``Holbein picks up on Durer's innovations, in a tonal sense,
creating infinite ranges of light and dark,'' explains co-curator
Barbara Butts, who is a guest curator at the St. Louis Art Museum
where the exhibit will be displayed this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Another part of the exhibit shows how the stained glass was
created. As the exhibition's title, ``Painting on Light,''
suggests, the hand-blown glass was not only stained with such
materials as silver nitrate for yellow or iron oxide for red, it
was also painted with vitreous paints made by mixing crushed glass
with vinegar, clove oil or gum arabic. To re-create the fine
details from a drawing, a glass painter often put the charcoal
drawing directly beneath a clear panel and copied the image in
paint. When finished, light, as it shines through the panels,
brings life to the images.
</P>
<P>
   Two of Durer's larger works, ``The Annunciation'' and ``Saints
Andrew and Pope Sixtus II,'' originally from the private chapel of
Dr. Sixtus Tucher of Nuremberg, are reunited for the exhibit.
</P>
<P>
   The windows were sold when Tucher's home was destroyed around
1833 and later repurchased by the Tucher family. But today, ``The
Annunciation'' hangs in the Museum Tucherschloss in Nuremberg,
while the ``Saints'' _ purchased by William Randolph Hearst in 1929
_ has been at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale since 1954.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are just two of the incredible surprises of the show,''
Hendrix says. ``The exhibition is full of discoveries. We had no
idea we had such marvelous stained glass right under our noses.''
</P>
<P>
   Hendrix, drawing curator for the Getty, and Butts spent the past
13 years tracking down the stained glass and drawings. They worked
from a German catalog from 1913 and discovered that many of the

THERMO ELECTRON TO NAME DEKKERS NEW CEO

<TEXT>
<P>
   Thermo Electron Corp. is expected to name Marijn Dekkers to help
reshape the company as its new chief operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   The 42-year-old native of the Netherlands, who previously worked
for Honeywell International Inc. and General Electric Co., will
become one of the youngest senior executives to join Thermo as the
company seeks to shed some businesses and sharpen its focus on
monitoring instruments.
</P>
<P>
   Dekkers holds a doctorate in chemical engineering and speaks
four languages (English, Dutch, German and French). He is the first
major outside executive hired by Richard F. Syron, Thermo
Electron's chairman, president and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Dekkers replaces Earl Lewis, who spent 16 years at Thermo
Electron where he was chief operating officer of the Waltham, Mass.
company's instruments division, its single largest unit.
</P>
<P>
   The company said Lewis is leaving Thermo to ``pursue other
interests,'' but declined to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Syron, the hand-picked successor to Thermo Electron's retired
founder George Hatsopoulos, said Dekkers was chosen for his strong
experience in improving the growth and productivity at both GE and
AlliedSignal, the predecessor to Honeywell.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have several major issues to focus on,'' Syron said. ``And
he (Dekkers) will help us improve our information systems, aid us
internationally where we have more than half our sales, and help us
unify the company that is still spinning off some of its
operations.''
</P>
<P>
   Syron noted that Dekkers holds 30 patents for his work at
General Electric, where he spent 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Since Jan. 31, when Thermo Electron announced plans to split
into three businessess and streamline the 23 units it controlled,
the company has completed most of its restructuring. It still plans
to sell its Thermo Fibertek composite-products unit and a new
medical products company to shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Thermo Electron's stock Monday closed at $24 a share, up 50
cents.

DESPITE MEXICO'S VOTE FOR FOX, PRI STILL CONTROLS CONGRESS 
</HEADLINE>
   By SAM DILLON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ President-elect Vicente Fox' center-right party
made strong advances in the Chamber of Deputies and Senate in the
balloting last week but failed to win a majority in either house
and will need to form legislative coalitions to pass laws,
according to official election results.
</P>
<P>
   The congressional delegation of the governing party, the
Institutional Revolutionary Party, was sharply reduced. But it will
start the legislative session that begins on Sept. 1 with the
largest voting bloc, the results show.
</P>
<P>
   Yet a series of squabbles in which party members have blamed one
another and President Ernesto Zedillo for their defeat raises
doubts about whether the party will vote as a disciplined unit, as
it has in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's National Action Party won 208 seats in the 500-member
Chamber of Deputies, the lower house. The governing party won 209,
and the main leftist grouping, the Party of the Democratic
Revolution, won 53. Five small parties won the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Fox will need to attract 43 votes to reach the majority of 251
needed to pass his budget and other initiatives in the chamber. The
Green Party, which Fox ran with in an election alliance and which
elected 15 members, will almost certainly vote with Fox, said
Jeffrey A. Weldon, a political scientist at the Autonomous
Technological Institute here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fox doesn't have a majority, but he's close enough to build
majorities issue by issue,'' Weldon said. ``He'll be able to
negotiate some kind of coalition for almost everything he wants to
get passed.''
</P>
<P>
   National Action added 86 seats to the delegation that it fielded
after the last federal balloting, in 1997, when the party elected
122 deputies, the results show. The gains by Fox's party and the
smaller parties came at the expense of the governing party, which
lost 30 seats in the voting on July 2, and at the expense of the
leftist party, which lost 72.
</P>
<P>
   In the 128-seat Senate, the governing party won 60 seats,
National Action won 46, Democratic Revolution won 15, the Greens
won five and two small parties won the remaining two, the results
show.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after the balloting, in which National Action got
38.1 percent and the governing party 36.7 percent of the votes for
Senate nationwide, it appeared that National Action would receive
more seats than the governing party.
</P>
<P>
   But under the formula that allocates Senate posts, the governing
party received 14 more seats than National Action, largely because
the the governing party received the most votes for Senate in two
more states than Fox's party and came in second in many more
states.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Electoral Institute released the final returns on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Fox has made conciliatory statements to both the governing party
and to the leftist party since his election. But leaders of both
parties have largely rebuffed his overtures.
</P>
<P>
   The results of the balloting for local posts in Mexico City
could give Fox some leverage, Weldon said.
</P>
<P>
   The leftist party's mayoral candidate, Andres Manuel Lopez, was
elected. But Fox's party won 34 seats in the 66-seat City Council,
so Lopez will need National Action's help in passing all his local
initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   Fox could offer National Action's cooperation in the council in
return for Lopez's help in securing the votes of about 10 leftist
deputies who represent Mexico City in the federal congress, Weldon
said.

 ADVANCE - COX &HT;    Strange breeze blows over 71st All-Star game
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - Cal Ripken won't be here. But Joe Girardi will.
</P>
<P>
   Mark McGwire won't be here. But Mike Sweeney will.
</P>
<P>
   Fred McGriff will be here, and Andres Galarraga will not only be
here but will be an All-Star starter for first time.
</P>
<P>
   A strange breeze blows over Turner Field tonight, where the 71st
All-Star game will be played out in a hundred subplots. The
American League has won the past three and nine of the last 12,
which might interest someone.
</P>
<P>
   But the real drama starts far earlier, when AL starter David
Wells (15-2), who was livid 17 months ago when the New York Yankees
traded him, gets the hook from Yankees manager Joe Torre, who had
to sign off on the trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what I'm capable of doing at any time,'' said Wells,
``and you know, right now if I wanted to, I could strangle Joe.''
</P>
<P>
   Ha-ha.
</P>
<P>
   ``I promised him he'd only pitch seven innings,'' Torre said.
``I've got to wear him out some way.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona left-hander Randy Johnson starts for the National,
though he will only throw one inning, after going seven innings
(122 pitches) while beating Oakland 4-2.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told our people he could go an inning, which I
appreciate,'' said Atlanta's Bobby Cox, managing his fifth All-Star
team. ``But certainly if Randy Johnson's got an inning in him, you
want him to be the first guy out the chute.''
</P>
<P>
   Cox was up until 1:15 a.m. Monday mending a roster that was
reduced all weekend by injury-related withdrawals of McGwire (knee
tendinitis), Barry Bonds (broken thumb), Mike Piazza (concussion),
Ken Griffey Jr. (knee) and Greg Maddux (bruised shoulder). Javy
Lopez might have earned an invitation, had he not roared off to
Puerto Rico Sunday night, opening the door for Chicago's Girardi.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a lineup really set, etched in stone here about 10 days
ago,'' Cox said. ``Our guys started dropping a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   One guy has stood up since February. Galarraga, after sitting
out the 1999 season to undergo cancer treatment, was named the
starting first baseman in McGwire's place. He has become MLB's
Official Feel-Good Story of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a wonderful human being,'' said Torre, who managed
Galarraga in St. Louis and is a cancer survivor himself. ``It's
scary. There's no question. When you hear the 'C' word and the one
thing you associate with it is death.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It surprised me in spring training, the way I feel, that I got
my timing back so fast,'' Galarraga said. ``To be honest, I think
Bobby Cox didn't have plans for me playing this year.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He thinks the angels are looking out for him,'' Cox said,
``and certainly, that has a lot to do with it.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since 1983, an All-Star game will go on
without Ripken, whose ailing lower back ended his string of 16
straight starts. Torre was already dealing with the withdrawl of
Alex Rodriguez (concussion) but A-Rod is 24. He'll be back. Ripken
is 39. Torre phoned him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He expressed his regrets at not being able to be here for the
first time in 100 years or so,'' Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   But what this attrition also means is 25 players 43 percent of
the combined rosters will be participating in their first All-Star
games. Three of them Kansas City's Jermaine Dye, Boston's Carl
Everett and Oakland's Jason Giambi will be starting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still the All-Star game,'' said Philadelphia catcher Mike
Lieberthal. ``All the deserving players are still here. Hey, there
are more All-Stars out there than there were All-Star slots.''

BUSH LAUNCHES NEW APPEAL TO MINORITIES, WOMEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ Appearing before a group that some Republican
presidential candidates have shunned, Texas Governor George W. Bush
brought a conciliatory message to the NAACP's national convention
Monday, saying that racism still exists, that his party has not
done enough to help combat it, and that slavery remains a tragic
blight on the nation's history.
</P>
<P>
   ``For my party, there's no escaping the reality that the party
of Lincoln has not always carried the mantle of Lincoln,'' said
Bush, who received a polite reception with occasional applause and
a few soft cries of ``Amen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``While some in my party have avoided the NAACP, and some in the
NAACP have avoided my party, I'm proud to be here,'' Bush told the
annual gathering of the nation's oldest and largest civil rights
organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``For those who support me _ and I see one or two here -- I hope
you won't change your opinion,'' Bush said. ``For those who don't,
I hope you. . .give me the chance to tell you what is in my
heart.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor's aides compared his visit to the country's largest
civil rights group to a trip inside the lion's den. That's because
the majority of African American voters have long tended to support
Democratic politicians. A New York Times/CBS poll in May showed
Vice President Al Gore, Bush's Democratic rival, with 69 percent of
the black vote and Bush with 17 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That voting record, and differences on key issues of concern to
the minority community, has led some Republican contenders to avoid
a potentially hostile reception before the NAACP. Bob Dole snubbed
the group when he ran for president in 1996 and Ronald Reagan never
addressed the convention when running for president, either.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's father, however, gave speeches to the NAACP in 1983 and
1988 as vice president, and in 1992 as president. The first time,
as he defended the Reagan administration's record on civil rights,
he was booed and hissed. The second time, while running for
president, he was warmly received after saying he had always
supported affirmative action and always would.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, in a speech sprinkled with poetic flourishes not usually
heard from the Texas governor, Bush said the nation must make a new
commitment to equality and upward mobility for all citizens. He
promised to enforce civil rights laws and denounced the
discriminatory practices of redlining and racial profiling. He
quoted W.E.B. DuBois, Abraham Lincoln and Jackie Robinson, in a
17-minute speech that touched on topics ranging from from education
to housing to the ``transforming power of faith.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's speech is part of a recent effort he has made to reach
out to non-traditional Republican voters, such as Latinos, women
and African Americans. He hopes to draw enough minority support to
make the difference in some battleground states both he and Gore
count on winning.
</P>
<P>
   Just prior to his speech, Bush was greeted by half a dozen
people protesting the recent execution of Gary Graham in Texas. The
protesters waved signs saying ``Remember Gary Graham,'' and
``Abolish the Racist Death Penalty.'' Although the NAACP protested
that execution, and has called for a national moratorium on capital
punishment, the organization's President Kweisi Mfume called the
protesters ``outsiders'' and ordered security to escort them out of
the room.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the brief interruption, Bush said after his speech that
he was never nervous and felt he had received a respectful
reception. ``It's kind of fun to go into the places where
expectations are low,'' Bush told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a challenge to attract African American votes, but that's
not going to stop me from trying,'' he said, noting that his
support among Latino and African American voters in Texas went up
from his first gubernatorial election to his second as he became
better known. For example, in 1994 he won about 15 percent of the
black vote, and in 1998, he won 27 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Some among the convention delegates appreciated Bush's effort to
reach out. James Winter, a Florida Republican, said Bush ``did what
he needed to do and that was to acknowledge the tensions between
the Republican Party and black people. That's a very good sign that
things can change.''
</P>
<P>
   Others were unimpressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed like just a bunch of nice words but I don't see them
played out in his record,'' said Arnold Faulker, a Democrat from
New York. ``He talks a nice game but I'm not so sure he will follow
through.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Gore campaign, officials dismissed Bush's speech as
meaningless rhetoric from a politician who would do nothing
concrete to help African Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Talk is one thing, action is quite another,'' said Douglas
Hattaway, Gore's spokesman. ``If he wants to make real progress,
he'd stand up to the Republicans in Congress who are hostile to the
priorities of African Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   Hattaway said it would mean much more if Bush would support
perscription drug benefits for African Americans on Medicare,
support a vote to increase the minimum wage without ``poison pill''
amendments, and back legislation to boost patient rights and
restrict the power of health maintenance organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is to address the NAACP convention on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Darrell M. West, a political science professor at Brown
University, said Bush's efforts to reach out to African Americans
may not win him much support in the black community, but it makes
him look more inclusive and tolerant to swing voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dole was generally surrounded by white males and Bush is
making a concerted effort to include women, young people and
minorities,'' said West. ``Obviously, what he's trying to do is
make himself look more moderate.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Vice President Al Gore, who has tried mightily to take
credit for the strong economy, Bush acknowledged the downside,
saying the national prosperity has yet to reach everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many still live in prosperity's shadow,'' he said. ``The same
economy that is a miracle for millions is a mystery to millions as
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Education is one key to breaking the barrier, he said, promising
to confront ``the soft bigotry of low expectations.'' The gap in
educational achievement between rich and poor, and white and
minority, results in discrimination, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he wants to change the federal Title One education
grants program to require testing of all students. He said
low-performing schools should be forced to show improvement in
three years, or have their federal funds sent directly to parents
to use for for vouchers, or to charter schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``As W.E.B. Du Bois said a century ago, `Either the United
States will destroy ignorance, or ignorance will destroy the United
States,' '' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also outlined other proposals that are part what he calls
his ``compassionate conservative'' agenda:
</P>
<P>
   --A family health credit to cover 90 percent of the cost of a
basic health policy for low-income families;
</P>
<P>
   --An `American Dream Down Payment Fund' to match individual
savings for the down payment on a home;
</P>
<P>
   --The use of Section 8 rental payments to make a down payment on
a home, as well as five years worth of Section 8 vouchers to help
cover the mortgage;
</P>
<P>
   --The elimination of regulations that prevent private and
faith-based programs from helping those in need.
</P>
<P>
   Bush did not attempt, in his speech, to address two topics which
divide him from many in the minority community and the NAACP: the
death penalty, and the controversy over whether the Confederate
flag should fly over the South Carolina state capitol. Bush has
said he would defer to South Carolinian public opinion on the flag
issue.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next three weeks leading up to the Republican
convention in Philadelphia, Bush said he would concentrate on his
compassionate conservative theme. In Michigan Tuesday , he plans to
talk about foster care, adoption and other initiatives to help
those on the outskirts of poverty.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ There was a time when the idea of reggae music
pulsing through the hallowed concert halls of Lincoln Center might
have seemed like sacrilege. But as the Lincoln Center Festival
prepares to open its fifth season Tuesday night, such fare is now
almost taken for granted on Manhattan's main cultural campus.
</P>
<P>
   No longer is it surprising to see something like ``Pour
Antigone,'' a dance theater piece by the French choreographer
Mathilde Monnier that explores the dynamics between Greek tragedy
and modern Africa and opens on July 26, alongside the established
Bolshoi Ballet, which starts performances next Tuesday. Or Lev
Dodin's adaptation of Fyodor Abramov's novel ``Brothers and
Sisters'' staged by the Maly Drama Theater of St. Petersburg, a
six-hour epic in Russian with English supertitles and a cast of 40,
juxtaposed with ``Spinning Into Butter,'' a new play about racism
and political correctness by Rebecca Gilman with a cast of 7.
</P>
<P>
   The summer festival is part of a broader effort by Lincoln
Center over the last few years to expand its purview beyond the
classics and to reach out to new audiences year round. In addition
to the festival, Lincoln Center's newer offerings include Jazz at
Lincoln Center, which started as a program called classical jazz
and grew into a full-fledged constituent; New Visions, which
commissions productions as part of the Great Performers series; and
Midsummer Night Swing, dancing to live bands on the Lincoln Center
plaza.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really was the opportunity to do two things: present art
forms that have not been represented and bring in new audiences,
more diverse, less affluent,'' said Nathan Leventhal, president of
Lincoln Center, who will step down in December after nearly 17
years.
</P>
<P>
   Presenting the kind of unconventional programs that might more
typically be found at the Brooklyn Academy of Music requires a
delicate balancing act for Lincoln Center. Loyal audiences and
longtime contributors need to be assured that the institution is
not abandoning its base. Programming executives must contend with
Lincoln Center's 12 constituents, some of whom, like the
Metropolitan Opera and the Philharmonic, have complained in the
past that some events in the summer festival, which is produced by
Lincoln Center itself, encroached on their turf.
</P>
<P>
   ``The constituents have primacy,'' said Beverly Sills,
chairwoman of Lincoln Center. ``We cannot step on their toes, nor
do we want to.''
</P>
<P>
   The festival, which does not release any figures on earnings or
attendance, must also be careful to balance riskier presentations
with more mainstream events, like the Bolshoi and Alvin Ailey
American Dance Theater, that can be counted on to sell out or come
close.
</P>
<P>
   Nigel Redden, the director of the festival, said he was careful
to try to push the boundaries without going overboard. ``There are
some things I wouldn't put in the State Theater,'' he said. ``I
make some attempt to match the spaces with what I believe the
audience potential will be.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year the festival exceeded box office projections for the
first time, in large part because of the publicity generated by
``The Peony Pavilion,'' the Chinese opera that came to the festival
after being scheduled and then canceled by the Chinese authorities
a year before. Box office receipts account for a little more than a
third of the festival's $9 million budget, with the bulk of the
rest coming from donations.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the risks and growing pains attached to programming like
the festival, Sills said Lincoln Center had no choice but to forge
ahead. ``The last decade showed us there was a whole new world
coming in, and we have to be a part of that,'' she said. ``Lincoln
Center cannot turn into 12 museums.''
</P>
<P>
   Some constituents pride themselves on presenting the classics,
while others seek out adventurous programs.
</P>
<P>
   The median age of Lincoln Center's audiences is 50 for song
recitals and 55 for other programs, while the median age at the
Brooklyn Academy is 42 for its Next Wave Festival and 46 for other
events.
</P>
<P>
   So far Lincoln Center's new programming terrain seems to be
bearing fruit. Surveys last summer showed that nearly 20 percent of
the festival audience, almost one-third of whom were under 35, had
never been to Lincoln Center before, and that an additional 25
percent had never been to the festival.
</P>
<P>
   The institution has changed in the eyes of its peers. ``They
have made courageous artistic choices,'' said Joseph V. Melillo,
the executive producer of the Brooklyn Academy.
</P>
<P>
   Encouraging this new thinking has in part been the work of Jane
Moss, the vice president for programming since 1992. ``I had no
interest in coming in and preserving the status quo,'' Moss said.
</P>
<P>
   In particular she has tackled the area of classical music,
trying to broaden the scope of what Lincoln Center includes and to
make the presentations more accessible, using video, for example. A
series on Sibelius included a documentary film. Lincoln Center
recently presented a series featuring archival film of great
pianists from the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   ``The classical music event itself is somewhat anachronistic in
this day and age,'' Moss said. ``In a world that is increasingly
visual, it is a nonvisual activity.''
</P>
<P>
   Moss said she had also devoted considerable energy to building
up Lincoln Center's educational programs, like pre-concert lectures
and post-performance discussions, working to generate publicity
around events to get the word out to nontraditional audiences and
commissioning new work to attract artists who have not been staples
of Lincoln Center.
</P>
<P>
   Through the New Visions series, which started in 1998, the stage
director Peter Sellars created theatrical versions of Bach cantatas
performed by the mezzo-soprano Lorraine Hunt and the Orchestra of
the Age of Enlightenment from London. The choreographer Bill T.
Jones, in collaboration with the soprano Jessye Norman, offered an
original work, ``How! Do! We! Do!''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about replacing, but about adding and expanding,''
Moss said. ``It's exciting to see people discovering this music for
the first time.''
</P>
<P>
   Planning the festival, which runs through July 30, is the job of
Redden, who has been its director since 1998. ``I wanted the
festival to be an ambitious event that would stretch the limits,''
said Redden, who also directs the Spoleto Festival USA in
Charleston, S.C.
</P>
<P>
   A man who relishes the details, Redden was excited about the
7,000 gallons of water that will flood the stage of the New York
State Theater when the United States premiere of the Netherlands
Opera's ``Writing to Vermeer'' opens the festival Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to bringing work of an international scope to New
York, Redden said he was trying to feature culture that was already
in the city but on a bigger platform; thus this season's series on
Caribbean music, including reggae, voodoo, calypso and Creole.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is where Lincoln Center has put itself most on the
line,'' he said. ``It's not high-comfort programming all of the
time.''

GOP SEEKS TO MODERATE DISSENSION DURING CONVENTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The official them of this year's Republican
National Convention is ``Renewing America's Purpose. Together.''
But the unofficial message could be: ``Lessons George W. Bush
learned from his father's 1992 convention.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday, the Texas governor unveiled a convention plan that seeks
to avoid any repeat of the way his father was hurt by party
infighting in Houston. The plan relies on quelling public
dissension at the podium and presenting the Republican nominee in a
relatively moderate light when the Philadelphia gathering begins on
July 31.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ours will be a different kind of convention for a different
kind of Republican,'' convention co-chairman Andrew Card said in a
telephone conference call Monday. ``We will be talking about issues
like education and Social Security, which have not been center
stage at Republican conventions before.''
</P>
<P>
   Eight years ago, then-President Bush's reelection hopes suffered
a major blow when he allowed some of his most bitter opponents,
including conservative commentator Patrick J. Buchanan, to dominate
the news at the Houston convention. Buchanan, whose allies already
had helped put tough antiabortion language in the party platform,
declared that a ``religious war'' was sweeping the country. Many
commentators said Bush spent too much time at the convention
appealing to conservatives and not focusing on wavering moderates.
</P>
<P>
   If things go as planned, this year's convention speakers will
not be focusing on differences among the delegates about issues
such as abortion, which traditionally divides Republican
gatherings.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's chief rival for the nomination, Senator John McCain of
Arizona, will be given a prominent speaking slot, but he is
expected to gloss over or ignore his disagreements with Bush, at
least at the podium. McCain, a former Vietnam prisoner of war, will
talk about the achievements of veterans and ``the greatest
generation.'' Bush aides said they do not expect McCain to mention
areas of disagreement, such as McCain's support for campaign
finance legislation or his criticism of Bush's tax-cut plan.
</P>
<P>
   A McCain aide said the senator hasn't been barred from talking
about tax cuts or campaign finance on the podium, but said it was
much more likely that McCain would bring up the subjects at
numerous events outside the convention.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, two other outspoken Bush rivals who focused
significantly on antiabortion matters, Alan Keyes and Gary Bauer,
have not yet been promised speaking slots.
</P>
<P>
   Card said the convention will be ``unconventional'' and much
more exciting than in the recent past, when the events received
dismal television ratings and were widely viewed as a four-day
advertisement for the respective parties. But the changes Card
announced Monday may appear to be nuanced differences to most of
the public.
</P>
<P>
   Card, for example, said the vice presidential candidate would
give his acceptance speech on Wednesday instead of Thursday. He
said the convention stage will be less like a castle and more like
a regular stage. And Card vowed there will not be a night devoted
to ``whacking'' the Democrats, but the former Massachusetts
legislator said that would not stop individual speakers from
``comparing and contrasting'' Republican and Democratic candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The real news could come before the convention begins. There has
been considerable speculation that Bush might announce his vice
presidential pick just before the July 31-Aug. 3 convention.
</P>
<P>
   As Card described the convention, it sounded strikingly similar
to the campaign speeches Bush has made for months, with a heavy
emphasis on actions ``with a purpose.'' Here is an outline of the
convention schedule:
</P>
<P>
   -- Monday, July 31. The night's message is ``Opportunity with a
Purpose: Leave No Child Behind.'' The speakers include Bush's wife,
Laura Bush, and former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Colin
Powell.
</P>
<P>
   -- Tuesday, Aug. 1. The message is ``Strength and Security with
a Purpose: Safe in our Homes and in the World.'' The speakers
include McCain, former GOP presidential candidate Elizabeth Dole
and Bush national security adviser Condoleezza Rice. The night will
also feature a tribute to former Republican presidents, but none is
scheduled to speak. Former President Bush will be at the convention
but has decided not to take a speaking slot.
</P>
<P>
   -- Wednesday, Aug. 2. The message is ``Prosperity with a
Purpose: Keeping America Prosperous and Protecting Retirement
Security.'' The main speaker will be the vice presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   -- Thursday, Aug. 3. Bush will give his acceptance speech on a
day when the message is ``President with a Purpose: A strong leader
who can unite our country and get things done.''

TRADE COMMISSION SUING TOYSMART FOR TRYING TO SELL WEB CUSTOMER
DATABASE 
</HEADLINE>
   By MATT RICHTEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The federal government on Monday sued to prevent Toysmart.com, a
bankrupt Internet toy retailer, from selling its database of
customer information, asserting the company had assured hundreds of
thousands of online visitors their personal data would never be
shared with a third party.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Federal Trade Commission said Toysmart.com, in
trying to sell the database among the defunct company's assets, has
compromised not just names, addresses and shopping preferences of
online toy shoppers, but potentially also family profile
information, including names and ages of children. Toysmart, which
is majority-owned by the Walt Disney Co., ceased operations in May
and began soliciting bids for its assets.
</P>
<P>
   The suit has added fuel to an already fiery debate over online
privacy, and about whether Internet retailers should be subject to
government regulation limiting how they handle and protect customer
information. Internet retailers assert they can regulate themselves
by disclosing on their sites whether and how they might use
customer data accrued when visitors join sites or make purchases.
</P>
<P>
   But in the last week, before the FTC acted, privacy advocates
said the Toysmart case represented a nightmare scenario. The
privacy advocates and FTC officials say that online companies that
amass large and potentially valuable customer databases might have
little incentive to adhere to privacy assurances once they go out
of business, in case they are bought or merge with other
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a shakeout of dot-com companies occur, they can't sell out
customer lists they promised to protect like they do other assets,
like paper clips or computer equipment,'' said David Medine,
associate director of Financial Practices for the FTC, the division
that filed the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from Boston-based Toysmart, could not be reached for
comment. The company's bankruptcy lawyer, Harry Murphy, said the
two sides are in settlement discussions and he said he is ``very
hopeful'' a settlement will be reached. Officials from Disney,
which owned a majority of Toysmart and hold three of five board
seats, released a statement, saying they ``favor an outcome that
honors the commitments contained in the Toysmart privacy policy,''
but they declined to be specific about whether that might preclude
the sale of the information.
</P>
<P>
   Medine also said he is optimistic the two sides can reach an
agreement. Parties close to the negotiations said that a settlement
might permit Toysmart to sell the customer database, but only in
the event that the buyer essentially took over the Toysmart
business as a whole and continued to use it as part of a similar
online toy retailer.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there are appropriate protections, there could be room for
transferring the list as part of the overall company,'' Medine
said.
</P>
<P>
   That might not be the case under a law proposed on Monday. Rep.
Spencer Bachus, R-Ala., introduced legislation on Monday that would
make it an unfair business practice subject to civil penalties, if
an online business promises it will not divulge customer
information, then seeks to sell it, including in the case of merger
or bankruptcy, Bachus said.
</P>
<P>
   Toysmart announced on May 22 that it was closing and selling its
assets. The decision came despite the fact that the company was
ranked among the 24th most visited sites in December, with 1.4
million visitors according to Web site traffic monitor Media
Metrix, FTC officials said.
</P>
<P>
   On June 8, the company advertised in The Wall Street Journal
offering for sale both tangible and intangible assets, including
``databases and customer lists.'' A day later, the company filed
for bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   On June 29, the advertisement came to the attention of Truste, a
nonprofit agency that certifies the privacy policy of online
retailers. Toysmart was among roughly 2,000 sites, including major
online search engines, that have received Truste's seal of
approval.
</P>
<P>
   David Steer, spokesman for Truste, said Toysmart's move to sell
information was in violation of the company's Web customer privacy
policy, which states that ``Personal information, voluntarily
submitted by visitors to our site, such as name, address, billing
information and shopping preferences, is never shared with a third
party.'' The notice continues, ``you can rest assured that your
information will never be shared with a third party.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're hiding under a veil of bankruptcy to hoodwink their
customers,'' Steer said.
</P>
<P>
   Steer said he asked the FTC to look into the company, along with
other Internet companies that he had heard also may be planning to
sell customer databases.
</P>
<P>
   Steer and other privacy advocates said the recent failures of
Internet companies puts newfound urgency into the debate over how
companies handle customer information. ``Given the current state of
the e-commerce industry, we are likely to see this happen again and
again as companies try to sell assets to stay afloat,'' he said.

NEW CONSECO CHIEF RECEIVED $45 MILLION IN CASH UP FRONT 
</HEADLINE>
   By FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gary C. Wendt took the cash up front when he agreed to become
chairman and chief executive of Conseco Inc., the company disclosed
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Conseco, the troubled insurance and financial services company,
said that it paid Wendt a signing bonus of $45 million when he
joined the company last month. He was also given 3.2 million shares
of stock, now worth $31.2 million, as well as options to buy 10
million more shares.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, he is getting a significant sum of money up front,''
said Kathy Shanley, a fixed-income analyst with Gimme Credit, an
institutional research firm. ``He's not taking any risk by taking
this assignment.''
</P>
<P>
   Wendt, the former chief executive of GE Capital Corp., will not
get a salary for the first two years he runs Conseco, but he will
get a bonus of no less than $8 million, and as much as $50 million,
at the end of the two-year period, depending on how high the stock
price is.
</P>
<P>
   Wendt, 58, gained a wide following at GE, but he faces very
different challenges at Conseco, whose bonds are rated as
speculative, or below investment grade, and whose insurance
operations have a relatively low rating as well. At GE, he
benefited from that company's top-notch credit rating, which meant
it could usually raise capital at a lower cost than competitors had
to pay.
</P>
<P>
   Conseco pays substantially higher costs, which is one reason the
company has said it needs to sell its Conseco Finance subsidiary.
Buyers have not been willing to pay Conseco's asking price,
however, leading to speculation that Wendt may decide to keep the
operation.
</P>
<P>
   Conseco was once a highflying stock, but since the spring of
1998 it has fallen from a high of $58.125 to a low of $4.50 in May.
The stock price was at $5.875 on June 20, 10 days before Wendt's
hiring was announced, and that will be the exercise price for the
options he is being issued. Monday, in trading before the pay
package was announced, Conseco shares were unchanged at $9.75.
</P>
<P>
   Wendt will get the maximum bonus of $50 million in two years
even if he does not come close to restoring Conseco's stock price
to its former glory. The top amount will be paid if the stock price
averages $20 a share _ less than 35 percent of the stock's previous
high _ over a period prior to the end of the two years. The minimum
bonus of $8 million will be paid if the share price is under $10,
with payments between those figures if the stock price is higher
than $10 but less than $20.
</P>
<P>
   Wendt was hired after the company's board ousted Steven Hilbert,
the founder of the company, who received $53 million when he
departed in April. Hilbert remains deeply in debt on
company-guaranteed loans that he took out to buy shares at prices
far above the current level.
</P>
<P>
   Wendt's employment contract covers five years, with the final
three years calling for an annual salary of $1 million, a bonus of
up to $2.8 million, a grant of shares worth $1.5 million at the
time and annual grants of options to buy 500,000 shares of stock.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the employment agreement provides for some smaller
benefits for Wendt. The company, based in Carmel, Ind., will pay
all travel costs for the executive and his family for up to a year,
until they move to Indiana. It will also reimburse him for up to
$10,000 a year to cover any medical expenses not covered by the
company's health plan, pay him an automobile allowance of $600 a
month plus the cost of gasoline, and pay up to $125,000 a year for
the cost of Wendt's life insurance.
</P>
<P>
   General Electric agreed to release Wendt from a non-compete
agreement in return for a warrant allowing it to buy 10.5 million
shares of Conseco at a price of $5.75 a share at any time through
June 28, 2005.

by the Rosen family for more than 50 years at the corner of
Flatbush and DeKalb avenues _ that I began to realize what a
melting pot New York's most populous borough is. In Brooklyn,
habitat of Hassids and homeboys, matzah ball soup is served side by
side with collard greens and salmon croquettes. Over a recent long
weekend, I didn't have nearly enough time to eat my way around this
ethnic-food lover's paradise. But I did hopscotch around
sufficiently to see why it's New York's new ground zero of cool,
why trendies from ``The City'' are subwaying over to check out the
clubs and restaurants, the museums and green spaces, the Gothic
architecture and Gotham views. From the BAM Opera House to swanky
Brooklyn Heights to the bombed-out environs of Williamsburg,
Brooklyn is a world unto itself.

SIX CHARACTERS AND A COMPOSER FOUND IN NEW JERSEY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.J.)   By ANTHONY TOMMASINI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRINCETON, N.J. _ Long before the American composer Hugo
Weisgall died at 84 in 1997, he was regarded by many musicians and
critics as a major figure in 20th-century opera. General audiences
have been slower to catch on. Although Weisgall's operas are the
products of a skilled dramatist, his musical language, steeped in
fitful Expressionism and spiked with elements of 12-tone writing,
is craggy and challenging.
</P>
<P>
   The composer and his supporters were heartened when his 10th
opera, ``Esther,'' was ecstatically received at its premiere in
1993 as part of the 50th-anniversary celebrations of the New York
City Opera. Now the Opera Festival of New Jersey has revived
Weisgall's ``Six Characters in Search of an Author,'' based on the
play by Pirandello. The enthusiastic response to the opening
performance at the McCarter Theater at Princeton University should
encourage Weisgall's champions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Six Characters,'' commissioned by the Alice Ditson Fund at
Columbia University in the mid-1950s, was given its premiere at the
New York City Opera in 1958 and repeated successfully the following
season. Then, inexplicably, it languished unproduced until 1990,
when the resident training company of the Lyric Opera of Chicago
presented an acclaimed performance, later released on Pirandello's
remarkable 1921 play shatters the boundaries between illusion and
reality by boldly manipulating the play-within-a-play convention. A
company of actors is rehearsing ``Mixing It Up,'' a new play that
none of them like, by this pretentious modern playwright named
Pirandello. As they work, six strangers walk onstage from out of
nowhere: a father, a mother in mourning dress, a surly adult son, a
volatile stepdaughter and two silent, sullen young children. They
are, they say, characters from a play left unfinished by its author
and are searching for someone to complete their story. In creating
an operatic version of Pirandello's play, Weisgall and his
librettist, Denis Johnston, an Irish playwright, turned the actors
into singers who were rehearsing an overly complex new opera, ``The
Temptation of St. Anthony,'' by Hugo Weisgall. The six strangers
are characters from an incomplete opera. While generally adhering
to the events of the original, the librettist wisely cut, altered
and rewrote the material to produce an effective libretto.
</P>
<P>
   Weisgall's score is brilliant and haunting. Born in Bohemia, the
son of a cantor, he immigrated as a child to the United States,
where he received his musical education. Yet his works are imbued
with Central European Expressionism. Weisgall ably fashioned the
pungent atonal and thickly chromatic elements of his harmonic
language into music of gritty power and affecting lyricism. Though
not conventionally tuneful, the score is richly melodic.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in Act I the stepdaughter, to audition for the
director, sings a melancholy soliloquy about her life. It's a
mystery why this ravishing solo has not achieved independent life
as a recital work. The soprano Michaela Gurevich sang it here with
dusky sound and sensitivity, though her diction was not always
clear. If you can't understand the words in a Weisgall opera, it's
not the composer's fault, for his skills at prosody were
first-rate.
</P>
<P>
   In general, the production was admirable. The bare look of the
rehearsal stage, by the set designer Ron Kadri, and the 1950s-style
costumes, by Patricia Hibbert, created the right effect.
</P>
<P>
   Only one aspect of the director Albert Takazauckas' work seemed
miscalculated. Though there is bleak humor in Pirandello's ``Six
Characters,'' which the author subtitled ``A Comedy in the
Making,'' the opera does not quite capture it. The opera singers
are comic stereotypes, like the Coloratura (here sung by Alicia
Berneche), a diva with a thick German accent and a little dog named
Toto that she carries in a straw handbag.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, Takazauckas exaggerated the caricatures, turning
the Tenore Buffo (Douglas Perry) and the Basso Cantante (Scott
Altman) into stock figures.
</P>
<P>
   But his handling of the six rootless characters was very
compelling. They were grim, unnerving figures, ageless and bound
forever to their creator's conception.
</P>
<P>
   On opening night the musical performance, conducted by Barbara
Day Turner, was not completely solid. But this was essentially a
strong and sensitive account of the score.
</P>
<P>
   Several singers were standouts. The Accompanist, Kent Smith,
sang with crisp diction and bright sound, and played the difficult
onstage piano part himself. Robert Orth as the Father, Dominic
Inferrera as the Son, and Ryan Allen as the crusty Stage Manager
were all memorable. And it was good to see the veteran
mezzo-soprano Rosalind Elias, 71, make the tormented Mother a
riveting figure.
</P>
<P>
   There will be two more performances, on Sunday and on July 22.
With luck, this revival will prod other companies into presenting
this important work. How about the New York City Opera, where it
received its premiere?

A CALL FOR BIOTECHNOLOGY TO BE USED FOR THE DEVELOPING WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
   By CAROL KAESUK YOON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Against a backdrop of increasing concern over the safety of
genetically modified crops, the National Academy of Sciences took
the unusual step Monday of joining with six foreign academies of
science to urge the increased development and use of biotechnology
crops to solve problems of hunger and poverty in developing
nations.
</P>
<P>
   Describing genetic engineering as an important tool that can
provide more nutritious crops and disease-resistant plants, the
academies called for increased support from governments as well as
industry, including increased research financing for scientists and
the freer use of patented gene technologies by farmers in
developing nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was an attempt to give world science a voice,'' said Dr.
Bruce Alberts, president of the National Academy. He said he
believed the backlash against genetically modified foods in many
developed nations was threatening the use of biotechnology
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy for the United Kingdom and the United States to say
we don't need more food, but this is the voice of the developing
world which has faced a great deal of starvation in the past,''
Alberts said.
</P>
<P>
   The report also called for regulatory systems to be put in place
in every country to monitor health risks from genetically modified
plants and for research into environmental risks, acknowledging the
potential for threats to both food and environmental safety.
</P>
<P>
   The National Academy issued the report with the Royal Society of
London, the Brazilian Academy of Sciences, the Chinese Academy of
Sciences, the Indian National Academy of Sciences, the Mexican
Academy of Sciences and the Third World Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the technology viewed the report as an attempt by
scientists to gain public support for a technology that is becoming
increasingly unpopular.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suspect that many scientists are quite worried that this
technology, which is the star to which they have hitched their
wagon, will lose support,'' said Dr. Jane Rissler, senior scientist
at the Union of Concerned Scientists, an antigenetic-engineering
watchdog group in Washington. ``In fact, it coincides with the
industry's $50 million a year campaign to rally public opinion in
this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Biotechnology supporters also expressed concerns, questioning
the notion that industry should take more responsibility for the
development of crops in the developing world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Biotechnology companies are not in the business of giving away
anything,'' said Dr. Val Giddings of the Biotechnology Industry
Organization, a trade group.
</P>
<P>
   The report notes that the major efforts in genetic engineering
of crops have so far been driven by the biotechnology industry and
have focused on products that benefit the most important buyers of
seed _ farmers in developed nations _ rather than consumers or
subsistence farmers in developing countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador _ Like a testament to life's stubborn
triumph, a rose garden filled with thick, fragrant blossoms rises
at the site where soldiers killed six Jesuit priests at the Jose
Simeon Canas Central American University in 1989. Nearby, a votive
candle flickers in the room where the soldiers then killed a
housekeeper and her daughter, hoping to eliminate any witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   It did not work. One woman saw the crime and helped build a case
against the gunmen. More important, more than a decade since the
killings, tens of thousands of people from around the world have
sought out the Jesuit residence's tiny garden to bear their own
witness to the faith of eight people they consider martyrs who
defended the poor during this country's civil war.
</P>
<P>
   Invariably, these pilgrims also trek across town to the chapel
at the Divine Providence Hospital where Archbishop Oscar Arnulfo
Romero, a vocal opponent of the elite and the violent, was shot
dead while celebrating Mass.
</P>
<P>
   They walk through his modest three-room house, where his
bloodied vestments hang in the closet and his bedroom calendar is
forever turned to the month he was killed _ March 1980. Others go
to the countryside to visit the spot where four American
churchwomen were also killed by soldiers in December of that year.
</P>
<P>
   Centuries ago, Spanish conquistadors came here for glory, gold
and God. Now many visitors come to this nation whose name means the
Savior searching for a more elusive treasure along modern-day
Stations of the Cross. They come to conquer their own spiritual
doubts, looking for lessons from priests, nuns and laity whose
embrace of liberation theology's blend of religion and social
activism exacted such a brutal price.
</P>
<P>
   One recent afternoon, the shuffling steps of a dozen Americans
from the University of Scranton blended in with the everyday sounds
of barking dogs, tinny music and food sizzling in the kitchen of
the Jesuit residence.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, the visitors encircled the garden, where the Rev.
Brendan Lally, the Roman Catholic priest leading the group, quietly
knelt in prayer. Afterward, he plucked a tiny sprig of clover and,
as though it were a relic, tucked it into his pocket.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a sacred place where people gave their lives for
Christ and the Gospel,'' Lally said, ``and their deaths make this a
holy place and an eternal symbol of the work for justice. This is a
faith journey. But it is also an attempt to help us as Catholics
understand more deeply our mission by coming to listen deeply to
the experiences of our brothers in El Salvador and the stories of
the people of El Salvador.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a heartening sight to the Rev. Dean Brackley, a American
theologian who came to El Salvador to replace his fallen Jesuit
brothers at the Central American University. He sees it as a
resurrection of sorts, one that is reflected in the experiences of
the dozens of delegations he ushers through here each year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This place, we export more hope than coffee,'' he said. ``With
all the violence, we still export hope. That is why people still
come.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet as strong as the attraction is for visiting delegations, the
religious movement that attracts them has lost ground here. The
popular church, formed of communities that grounded their political
and social activism for the poor in Scripture, was once virtually
the only nonviolent voice speaking out against the government
during the war. Now it competes to be heard.
</P>
<P>
   The killings of the Jesuits and the two women drew international
scorn for the government and helped to propel the peace effort that
ended the war. But the popularity and influence of the grass-roots
church has since waned.
</P>
<P>
   Former guerrilla leaders now speak freely and have entered
elective politics, evangelical Protestants have recruited thousands
of Salvadorans wary of an activist Catholic clergy and skeptical of
political engagement, and a conservative Catholic hierarchy looks
at adherents of liberation theology as sick brethren in need of
more orthodox spiritual healing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hierarchy represents a line of thinking that does not look
for repercussions or any social or political change,'' said the
Rev. Rafael de Sivatte, chairman of Central American University's
theology department. ``It represents a religion that only deals
with personal change and repentance of sins. It is an internal
religion that looks at the individual with a spirituality that is
very much in the air without reference to reality.''
</P>
<P>
   The church's challenge in peace, he said, is to find the unity
that was forged and tested to the breaking point during the civil
war from 1979 to 1992. Although the conflict has ended, he said,
many Salvadorans still lack jobs, housing and medical care.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to be even firmer than before,'' he said. ``People
have lost their aspirations and are happy with small economic
advances. We have to tell people not to be content with any little
thing. People say if they are working and have a little money, why
should they struggle for others to work? That was a great value we
had in the war. But it is being lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Enough of the popular movement remains in parishes like San
Bartolo in the town of Ilopango, where teachers from the Central
American University offer theology classes to the congregation. The
students, mostly working adults, take part in discussions of social
justice, grounded in the Bible.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to read the newspaper, too, if you read Scripture,''
said Felipe Miando, a truck driver who recently enrolled in the
class. ``We went through a war.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Bible, the Israelites were subjected to the Roman
Empire,'' he said. ``We were subjected to the empire of the United
States and the rich of El Salvador.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The movement for a more socially relevant religion has also been
buoyed in recent months by the huge crowds that came to San
Salvador to mark the 20th anniversary of Archbishop Romero's
assassination, as well as to commemorate the killings at the
university. Their visits are familiar to Sister Rosa Avalos, who
tends to the chapel where Romero was killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes they come here right from the airport,'' she said.
``They want to know where a prophet, saint and martyr lived.
Sometimes they come to thank God after asking Bishop Romero's
intercession in everything from health, work or some difficulty
they have. Their only recourse is to ask God through him.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside the archbishop's former home, beside a mural of him
smiling by the shore of a lake, dozens of stones are embedded in a
wall, each one thanking the archbishop for answered prayers. But
there are more everyday miracles to be found among the pilgrims who
come here.
</P>
<P>
   For them, the survival of the popular church has been imbued
with a deep meaning that can be personal, political or both. They
go to parishes in poor communities where people share their many
stories and limited food with them. They stand in silence at the
relics of the Jesuit martyrs, including a book whose blood-stained
cover reads ``The Crucified God.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What I want to bring back to Pennsylvania with me is this
spirit of community,'' said Sean Farry, a college administrator who
was making his second trip to El Salvador. ``Here titles are
dropped and you get to know the Salvadoran people. What I find
about them is their spirituality. It strikes me as being part of
their everyday lives and how they rely on their faith. When there
is nothing else to depend on, they can't depend on the government
to help them. They have to turn to God.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Rowland stood inside the university's museum, which is
dedicated to the slain clergy and laity, shaking her head as she
looked at the threadbare clothes, now darkened with blood, that the
Jesuits were wearing when they were shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goodness,'' she whispered. ``They took the time to get
dressed. Good for them.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she had to come here. ``Hopefully, this will make me
more sensitive to other people,'' she said. ``I want to trust
people in a straightforward way. I know I fail miserably in that.''
</P>
<P>
   She looked at a case where tiny jars were filled with soil from
where the priests died.
</P>
<P>
   ``This should never happen again.'' She said. ``But it will.''

 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: I want to build some large plywood ``blocks'' or boxes that
my young son can play with, similar to the kind I've seen him
playing with at nursery school.
 &HT;    These ``blocks'' are hollow cubes about 12 to 15 inches on each
side and light enough to be moved and even stacked up like large
`building blocks,' much like children's small building blocks. When
turned over they can also be used to store small toys or stuffed
animals.
 &HT;    They are apparently made of wood and painted in bright colors,
so I thought of making them of plywood. But in order to make them
sturdy enough for my son to sit or even stand on, I would have to
use plywood at least 1/2 to 3/4 inch thick _ which would make them
too heavy for a youngster to handle.
 &HT;    Any ideas you can offer?
 &HT;    A: Build a framework of lightweight bass wood or balsa wood
first, then cover the outside with thin sheets of 1/4 inch or 1/8
inch plywood. This should be strong enough for your purposes, yet
light enough for a youngster to lift or move around.
 &HT;    Make sure all edges and corners are sanded smooth and rounded
off, and it's also a good idea to cover all these corners with a
self-adhesive tape of some kind.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: After changing a number of hot-water-faucet washers in our
house we notice that when we turn on these faucets to a full flow
the stream gradually lessens to a small trickle.
 &HT;    What can cause this?
 &HT;    A: Some types of faucet washers are made for use only on cold
water faucets and some for hot. If you install the wrong type on
the hot water faucets _ as you apparently did _ the heat from the
water can cause the washer to swell, thus restricting the flow of
water.
 &HT;    Your solution lies in replacing those washers with the proper
type _ the kind made for use on a hot-water faucet.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: My house has wood framed windows that were varnished when the
house was built.
 &HT;    Now there are dark stains on the finish in some places,
apparently due to moisture dripping off the glass during cold
weather.
 &HT;    I am worried about this affecting the wood, so is there anything
I should do to protect it?
 &HT;    A: Water stains such as you describe may be only in the varnish,
not in the wood itself, but it depends on how old the stains are as
well as on the type of wood.
 &HT;    It's possible you can get rid of the stains by removing the old
finish, then revarnishing with two or three coats of a good
waterproof varnish.
 &HT;    However, to prevent this happening again you should do something
about the condensation problem _ perhaps by installing storm sash
on the outside of each window, or possibly by lowering the humidity
inside the house during cold weather.
 &HT;    Also, make sure the bathrooms and kitchen have exhaust fans that
are turned on when those rooms are in use.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Our Formica kitchen counters are almost 20 years old and are
now quite dull looking. Can I apply several coats of a clear
polyurethane over this plastic laminate to restore the luster, or
is there any other method you can suggest?
 &HT;    A: Coating with a clear polyurethane is possible, but I would
not recommend it. It will change the color by giving it a more
amber cast, and the plastic will have to be sanded down and cleaned
thoroughly first. In addition, it will have to be re-coated
regularly.
 &HT;    You may be better off trying one of the special polishes that
are sold for this purpose in many hardware stores and home centers.

GOP HAS NOT `ALWAYS CARRIED THE MANTLE OF LINCOLN,' BUSH TELLS

 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ Gov. George W. Bush told the nation's largest civil
rights organization Monday that ``the party of Lincoln has not
always carried the mantle of Lincoln'' and he pledged that ``strong
civil rights enforcement will be a cornerstone of my
administration.''
</P>
<P>
   In his latest bid to show that he is a different kind of
Republican, the Texas governor quoted Abraham Lincoln's warning to
a divided nation that ``we cannot escape our history.'' He added,
``One hundred and forty years later, that is still true. For our
nation there is no denying the truth that slavery is a blight on
our history. And that racism, despite all the progress, still
exists today.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, to a large extent, simply retailored his standard stump
speech for the thousands of delegates to the annual convention of
the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, and
he won a polite reception. He did not cover an array of topics of
interest to the delegates, including the death penalty, Supreme
Court nominees and affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   But his appearance provided a contrast with four years ago when
Bob Dole, the Republican nominee, refused an invitation to speak to
the group and accused its president, Kweisi Mfume, of ``trying to
set me up.'' Dole said he would look for audiences that ``I can
relate to.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as Bush was about to be introduced Monday, four
demonstrators rose in the vast Baltimore Convention Center and
began protesting the execution in Texas last month of Gary Graham.
``Remember Grady Graham,'' they shouted. ``An innocent man was
murdered by Governor Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank Humphrey, the presiding officer, ordered the protesters
removed as hymns were played. ``This is our house and we are in
charge here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Graham, the 135th inmate to be executed in Texas since Bush
became governor, went to death proclaiming his innocence. The NAACP
has called his execution a ``gross travesty of justice'' and wants
a national moratorium on all executions.
</P>
<P>
   When he began speaking, Bush quickly drew laughter by
remembering how Jackie Robinson, upset by something John F. Kennedy
once did, called the president a fine man but said he reserved the
right to change his opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``For those of you who support me,'' Bush said, ``I see a couple
here, maybe more than a couple: I hope you won't change your
opinion. And for those of you who don't, I hope that at least you
take Jackie's opinion as your own and give me chance to tell you
what is in my heart.''
</P>
<P>
   He made implicit reference to Dole and drew another round of
applause when he said, ``I recognize the history of the Republican
Party and the NAACP has not been one of regular partnership. But
our nation is harmed when we let our differences separate us and
divide us. So while some in my party have avoided the NAACP and
while some in the NAACP have avoided my party, I'm proud to be
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Black Americans represent one of the Democratic Party's
strongest constituencies and those Republicans who have appeared
before the NAACP have not had an easy time. Bush's father, who was
then the vice president, faced a chorus of boos and hisses in 1983
when he tried to portray the Reagan administration as sensitive to
blacks.
</P>
<P>
   A year later both Bush's father and Ronald Reagan cited
scheduling conflicts in declining invitations to the convention and
sent Elizabeth Dole, then the secretary of transportation. She was
received politely but not enthusiastically. But Bush's father did
speak to the group as a presidential candidate in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's reception was polite, but he did not appear to
have changed many minds. After his speech many listeners complained
about his lack of specificity and said his appearance was about
symbolism more than substance. ``He's speaking to a moderate
element of the Republican Party more than he's talking to us,''
said Thomas L. Jackson, a retired police officer from Ohio. ``What
is compassionate conservatism? What is it? The things he outlined
are pretty vague.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Bledsoe, the president of the Texas branch of the civil
rights organization, said of Bush, ``He reduced some barriers
today, but I don't think he won any support.'' He praised the
governor's tone and self-deprecation but said ``people were crying
out for specifics and substance.''
</P>
<P>
   Eleanor Holmes Norton, the nonvoting House member from the
District of Columbia and a Democrat, said: ``It is too late in
American history for us to give any candidate points for showing
up. You have to show up with something.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush spoke of expanding opportunity in American and said ``this
begins by enforcing the civil rights laws.''
</P>
<P>
   He said, ``Discrimination is still a reality even when it takes
different forms. Instead of Jim Crow, there's racial redlining and
profiling. Instead of `separate but equal,' there's separate and
forgotten. Strong civil rights enforcement will be cornerstone of
my administration.'' He did not explain this idea any further.
</P>
<P>
   Bush put his usual emphasis on education and on ending what he
calls ``the soft bigotry of low expectations'' for minority
children. He promoted his plan to give parents in low income areas
vouchers that they could use for private schools if their children
attend poor schools that fail to improve.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor said he wanted his party and the NAACP to
find some common ground. ``This will not be easy work,'' he said.
``But a philosopher once advised when given a choice, prefer the
hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has campaigned often in black and Hispanic neighborhoods,
to underscore his theme that he is a ``compassionate
conservative.'' And his campaign media strategist was on hand
Monday to film the governor's speech to the civil rights group for
possible use in future commercials.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush still has significant differences with the NAACP, and
not just over the death penalty. The group has been leading a
boycott of South Carolina over the confederate flag. During the
Republican primary in South Carolina, Bush declined to take a stand
on whether the Confederate flag should fly over the state Capitol.
He also campaigned at Bob Jones University, which had a ban on
interracial dating.
</P>
<P>
   As a tax-exempt group, the NAACP cannot endorse a presidential
candidate. But Sunday evening, the group's leaders urged members to
mount an ambitious voter registration drive. Julian Bond, the
group's chairman, argued that one more conservative vote on the
Supreme Court could bring a setback for civil rights causes.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Ralph Nader, the Green Party's presidential nominee,
are also scheduled to speak at the NAACP convention.
</P>
<P>
   After his speech Bush went to a $2 million fund-raiser at the
Virginia home of Fred Malek, a longtime Republican backer.

NEW CONSERVATIVE LEADER A REMINDER OF TRUDEAU'S ASCENT 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES BROOKE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CALGARY, Alberta _ Stockwell Day, the new leader of Canada's
opposition going into elections expected next spring, offers a
conservative face rarely associated with Canadian politicians:
support for a flat income tax, tougher sentencing for criminals and
beefed up military spending.
</P>
<P>
   But his sudden sweep to national prominence, culminating with
his decisive election Saturday night as leader of the new Canadian
Alliance Party, seems vaguely familiar, leading some commentators
to call him the ``Pierre Trudeau of the Right.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Trudeau, a Liberal prime minister who came to power on the
wings of ``Trudeaumania'' at age 48, Day, 49, comes along at a time
when more and more Canadians say they are weary of an aging prime
minister, in this case Jean Chretien, 66, who first was elected to
Parliament when John F. Kennedy was in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Posing in a sweat-soaked muscle shirt, playing drums with a jazz
quartet in Montreal or maneuvering a kayak, Day projects physical
energy and the promise of a generational turnover. When Liberals
try to paint him as a right-wing extremist, his aides pull out his
wedding photos, complete with long hair and sideburns, snapped near
the time when Day, by his own admission, was smoking marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   The Alliance is the successor to the Reform Party, a
western-based group, and it has been rapidly growing by depleting
the ranks of the Progressive Conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   A former auctioneer and now master of the sound bite, Canada's
new conservative phenomenon has invited Joe Clark, a former prime
minister and leader of the rival Progressive Conservative Party, to
join forces with the Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Day, in his victory address Saturday night, said: ``Joe, I reach
out to you once again with respect and sincerity. You served this
country well, but it is only in that TV series, `Survivor,' that
the last person on the island is the winner.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark has vowed to fight on, even though his party suffers
defections almost daily. Most recently, his lone member of
Parliament from Ontario, Jim Jones, announced that he would run for
re-election as a fusion candidate for both parties.
</P>
<P>
   One Liberal strategist, Warren Kinsella, dismisses Day, who was
formerly treasurer of Alberta, as ``Archie Bunker on
Rollerblades.'' But the ruling party appears nervous about his
emergence as the leader of Canada's right.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although opinion polls suggest Jean Chretien's Liberals are
unbeatable, there is a weariness with the prime minister's
unhurried style that a young, energetic leader might be able to
exploit,'' The Toronto Star, Canada's largest-circulation
newspaper, and a traditional Liberal backer, said in an editorial
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   In a Compas poll released Saturday by the National Post, a
conservative newspaper that backs Day, the gap between the Alliance
and the Liberals had been narrowed greatly, with the Liberals
winning 44 percent of voter preferences and the Alliance 25
percent.
</P>
<P>
   In the last election, in 1997, Chretien's Liberals took only 38
percent of the popular vote, but were returned to power because the
conservative vote was split between two parties, delivering almost
all of Ontario's seats to Liberals. Chretien is expected to call an
election next spring, telling a television interviewer two weeks
ago: ``I am not a loser. I love a good fight, and I want to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Turning to the Alliance's proposal to lower Canada's federal
income tax to 17 percent across the board, from a top rate of 29
percent, the prime minister told Canada's parliamentary television
network: ``I think there is more to life than money. There is the
quality of life and the extraordinary quality of Canadian
society.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently fearing election losses in Ontario, Canada's
electoral powerhouse, the Liberal government recently announced a
$500 million aid package to Atlantic Canada, the four eastern
provinces where unemployment rates are above the national average.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any dolt can see that the Liberal caucus, unnerved by the
fresh face of Stockwell Day, knows it can never again win 101 of
Ontario's 103 seats, the only thing that keeps the Chretien
government in power,'' Allan Fotheringham, a veteran political
commentator, wrote in Maclean's magazine.
</P>
<P>
   To the dismay of the Liberals, Day's election represents a
resounding defeat of Preston Manning, a leader of Canadian
conservatives since the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   In a dramatic personal gamble, Manning, a 58-year-old veteran
campaigner, resigned as opposition leader this spring and threw
open to all comers the race for the leadership of the Alliance,
after it succeeded the Reform Party. Membership in the Alliance
tripled in three months, hitting 202,000. But the new members voted
heavily for Day, giving him a 63 to 37 percent victory in
Saturday's runoff.
</P>
<P>
   Liberals preferred Manning, an Albertan with a folksy drawl, who
failed twice in the 1990s to win any seats for the Reform Party
east of the prairies.
</P>
<P>
   In defeat, Manning was gracious, referring in his concession
speech to conservatives' dreams of occupying the official residence
of Canada's prime minister: ``Stock, we are all behind you, 200,000
strong, and tonight I join with all our members in giving you the
mandate to knock on the door of 24 Sussex Drive, on behalf of all
Canadians, and to say, `Mr. Chretien, your time is up.'''
</P>
<P>
   Day not only won decisively, but he spread the party's reach
deep into Ontario. In provisional returns from Saturday's voting,
almost 40 percent more votes were cast in Ontario than in Alberta,
the party's birthplace. Unlike Manning, Day speaks passable French
and seems to have the capability of extending his party's reach
into Canada's other electoral storehouse, Quebec, a province where
anti-Ottawa feelings sometimes mesh with western conservatism.
</P>
<P>
   The strong endorsement of Alberta's former treasurer underscores
how this province has set much of Canada's ideological agenda in
recent years, spurring the rest of the nation to follow its example
in balancing budgets, reducing government debt and cutting taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``For almost half a century since Confederation, the interplay
of Ontario and Quebec has dominated our national politics,'' John
Duffy wrote recently in Saturday Night, a Toronto-based magazine.
``Now the west is asserting itself as a full and equal political
partner in the federation.''

IPO FOR EUROPE'S SUPERJUMBO JET MAKER STALLS 
</HEADLINE>
   By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ The European Aeronautic Defense and Space
Co., the new conglomerate that controls Airbus Industrie, received
a chilly response from investors Monday when it launched a
long-awaited initial stock offering.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of the company, known as EADS, had already been
discounted by underwriters on Sunday as a result of
lower-than-expected demand. On Monday, shares dropped more than 9
percent from an opening price of 19 euros, or $18.14, to 17.25
euros after the first day of trading on the Frankfurt, Paris and
Madrid exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   The response was a sharp contrast to the high investor appetite
for a slew of other big initial stock offerings from European
companies, such as those by Infineon AG, the computer chip
manufacturer spun off by Siemens AG, and T-Online, the internet
subsidiary of Deutsche Telekom.
</P>
<P>
   Those, and other major offerings, were heavily oversubscribed _
Infineon by 30 times the number of shares offered _ and jumped up
significantly from their opening price after trading began.
</P>
<P>
   Though hardly devastating for EADS, the lack of enthusiasm
inevitably cast a pall over the company's flagship project: its $12
billion plan to build a superjumbo jet, the A3XX, intended to
supersede the Boeing 747.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the nearly $3 billion raised by Monday's initial stock
offering will be pumped into the A3XX, a flying mammoth with enough
room for 550 seats and amenities like a restaurant, bedrooms or
children's play area.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the original goal of EADS to raise 3.5 billion euros,
about $3.3 billion, analysts had predicted the shares would be
offered at 22-24 euros each. But underwriters dropped their
estimate to about 20 euros by the end of last week, and on Sunday
settled on an even lower price: 19 euros for institutional
investors and 18 for individual investors.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the lower offering price, shares still sank when trading
began Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts said the feeble reception had less to do with
worries about the A3XX or with EADS itself than with concerns about
a cyclical downturn in the civilian aircraft industry.
</P>
<P>
   Both Airbus and Boeing have enjoyed big surges in orders in the
last few years, and Airbus has climbed from distant second to
virtually tied with Boeing in new orders.
</P>
<P>
   The fear is that the pace of orders will inevitably taper off
from current levels, and investors do not want to buy up shares if
the industry is about to enter a more sluggish period.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, we are much nearer the top of the cycle than the
bottom, and this is a deeply cyclical industry,'' said Nick
Cunningham, an aerospace analyst at Schroder Salomon Smith Barney
in London. ``There has to be a correction. The real issue is how
deep of a correction and what the effects will be on the different
players.''
</P>
<P>
   Other analysts said investors remain worried about EADS's
complex ownership, which includes a careful balance between French
and German ``co-chairmen'' and an awkward relationship with British
Aerospace, which is not part of EADS, but still owns 20 percent of
Airbus.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the complexity, the French government continues to own
a 20 percent stake in EADS. That has raised concerns among some
experts that the company could still fall victim to politicized
decision-making.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a difficult company _ difficult to manage and difficult
to squeeze out synergies,'' said Klaus Martini, head of European
equities at DWS, the big mutual fund arm of Deutsche Bank AG. ``You
have to deal with a lot of different parties with a lot of
different interests.''
</P>
<P>
   Risks associated with the A3XX have also played into the
worries.
</P>
<P>
   After years of study, Airbus executives announced two weeks ago
that they would proceed with plans to build the new jumbo jet.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing, by contast, has argued for years that there is little
real demand for a new class of jumbo jet. Boeing now seems to be
hedging its bets with plans to develop a stretched version of the
747. Though it is unlikely to be as efficient or innovative as the
A3XX, the stretch-747 would be far cheaper to develop.
</P>
<P>
   Philippe Camus, one of EADS's two co-chief executives, responded
stoicly to the difficulties that confronted Monday's public
offering.
</P>
<P>
   ``You must be humble with the market,'' Camus said in Paris.
``The market indicated to us the price which it was ready to pay.
End of story.''

 By KEVIN SACK and JANET ELDER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thirty-five years after the dismantling of legalized
segregation, a majority of Americans maintain that race relations
in the United States are generally good, but blacks and whites
continue to have starkly divergent perceptions of many racial
issues and they remain largely isolated from each other in their
everyday lives, according to a nationwide poll by The New York
Times.
</P>
<P>
   The poll reflects some of the same complex tensions that
surfaced in the Times' six-week examination of contemporary race
relations, ``How Race is Lived in America.'' The series portrayed a
stubbornly enduring racial divide, and the poll suggests that even
as the rawest forms of bigotry have receded they have often been
replaced by remoteness and distrust in places of work, learning and
worship.
</P>
<P>
   The poll detected some signs that both blacks and whites believe
that race relations are improving. The proportion of those surveyed
who said that race relations in the country are generally good _ 57
percent _ is at its highest mark in 10 years, a full 16 percentage
points higher than in 1990. Large majorities of both races _ 63
percent of whites and 79 percent of blacks _ said they approved of
interracial marriage, compared to only 44 percent of whites and 70
percent of blacks who said so in a 1991 poll.
</P>
<P>
   And the percentage who said the country has made real progress
in reducing racial discrimination _ 74 percent, including 78
percent of whites and 58 percent of blacks _ is about 25 percentage
points higher for each group than in May 1992, just after the
deadly rioting that followed the acquittal of four police officers
in the beating of a black California motorist.
</P>
<P>
   But in question after question the poll also revealed a core of
blacks _ about four in 10, many of them college-educated _ who say
they think that race relations in the country are generally bad and
that there has been no real progress in eliminating racial
discrimination since the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   On many questions, particularly those related to whether blacks
are treated equitably and whether race plays too large a role in
the national discourse, blacks and whites seem to be living on
different planets. One of the few areas where blacks and whites are
most in agreement is in their perceptions of racial hostility.
Similar percentages _ 39 percent of whites and 45 percent of blacks
_ said they think that either many or almost all white people
dislike blacks. And 45 percent of whites and the same percentage of
blacks said they think that either many or almost all black people
dislike whites.
</P>
<P>
   Befitting the subject matter, the poll is rife with seeming
contradictions.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, large majorities of both whites and blacks said
that race relations were generally good in their neighborhoods,
where they worked and at their children's schools.
</P>
<P>
   But the numbers dropped when people were asked to characterize
race relations in their communities, and they dropped more
precipitously when they were asked about race relations in the
country. Only 58 percent of whites and 51 percent of blacks said
that race relations in the country were generally good, while 30
percent of whites and 40 percent of blacks said they were generally
bad.
</P>
<P>
   The poll, which was conducted June 21-29, surveyed 1,107 people
who said they are white and 934 who said they are black. It has a
margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points for
each racial group.
</P>
<P>
   To determine the views of the country as a whole, the responses
of blacks were weighted to comprise 11 percent of the total, the
proportion used by the Census bureau. According to the Current
Population Survey, 11 percent of Americans are black, and 89
percent are nonblack.

NORTHERN IRELAND COWERS AS PROTESTANTS PROMISE UNREST 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   ENNISKILLEN, Northern Ireland _ Parts of Northern Ireland came
to a virtual standstill Monday as residents cleared out ahead of
expected protests by the Protestant group the Orange Order.
</P>
<P>
   The Orangemen had vowed to paralyze all of Northern Ireland to
demonstrate their anger over being barred from marching down the
Garvaghy Road in a Catholic neighborhood of Portadown, the most
bitterly divided town in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Businesses closed early, and nearly everyone not taking part in
the protest decided to hunker down in their homes. By 4 p.m.,
Belfast, one of the largest cities in the British isles, was
deserted.
</P>
<P>
   But aside from assorted roadblocks in sections of Belfast, and a
bomb threat in Portadown that paralyzed that town, the disruption
throughout the province was far less than in any of the previous
five years in which the annual standoff in Portadown has fueled
violence throughout Northern Ireland. Police used water cannon to
ward off loyalists who were throwing bricks at them in Portadown.
</P>
<P>
   Senior police officers said that while it was too early to
conclude they had weathered the annual storm of pro-British
loyalist violence, they were encouraged by the relatively small
number of demonstrators who took to the streets Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Orange Order, so named for William of Orange, whose 1690
defeat of Catholic King James II is the main reason they hold some
3,000 parades every year, had asked supporters to flood the streets
between 4 and 8 p.m. Monday, but police said their numbers were far
less than in previous years.
</P>
<P>
   As darkness fell, police said they were coming under attack in
loyalist strongholds, as they have been for the past week. Trucks
were parked across highways, blocking traffic, as demonstrators
wearing orange sashes did not try to hide their allegiance. In
other areas, loyalists used their bodies to block roads.
</P>
<P>
   The violence is expected to peak on Wednesday, which loyalists
call the Glorious 12th, the actual anniversary of King William's
victory over King James at the Battle of the Boyne, which created a
Protestant hegemony in the north of Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   While several Orange parades are prohibited every year, usually
on the grounds that they will cause civil unrest, it is the parade
in Portadown that is the most contentious. Orangemen there are the
most uncompromising of their organization, while the Catholic
nationalist residents in the Garvaghy Road neighborhood refuse to
consent to a parade until the Orangemen sit down and negotiate the
conditions of a march with them.
</P>
<P>
   Orangemen refuse to talk to local residents, but the British
government has made it clear that until the Orangemen agree to talk
to the elected leaders of the Catholic neighborhoood the parade
will be barred. Peter Mandelson, the British secretary of state for
Northern Ireland, said the Orange Order risked ruining its
reputation by continuing to foment violence.
</P>
<P>
   But David Jones, the spokesman for the Portadown lodge of the
Orange Order, insisted that it was the British Parades Commission
which created the problem by barring them from marching their
traditional route down the Garvaghy Road.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said any accompanying violence ``lies at the feet of the
parades commission.'' He said the protests will continue Tuesday,
between 10 a.m and 7 p.m., and will be ``sporadic in nature.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout Northern Ireland, meanwhile, many loyalists who
support the Good Friday Agreement of 1998, which seeks to end the
conflict in Northern Ireland, tried to maintain order. In
particular, members of the Ulster Volunteer Force, the second
largest loyalist paramilitary group, have been out every night the
last week, trying to control violence in their neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Carolyn Howarth, a spokeswoman for the Progressive Unionist
Party, the political wing of the Ulster Volunteer Force, deplored
the violence, saying it was damaging Protestant property and
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't believe that Protestants are hurting each other,''
said Howarth. ``We're playing right into the hands of the
republican agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   In Derry, the car and home of a prominent Protestant activist
was damaged by Protestant extremists. Sadie Logan, a community
liaison with the police, was attacked because she had met with
police in an effort to ensure that protests were peaceful.
</P>
<P>
   ``I come from an Orange family, and I'm ashamed,'' said Logan,
voicing the disgust of most Protestants in Northern Ireland, who
believe the Orangemen in Portadown are bringing their traditions
into disrepute.
</P>
<P>
   Royal Ulster Constabulary Superintendent Ian Hamill, who visited
Logan to comfort her and promise a thorough investigation, said the
attack on her ``had nothing to do with peaceful protest. This was
the work of thugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Here in Enniskillen, one of the more moderate areas of Northern
Ireland, disruption was kept to a minimum, as shops closed earlier
than usual and most people seemed to accept the inconvenience with
good humor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll not complain, going home early,'' said Gary Mulholland,
who got off early from his job at a shoe store. He said he will be
off again Wednesday when Northern Ireland both celebrates and
cowers from the Glorious 12th.

 By CLAIRE POOLE 
 c.2000 Latin Trade 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    HOUSTON _ In 1995, Ivan Utrera was an up-and-coming executive at
PepsiCo. The Sao Paulo native had just finished a three-year
rotation as international marketing director for Pizza Hut, which
included opening 300 fast-food pizza restaurants in Brazil as well
as others around Latin America. He was shifted back to PepsiCo's
Purchase, N.Y., headquarters as director of U.S. marketing for
Pizza Hut, which sees US$1.5 billion in sales annually.
 &HT;    Yet Utrera was frustrated. ``It got really stifling,'' he says.
``If you wanted to do anything, even change the color of the
napkins, you needed two years' worth of research to see if it was
going to impact anything.''
 &HT;    So Utrera chucked it all in 1995 to start Rodizio Grill, a chain
of Brazilian-style steak houses, or churrascarias. He's opened six
restaurants around the country, from Houston, Texas, to Arlington,
Virginia, and employs 500 people. With revenues of $14 million a
year and operating profits somewhere in the 10 percent to 20
percent range, he's now planning to open three more eateries in the
next 12 months (possible sites: Arizona, Texas and Illinois) and
four more the next year.
 &HT;    ``Brazil doesn't do a very good job of marketing. So one of my
goals is to bring a little more knowledge about Brazil into the
U.S.,'' he says. Utrera is just one of many entrepreneurs
capitalizing on the increasing popularity of Latin American cuisine
in the United States. What's generally been dubbed the Nuevo Latino
movement has now branched off into subsegments, with Argentine and
Brazilian restaurants becoming especially popular.
 &HT;    Brazilian bistros are popping up all over the country, from
Churrascaria Plataforma in New York City to Rhumba in Chicago,
Illinois, to Yolie's Brazilian Steak House in Las Vegas, Nevada.
``There is no point in being prudent at a churrascaria: It is a
Rabelaisian experience,'' The New York Times restaurant critic Ruth
Reichl has written. ``And if you are not prepared to throw caution
to the winds, eating more than you have ever eaten before, it is
not the place for you.''
 &HT;    Utrera's version is taking off. His restaurant chain based in
Littleton, Colorado, was recently declared one of six ``Hot
Concept'' winners by Nation's Restaurant News, a trade publication.
``Carnivores, come hither. Welcome to a meat lover's paradise,'''
the magazine suggested as Rodizio Grill's slogan last year.
 &HT;    The 38-year-old Utrera became a restaurateur via a circuitous
path. Born and raised in Sao Paulo of entrepreneurial parents (his
father and mother run Utreplas, which makes plastic components for
GTE phones and Whirlpool washing machines), he earned his
undergraduate degree in communications from Brigham Young
University in Provo, Utah. He worked in advertising for three
years, but returned to Brigham Young's Marriott School of
Management for an MBA.
 &HT;    After business school, Utrera joined Pizza Hut, rising from
marketing manager to director of international marketing for Latin
America and the Caribbean and finally to the top marketing spot for
one of its U.S. operations.
 &HT;    While he was in Brazil, though, he noticed that family-oriented
steak houses from the provinces were growing popular in Sao Paulo.
He also noticed that North Americans who ate at them wished they
had something similar back home. Part of Utrera's extended family
was in the restaurant business in Sao Paulo, so he tapped them for
information on how to set up a churrascaria in the United States.
``I was the only one in my family to follow a corporate career,''
he says. ``It was time to go out on my own.''
 &HT;    It wasn't easy without a giant like PepsiCo behind him. Indeed,
he couldn't sell anyone in the United States on the idea. ``They
didn't understand the concept,'' he says.
 &HT;    Turning to friends, relatives (his mother bought in) and some
Pizza Hut franchisees in Brazil, he scraped together $1 million in
six months. His first restaurant debuted in Denver, Colorado, in
1996.
 &HT;    Why Denver? ``I had used Denver extensively for Pizza Hut as a
test market,'' he explains. ``It didn't have a heavy ethnic
influence, especially Brazilians, and I didn't want that to affect
the results. If we could succeed in Denver, we could succeed
anywhere.''
 &HT;    Rodizio Grill opened to rave reviews from Denver food critics _
including one who recommended Utrera hire industry veteran Scott
Henley as director of operations. (He did.) But the restaurant was
criticized by diners for several oversights, from not offering
mashed potatoes, grilled vegetables and sandwiches to its layout,
which many thought looked too much like a cafeteria.
 &HT;    The feedback did not fall on deaf ears. Utrera has added items
to the menu even though they're not traditional to Brazil. He has
installed half walls and decorative ironwork so his customers feel
more comfortable. Indeed, he still actively solicits customer
suggestions with a review card on every table; on the front is an
old snapshot of his family celebrating his grandmother's birthday.
(Utrera's the big-eyed 3-year-old sitting on a woman's lap near the
front of the shot.) ``Based on that feedback, we've changed and
added a few things to improve customer satisfaction,'' he says.
 &HT;    But the basic concept behind the Brazilian churrascaria is still
there. When you sit down, you're followed by a basket of
appetizers: paozinho, a small roll; pao de queijo, a Brazilian
cheese bread; polenta, or fried corn sticks served with a marinara
sauce; and bananas fritas, or cinnamon-glazed bananas.
 &HT;    After you order from the menu, which is in English and
Portuguese, you head to a self-serve salad bar bursting with
traditional Brazilian salads, including hard-boiled quail eggs and
hearts of palm, on one side. The other side holds the ingredients
for more traditional U.S.-style garden salads.
 &HT;    To signal that you're ready for your entree, you flip over a
wooden cue on your table _ turning it from red to green _ and
waiters dressed like gauchos, or Brazilian ranchers, walk to your
table to offer a dozen different cuts of meats right off the
skewer. There's cupim (Brahma hump steak) and coxa (marinated
chicken drumsticks), as well as lombo (pork loin) and linguica (a
Brazilian sausage). There's even peru (turkey _ in this case
wrapped in bacon). ```Turkey' in English is a country also,''
Utrera jokes.
 &HT;    Despite its all-you-can-eat menu, Rodizio Grill's prices are
reasonable. The average bill per person is only $22, including
appetizers, drinks and desserts. Children 6 and under eat free and
those between 7 and 12 get a discount. (Utrera understands since he
has four children of his own.) The only thing that will set you
back: a caipirinha. The Brazilian cocktail made with sugar cane
spirit, lime and sugar costs $6 at his Houston restaurant.
 &HT;    Other restaurateurs marvel at how he can keep prices so low
while offering so much ``middle of the plate,'' or entree, to his
customers. Utrera calls it a trade secret but gives a few hints.
``It's on the production side: controlling your costs _ and the
grilling methods,'' he says. ``It's also the law of averages,
because you may not eat as much as your husband.'' Utrera also
admits he negotiates hard with his suppliers. He has the power to
do so: He buys 15,000 to 20,000 pounds of meat a week.
 &HT;    Probably the most difficult part of launching the chain has been
finding staff. ``Because of the state of the U.S. economy, there
aren't enough employees to fill all the positions we have open,''
Utrera says. ``We're trying to push the Brazilian atmosphere of a
friendly place to work, and we've been able to succeed, especially
where we have managers who embrace that.''
 &HT;    The most satisfying part of the process has been watching his
idea produce results. ``I have a lot more gray hair than I had two
years ago,'' he says. ``But it's fun to go to the restaurant on a
Friday or Saturday night and there's a two-hour wait. You see all
these people having a great time, and everybody working like
clockwork. I sit back in awe and say, Wow, I've been blessed.'''
 &HT;    To date, Utrera has managed to raise $4 million from his sources
in Brazil to build his restaurant chain. He is now looking for $5
million to $10 million from U.S. investors so he can roll out a
nationwide chain that will eventually boast anywhere from 50 to 100
restaurants. He plans to take his company public within the next
three years.
 &HT;    What does he think of the growing popularity of Latin American
cuisine in the United States? Obviously, he thinks it is high time.
``I've visited every single country in Latin America, and the
variety of the dishes and the style of the food is so wonderful,''
he says. ``I could say with full assurance that it would rival a
lot of European cuisine. It just hasn't been discovered yet.''

 &HT;    The debate continues as to baseball's best player
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - The proposition belonged to Whitey Herzog. The banquet
was in St. Louis several years ago, and Herzog's dining partner
happened to be Tommy Lasorda. Pick the best player in baseball,
Herzog suggested, write his name on a piece of paper and then turn
it over.
</P>
<P>
   What followed was a rare convergence in this baseball age: a
consensus.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Piazza.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy is going to break every offensive record of any
catcher, if he stays healthy, in the history of the game,'' Lasorda
said. ``His first full year with me (in Los Angeles in 1993), he
did something no catcher ever did in his first year hit over .300,
hit 35 home runs and drove in over 100 runs. Johnny Bench never did
that. Johnny Bench never hit .300.''
</P>
<P>
   But then again.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, the most talented guy is still (Barry) Bonds,'' Lasorda
said. ``Tremendous talent.''
</P>
<P>
   With that, Lasorda underscored the trouble with identifying the
best baseball player in the contemporary game. It is one thing to
pronounce Piazza or Derek Jeter or Alex Rodriguez or Vladimir
Guerrero or Ken Griffey Jr. or Nomar Garciaparra or Ivan Rodriguez
to be the best player in the game.
</P>
<P>
   It is a far more difficult thing to hold the same opinion the
next day. Or the next hour. Baseball has churned out a half-dozen
players who have captured the game's imagination. Problem is, that
half-dozen seems to shift, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every night, you see someone else whacking,'' Pittsburgh
catcher Jason Kendall said. ``I mean yesterday, (Minnesota's) Corey
Koskie was hitting balls like it was unbelievable. Matt Lawton.
Before that, we saw (Sammy) Sosa hitting the ball in Chicago. And
before that (Mike) Lieberthal and (Scott) Rolen (in Philadelphia).
Every night, you see something new. It doesn't even surprise me
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Consensus, indeed.
</P>
<P>
   The debate should probably start with Griffey, the player that
Hank Aaron recognized as the best candidate to break his home-run
record. On April 10, he became the youngest player to reach 400
homers, at 30 years, 141 days. The defense has always been there:
Griffey has won 10 Gold Gloves in a row.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd still probably go with Griff,'' said Dave Winfield, the AL
honorary captain. ``There are so many good players, a lot of people
who are up and coming and on the horizon. He's excellent now. When
the year is over and it's all said and done, he's usually there.''
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati shortstop Barry Larkin said. ``There is no one guy
who is the best player in baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   What about the center fielder behind you?
</P>
<P>
   ``He can't pitch. That may be the one thing he can't do. . . .
He's damn good.''
</P>
<P>
   But Griffey's first year in the National League has run
head-long into Vladimir Guerrero's campaign in Montreal. Guerrero
has yet to play 500 games. But the more people who see the Expos
right fielder, the more people are stunned.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first series we played them, I said, 'Oh, my God. Here
comes Andre Dawson again,'' Houston manager Larry Dierker said.
Speed. Arm. Power. Hand-eye coordination.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Vladimir,'' Philadelphia catcher Mike Lieberthal said.
``Power. Average. A hose in the outfield. He can run. He can fly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough to find a guy who is strong and big and who can run
like Vladimir,'' Cleveland second baseman Roberto Alomar said.
``I'd pick him maybe as the best player right now.''
</P>
<P>
   But there can be no ignoring the history being achieved by the
age's two premier catchers. Texas' Rodriguez last year became the
first catcher to earn an MVP award since Thurman Munson in 1976.
Tonight, he starts in his eighth All-Star game in a row, one away
from Bench's record of nine.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez received more All-Star votes than any player (2.8
million) and leads the AL in extra-base hits (55) and total bases
(230). Only one catcher in history led his league in total bases
Bench with 315 in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Piazza will go down as the hardest-hitting catcher in
history. He already is the first catcher with two 40-homer seasons
and the only player to have gone .300-30-100 in each of his last
four seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were a nice little team,'' Mets general manager Steve
Phillips has said, ``until we got Piazza.''
</P>
<P>
   The AL's shortstop trio has engendered a debate unto itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got three guys at the shortstop position that you could
start any team with,'' Ozzie Smith said. ``Any of those three guys,
put their names in a hat and pick one, you can't lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra, in just his fourth full season, is flirting with
.400 by hitting .389 at the break and is seeking his second batting
title in a row. Jeter is the first shortstop since Ernie Banks to
lead his team in hits in each of his first four seasons. Rodriguez
already is one of baseball's three 40-40 players, with Bonds and
Jose Canseco.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd have to put our shortstop up with the other names,''
Seattle manager Lou Piniella said. ``He's the total package. He's
got the athleticism, he's got the power. The center fielder I had
who's in Cincinnati now is a damn good player. You'd have to add
Barry Bonds into that mix. The catcher at Texas is awfully good.
The shortstops in Boston and New York are great players. I've only
named six.
</P>
<P>
   ``But our guy can play. He's got some good leadership qualities,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Alex is probably the best pure shortstop,'' Jeter said.
``Nomar can do everything. He can put the ball in play, he hits for
high average, doesn't strike out much. Myself, I'm in between.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the problem. In a multiplayer debate, in an era of
expansive offense, most of the numbers fall in between. The scope
of the player becomes the scope of the debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is Mark McGwire the best player in the game because of what
he's able to do?'' Atlanta's Tom Glavine asked. ``Was Tony Gwynn
the best player of his age because he could hit so well for
average?
</P>
<P>
   ``Or are you looking for a combination of everything. What do
people prefer out of a player? If you go by the old adage of how
they scout players, the five-tool player, there are a handul of
those guys in the game right now, maybe more so than there's ever
been.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe there is no best player in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``The unique thing about baseball is that somebody leaps to the
forefront each and every year,'' Wade Boggs said. ``They don't
dominate the sport. It's really hard to dominate this game because
you play so many games. There is no Tiger Woods.''
</P>
<P>
   One player has been the most consistent force on the game's most
successful team over the past four seasons. Jeter's .320 career
average is the fifth-highest posted by a Yankee, behind Babe Ruth,
Lou Gehrig, Earle Combs and Joe DiMaggio.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't have Rodriguez's power, doesn't have Garciaparra's
bat control. He can't swing like Piazza, can't run like Guerrero.
He even spent two weeks in May recovering his stroke at extended
spring training.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know,'' Joe Torre said, ``you have to be around this kid
to appreciate maybe you don't have to be around him to appreciate
what he's all about. He's a tough kid.''
</P>
<P>
   He also might be the best.

EXCERPTS OF BUSH'S REMARKS AT NAACP CONVENTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: A full transcript of Bush's remarks is available from The New
York Times on the Web: www.nytimes.com) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Excerpts of George W. Bush's remarks Monday to delegates at the
NAACP annual convention in Baltimore:
</P>
<P>
   ``For our nation there is no denying the truth that slavery is a
blight on our history and that racism, despite all the progress,
still exists today. For my party there is no escaping the reality
that the party of Lincoln has not always carried the mantle of
Lincoln. Recognizing and confronting our history is important.
Transcending our history is essential. We're not limited by what we
have done or what we have left undone. We are limited only by what
we're willing to do.
</P>
<P>
   Our nation must make new a commitment to equality and upward
mobility to all the citizens. This is a great moment of national
prosperity. But many still live in prosperity's shadow. The same
economy that is a miracle for millions is a mystery to millions as
well. From the beginning of this campaign I have said that
prosperity must have a purpose. The purpose of prosperity is to
ensure the American dream touches every willing heart. And we
cannot afford to have an American segregated by class, by race or
by aspiration. America must close the gap of hope between
communities of prosperity and communities of poverty. ...
</P>
<P>
   There is a higher and older tradition in my party. Lincoln
argued that every poor man should have a chance. He defended a
clear path for all. He financed colleges and welcomed immigrants,
promoted railroads and economic development. Through the Homestead
Act he gave countless Americans a piece of land, a start in life.
</P>
<P>
   I propose a new prosperity initiative that reflects the spirit
of Lincoln's reforms. A plan to remove obstacles on the road to the
middle class. You see, instead of helping people cope with their
need, we will help them move beyond it.
</P>
<P>
   And here are some of the ideas of the new prosperity initiative,
just some of the thoughts:
</P>
<P>
   We must provide a family health credit that covers 90 percent of
the cost of basic health policy for low-income families in America.
</P>
<P>
   We must make it possible for more people to become homeowners in
this great land, to own a part of the American dream. So we allow
low-income families to use up to a year's worth of Section Eight
rental payments to make a down payment on their own home. Then use
five years of those payments to help with the mortgage.
</P>
<P>
   We will start an American dream down payment fund, matching
individual savings to the down payment for a home.
</P>
<P>
   Behind these last two proposals is a simple belief. I believe in
private property. I believe in private property so strongly, I want
everybody to have some. ...
</P>
<P>
   These are some of my goals for America. To help make opportunity
not only a hope and a promise but a living reality. The NAACP and
the GOP have not always been allies. I know that. But recognizing
our past and confronting the future with a common vision, by doing
that I believe we can find common ground. It won't be easy work.
But a philosopher once advised, `When given a choice prefer the
hard.' We will prefer the hard because only the hard will achieve
the good. That's my commitment. And that is our opportunity. ''

 Por CLAIRE POOLE 
 c.2000 Latin Trade 
 (Distribuido por New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    HOUSTON _ En 1995 Ivan Utrera era un joven ejecutivo en Pepsico.
Este hijo de Sao Paulo acababa de concluir una rotacion de tres
anos como director de mercadeo internacional de Pizza Hut, que
incluyo la inauguracion de 300 pizzerias en Brasil y otras en el
resto de Latinoamerica. Entonces lo enviaron de regreso a la sede
de PepsiCo en Nueva York, como director de mercadeo de Pizza Hut,
que genera US$1.500 millones en ventas al ano.
 &HT;    Pero Utrera estaba frustrado. ``La situacion se volvio
practicamente intolerable,'' dice. ``Si uno queria hacer algo,
aunque fuera cambiar el color de las servilletas, necesitaba dos
anos de investigaciones para determinar cual seria el impacto sobre
todo lo demas,'' explica.
 &HT;    Asi que Utrera se lo jugo todo en 1995 para crear Rodizio Grill,
una cadena de churrasquerias brasilenas. Desde entonces, ha abierto
seis de estos restaurantes especializados en carnes en todo Estados
Unidos, entre ellos en Houston, Texas, y Arlington, Virginia, y
emplea a 500 personas. Con ingresos de US$14 millones al ano y
ganancias operativas de entre el 10 por ciento y el 20 por ciento,
ahora planea abrir tres restaurantes mas en los proximos doce meses
(probablemente en Arizona, Texas e Illinois), y cuatro mas el
proximo ano.
 &HT;    ``Brasil no se da a conocer como es debido. Asi que una de mis
metas es hacer que en Estados Unidos se conozca un poco mas sobre
Brasil,'' dice. Utrera es uno de muchos nuevos empresarios que
aprovechan la popularidad de la variada cocina latinoamericana en
Estados Unidos (ver Pasen el chimichurri, noviembre de 1999). Lo
que en Estados Unidos se ha dado en llamar la nueva cocina latina,
se ha segmentado, y los restaurantes argentinos y brasilenos se han
hecho especialmente populares.
 &HT;    Por todo Estados Unidos surgen bistros brasilenos, como la
Churrascaria Plataforma en Nueva York, Rhumba en Chicago y Yolies
Brazilian Steak House en Las Vegas. ``En una churrasqueria no tiene
sentido la prudencia. Es una experiencia pantagruelica,'' escribio
Ruth Reichl, critica de restaurantes de The New York Times. ``Y si
usted no esta preparado para echar la cautela por la borda, para
comer como jamas ha comido, entonces ni se porte por alli.''
 &HT;    El estilo de Utrera ha comenzado a pegar. Su cadena de
churrasquerias, con sede en Littletown, Colorado, recientemente
recibio el galardon ``Hot Concept'' de Nations Restaurant News, una
publicacion especializada del sector. ``Carnivoros, acerquense,
bienvenidos al paraiso,'' fue el lema que la revista sugirio para
Rodizio Grill el ano pasado.
 &HT;    Utrera, de 38 anos, llego al negocio de los restaurantes por un
camino sinuoso. Nacido y criado en Sao Paulo, hijo de padres
empresarios (dirigen Utreplas, que fabrica piezas de plastico para
los telefonos GTE y las lavadoras Whirlpool), se graduo de una
licenciatura en Comunicaciones en la Universidad Brigham Young en
Provo, Utah. Trabajo en publicidad tres anos y entonces regreso a
la misma universidad a estudiar una maestria en Administracion de
Empresas.
 &HT;    Despues de graduarse, Utrera comenzo a trabajar en Pizza Hut,
donde ascendio de gerente de mercadeo a director de mercadeo
internacional para Latinoamerica y el Caribe, y finalmente se hizo
cargo del mercadeo en Estados Unidos.
 &HT;    Mientras estuvo en Brasil noto que los restaurantes de carnes
populares en las provincias, que estan orientados a una clientela
familiar, eran cada vez mas populares en Sao Paulo. Tambien noto
que los norteamericanos que visitaban estos restaurantes se
marchaban con ganas de tener algo asi en su pais. Parte de la
extendida familia de Utrera tenia restaurantes en Sao Paulo, y les
pidio informacion y consejos sobre como establecer una
churrasqueria en Estados Unidos. ``Yo soy el unico de mi familia
que hizo carrera en una empresa. Ya era hora de poner mi negocio,''
explica.
 &HT;    Pero no fue facil. No consiguio a nadie a quien venderle la idea
en Estados Unidos. ``No comprendian el concepto,'' dice. Entonces
recurrio a amigos, parientes y algunos duenos de franquicias de
Pizza Hut en Brasil, con lo que logro acumular US$1 millon en seis
meses. Su primer restaurante se inauguro en Denver, Colorado, en
1996.
 &HT;    Por que en Denver? ``Yo habia usado mucho a Denver como mercado
de prueba para Pizza Hut,'' explica. ``No tenia una influencia
etnica fuerte, especialmente de brasilenos, y no queria que eso
afectara los resultados. Si salia adelante en Denver, podia
triunfar en cualquier parte.''
 &HT;    Rodizio Grill fue inaugurado para deleite de los criticos de
restaurantes. Pero fue criticado por algunos comensales por no
ofrecer en el menu cosas como pure de papas, vegetales a la plancha
y emparedados. Las sugerencias no cayeron en oidos sordos. Utrera
ha agregado platos que no son tipicos de la cocina brasilena, y ha
instalado medias paredes y trabajos en herreria decorativa para que
los clientes se sientan mas como en casa. De hecho, se pide
activamente a los comensales sus opiniones, que expresan en
tarjetas que hay en todas las mesas. ``Hemos tomado en cuenta las
sugerencias y hemos cambiado y agregado algunas cosas para mejorar
el nivel de satisfaccion del cliente,'' explica Utrera.
 &HT;    Pero el concepto basico de la churrasqueria brasilena esta
intacto. Cuando uno se sienta a la mesa le sirven una cesta de
aperitivos con paozionho (panecillos), pao de queijo (pan de queso,
polenta o maiz frito servido con una salsa de tomate y bananas
fritas con canela.
 &HT;    Despues de hacer el pedido del menu (en ingles y portugues), los
clientes se levantan y pasan al bufet de ensaladas, repleto de
cosas como huevos de codorniz hervidos y palmitos, en una parte, e
ingredientes mas tradicionales, como lechuga, tomate y pepino en la
otra.
 &HT;    Cuando uno esta listo para el plato principal, mueve una pieza
de madera que hay encima de las mesas, de rojo a verde, y los
meseros _ vestidos de gauchos _ se acercan entonces a la mesa para
ofrecerle diferentes cortes de carne al pincho, como el cupim
(filete de lomo) y la coxa (piezas de pollo adobadas a la brasa),
asi como lombo (lomo de cerdo) y linguica (un tipo de chorizo
brasileno). Otro plato tipico es el peru (carne de pavo envuelta en
tocino).
 &HT;    En el Rodizio Grill usted come hasta hartarse, pero los precios
son razonables. La factura promedio es US$22 por persona, que
incluye aperitivos, bebidas y postre. Los ninos menores de seis
anos comen gratis y los de siete a doce anos reciben un descuento.
(Utrera comprende la situacion porque tiene cuatro hijos). Lo unico
que se paga extra es la caipirinha, ese fabuloso coctel que se
prepara con aguardiente, limon y azucar, y que cuesta US$6 en el
restaurante de Houston.
 &HT;    Los colegas de Utrera se maravillan de como puede mantener los
precios tan bajos y a la vez ofrecer tan buena comida. El genio del
Rodizio Grill dice que es un secreto, pero ofrece algunos detalles.
``Parte es controlar los costos y los metodos de asar la carne, y
tambien las probabilidades, porque todas las personas no comen la
misma cantidad,'' afirma. Utrera tambien reconoce que negocia con
sus proveedores, y tiene el poder para hacerlo porque compra entre
7.000 y 9.000 kilos de carne a la semana.
 &HT;    Probablemente la parte mas dificil de lanzar la cadena ha sido
encontrar el personal adecuado. ``Debido a la buena marcha de la
economia en Estados Unidos, no es facil encontrar personal para las
vacantes que tenemos. Estamos tratando de crear un ambiente
brasileno, un lugar comodo para trabajar, y lo hemos logrado,
especialmente porque tenemos los gerentes que respaldan ese
concepto,'' dice.
 &HT;    Lo que mas le satisface es ver su idea rendir frutos. ``Tengo
muchas mas canas que hace dos anos, pero vale la pena ir al
restaurante un viernes o sabado por la noche y enterarse que la
espera es de dos horas,'' afirma con satisfaccion. ``Es bueno ver a
todas esas personas pasandola bien y como el restaurante funciona
como un reloj. Entonces me siento y digo: Que suerte. Que
bendicion.''
 &HT;    Hasta la fecha, Utrera ha logrado recaudar US$4 millones en
Brasil. Ahora busca entre US$5 y US$10 millones de inversionistas
norteamericanos para poder ampliar la cadena a todo el pais, con 50
o 100 restaurantes. Ademas, Utrera planea sacar la empresa a bolsa
en los proximos tres anos.
 &HT;    Que piensa de la popularidad de la cocina latinoamericana en
Estados Unidos? Obviamente, opina que ya era hora. ``He visitado
todos los paises de America Latina, y la variedad de platos y
estilos es enorme. Puedo asegurarle con confianza que no tiene
mucho que envidiarle a gran parte de la cocina europea,'' dice.
``Lo que pasa es que todavia no la han descubierto.''

 &HT;    HOUSTON _ En 1995 Ivan Utrera era un joven ejecutivo en Pepsico.
Este hijo de Sao Paulo acababa de concluir una rotacion de tres
anos como director de mercadeo internacional de Pizza Hut, que
incluyo la inauguracion de 300 pizzerias en Brasil y otras en el
resto de Latinoamerica. Entonces lo enviaron de regreso a la sede
de PepsiCo en Nueva York, como director de mercadeo de Pizza Hut,
que genera US$1.500 millones en ventas al ano.
 &HT;    Pero Utrera estaba frustrado. ``La situacion se volvio
practicamente intolerable,'' dice. ``Si uno queria hacer algo,
aunque fuera cambiar el color de las servilletas, necesitaba dos
anos de investigaciones para determinar cual seria el impacto sobre
todo lo demas,'' explica.
 &HT;    Asi que Utrera se lo jugo todo en 1995 para crear Rodizio Grill,
una cadena de churrasquerias brasilenas. Desde entonces, ha abierto
seis de estos restaurantes especializados en carnes en todo Estados
Unidos, entre ellos en Houston, Texas, y Arlington, Virginia, y
emplea a 500 personas. Con ingresos de US$14 millones al ano y
ganancias operativas de entre el 10 por ciento y el 20 por ciento,
ahora planea abrir tres restaurantes mas en los proximos doce meses
(probablemente en Arizona, Texas e Illinois), y cuatro mas el
proximo ano.
 &HT;    ``Brasil no se da a conocer como es debido. Asi que una de mis
metas es hacer que en Estados Unidos se conozca un poco mas sobre
Brasil,'' dice. Utrera es uno de muchos nuevos empresarios que
aprovechan la popularidad de la variada cocina latinoamericana en
Estados Unidos (ver Pasen el chimichurri, noviembre de 1999). Lo
que en Estados Unidos se ha dado en llamar la nueva cocina latina,
se ha segmentado, y los restaurantes argentinos y brasilenos se han
hecho especialmente populares.
 &HT;    Por todo Estados Unidos surgen bistros brasilenos, como la
Churrascaria Plataforma en Nueva York, Rhumba en Chicago y Yolies
Brazilian Steak House en Las Vegas. ``En una churrasqueria no tiene
sentido la prudencia. Es una experiencia pantagruelica,'' escribio
Ruth Reichl, critica de restaurantes de The New York Times. ``Y si
usted no esta preparado para echar la cautela por la borda, para
comer como jamas ha comido, entonces ni se porte por alli.''
 &HT;    El estilo de Utrera ha comenzado a pegar. Su cadena de
churrasquerias, con sede en Littletown, Colorado, recientemente
recibio el galardon ``Hot Concept'' de Nations Restaurant News, una
publicacion especializada del sector. ``Carnivoros, acerquense,
bienvenidos al paraiso,'' fue el lema que la revista sugirio para
Rodizio Grill el ano pasado.
 &HT;    Utrera, de 38 anos, llego al negocio de los restaurantes por un
camino sinuoso. Nacido y criado en Sao Paulo, hijo de padres
empresarios (dirigen Utreplas, que fabrica piezas de plastico para
los telefonos GTE y las lavadoras Whirlpool), se graduo de una
licenciatura en Comunicaciones en la Universidad Brigham Young en
Provo, Utah. Trabajo en publicidad tres anos y entonces regreso a
la misma universidad a estudiar una maestria en Administracion de
Empresas.
 &HT;    Despues de graduarse, Utrera comenzo a trabajar en Pizza Hut,
donde ascendio de gerente de mercadeo a director de mercadeo
internacional para Latinoamerica y el Caribe, y finalmente se hizo
cargo del mercadeo en Estados Unidos.
 &HT;    Mientras estuvo en Brasil noto que los restaurantes de carnes
populares en las provincias, que estan orientados a una clientela
familiar, eran cada vez mas populares en Sao Paulo. Tambien noto
que los norteamericanos que visitaban estos restaurantes se
marchaban con ganas de tener algo asi en su pais. Parte de la
extendida familia de Utrera tenia restaurantes en Sao Paulo, y les
pidio informacion y consejos sobre como establecer una
churrasqueria en Estados Unidos. ``Yo soy el unico de mi familia
que hizo carrera en una empresa. Ya era hora de poner mi negocio,''
explica.
 &HT;    Pero no fue facil. No consiguio a nadie a quien venderle la idea
en Estados Unidos. ``No comprendian el concepto,'' dice. Entonces
recurrio a amigos, parientes y algunos duenos de franquicias de
Pizza Hut en Brasil, con lo que logro acumular US$1 millon en seis
meses. Su primer restaurante se inauguro en Denver, Colorado, en
1996.
 &HT;    Por que en Denver? ``Yo habia usado mucho a Denver como mercado
de prueba para Pizza Hut,'' explica. ``No tenia una influencia
etnica fuerte, especialmente de brasilenos, y no queria que eso
afectara los resultados. Si salia adelante en Denver, podia
triunfar en cualquier parte.''
 &HT;    Rodizio Grill fue inaugurado para deleite de los criticos de
restaurantes. Pero fue criticado por algunos comensales por no
ofrecer en el menu cosas como pure de papas, vegetales a la plancha
y emparedados. Las sugerencias no cayeron en oidos sordos. Utrera
ha agregado platos que no son tipicos de la cocina brasilena, y ha
instalado medias paredes y trabajos en herreria decorativa para que
los clientes se sientan mas como en casa. De hecho, se pide
activamente a los comensales sus opiniones, que expresan en
tarjetas que hay en todas las mesas. ``Hemos tomado en cuenta las
sugerencias y hemos cambiado y agregado algunas cosas para mejorar
el nivel de satisfaccion del cliente,'' explica Utrera.
 &HT;    Pero el concepto basico de la churrasqueria brasilena esta
intacto. Cuando uno se sienta a la mesa le sirven una cesta de
aperitivos con paozionho (panecillos), pao de queijo (pan de queso,
polenta o maiz frito servido con una salsa de tomate y bananas
fritas con canela.
 &HT;    Despues de hacer el pedido del menu (en ingles y portugues), los
clientes se levantan y pasan al bufet de ensaladas, repleto de
cosas como huevos de codorniz hervidos y palmitos, en una parte, e
ingredientes mas tradicionales, como lechuga, tomate y pepino en la
otra.
 &HT;    Cuando uno esta listo para el plato principal, mueve una pieza
de madera que hay encima de las mesas, de rojo a verde, y los
meseros _ vestidos de gauchos _ se acercan entonces a la mesa para
ofrecerle diferentes cortes de carne al pincho, como el cupim
(filete de lomo) y la coxa (piezas de pollo adobadas a la brasa),
asi como lombo (lomo de cerdo) y linguica (un tipo de chorizo
brasileno). Otro plato tipico es el peru (carne de pavo envuelta en
tocino).
 &HT;    En el Rodizio Grill usted come hasta hartarse, pero los precios
son razonables. La factura promedio es US$22 por persona, que
incluye aperitivos, bebidas y postre. Los ninos menores de seis
anos comen gratis y los de siete a doce anos reciben un descuento.
(Utrera comprende la situacion porque tiene cuatro hijos). Lo unico
que se paga extra es la caipirinha, ese fabuloso coctel que se
prepara con aguardiente, limon y azucar, y que cuesta US$6 en el
restaurante de Houston.
 &HT;    Los colegas de Utrera se maravillan de como puede mantener los
precios tan bajos y a la vez ofrecer tan buena comida. El genio del
Rodizio Grill dice que es un secreto, pero ofrece algunos detalles.
``Parte es controlar los costos y los metodos de asar la carne, y
tambien las probabilidades, porque todas las personas no comen la
misma cantidad,'' afirma. Utrera tambien reconoce que negocia con
sus proveedores, y tiene el poder para hacerlo porque compra entre
7.000 y 9.000 kilos de carne a la semana.
 &HT;    Probablemente la parte mas dificil de lanzar la cadena ha sido
encontrar el personal adecuado. ``Debido a la buena marcha de la
economia en Estados Unidos, no es facil encontrar personal para las
vacantes que tenemos. Estamos tratando de crear un ambiente
brasileno, un lugar comodo para trabajar, y lo hemos logrado,
especialmente porque tenemos los gerentes que respaldan ese
concepto,'' dice.
 &HT;    Lo que mas le satisface es ver su idea rendir frutos. ``Tengo
muchas mas canas que hace dos anos, pero vale la pena ir al
restaurante un viernes o sabado por la noche y enterarse que la
espera es de dos horas,'' afirma con satisfaccion. ``Es bueno ver a
todas esas personas pasandola bien y como el restaurante funciona
como un reloj. Entonces me siento y digo: Que suerte. Que
bendicion.''
 &HT;    Hasta la fecha, Utrera ha logrado recaudar US$4 millones en
Brasil. Ahora busca entre US$5 y US$10 millones de inversionistas
norteamericanos para poder ampliar la cadena a todo el pais, con 50
o 100 restaurantes. Ademas, Utrera planea sacar la empresa a bolsa
en los proximos tres anos.
 &HT;    Que piensa de la popularidad de la cocina latinoamericana en
Estados Unidos? Obviamente, opina que ya era hora. ``He visitado
todos los paises de America Latina, y la variedad de platos y
estilos es enorme. Puedo asegurarle con confianza que no tiene
mucho que envidiarle a gran parte de la cocina europea,'' dice.
``Lo que pasa es que todavia no la han descubierto.''

COMMENTARY: LEBANON AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE 
</HEADLINE>
   By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon _ If you can't be at Camp David, Beirut is about
as good a vantage point as any for watching the Palestinian-Israeli
summit talks, because Lebanon has many lessons, some obvious, some
subtle, to offer the negotiators.
</P>
<P>
   Lebanon, first off, is a reminder of what happened when Israelis
and Palestinians tried to resolve their differences not with
diplomacy but with brute force during that long hot summer of 1982.
At that time Israel still entertained the fantasy of solving the
Palestinian problem by wiping out the PLO, and the PLO entertained
the fantasy that armed struggle could win back at least all of the
West Bank and East Jerusalem. But the Israeli-Palestinian war in
Lebanon was a war with no winner. All sides lost.
</P>
<P>
   A short time later, Lebanon taught the Israelis another lesson _
that simply because Israel has more power doesn't mean it is in its
interest to cram a deal down the other side's throat. On May 17,
1983, with the help of a very foolish Reagan administration,
Israel's Likud government imposed a peace settlement on Lebanon,
which gave Israel a permanent security presence in South Lebanon.
The Lebanese prime minister at the time literally cried after
signing the treaty. The May 17 agreement, though, was never
implemented. Because it had no legitimacy in Lebanese society it
had no roots, and therefore no staying power. The only thing the
May 17 agreement gave birth to was a war against Israel by the
Hezbollah Shiite guerrillas _ which eventually forced a unilateral
Israeli withdrawal _ and a virulent anti-American campaign that
culminated in the blowing up of a U.S. Marine barracks, killing 241
servicemen.
</P>
<P>
   But what is most intriguing is the latest lesson from Lebanon _
the one being taught by Hezbollah. Who said the following on TV
here the other day? ``The political class in Lebanon got so
self-absorbed in its rules and games that it is not aware of
globalization and competition and the requirements to succeed today
... You cannot work anymore on the assumption that we should not
change our ways to meet the challenges of peace and in order to
become a productive economy.''
</P>
<P>
   No, it wasn't the minister of finance. It was Haj Hussein al
Haj-Hassan, a Hezbollah Parliament member from Baalbek. In the wake
of driving the Israelis out of South Lebanon, Hezbollah has turned
its focus inward to satisfy what it knows its constituency now
wants most _ jobs, better schools, development, an end to
corruption and integration with global trends, not more war.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot imagine how tired people are of this conflict and
all the old political sloganeering,'' remarked Jamil Mroue, editor
of The Beirut Daily Star, ``and the party here that understands
that best is precisely the party that has been most removed from
traditional Lebanese politics _ Hezbollah.''
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah first leapfrogged over the old politics here by not
being afraid of the Israelis, but now, having evicted them from
South Lebanon, Hezbollah is turning its attention to the economic
and social aspirations of its rank and file.
</P>
<P>
   So what's the lesson? Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel may be
coming to Camp David without the support of all the traditional,
small-minded ethnic parties in Israel. But I guarantee you, 60 to
70 percent of the Israeli people are with Barak. That is, they are
ready for a real and fair deal, including hard compromises,
provided the bottom line reads ``The End'' _ the end of this
conflict so Israelis can really get on with life.
</P>
<P>
   The divisions in the Israeli Parliament, like those in the
Lebanese Parliament, represent the old politics of ethnic and
religious division. But remember, Barak himself was directly
elected by the Israeli people _ precisely to bring about a final
peace. He still comes to Washington with a strong mandate for that.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of elections, Bashar Assad was ``elected'' president of
Syria Monday night to succeed his father. On the eve of Bashar's
election, what did he do? Give a speech attacking Israel? No, he
ended government controls on auto imports, enabling any Syrian to
import a car.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line: I don't know whether Yasser Arafat and Barak will
be able to achieve what they both will consider a fair deal. But I
do know this: If they do, they will each find solid silent
majorities at home to embrace it, because growing underneath the
old politics out here is a new politics. It may not make as much
noise as the old politics, but it has a lot more support than you
think.

 By CLAIRE POOLE 
 c.2000 Latin Trade 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    HOUSTON _ In 1995, Ivan Utrera was an up-and-coming executive at
PepsiCo. The Sao Paulo native had just finished a three-year
rotation as international marketing director for Pizza Hut, which
included opening 300 fast-food pizza restaurants in Brazil as well
as others around Latin America. He was shifted back to PepsiCo's
Purchase, N.Y., headquarters as director of U.S. marketing for
Pizza Hut, which sees US$1.5 billion in sales annually.
 &HT;    Yet Utrera was frustrated. ``It got really stifling,'' he says.
``If you wanted to do anything, even change the color of the
napkins, you needed two years' worth of research to see if it was
going to impact anything.''
 &HT;    So Utrera chucked it all in 1995 to start Rodizio Grill, a chain
of Brazilian-style steak houses, or churrascarias. He's opened six
restaurants around the country, from Houston, Texas, to Arlington,
Virginia, and employs 500 people. With revenues of $14 million a
year and operating profits somewhere in the 10 percent to 20
percent range, he's now planning to open three more eateries in the
next 12 months (possible sites: Arizona, Texas and Illinois) and
four more the next year.
 &HT;    ``Brazil doesn't do a very good job of marketing. So one of my
goals is to bring a little more knowledge about Brazil into the
U.S.,'' he says. Utrera is just one of many entrepreneurs
capitalizing on the increasing popularity of Latin American cuisine
in the United States. What's generally been dubbed the Nuevo Latino
movement has now branched off into subsegments, with Argentine and
Brazilian restaurants becoming especially popular.
 &HT;    Brazilian bistros are popping up all over the country, from
Churrascaria Plataforma in New York City to Rhumba in Chicago,
Illinois, to Yolie's Brazilian Steak House in Las Vegas, Nevada.
``There is no point in being prudent at a churrascaria: It is a
Rabelaisian experience,'' The New York Times restaurant critic Ruth
Reichl has written. ``And if you are not prepared to throw caution
to the winds, eating more than you have ever eaten before, it is
not the place for you.''
 &HT;    Utrera's version is taking off. His restaurant chain based in
Littleton, Colorado, was recently declared one of six ``Hot
Concept'' winners by Nation's Restaurant News, a trade publication.
``Carnivores, come hither. Welcome to a meat lover's paradise,'''
the magazine suggested as Rodizio Grill's slogan last year.
 &HT;    The 38-year-old Utrera became a restaurateur via a circuitous
path. Born and raised in Sao Paulo of entrepreneurial parents (his
father and mother run Utreplas, which makes plastic components for
GTE phones and Whirlpool washing machines), he earned his
undergraduate degree in communications from Brigham Young
University in Provo, Utah. He worked in advertising for three
years, but returned to Brigham Young's Marriott School of
Management for an MBA.
 &HT;    After business school, Utrera joined Pizza Hut, rising from
marketing manager to director of international marketing for Latin
America and the Caribbean and finally to the top marketing spot for
one of its U.S. operations.
 &HT;    While he was in Brazil, though, he noticed that family-oriented
steak houses from the provinces were growing popular in Sao Paulo.
He also noticed that North Americans who ate at them wished they
had something similar back home. Part of Utrera's extended family
was in the restaurant business in Sao Paulo, so he tapped them for
information on how to set up a churrascaria in the United States.
``I was the only one in my family to follow a corporate career,''
he says. ``It was time to go out on my own.''
 &HT;    It wasn't easy without a giant like PepsiCo behind him. Indeed,
he couldn't sell anyone in the United States on the idea. ``They
didn't understand the concept,'' he says.
 &HT;    Turning to friends, relatives (his mother bought in) and some
Pizza Hut franchisees in Brazil, he scraped together $1 million in
six months. His first restaurant debuted in Denver, Colorado, in
1996.
 &HT;    Why Denver? ``I had used Denver extensively for Pizza Hut as a
test market,'' he explains. ``It didn't have a heavy ethnic
influence, especially Brazilians, and I didn't want that to affect
the results. If we could succeed in Denver, we could succeed
anywhere.''
 &HT;    Rodizio Grill opened to rave reviews from Denver food critics _
including one who recommended Utrera hire industry veteran Scott
Henley as director of operations. (He did.) But the restaurant was
criticized by diners for several oversights, from not offering
mashed potatoes, grilled vegetables and sandwiches to its layout,
which many thought looked too much like a cafeteria.
 &HT;    The feedback did not fall on deaf ears. Utrera has added items
to the menu even though they're not traditional to Brazil. He has
installed half walls and decorative ironwork so his customers feel
more comfortable. Indeed, he still actively solicits customer
suggestions with a review card on every table; on the front is an
old snapshot of his family celebrating his grandmother's birthday.
(Utrera's the big-eyed 3-year-old sitting on a woman's lap near the
front of the shot.) ``Based on that feedback, we've changed and
added a few things to improve customer satisfaction,'' he says.
 &HT;    But the basic concept behind the Brazilian churrascaria is still
there. When you sit down, you're followed by a basket of
appetizers: paozinho, a small roll; pao de queijo, a Brazilian
cheese bread; polenta, or fried corn sticks served with a marinara
sauce; and bananas fritas, or cinnamon-glazed bananas.
 &HT;    After you order from the menu, which is in English and
Portuguese, you head to a self-serve salad bar bursting with
traditional Brazilian salads, including hard-boiled quail eggs and
hearts of palm, on one side. The other side holds the ingredients
for more traditional U.S.-style garden salads.
 &HT;    To signal that you're ready for your entree, you flip over a
wooden cue on your table _ turning it from red to green _ and
waiters dressed like gauchos, or Brazilian ranchers, walk to your
table to offer a dozen different cuts of meats right off the
skewer. There's cupim (Brahma hump steak) and coxa (marinated
chicken drumsticks), as well as lombo (pork loin) and linguica (a
Brazilian sausage). There's even peru (turkey _ in this case
wrapped in bacon). ```Turkey' in English is a country also,''
Utrera jokes.
 &HT;    Despite its all-you-can-eat menu, Rodizio Grill's prices are
reasonable. The average bill per person is only $22, including
appetizers, drinks and desserts. Children 6 and under eat free and
those between 7 and 12 get a discount. (Utrera understands since he
has four children of his own.) The only thing that will set you
back: a caipirinha. The Brazilian cocktail made with sugar cane
spirit, lime and sugar costs $6 at his Houston restaurant.
 &HT;    Other restaurateurs marvel at how he can keep prices so low
while offering so much ``middle of the plate,'' or entree, to his
customers. Utrera calls it a trade secret but gives a few hints.
``It's on the production side: controlling your costs _ and the
grilling methods,'' he says. ``It's also the law of averages,
because you may not eat as much as your husband.'' Utrera also
admits he negotiates hard with his suppliers. He has the power to
do so: He buys 15,000 to 20,000 pounds of meat a week.
 &HT;    Probably the most difficult part of launching the chain has been
finding staff. ``Because of the state of the U.S. economy, there
aren't enough employees to fill all the positions we have open,''
Utrera says. ``We're trying to push the Brazilian atmosphere of a
friendly place to work, and we've been able to succeed, especially
where we have managers who embrace that.''
 &HT;    The most satisfying part of the process has been watching his
idea produce results. ``I have a lot more gray hair than I had two
years ago,'' he says. ``But it's fun to go to the restaurant on a
Friday or Saturday night and there's a two-hour wait. You see all
these people having a great time, and everybody working like
clockwork. I sit back in awe and say, Wow, I've been blessed.'''
 &HT;    To date, Utrera has managed to raise $4 million from his sources
in Brazil to build his restaurant chain. He is now looking for $5
million to $10 million from U.S. investors so he can roll out a
nationwide chain that will eventually boast anywhere from 50 to 100
restaurants. He plans to take his company public within the next
three years.
 &HT;    What does he think of the growing popularity of Latin American
cuisine in the United States? Obviously, he thinks it is high time.
``I've visited every single country in Latin America, and the
variety of the dishes and the style of the food is so wonderful,''
he says. ``I could say with full assurance that it would rival a
lot of European cuisine. It just hasn't been discovered yet.''

CLINTON CREATES 2   MILLION-GALLON NORTHEAST HEATING OIL RESERVE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JENNIFER WALSH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton established a home heating oil
reserve for the Northeast Monday, hoping to prevent a repeat of
last winter's fuel shortages that drove prices sky high as
residents struggled to stay warm.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton asked Energy Secretary Bill Richardson to prepare to
withdraw oil from the nation's emergency energy supply, the
Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and offer it to oil refiners in
exchange for 2 million barrels of home heating oil. It will be set
aside to prevent oil shortages in the Northeastern states.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winter may seem far off on this hot day, but if we don't do
something now, reserve stocks of heating oil may not be in place
before the cold weather comes,'' Clinton said from the White House
lawn before leaving to speak at the National Governors' Association
meeting in State College, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Chretien, director of Boston Oil Consumers Alliance, said
the creation of the reserve will help control a spike in the price
of home heating oil caused by temporary shortages such as the one
that struck New England last winter. But the reserve will not
affect the day to day price.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's used in a short-term situation,'' Chretien said. ``That 2
million barrels would have come in handy in the first part of 2000.
It's good news to be thinking in July what is going on in the
winter.''
</P>
<P>
   Heating oil prices in the Northeast nearly tripled last February
during a cold spell that oil refiners and the Clinton
Administration alike had failed to anticipate. The sudden price
hikes, brought on by the sudden jump in demand, caused an uproar on
the Eastern Seaboard where residents consume almost three quarters
of US heating oil.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph P. Kennedy II, president of the Citizens Energy
Corporation, said he expects prices to be even higher than they
were during last winter's crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two million additional barrels will barely heat our region for
two days,'' the former US representative from Brighton said in a
written statement. ``A reserve of that size for the whole Northeast
is a small and regrettably inadequate step to protect us against
big price spikes.''
</P>
<P>
   Jason Kauppi, spokesman for Massachusetts Governor Paul
Cellucci, said the president's action is coming a season too late.
Last winter, Clinton declined to tap into the Strategic Petroleum
Reserve, a huge oil reserve in underground salt caverns in Texas
and Louisiana. Set up after the 1973-74 OPEC oil embargo, the
reserve is intended for emergencies only.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously it's good news for New England, it's just too bad
the president didn't take this action in the winter time when we
needed it,'' Kauppi said. ``Now that his vice president is having
some political problems in this region, he sees it fit to release
the oil. We could have used it last winter.''
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton used administrative action to set aside the
reserves, he lacks the legal power to order the release of the oil.
Clinton urged Congress to pass legislation that would authorize a
way to tap into the new heating oil reserve.
</P>
<P>
   ``The action I take today will leave us far better prepared to
face the winter months, but it does not relieve Congress of the
responsibility to act,'' said Clinton, adding that he has been
asking Congress since March to authorize the creation of a
permanent heating oil reserve.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the House approved legislation that would create a
Northeast oil reserve, but the Senate has not acted.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Bernard Sanders, the Vermont independent who was
chief sponsor of the House measure, said he hopes Clinton's
announcement will send a message to Congress to ``act immediately
so that we can have a reserve up and running as soon as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Massachusetts senators are trying to push legislation in
the Senate for a heating oil reserve system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Northeastern senators from both parties have repeatedly urged
passage of legislation, and I hope the president's action will
break the log jam,'' said Senator Edward M. Kennedy in a written
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Senator John F. Kerry said Congress should ``pass legislation
that will further protect consumers and ensure the reserve is
fiscally and economically sound for the government, consumers and
the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   There are currently 37 million barrels of heating oil in the
United States, down from 65 million barrels this time last year,
said Gene Sperling, the president's chief economic adviser.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to create the reserve in the next 90 days _ before
the heating season arrives _ so that the oil being placed in the
reserve is not diverted from the marketplace, inadvertently driving
the price up, Sperling said.
</P>
<P>
   As outlined by the White House, the Energy Department, through
an agent, will take offers from the private sector to exchange the
Strategic Petroleum Reserve crude oil for up to 2 million barrels
of heating oil, plus transportation and necessary storage.
</P>
<P>
   Companies wanting to participate in the exchange must have
stocks in place in October, and contracts will be awarded to the
companies that offer the ``best exchange value.''
</P>
<P>
   Until now, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve has been tapped only
once _ by President Bush during the 1991 Persian Gulf War.

 By CLAIRE POOLE 
 c.2000 Latin Trade 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    HOUSTON _ In 1995, Ivan Utrera was an up-and-coming executive at
PepsiCo. The Sao Paulo native had just finished a three-year
rotation as international marketing director for Pizza Hut, which
included opening 300 fast-food pizza restaurants in Brazil as well
as others around Latin America. He was shifted back to PepsiCo's
Purchase, N.Y., headquarters as director of U.S. marketing for
Pizza Hut, which sees US$1.5 billion in sales annually.
 &HT;    Yet Utrera was frustrated. ``It got really stifling,'' he says.
``If you wanted to do anything, even change the color of the
napkins, you needed two years' worth of research to see if it was
going to impact anything.''
 &HT;    So Utrera chucked it all in 1995 to start Rodizio Grill, a chain
of Brazilian-style steak houses, or churrascarias. He's opened six
restaurants around the country, from Houston, Texas, to Arlington,
Virginia, and employs 500 people. With revenues of $14 million a
year and operating profits somewhere in the 10 percent to 20
percent range, he's now planning to open three more eateries in the
next 12 months (possible sites: Arizona, Texas and Illinois) and
four more the next year.
 &HT;    ``Brazil doesn't do a very good job of marketing. So one of my
goals is to bring a little more knowledge about Brazil into the
U.S.,'' he says. Utrera is just one of many entrepreneurs
capitalizing on the increasing popularity of Latin American cuisine
in the United States. What's generally been dubbed the Nuevo Latino
movement has now branched off into subsegments, with Argentine and
Brazilian restaurants becoming especially popular.
 &HT;    Brazilian bistros are popping up all over the country, from
Churrascaria Plataforma in New York City to Rhumba in Chicago,
Illinois, to Yolie's Brazilian Steak House in Las Vegas, Nevada.
``There is no point in being prudent at a churrascaria: It is a
Rabelaisian experience,'' The New York Times restaurant critic Ruth
Reichl has written. ``And if you are not prepared to throw caution
to the winds, eating more than you have ever eaten before, it is
not the place for you.''
 &HT;    Utrera's version is taking off. His restaurant chain based in
Littleton, Colorado, was recently declared one of six ``Hot

FAMILY STRATEGY FOR SAN DIEGO 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, July 16) 
 By MARTHA STEVENSON OLSON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   For visitors and San Diegans alike, the city offers some great
attractions: The San Diego Zoo, San Diego Wild Animal Park and
SeaWorld San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   But family outings can quickly get expensive and, without a game
plan, can leave everyone out of sorts and unsatisfied. Doing some
homework before buying tickets and mapping out a route through the
attractions can help save money, time and energy. In San Diego, as
at increasing numbers of theme parks and family-oriented
attractions, it may be worth becoming an annual member, or buying
combination passes, rather than buying separate single tickets,
even if you're planning to visit only once. You won't be able to
put your wallet away _ there are extra-cost features beyond the
entrance gate, not to mention lunch, snacks and souvenirs to buy _
but at least you'll be starting out ahead of the game.
</P>
<P>
   SOME OF THE CHOICES
</P>
<P>
   The San Diego Zoological Society offers an annual membership
that is a bargain: A dual membership is $76 (less for renewals),
and children's memberships are $19 each. (A single adult membership
is $60.) These provide unlimited visits to both the zoo and the
animal park, including free passage on the zoo's aerial tram, the
Skyfari, along with a sheet of coupons and discounts.
</P>
<P>
   With a day's general admission to the zoo running $18, and $8
for children ages 3 to 11, not including the $1.50 cost of a
Skyfari ride, and with a day at the animal park costing $21.95 for
adults and $14.95 for children, the society membership can pay for
itself after one visit to each place. Short-term visitors can also
buy a pass offering one day at the zoo and one day at the animal
park in a five-day period, which costs $38.35 for adults and $23.15
for children.
</P>
<P>
   SeaWorld, with day admission $40 for adults and $30 for children
3 to 11, also offers an annual pass that costs $74.95 for each
adult and $59.95 for children and those 55 and older; it includes
free parking (normally $7 for cars). A Rockin' Summer Nights Pass
can be be obtained with a single day's paid admission, entitling
the holder to return for free after 4 p.m. on any or every night
before Labor Day. And a three-for-one pass allows unlimited
admission during a five-day period to the zoo, the animal park and
SeaWorld for $75 for adults and $55 for children.
</P>
<P>
   Single-day entry fees are sometimes discounted through coupon
promotions with fast-food franchises, newspapers, or other theme
parks. SeaWorld, for example, has a deal with the local Subway
sandwich chain that knocks $5 off a day's admission for up to six
people per coupon. A Southern California Value Pass offers
unlimited admission to SeaWorld and Universal Studios Hollywood
over any 14 consecutive days for $75 adults and $55 children.
</P>
<P>
   At the San Diego Zoo, highlights of the day, including
``enrichment activities,'' when various animals get to play with
something new and different, are posted on a big board at the zoo's
entrance, just in front of the Flamingo Lagoon. The prime
attraction at the zoo these days is Hua Mei, the panda cub born
last August. Zoo gates open at 7:30 a.m. and shut at 9 p.m. through
Labor Day, with the zoo closing at 10 p.m. The panda exhibit is
open from 8 to 11:30 a.m. and from 4 to 8 p.m., with the bonus that
the animals are more likely to be frisky in the cooler hours. Other
nighttime entertainment includes music, magic shows and animal
interactions.
</P>
<P>
   Getting around the zoo's 110 acres can be a challenge. The
easiest option is a Kangaroo Bus Tour pass, which entitles holders
to hop on and off as the bus circles the zoo. The cost is $8, $5
for children 3 to 11. The Skyfari ride, aside from providing a
bird's-eye view of the gorilla enclosure and Balboa Park's ornate
1915 California Tower, connects the entrance side to the western
side of the zoo. Visitors can walk down into Bongo Canyon near the
center of the zoo to see the pandas, and, to save energy, can use
people-moving ramps to get up and out.
</P>
<P>
   There are places to eat and drink throughout and near the park.
Try the snack bars near the entrance, or Albert's Treehouse, a
pleasant, full-service restaurant built on a breezy series of
platforms overlooking Bongo Canyon. Another option is the new Prado
restaurant, an upscale place a short distance from the zoo in
Balboa Park's House of Hospitality. It's possible to leave the zoo
and return the same day by getting your hand stamped at the exit.
</P>
<P>
   OUT OF AFRICA
</P>
<P>
   The Wild Animal Park, on 1,800 acres near Escondido, Calif., 30
miles north of San Diego, presents its own challenges: Its inland
valley gets above 100 degrees most summer days and the lines for
the park's 55-minute railway ride can be long and tedious.
</P>
<P>
   The park is open from 9 a.m. until 10 p.m. through Labor Day,
when it will begin closing again at 5. Heart of Africa, a lakeside
exhibit in the midst of what looks like an African savanna,
features evening performances by Bomani, a dance and drum troupe
from West Africa, and encounters between animals and their keepers.
</P>
<P>
   The newest attraction at the park is Condor Ridge, a rocky
hillside about 10 minutes' walk from the park entrance. Five
California condors, an endangered species brought back from
near-extinction through a captive breeding program (the zoological
society has been a key participant in it) live in a six-story
aviary on the hillside. The huge boulders serve as launching pads
for the birds _ whose wingspans range up to 10 feet _ as well as
places for them to roost.
</P>
<P>
   The best time to visit the ridge is early in the morning, after
the condors are first fed, or very late in the afternoon, when the
setting sun provides a gilded view of the park and the lion
enclosure below. Condor Ridge is also home to other rare and
endangered animals like the desert bighorn sheep and the desert
tortoise.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the lines, most visitors to the park do take the Wgasa
Bush Line Railway, which loops five miles around grazing groups of
giraffe, gazelles, rhinos, elephants and other wildlife from Asia
and Africa.
</P>
<P>
   One way to avoid the wait for the train is to buy a preferred
boarding pass ($4, $3 children) at the railway station and get on
the next train, which otherwise would be free.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors board the train at a different point from where they
get off. Once off, you can walk to the right to the Petting Kraal
and Mombasa Lagoon, or to the left to Lorikeet Landing, where you
can buy food to feed the lorikeets, which are colorful South
American birds about the size of a robin. Also to the left is the
Hidden Jungle exhibit, with its butterflies and cutter ants. Nearby
is the Mombasa Island Cooker, the most diverse of the park's
eateries; it serves Asian and Italian food and salads and has
tables that overlook the lagoon.
</P>
<P>
   A three-minute walk from the lagoon is a meandering path that
passes by a children's playground and into the Heart of Africa, a
simulated East African environment. At Jameson Research Island, set
up like a study camp, there usually is an opportunity to interact
with an animal like an aardvark or an African crested porcupine,
with help from a park educator.

 &HT;    Atlanta fans give the Crime Dog a warm welcome
 &HT;    By Carlos Frias
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - Remember Fred McGriff? The Crime Dog? The resident
home run hitter in Atlanta before Chipper Jones put on 20 pounds of
muscle?
</P>
<P>
   The fans at Turner Field took time to remember Monday evening,
even if just for a brief moment. Prior to the Home Run Derby,
McGriff was interviewed on the field, and the second his likeness
flashed onto the big screen, the fans raised a standing ovation
that made McGriff widen his famous smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fans here have always been great to me,'' he said, looking
around the park. ``It's a great city and a great place to host an
All-Star Game.''
</P>
<P>
   McGriff returned to Atlanta as a five-time All-Star Game
veteran, this time representing the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. But few
can forget what he meant to the Braves in five of the franchises'
most memorable years. Among them, he helped Atlanta to the 1995
World Series title, a year after being named the All-Star Game's
MVP in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't know if he will be remembered as one of the players
that helped build the National League's Team of the '90s. He
doesn't know if people will remember he has homered in 36 different
ball parks, one behind McGwire for the Major League record, or with
six more homers in Tampa Bay, he would become only the second
player in history to hit over 200 in each league.
</P>
<P>
   But on a day like today, six years since being named the MVP of
the 1994 All-Star Game for his pinch-hit, two-run homer in the
ninth, the trophy in his den is a nice reminder of what he meant to
the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've still got it at my house,'' he said. ``People can forget
what you did. Records can be broken. But they can't take that away
from me... Maybe I can get another one.''
</P>
<P>
   McGriff's return was not without its share of grumbling. With a
.272 average, 15 home runs and 58 RBI, McGriff's numbers are not as
impressive as those of Chicago's Frank Thomas, who was left off the
team. Thomas is hitting .340 with 25 home runs and 72 RBI.
Anaheim's Mo Vaughn (.297, 21, 62) and Texas' Rafael Palmeiro
(.289, 21, 61) were also bypassed.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Torre, the American League's manager for the All-Star Game,
took some heat for the selection. Torre admitted first base was the
toughest position and said one reason he picked McGriff was
``because he played for Bobby down there and I thought it was a
good spot.''
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Cox, the Braves manager and skipper for the National
League team, admitted they tried to bring McGriff back when Andres
Galarraga was lost for the year, while he received treatment for
the cancerous tumor in his lower back. To see him back in Atlanta
in any aspect, Cox said, is great for the fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's terrific,'' Cox said. ``He's a very popular guy
here. He's had a lot
</P>
<P>
   of success down there in St. Pete. I think Joe made a great pick
for our fans. I know Mac will bevery excited to be here. It means
a lot to him.''

 UNDATED: park educator.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although SeaWorld San Diego weaves educational and conservation
messages into its programs, it's still an amusement park, with
interactive displays that include dolphin feeding and hands-on
exhibits of starfish and bat rays. And there are several thrill
rides, like whitewater rafting on Shipwreck Rapids and Wild Arctic,
a hair-raising virtual helicopter flight in a simulated polar
storm.
</P>
<P>
   AND NOW, 4D
</P>
<P>
   New this summer is ``Pirates 4D,'' a sensorama movie about a
bunch of hapless pirates. Special effects include, in addition to
the usual 3D in-your-face whangers, such novelties as water
spritzing from the seats, little electric shocks from the seat
backs and warm-water droplets spattering from above (those darned
birds!).
</P>
<P>
   Still, the centerpiece of SeaWorld's attractions are the justly
famous marine mammal shows featuring trained sea lions, dolphins
and Shamu, the orca star. Some lines can be long at the amusement
shows. Build in plenty of waiting time.
</P>
<P>
   Before entering SeaWorld, stop at the guest relations booth for
advice and to make sure the maps given out at the parking lot
kiosks are current (ours wasn't). The maps are supposed to list the
day's special events. As it was, we were advised to pick the shows
we wanted to see and visit the attractions nearby, while generally
circling the park's perimeter.
</P>
<P>
   Directly inside the entry gates is the reservation center, which
can book tours of the park or reserve seats at the daily,
all-you-can-eat Dine With Shamu buffet. After filling your plate,
you eat at poolside tables as Shamu, supervised by trainers,
performs feats like resting his nose on the pool's edge often as
close as a few feet away. Including tax, the cost is $27.47 for
adults and $13.95 for children.
</P>
<P>
   A 90-minute Behind the Scenes tour costs $8 for adults, $7 for
ages 55 and up and children 3 to 11. A Spotlight Tour lasting two
hours features interactions with various animals and costs $22, $18
for children. Petting the bottlenose dolphins is popular, so it's
best to arrive fairly early, bearing dead fish bought nearby.
SeaWorld also has a dolphin interaction pool, where visitors, in
loaned wetsuits and booties, can swim for about 20 minutes with an
actual dolphin. The cost is $125 a person, with admission to the
park required but not included. Reservations are suggested: (877)
436-5746.
</P>
<P>
   The Bayside Skyride, an aerial gondola across part of Mission
Bay and back, and the Skytower ride, a circling observation deck
that climbs the needle at the park's center, are cool and quiet.
The cost is $2.25 each, $3.50 for both.
</P>
<P>
   When planning a visit, remember that theme parks generally are
most crowded on Saturdays, water parks on Sunday. As each weekday
passes, popularity accelerates, with Monday typically the least
crowded, Friday the most crowded. Many parks can provide
information on admission discounts through their general
information line, and it's easier to figure out the numbers before
you get to the admissions gate with impatient children.

NORTHERN IRELAND PARALYZED BY UNIONIST DEMONSTRATIONS

 By WARREN HOGE

<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland _ The Protestant Orange Order
succeeded in practically shutting down Northern Ireland on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Cities and villages turned into ghost towns with only army and
police vehicles moving about the streets.
</P>
<P>
   The summons to paralyze Ulster came from the chapter of the
order in Portadown, County Armagh, which was angered at being
barred from parading on Sunday down an avenue running through a
Catholic neighborhood after annual commemorative services at
Drumcree Church. The militants were already vehemently opposed to
the new power-sharing Catholic-Protestant government.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the parade has been the flash point for
firebombings in the town center, riots on the hillside at whose
crest stands the unadorned 18th century Drumcree Church, and for
widespread disruptions across the province.
</P>
<P>
   With the violence of the past week, Protestant church leaders
and some Orange Order senior officers have criticized the Portadown
lodge for leaving the organization open to the charge of fomenting
disorder. But but Harold Gracey, 63, the group's district master,
has refused to condemn the violence and has urged members to
continue taking to the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Eight straight nights of violence across the province have
brought a familiar tension back to life, and the motivation for
businesses closing at midday could have reflected the fear of being
caught up in the protests as much as of showing support for the
militants.
</P>
<P>
   Public transportation halted early to forestall bus hijackings
and burnings, and people were seen running through downtown streets
to make their homebound connections before midafternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Intimidation also was a factor in clearing the streets.
Neighbors of a municipal pool operator in Portadown said he had
received telephone calls warning that if there were any cars in his
parking lot by 3 p.m., he would be ``burned out.''
</P>
<P>
   At a time when Protestants are increasingly fractious and
insecure, many people have been unnerved by the presence at
demonstrations of Johnny Adair, known as ``Mad Dog,'' a recently
released paramilitary leader with a shaved head, muscular bearing
and cold-eyed glower. His group, the Ulster Freedom Fighters, is
held responsible in a new book called ``Lost Lives'' for the
killings of more than 400 people, most of them Catholic civilians,
over the past 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   The police suspect that some of the nighttime disorder is being
coordinated by Protestant paramilitary groups, which, although on
cease-fire, have the capability to send marauding youths and masked
members into the streets. Adding to the volatility, Protestant
paramilitaries are themselves at loggerheads, with one group, the
Ulster Volunteer Force, accusing the Ulster Freedom Fighters of
being behind gun attacks last week against officers of the
province's police force, the Royal Ulster Constabulary.
</P>
<P>
   At highway junctures across Ulster, some of the 80,000 Orange
Order members, their wives and children gathered in milling groups
to shut down traffic. Roadblocks of hastily nailed together wooden
slats were thrown up on city corners during the declared 4 to 8
p.m. protest period and then set on fire once darkness fell.
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrators surged at police lines and shouted abuse at
officers in various towns, but while daylight held, there were none
of the car burnings and firebombings of recent nights. Police
reported skirmishes with protesters in Portadown and Drumcree
throwing rocks and bottles at officers who responded with water
cannons.
</P>
<P>
   David Trimble, the first minister of the new Northern Ireland
Assembly and leader of the largest Protestant party, the Ulster
Unionists, appealed for calm, saying that anyone resorting to
violence would ``dishonor and disgrace the cause they profess to
support.''
</P>
<P>
   Trimble, once a Portadown Orange Order marcher himself, is a
pariah with the organization now, since it is vehemently opposed to
the new government he heads. The government was set up by the April
1998 peace accord that was aimed at putting an end to three decades
of sectarian struggles that have cost more than 3,600 lives.
Trimble has barely kept his leadership of the Ulster Unionists in
two recent votes that have exposed yet another fissure in the
Protestant ranks between moderates and hard-liners.
</P>
<P>
   The Portadown Orangemen said they were staging their shutdown of
the province to persuade the government-appointed Parades
Commission to reverse its decision to bar them from marching down
the Garvaghy Road, a thoroughfare into town lined on either side by
Catholic housing blocks.
</P>
<P>
   But Peter Mandelson, Britain's Northern Ireland secretary, said
that ``every stone, every missile, every petrol bomb will militate
against'' that goal. Mandelson said he firmly backed the
commission's declaration that the only way for the Portadown
Orangemen to march down the Garvaghy Road was to enter into
dialogue with the people living along it. The Portadown lodge
members have refused to speak directly to the residents or to meet
with members of the Parades Commission.
</P>
<P>
   This was the third straight year that the panel had ruled
against the Portadown Orangemen. Portadown is known as the
Protestant citadel because the Orange Order was founded there in
1795, and the parade from the downtown lodge hall out Dungannon
Street to Drumcree and then back along the Garvaghy Road dates from
1807. There are 2,500 Protestant parades that go off without
incident in Northern Ireland each summer. They mark epochal
Protestant moments like the Battle of the Boyne in 1690, when
William of Orange, the king of England, overcame his Catholic
rival, James II.
</P>
<P>
   Protestants consider them proud expressions of their culture.
Catholics complain that they are reminders of the supremacy
Protestants long held over them here.

COMMENTARY: AN ODE TO JULY 
</HEADLINE>
   By GAIL COLLINS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ah, July. The children commune with Harry Potter while their
parents watch the ``Big Brother'' roommates try to make an alarm
clock out of a couple of potatoes. (Where's Al Gore when you need a
consult?) Just outside our nation's capital, kids of all ages have
been flocking to an arcade in Rockville, Md., to ride on The
Shocker, an electric chair simulation that challenges patrons to
hang on until smoke comes out of their skulls. (Where's George W.
Bush when you need a photo op?)
</P>
<P>
   July is a special month in American politics, a semiofficial
civic vacation from the yearlong presidential campaign. Admittedly,
most Americans have already been on hiatus from this race for so
long they've forgotten the names of the candidates. (Is Gary Bauer
in this somewhere? Whatever happened to Orrin Hatch?) But that was
a springtime form of inattention. We overlooked George W. Bush and
Al Gore absent-mindedly, the way we neglected to catch ``Mission
Impossible 2.'' In July you can ignore politics in a decisive,
activist way, the way we did ``The Patriot.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest political news last weekend in New York City was
that Rudy Giuliani's motorcade got in a wreck en route to a
Mets-Yankees game; this is what happens when you attempt to drive
an SUV to a subway series. ``I was wearing a seat belt, which I
think is a very, very good idea,'' said the uninjured mayor, who
never passes up the opportunity to deliver an improving lecture.
Given the run of luck this guy has had recently, you would not be
surprised if he insisted on being swaddled in bubble wrap.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has turned into a lame duck overnight. You can
practically see pieces of him fading away before your eyes, like
the hero in ``Back to the Future.'' He's not the only term-limited
official around, of course. Look at Bill Clinton these days and
you'll notice an arm disappearing from this picture, a leg from
that. Once the Democratic Convention is over next month, Clinton
will seem as dim as a 20-year-old Polaroid.
</P>
<P>
   But that's an August problem _ August looks like summer, but
it's really autumn with high temperatures, full of back-to-school
sales and professional football. July, on the other hand, is a
month that imposes so few demands that it will be happy if it just
succeeds in eliminating a few more people from the ``Survivor''
island. Three weeks from now, Sean-the-neurologist-with-nipple-ring
and Susan-the-tough-talking-truck-driver will no longer be part of
the ongoing national dialogue, and July can declare victory.
Unless, of course, Al Gore picks one of them as his running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Vice-presidential speculation is very July _ as restfully
meaningless as the All-Star Game. It also drowns out the sound of
the actual presidential race, which is currently something like
this:
</P>
<P>
   Gore Challenges Do-Nothing-for-People Congress. Video available
via satellite and webcast.
</P>
<P>
   Governor Bush to Unveil His Initiative to Ensure Safe Children
and Strong Families in Royal Oak, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   The e-mails keep arriving, but we have stretched out under a
tree, where we can mentally count vice-presidential candidates as
they jump over a fence.
</P>
<P>
   Current conventional wisdom holds that Gore's choice of a
vice-presidential nominee will be greatly influenced by Bush, who
goes first at the Republican Convention in Philadelphia. Bush is
said to be looking for someone boring, the better to avoid a moment
like the one in 1988 when the words ``Dan Quayle'' created a
Mardi-Gras-like sense of anticipation in the press room at the
Republican Convention.
</P>
<P>
   If Bush selects Gov. George Pataki of New York, who was his
classmate at Yale, Gore might pick Sen. Evan Bayh of Indiana, a
fellow alumnus of St. Albans in Washington, D.C. Both slates could
embark on the ceremonial post-convention bus tour wearing their
school jackets, waving pom-poms out the window.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Republican Party ought to consider giving the nod
to Giuliani, who is currently operating under a misalignment of the
stars so powerful that he might serve as a kind of a magnet,
drawing political misfortune away from the guy at the top. If that
happened, Gore would undoubtedly want to hunt up a bigger, more
powerful bad luck magnet of his own _ say, Energy Secretary Bill
Richardson.

   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton established a home heating oil
reserve for the Northeast Monday, hoping to prevent a repeat of
last winter's fuel shortages that drove prices sky high as
residents struggled to stay warm.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton asked Energy Secretary Bill Richardson to prepare to
withdraw oil from the nation's emergency energy supply, the
Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and offer it to oil refiners in
exchange for 2 million barrels of home heating oil. It will be set
aside to prevent oil shortages in the Northeastern states.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winter may seem far off on this hot day, but if we don't do
something now, reserve stocks of heating oil may not be in place
before the cold weather comes,'' Clinton said from the White House
lawn before leaving to speak at the National Governors' Association
meeting in State College, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Chretien, director of Boston Oil Consumers Alliance, said
the creation of the reserve will help control a spike in the price
of home heating oil caused by temporary shortages such as the one
that struck New England last winter. But the reserve will not
affect the day to day price.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's used in a short-term situation,'' Chretien said. ``That 2
million barrels would have come in handy in the first part of 2000.
It's good news to be thinking in July what is going on in the
winter.''
</P>
<P>
   Heating oil prices in the Northeast nearly tripled last February
during a cold spell that oil refiners and the Clinton
Administration alike had failed to anticipate. The sudden price
hikes, brought on by the sudden jump in demand, caused an uproar on
the Eastern Seaboard where residents consume almost three quarters
of US heating oil.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph P. Kennedy II, president of the Citizens Energy
Corporation, said he expects prices to be even higher than they
were during last winter's crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two million additional barrels will barely heat our region for
two days,'' the former US representative from Brighton said in a
written statement. ``A reserve of that size for the whole Northeast
is a small and regrettably inadequate step to protect us against
big price spikes.''
</P>
<P>
   Jason Kauppi, spokesman for Massachusetts Governor Paul
Cellucci, said the president's action is coming a season too late.
Last winter, Clinton declined to tap into the Strategic Petroleum
Reserve, a huge oil reserve in underground salt caverns in Texas
and Louisiana. Set up after the 1973-74 OPEC oil embargo, the
reserve is intended for emergencies only.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously it's good news for New England, it's just too bad
the president didn't take this action in the winter time when we
needed it,'' Kauppi said. ``Now that his vice president is having
some political problems in this region, he sees it fit to release
the oil. We could have used it last winter.''
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton used administrative action to set aside the
reserves, he lacks the legal power to order the release of the oil.
Clinton urged Congress to pass legislation that would authorize a
way to tap into the new heating oil reserve.
</P>
<P>
   ``The action I take today will leave us far better prepared to
face the winter months, but it does not relieve Congress of the
responsibility to act,'' said Clinton, adding that he has been
asking Congress since March to authorize the creation of a
permanent heating oil reserve.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the House approved legislation that would create a
Northeast oil reserve, but the Senate has not acted.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Bernard Sanders, the Vermont independent who was
chief sponsor of the House measure, said he hopes Clinton's
announcement will send a message to Congress to ``act immediately
so that we can have a reserve up and running as soon as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Massachusetts senators are trying to push legislation in
the Senate for a heating oil reserve system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Northeastern senators from both parties have repeatedly urged
passage of legislation, and I hope the president's action will
break the log jam,'' said Senator Edward M. Kennedy in a written
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Senator John F. Kerry said Congress should ``pass legislation
that will further protect consumers and ensure the reserve is
fiscally and economically sound for the government, consumers and
the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   There are currently 37 million barrels of heating oil in the
United States, down from 65 million barrels this time last year,
said Gene Sperling, the president's chief economic adviser.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to create the reserve in the next 90 days _ before
the heating season arrives _ so that the oil being placed in the
reserve is not diverted from the marketplace, inadvertently driving
the price up, Sperling said.
</P>
<P>
   As outlined by the White House, the Energy Department, through
an agent, will take offers from the private sector to exchange the
Strategic Petroleum Reserve crude oil for up to 2 million barrels
of heating oil, plus transportation and necessary storage.
</P>
<P>
   Companies wanting to participate in the exchange must have
stocks in place in October, and contracts will be awarded to the
companies that offer the ``best exchange value.''
</P>
<P>
   Until now, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve has been tapped only
once _ by President Bush during the 1991 Persian Gulf War.

GARCIAPARRA GENTLEMANLY ABOUT CHOICE OF JETER TO START 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's a time-tested American sports cliche: Coach's son
gets the nod. Every time.
</P>
<P>
   This is what Nomar Garciaparra faced when he got to Atlanta for
the All-Star Game. Seattle Mariners shortstop Alex Rodriguez was
elected by fans to start the game but is unable to play because of
a concussion. (A-Rod is one of seven fan favorites who won't play.)
It was up to All-Star (and Yankees) manager Joe Torre to choose a
starter from a shortstop trio of Boston's Garciaparra, New York's
Derek Jeter, and Baltimore's Mike Bordick.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Garciaparra is hitting an eye-popping .389 with 12
homers and 55 RBIs, Torre is going with Jeter (.322, 9, 37).
</P>
<P>
   Coach's son gets the nod. Every time.
</P>
<P>
   As ever, Garciaparra took the high road.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfortunate that A-Rod can't play,'' said the Red Sox
shortstop. ``But as far as who starts, it doesn't matter. I'm a fan
of the game, too, and it's just flattering to even be mentioned
with those guys.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a huge honor,'' acknowledged Jeter. ``You just look at
the shortstop position in the American League. There are so many
deserving players. You can really flip a coin and decide who the
starter is. Maybe it's just my turn in the rotation.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, who is here to watch the game, said, ``I don't know
the procedure and I didn't talk to Mr. Torre about it. They're all
having great years and, basically, it's Mr. Torre's decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre explained, ``Derek Jeter, you know, was right behind Alex
Rodriguez in the voting. I'm a little partial to Derek and, yeah, a
little bit. You know, you have to be around this kid to appreciate
what he's all about. I picked him over Nomar because Nomar started
last year, and I think it's a big thrill for a youngster to start
the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Bordick is the party-crasher in the American League's
super-shortstop club. A-Rod, Nomar, and Jeter are the GQ cover
boys, probably the best trio to play at the position in one era.
Rodriguez has been on four All-Star teams, Garciaparra and Jeter
three each. A-Rod has been voted to start three times, Garciaparra
once. Jeter has yet to win the fan balloting.
</P>
<P>
   A-Rod also was hurt last year when Garciaparra narrowly beat
Jeter in the fan voting (Internet geeks are believed to have pushed
Garciaparra over the top). Garciaparra went 0 for 2 at Fenway Park
(Curt Schilling and Randy Johnson got him out), then took the field
in the bottom of the fourth and saw Jeter running out to replace
him. The public substitution was orchestrated by Torre, who wanted
Garciaparra to get a big hand in front of the home crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had talked about it,'' said Garciaparra. ``Joe told me they
were going to do that and it was a good way to do it. It was classy
on Joe's part. It meant a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeter chuckled and said, ``Hey, it was Boston. That was the only
way to do it so I wouldn't get booed.''
</P>
<P>
   When Jeter went to bat at Fenway, he mimicked Garciaparra's
elaborate batting routine. Then he struck out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him he didn't do it right,'' said Garciaparra. ``If he
did it right, he wouldn't have struck out.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeter said he might imitate Rodriguez. Garciaparra has no plans
to replace Jeter on the field before the start of an inning.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter-for-Rodriguez is one of seven instances in which the
All-Star electee isn't starting because of injury. Other American
League subs-turned-starters are Carl Everett in left field for
Manny Ramirez (hamstring) and Travis Fryman at third base for Cal
Ripken (back). In the National League, it'll be Andres Galarraga at
first base for Mark McGwire (knee tendinitis), Jim Edmonds in
center for Ken Griffey (knee), Vladimir Guerrero in left for Barry
Bonds (broken thumb), and catcher Jason Kendall for Mike Piazza
(concussion courtesy of a Roger Clemens 92 miles per hour
fastball). Also missing is Braves righthander Greg Maddux, who has
been replaced by Cincinnati's Danny Graves, and the inimitable
Pedro Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   Lefthanders David Wells and Randy Johnson are the starting
pitchers for the 71st midsummer joust. Wells is 15-2 with a 3.44
ERA and 100 strikeouts, while Johnson is 14-2 with a 1.80 ERA and
198 strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   Wells said he isn't on a mission to prove the Yankees were wrong
to trade him for Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not here to try to prove a point because of them trading
me,'' said Wells. ``I think I'm going to have success wherever I go
because of the fact that I was determined to go and pitch. I think
the Yankee organization knows, Joe knows that I'm a competitor.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Everett and Garciaparra, the Red Sox will be
represented by closer Derek Lowe. Martinez, due to come off the
disabled list for a start against the Mets Thursday, will not be
eligible to pitch but will be introduced with the American League
squad.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans have won the last three All-Star Games and nine of
the last 12. The AL won last year at Fenway, 4-1. Overall the NL
leads, 40-29-1.

&HT;     CLINTON ATTCKS PLANS FOR MORE POWER PLANTS ON HUDSON RIVER 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By LARA JAKES  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Hillary Rodham Clinton, who has made lower
utility rates a cornerstone pledge of her campaign for the Senate
in New York, criticized the state government Monday for allowing
the construction of new power plants along with Hudson River
without having a plan to assess demand for the power supply.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing relaxed if guarded during a 105-minute meeting with
editors and reporters of the Albany Times Union, the first lady
said New York's attempt to deregulate utility costs has not been as
successful as neighboring states. Moreover, she said, the state's
Public Service Commission has created a ``bottleneck'' bureaucratic
system that is stunting competition among power companies in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting capped off Clinton's five-day upstate tour, during
which the Democratic candidate called the region's economy her
``No. 1 priority'' if elected. The tour also marked Clinton's first
full year on the campaign trail, which started last July on the
Delaware County farm of Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the retiring
Democratic senator she aims to replace.
</P>
<P>
   She will face Rep. Rick Lazio, a Long Island Republican, in the
Nov. 7 election.
</P>
<P>
   The electricity generating plant issue is of particular interest
in the region because of the recent approval of a power plant for
Athens, which supporters hail for creating jobs but critics assail
for potentially endangering the environment. It puts Clinton in an
awkward position as she simultaneously advocates for the
environment and a stronger upstate economy.
</P>
<P>
   Of the electricity supply, she said: ``I'm not yet convinced
there isn't enough of a supply in the United States and Canada to
meet our needs if we structured it differently.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So I have some questions _ not that I'm against them,'' she
said. ``I'm for power plants, where we need them to create more
energy, but I think there are other ways of doing it than siting
all of these plants along the Hudson, which I don't think is
necessarily in the long-term interests of the Hudson Valley.''
</P>
<P>
   She described the Public Service Commission, which regulates
utilities in New York, as a ``bottleneck that has not been to our
benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spent considerable time Monday outlining her overall
economic plan for upstate New York. That plan includes lowering
regional airfares, wiring businesses for the Internet, promoting
tourism and support for farmers.
</P>
<P>
   She also:
</P>
<P>
   _ Reinforced her commitment for an abortion-rights litmus test
for U.S. Supreme Court nominees and other federal judgeships.
</P>
<P>
   _ Lashed out at Republicans who she said failed to deliver their
share of the bargain in reforming welfare.
</P>
<P>
   _ Called for financial and quality of life incentives to help
recruit and keep military personnel.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also acknowledged her unusually high negative ratings
among voters after 12 months of campaigning. Lazio, who just
entered the election in May, is tied with Clinton in the polls,
while the number of undecided voters in the race continues to grow.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a number of people who just really disagree with me
on the issues, and believe that I feel strongly about the issues
... and feel I'm more of a threat to their position than others
are,'' she said in explanation. ``For some people, it's the
accumulated residue of the last eight years, that they don't know
quite what to make of me and people have talked about me who have
never met me and said things about me that aren't true.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But I really am not either surprised or particularly concerned
by people who are opposed to me,'' she said. ``I think there's
going to be a hard-core group of people who would never vote for me
under any circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   Although her campaign has so far raised $18 million, Clinton
estimated that Lazio and his allies could outspend her by up to
3-to-1 in what is anticipated to be one of the most expensive
Senate races in national history. Lazio has so far raised about $8
million but will almost certainly be helped with millions of
dollars from the state and national GOP committees.
</P>
<P>
   She called herself a ``zealot'' for overhauling campaign finance
laws, even though her own joint fund-raising committee _ which
collects ``soft money,'' which are legal but unregulated donations
_ had around $4 million at the end of March.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Clinton sounded confident in describing her year on the
trail, and of the election's outcome. She is the first first lady
to run for public office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really believe that most New Yorkers agree with me on the
issues,'' she said. ``So my job is to make sure they know where I
stand on the issues as opposed to my opponent. ... And I bring a
commitment to persevere on behalf of what I believe. And I am not a
quitter.''

A MEETING OF DIVAS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROB LOWMAN 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Audra McDonald joked that Patti LuPone called her a ``devie'' _ a
diva in training _ while LuPone herself was a ``devaah.'' But it
was evident during Friday's Hollywood Bowl concert that the
Broadway superstars formed a mutual admiration society, which made
their spectacular performance even more special.
</P>
<P>
   Though it was conductor John Mauceri's 200th concert with the
Hollywood Bowl Orchestra, the evening was not a trip down memory
lane, but a celebration. And it's hard to think of a better way to
celebrate than with this first-time pairing of LuPone and McDonald,
who was making her Bowl debut.
</P>
<P>
   The orchestra kicked off the proceeding with the overture from
``Gypsy,'' and everything was coming up roses for the rest of the
evening.
</P>
<P>
   LuPone, not shying away from the Barbra Streisand mystique,
followed with a vibrant rendition of ``Don't Rain on My Parade''
from ``Funny Girl.'' Next was Kurt Weill's ``It Never Was You''
from ``Knickerbocker Holiday,'' which led to a Mauceri-arranged,
rather subdued but lovely instrumental version of Weill songs from
``Mack the Knife'' to ``September Song.''
</P>
<P>
   McDonald was up next with a splendid rendition of Harold Arlen's
``A Sleepin' Bee'' (``I'm on an Arlen kick,'' she noted). Within
it, McDonald showed why she's the reigning queen of Broadway _
going from an operatic trill to an almost bluesy growl within a few
notes and making it all seem perfectly natural.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For more than a century, New York and Chicago have
alternated outdoing each other by building the tallest skyscraper
in the United States. Their art museums have long competed for some
of the world's great paintings. And their sports teams _ be it the
Giants and Bears in football during the 1950s or the Knicks and
Bulls in basketball more recently _ have repeatedly battled for
championships.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes the latest skirmish in a long civic rivalry: the
behind-the-scenes struggle over which city might become the
take-off point for a lucrative set of new flights to China
scheduled to begin next April. The decision is due this summer from
the Transportation Department amid a flurry of subtle lobbying from
members of Congress and former top Clinton administration
officials, and the award is coveted because of the increase in
travel expected to follow once China enters the World Trade
Organization.
</P>
<P>
   In New York's corner is Delta Air Lines, which wants to fly to
Beijing from John F. Kennedy International Airport. With support
from Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and much of the state's congressional
delegation, Delta executives are arguing that New York's size and
economic importance so outweigh Chicago's as to make the decision
an easy one.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York is the most important aviation market on the
planet,'' Leo Mullin, Delta's chief executive, said.
</P>
<P>
   American Airlines, which would fly from Chicago's O'Hare
International Airport to Shanghai, responds that geography trumps
demographics. The Midwest's unofficial capital is an excellent
gathering point for passengers and is a shorter hop over the North
Pole to China, American and its supporters say. New York, important
as it is, is isolated from the rest of the country, they say, a
complaint New Yorkers have heard before.
</P>
<P>
   But even as the Big Apple and the Windy City highlight each
other's flaws, the bickering between Delta and American may help
open the door to another well-connected contender: United Parcel
Service. The U.S. aviation agreement with China, unlike any other
in memory, forces Transportation Department officials to choose
between passenger and cargo carriers, rather than allocating routes
to each separately.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're sort of in new territory, in terms of the department
trying to make an analysis,'' said Will Ris, American's senior vice
president for government affairs.
</P>
<P>
   UPS wants the same right to fly to China that its chief
competitor, Federal Express, already enjoys. With the help of the
Teamsters, its largest union, UPS _ one of the biggest campaign
contributors in the country _ has lined up a list of supporters
that includes more than 300 members of Congress. ``This is our
number one international priority,'' said Tom Weidemeyer, the
president of UPS Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   The company's allies have inundated the Transportation
Department with letters saying that the cargo business needs a new
entrant much more than the passenger business does. Currently,
Federal Express is the only American cargo company to fly directly
to China, although UPS flies to Hong Kong and its partners
distribute packages from there. Northwest Airlines and United
Airlines both now carry passengers to Beijing and Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has not been a more important carrier-selection case
before DOT since deregulation,'' more than two decades ago,
American wrote in its official filing. ``This one transcends
aviation.''
</P>
<P>
   The passenger airlines argue that opening up their market to
greater competition will spur travel between the two countries and
accelerate the kind of political change the United States wants to
see in China. UPS says it can lower the price of shipping goods
between the world's biggest economy and its most populous nation,
which should have a big effect on global trade.
</P>
<P>
   The carriers' deadline for making their official case has
recently passed. A decision is due soon, but it already has taken
longer than other cases because of the complexity of the filings,
analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, nobody really knows quite what's going on right
now,'' said Dale Bumpers, the former senator from Arkansas that
American hired to help its case.
</P>
<P>
   President Bill Clinton and Zhu Rongji, China's premier,
negotiated the new aviation treaty at their April 1999 meeting
here, when Zhu was willing to make concessions in an effort to
convince the Clinton administration to back China's entry into the
World Trade Organization. The pact did not go as far as American
government officials and airline executives would like, but it
allowed for the doubling of flights to about eight each day _ split
equally between American and Chinese airlines. And it gave each
country the right to designate one more airline to fly between the
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Even the airlines that already serve the market have become
involved in the political maneuvering. Currently, Northwest flies
to Beijing and Shanghai from Detroit. United flies from San
Francisco to Beijing and, via Tokyo, to Shanghai. But in a move
that most analysts consider an effort to ward off American's bid
for the new flights, United has announced that it will switch the
Shanghai flights to Chicago next April and no longer make a stop in
Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   The incumbents, including FDX Corp.'s Federal Express, have also
applied for some of the 10 new weekly round trips that the
Transportation Department will hand out. Still, lobbyists expect
the new entrant to get most of them so it can establish itself. In
addition, Polar Air, a small cargo carrier, has applied for the
Chinese routes, but it has little support in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   All along, federal law has barred the companies from directly
lobbying the Transportation Department official who oversees the
process, A. Bradford Mims. At a recent meeting of an international
airline industry group in Sydney, Australia, for instance, Delta's
Mullin said he had a long discussion with Mims, all about rules on
how much noise airplanes can make. ``I didn't mention China once,''
Mullin said. (Through a spokesman, Mims declined to comment.)
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the airlines have hired some of Washington's
best-connected lobbyists. Mickey Kantor, the former Commerce
Secretary and top trade representative in the Clinton
administration, has sent written testimony on behalf of UPS, and
Bumpers helped American, a unit of the AMR Corp., write its
application.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The companies have also asked their outside supporters to write
letters to the Transportation Department, though executives are
barred from asking the politicians to lobby Clinton administration
officials more directly. Hundreds of mayors, governors and members
of Congress have weighed in, breaking down along predictable
geographic lines. Richard Daley, the mayor of Chicago and brother
of Vice President Al Gore's campaign chairman, backs American. Sen.
Charles Schumer, D-New York, supports Delta. For either city, a
victory would mean new jobs, more trade with China and increased
tax revenue.
</P>
<P>
   One of the New Yorkers' biggest advantages is the imbalance that
currently exists between the Midwest and East Coast. Detroit is
already the take-off point for all of Northwest's flights to China.
Once United makes its change, Chicago will have direct flights,
too.
</P>
<P>
   ``That makes American's bid redundant,'' said Jon F. Ask, the
managing director of Global Aviation Associates, a Washington
consulting firm not working for any of the applicants. Meanwhile,
no airline flies between the East Coast and China.
</P>
<P>
   American's executives and their Midwestern supporters respond
that Delta's flight would not actually help many eastern cities
other than New York. Delta flies from only 29 cities to Kennedy
Airport, about 60 fewer than American and its regional partner,
American Eagle, does at O'Hare. As a result, many passengers would
have to make two flights just to get Kennedy, the Chicago's
proponents say.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a resident of Syracuse might have to fly first to
Atlanta and then north to New York to catch Delta's flight to
China. In its filing, UPS argued that many people would instead
choose to fly Northwest through Detroit because it would be a
shorter trip. The congestion in the skies above New York does not
help Delta's case, either.
</P>
<P>
   The more fundamental decision facing Mims and his colleagues at
the Transportation Department, however, is whether they should
award the new route to a passenger airline or a cargo carrier.
Analysts say that decision is a close call.
</P>
<P>
   UPS's strongest argument is that it would become only the second
American shipper to fly to China, while two U.S.-based passenger
airlines do. The company is supported by Northwest and United,
which say they currently lose money on their flights to China.
``The market is terribly overserved,'' Gary Wilson, Northwest's
chairman, said. ``I know everybody views China as a great new
market, but it's been viewed as a great new market for 500 years.''
</P>
<P>
   UPS, however, already flies to Hong Kong, and Chinese partner
companies pick up and drop off packages there. According to an
Arthur Andersen study commissioned by American, that service allows
UPS and DHL, which also lacks direct service, to get packages to
the United States almost as fast as Federal Express.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Weidemeyer, UPS's chairman, said the carrier's broad
support, from politicians in every region in the country, indicate
that it has the best application. Even some members of the New York
House delegation listed by Delta on its Web site as supporters _
Rep. Louise Slaughter, a Democrat from Rochester, for example, _
actually back UPS, according to letters they have written. They say
Delta should receive the new rights only if the administration
decides to select a passenger airline.
</P>
<P>
   The Teamsters have also written letters on behalf of UPS and
with Gore looking to shore up the support of labor leaders angered
by his position on other trade issues, the union could be an
important voice. Even American and Delta acknowledge that UPS has
built the strongest lobbying effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``They do have, probably, a political advantage because of the
number of people they employ and because of the members of Congress
they've signed up,'' Bumpers said. ``They operate not only in every
state, but in every village of every state.''
</P>
<P>
   With all three airlines presenting strong cases, the decision,
in the end, is bound to be influenced by the White House and a host
of considerations particular to each option. American and Delta
officials hope that their backers _ in Chicago and New York
respectively _ will cancel out some of UPS's support, and that the
administration will decide new passenger service is simply more
important.
</P>
<P>
   But only one airline will can win the Chinese routes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing wrong with UPS's proposal or Delta's,'' said
Ris, the lobbyist for American. ``The real problem is that we have
been able to negotiate only one new carrier with China.''

 &HT;    Bush gets lukewarm reception at NAACP event
 &HT;    By Jena Heath
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ Gov. George W. Bush took his brand of racial
inclusiveness to the NAACP's 91st annual convention Monday, where
he acknowledged the lingering effects of racism and pledged to make
civil rights enforcement a ``cornerstone'' of his administration
should he win the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Bush received a polite_ at moments even warm _ reception from
the nation's largest civil rights group whose members have
traditionally voted Democratic in overwhelming numbers. The
500,000-member National Association for the Advancement of Colored
People is working to register 4 million voters this year.
</P>
<P>
   Bush got his most enthusiastic response when he acknowledged the
frosty relations between the NAACP and the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   ``I recognize that the history of the Republican party and the
NAACP has not been one of regular partnership,'' he said to rousing
applause. ``But our nation is harmed when we let our differences
separate us and divide us. So while some in my party have avoided
the NAACP, and while some in the NAACP have avoided my party, I'm
proud to be here.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, he said: ``For my party, there's no escaping the reality
that the Party of Lincoln has not always carried the mantle of
Lincoln.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush offered no new proposals to strengthen race relations.
Instead, he discussed previously unveiled initiatives, including
ways to help low income people buy homes and allowing parents whose
children attend failing schools to use taxpayer money for private
education. He dubbed these and other ideas his, ``New Prosperity
Initiative.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bush's appearance in Baltimore, home to the NAACP's national
office, was as much about symbolism as it was about substance. In
recent weeks, Bush has been shoring up his, ``compassionate
conservative'' credentials, appearing before two Latino groups _
the League of United Latin American Citizens and the National
Council of La Raza _ and the conservative, African American
Congress on Racial Equality.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is seeking to recapture the moderate mantle he wore before
his speech at South Carolina's Bob Jones University, a
fundamentalist institution that, at the time, banned interracial
dating and has an anti-Catholic philosophy. Bush also angered many
African Americans when he refused to enter the fray over removing
the Confederate flag from the South Carolina statehouse.
</P>
<P>
   Former Maryland legislator Clarence Mitchell III said Bush
deserves credit for his appearance Monday. Mitchell, a former
president of the National Black Caucus of State Legislators whose
family is a Maryland political dynasty, said he believes Bush can
win over a sizeable number of African American voters.
</P>
<P>
   Exit polls showed Bush winning 15 percent of African-Americans'
votes in Texas in 1994. He nearly doubled that, to 27 percent, in
his 1998 re-election.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he gets a lot of points for showing up, for being
here,'' Mitchell said. ``I think he gets further points for what he
said. I mean he's opened the door. He wasn't specific. Nobody was
looking for specifics, but he talked in generalities about those
issues that have caused many people, including myself, to want to
know more.''
</P>
<P>
   Saying that, ``we cannot afford to have an America segregated by
class, by race or by aspiration,'' Bush spoke at length about his
education proposals, asserting that high standards and local
control is the formula to improve education across racial lines.
</P>
<P>
   He also pledged to, ``lift regulations that hamper private and
faith-based programs,'' and suggested offering grants to mentoring
programs and ministries that work with children whose parents are
in prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not calling for government to step back from its
responsibilities, but to share in them,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's remarks were interrupted early on by death penalty
protestors who held signs that said, ``Abolish the Racist Death
Penalty'' and ``George Bush Executed Gary Graham (aka Shaka
Sankoba) An Innocent Man.'' Chanting, ``Remember Gary Graham,'' the
handful of protestors were ushered out of the massive room at the
Baltimore Convention Center after Frank Humphrey, a member of the
NAACP's national board of directors, exhorted them to, ``put down
the signs and take your seats.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also garnered criticism from U.S. Rep. Eddie Bernice
Johnson, D-Dallas, who held a press conference along with state
Rep. Senfronia Thompson, D-Houston, and others to criticize Bush's
record in Texas. Johnson criticized Bush for coining the phrase
compassionate conservative even as he failed to help pass a
hate-crime law in Texas last year.
</P>
<P>
   Eleanor Holmes Norton, a Democrat and District of Columbia
delegate, also blasted Bush for failing to talk about the death
penalty and other issues, such as social security, prescription
drugs and how he would approach nominating candidates for at least
three anticipated openings on the Supreme Court. Norton said Bush
needs to do more than show up before minority audiences. He needs
to talk issues and specifics, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He essentially expected us to give him points for coming,''
she said. ``What (Bush) fails to understand is how issue-oriented
the NAACP and African-Americans are. They really take names and
keep score.''

EXPECTATIONS DIMMED FOR CAMP DAVID PEACE TALKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (With: MIDEAST-ISRAEL and MIDEAST-ISSUES)  
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Stunned by the political drama in Israel, the
Clinton administration tried Monday to put the best face on
prospects for the Camp David summit despite the weakened position
of Prime Minister Ehud Barak, saying that he still had sufficient
popular support to reach an agreement with the Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat and sell it back home.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who called the Camp David summit meeting after a series
of requests by Barak, praised both Arafat and Barak as leaders who
had the ``vision, the knowledge, the experience and the ability and
the sheer guts to do what it takes.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the administration had not anticipated that Barak would
arrive for the opening of the summit meeting Tuesday dependent for
his political survival on the parliamentary votes of Communist and
Arab parties. There was also surprise among officials here that
Barak's foreign minister, David Levy, apparently piqued at not
being included in the prime minister's inner circle, refused to
come.
</P>
<P>
   The slide in Barak's political fortunes took place as
administration officials were packing their bags for the trip to
Camp David and environs. Some officials were adding last-minute
touches to talking points as the no-confidence vote unfolded in the
Israeli parliament. Much of the State Department's press operations
moved to the second-grade classroom at Thurmont Elementary School
in Thurmont, a town on the edge of Camp David, where the
administration will brief the press on small snippets of
nonsubstantive information.
</P>
<P>
   There were preparations, too, to welcome Barak and Arafat and
their teams of negotiators, limited to about 12 on each side. Barak
was accompanied, among others, by his chief negotiators, Shlomo
Ben-Ami, a popular Labor Party politician.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat headed for Washington with a team representing a wide
spectrum of the Palestinian Authority's political thinking. His
chief negotiator is Abu Ala, the head of the Palestinian assembly
in Ramallah and a veteran from the secret 1993 Oslo proceedings
that set the stage for this Camp David summit.
</P>
<P>
   But almost all the focus Monday was on Barak, who was widely
referred to as a top-flight soldier but a less than top-flight
politician.
</P>
<P>
   Describing the reaction to Barak's tumultuous day in Jerusalem,
one official said, ``This was like lightning on a clear day.''
</P>
<P>
   But turning a seeming negative into a positive, a senior
administration official argued that Barak's predicament
``underscored that the prime minister is willing to take the
political heat for moving forward.''
</P>
<P>
   This in turn would enable Clinton to persuade Arafat that the
prime minister was the ``best'' Israeli leader with whom to deal
because few politicians would be willing to risk their positions
and offer such compromises as Barak, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   In pushing aside the perception of the prime minister's weakness
as he arrived _ an expected 12 hours later than planned because of
the no-confidence vote _ the senior official said that the White
House was unchanged in its view that Barak had the resolve to
complete an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said Monday morning that
Barak enjoyed the support of more than 55 percent of Israelis and
hence would be able to go to the people with an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   But Israeli opinion surveys were quite fickle, an administration
official said, adding that it was a thin reed to hang the future of
an agreement, yet to be negotiated, on polling.
</P>
<P>
   Among diplomats in the region and Middle East experts, there
appeared to be a consensus that the chances for a overall end of
conflict agreement had diminished.
</P>
<P>
   One experienced diplomat in the region said that Barak would
have to fight for the toughest terms he could because any agreement
would be portrayed as a sell-out by the right wing in Israel. At
the same time, Arafat, this diplomat said, would see that the
Israeli leader was ``desperate'' for an accord and would, in turn,
toughen his conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has left itself various possibilities for
claiming success. In announcing the summit last week, Clinton said
that he wanted an agreement on the ``core issues'' that had fueled
the Israeli-Palestinian conflict for more than 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   But he also set a slightly lesser goal, saying that the summit
would be where the two leaders would ``start drawing the contours
of the long-awaited peace,'' a phrase that seemed to indicate an
agreement on some general principles might also be enough.
</P>
<P>
   The collapse of Barak's coalition spurred a serious divisions
within the American Jewish community. One group of American Jewish
leaders, including Leon Levy, a past chairman of the Conference of
Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, criticized Barak
for preparing to give what it called lop-sided concessions to
Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   Another group of 315 leaders, including four past chairmen of
the Conference of Presidents, signed a letter Monday saying that
``the overwhelming majority of American Jews and indeed all
Americans support Israel's peace initiative.''

 &HT;    Digital cameras, recordable CDs great for storing memories
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Sometimes, to listen to me talk, you'd think that I
didn't like technology at all. A lot of times I end up complaining
about how it has messed with my life in bad ways.
</P>
<P>
   And it's partly true. Cellular phones bug me, junk e-mail drives
me crazy, Internet chat rooms seem like bad parties full of
dull-witted people, the debate between Mac owners and PC folk bores
me, and I will be able to live the rest of my life happily without
receiving another e-mailed joke.
</P>
<P>
   But since I write about technology, there are some things you
need to understand. I do love technology, have loved it since I was
a kid messing with ham radios, sending frog astronauts into near
space _ and usually an early grave _ with homemade rockets.
</P>
<P>
   Technology is great. It's just that it's somehow become a
religion instead of a tool.
</P>
<P>
   But there are some great tools out there, and today I'll tell
you about some of the ones that do impress me and are useful in my
life.
</P>
<P>
   We'll start with digital cameras. I started thinking about the
trend toward these filmless cameras last night while _ in a fit of
nostalgia _ looking through some old photographs taken when I was a
kid. Looking at those photographs you'd have thought that I come
from a long line of pastel-colored people.
</P>
<P>
   You'll hear a lot of good reasons to get a digital camera,
including how easy it makes it to send a photograph by e-mail to
relatives and friends. And those are good reasons. But _ if you are
the kind of person who wants future generations of your family to
see how you really look _ digital cameras have another advantage.
Unlike photographic prints, where the the chemistry that creates
the images are doomed to eventually blotch and fade into
nothingness, a digital photograph should look the same 100 years
from now.
</P>
<P>
   And that brings me to the second gadget that seems to have a
real future: the recordable CD. If you have a lot of photographs,
you can transfer them to the CD and store it away. Unlike magnetic
recording devices, if stored properly, it should last for a century
or two. (And if your great-great-grandchildren wish, they can copy
it a hundred years from now. Unlike duplicating a videotape, the
copy will be identical to the original with no loss of quality.)
</P>
<P>
   The mass storage available on a CD and its semipermanence make
it a great place to store other family memories including texts
about the family tree, precious letters and other information that
you'd like to keep around. Just one quick tip: Make two copies.
Keep one at home and store another one in a safe deposit box or
with a friend. That way if your home is ever struck by fire or some
other disaster, you won't lose the memories.
</P>
<P>
   The third technological marvel that I recommend to you is a UPS,
an uninterrupted power supply. Years ago, when I started writing
about computers, the UPS was something reserved for businesses and
government. It was too expensive for home users. But nowadays, you
can buy one for $100 or so, and it's worth every penny.
</P>
<P>
   A UPS is basically a large battery connected to circuitry that
converts the battery power into current that your PC can use. When
the power goes out at your house _ and, at my house at least, that
happens at least six or seven times a year _ the UPS automatically
kicks in to supply an uninterrupted source of power. That means
you'll have time to shut down your computer normally and save your
work. And since a UPS also provides excellent protection against
power surges and dips, your PC should work better with fewer screen
freezes and also last longer. The power dips and surges gradually
do damage to your machine.
</P>
<P>
   There is a lot of useless and expensive software and hardware
out there. But I don't know a soul _ truly _ who regrets owning any
of the devices I've mentioned today.

 &HT;    For the Redskins, high payroll means the future is now
 &HT;    By Ken Sugiura
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - Daniel Snyder dropped out of college to start his own
business. At age 31, he became the youngest CEO of a company traded
on the New York Stock Exchange. At 35, he sold his Snyder
Communications company for $2.07 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder's motto isn't ``slow and steady wins the race.'' In May
1999, he dropped $800 million for the Washington Redskins and what
was then Jack Kent Cooke Stadium, now FedEx Field.
</P>
<P>
   So it raised few eyebrows when the Redskins did a cannonball
into this offseason's free-agent pool.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL's 30 teams have a number of philosophies on reaching the
top. In Snyder's first full offseason as owner, the Redskins made
clear their method of business.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears winning right now is very important to them,''
Tennessee Titans general manager Floyd Reese said.
</P>
<P>
   Redskins player personnel director Vinny Cerrato said, ``The
reason you're in the NFL is to win the Super Bowl, and that's what
we're trying to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Rarely, though, has a team tried to win it before training camp.
Washington signed a slew of veteran players to a vault's worth of
contracts. The Redskins snagged the biggest name on the market,
cornerback Deion Sanders, late of the Cowboys, to a seven-year, $56
million contract with a signing bonus of $8 million.
</P>
<P>
   They have been called risky, foolish and short-sighted. They are
being criticized for finagling the salary cap and imperiling their
future. But if the Redskins end up hoisting the Vince Lombardi
Trophy in January, they will be the envy of the league.
</P>
<P>
   Falcons coach Dan Reeves still calls the Super Bowl champion
Rams the team to beat. But Reeves also said, ``It'll be interesting
to see.''
</P>
<P>
   On paper, it's a great collection of names. Defensive end Bruce
Smith, signed from the Buffalo Bills, is a future Hall of Famer.
Safety Mark Carrier has 31 career interceptions and is a three-time
Pro Bowler. Quarterback Jeff George, whisked away from the Vikings,
last year threw for 2,816 yards and 23 touchdowns in only 12 games
_ and he's the backup.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Redskins still have to play the 16-game schedule.
Sanders, because of injuries or his now-complete dalliance with
baseball, has played a full 16-game season only twice. Carrier,
Sanders and George all are 32 and much closer to the end of their
careers than the start. Smith, 37, is older than the owner.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knows how the parts will fit together. The Redskins only
have to look back to the 1998 season, when they obtained two of the
highest-priced defensive linemen in the league, Dan Wilkinson and
Dana Stubblefield and raised expectations the way they are doing
now. Washington flopped its way to a 6-10 record.
</P>
<P>
   ``You lose six or eight players (each season and) sign six or
eight,'' Reeves said, ``and you don't know what's going to
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Further, the age of Sanders and his free-agent cohorts, not to
mention their big salaries scraping the salary cap ceiling like a
helium balloon, lead some to think that the Redskins have a very
narrow window of opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt you can't give a 32-year-old guy an
eight-year contract and not feel the repercussions of that at some
point,'' Titans GM Reese said.
</P>
<P>
   Cerrato, though, isn't concerned. So long as a top quarterback
is in place, a team will be competitive, he said. The Redskins have
two of them, George and Brad Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers kept their dynasty alive largely because Joe Montana,
who will make the Hall of Fame later this month, was succeeded by
Steve Young, who will join him five years from now. Now that Jeff
Garcia is replacing the retired Young, 49ers' number finally might
be up.
</P>
<P>
   The scarcity of star quarterbacks and the limitations of the
salary cap have turned the peak of the football world into a
slippery place.
</P>
<P>
   Which, perhaps, makes Snyder's win-it-now ambition all the more
logical, and certainly more fun to watch. It would have been easy
to stick with what the Redskins had. They won the NFC East and
drafted Penn State linebacker LaVar Arrington and Alabama offensive
tackle Chris Samuels with the second and third picks in the draft,
respectively. They could have settled for one or two free agents.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Snyder is forcing the action. The Redskins all-star
team will win the Super Bowl or go broke trying.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't have a better person to work for,'' Cerrato said.
</P>
<P>
   The 35-year-old multimillionaire has at least one more admirer
in the football biz.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing you like in our business,'' Reese said, ``you like
somebody that puts together a plan, understands what they're living
with and goes out and does it.''

 &HT;    Boards of AOL, Time Warner to huddle
 &HT;    By Matt Kempner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Some of today's power hitting at Turner Field won't be
at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   The boards and top executives of both America Online and Time
Warner are in Atlanta to talk about how their businesses will look
after they merge.
</P>
<P>
   While in town, they will be at the stadium named for Time
Warner's vice chairman, watching the All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   The management teams of the two companies have had lots of
meetings to hash out what the new AOL Time Warner will look like.
But this will be the first meeting of both full boards since merger
plans were announced in January.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner declined to comment on specific issues that will be
on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
   For several years, Time Warner's top management has held annual
planning retreats with the company's board.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year,'' company spokesman Ed Adler said, ``part of the
planning will be the planning for post-merger.''
</P>
<P>
   It's likely that board members from both companies will be
briefed on ideas for how AOL and Time Warner businesses can work
together.
</P>
<P>
   Lots of issues have to be worked out as the companies intertwine
AOL's Internet power with Time Warner's print and TV holdings _
including its Atlanta-based Turner Broadcasting System.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a ton of different ways they can develop
synergies,'' said analyst Tom Wolzien, of Sanford C. Bernstein.
</P>
<P>
   The merger needs federal regulatory approval, but executives
continue to predict they will complete the deal this fall.
Shareholders approved the merger in separate votes last month.
</P>
<P>
   The new company would have a 16-member board with eight members
designated by AOL and eight by Time Warner. Ted Turner, Time
Warner's vice chairman, would be co-vice chairman of the new board.
</P>
<P>
   Wolzien said the companies might want to solidify ownership of
some Time Warner holdings. For example, 25 percent of HBO is owned
indirectly by AT&AMP;T, and one option might be to buy AT&AMP;T's interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can untangle some of those things,'' Wolzien said.

FUEL RESERVE ESTABLISHED TO RESTRAIN HEATING OIL PRICES 
</HEADLINE>
   By NEELA BANERJEE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
  Reacting to widespread concern over climbing heating oil prices
and low inventories, President Clinton announced a plan Monday to
establish a 2-million-barrel fuel reserve for the Northeast, where
most of the country's heating oil is consumed.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The plan calls for swapping crude oil from the federal
government's 570-million-barrel strategic petroleum reserve for
heating oil from refineries or marketers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winter may seem far off on this hot day, but if we don't do
something now, reserve stocks of heating oil may not be in place
before the cold weather comes,'' Clinton said. ``The action I take
today will leave us far better prepared to face the winter months,
but it does not relieve Congress of the responsibility to act.''
</P>
<P>
   But some analysts and politicians portrayed the plans to create
a reserve as a symbolic gesture that might temporarily placate
consumers but would not be enough to reverse spiraling prices nor
compensate for a nationwide shortfall in heating oil inventories.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a good first step, but we have a
36-million-barrel shortfall in heating oil,'' said Sen. Charles
Schumer, D-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could prevent the worst of the price spikes, but it won't
be large enough to deal with the root problem of a supply shortfall
and high demand.''
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally in the summer refineries begin to stockpile
distillate, which includes heating oil and diesel. But thriving
United States companies have been shipping a prodigious amount of
goods around the country, which has led to uncharacteristically
high demand for diesel.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, there are only 103.7 million barrels of distillate
fuel oil stockpiled so far, compared with 137.3 million barrels at
the same time last year, according to the U.S. Energy Information
Administration. In the Northeast, this year's stockpiles are off by
a similar margin.
</P>
<P>
   Low inventories, in turn, have driven heating oil prices up 10
percent in the last month alone. The fear is the prices will
continue to rise and that the Northeast may suffer a repeat of last
winter's troubles, when a heating oil shortage led to a doubling in
fuel prices.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said that the Defense Energy Supply
Center, a Defense Department unit responsible for military fuel
procurement, will begin seeking offers in about two weeks from
refiners in exchange for the strategic petroleum reserve crude. The
administration said it would try to have the heating oil reserve in
place by October.
</P>
<P>
   But it is uncertain what kind of events or price levels would
lead to the release of the fuel. The administration and Congress
would have to come up with explicit guidelines for a so-called
trigger to distribute the heating oil, which could turn into a
tug-of-war because of impending elections. The government would
also have to trade more than two million barrels of crude to get
the heating oil, because the heating oil costs more than the crude
being offered, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials were also vague about steps the government
could take to soften the blow an even greater number of consumers
will feel this winter from high natural gas prices, which has
doubled from levels a year ago because of higher-than-usual demand.
</P>
<P>
   The administration is trying to persuade Congress to pass an oil
and gas production tax break to increase natural gas supplies. But
even if the administration succeeded, consumers would not enjoy
lower prices until late winter.
</P>
<P>
   The only bit of consolation for consumers came from a decline in
crude oil prices, as the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries seemed to be softening toward Saudi Arabia's plan to
produce an additional 500,000 barrels a day. At the New York
Mercantile Exchange, the benchmark August crude closed at $29.69 a
barrel, down 59 cents from Friday.

 &HT;    Home Depot charms NYSE crowd
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Home Depot filled Wall Street with its raucous charm
Monday to celebrate the opening of the retailer's 1,000th store.
</P>
<P>
   With the smell of sawdust on the streets outside the New York
Stock Exchange, co-founder and Chief Executive Arthur Blank rang
the market's opening bell. Eleven store employees joined Blank on
the opening platform, along with co-founders Bernie Marcus and Ken
Langone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept asking, `Why me?' when I got picked to do this,'' said
Laura James, an employee at the Home Depot in Snellville. ``This is
awesome ... but things move really fast here,'' said James, who was
winded from a dash to the trading floor to see Blank make the first
ceremonial trade of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath a 2,200-square-foot orange apron, a contingent of nearly
100 Home Depot employees went to work on Broad Street in front of
the NYSE. Pop music blared from loudspeakers as employees in
T-shirts and jeans showed Wall Street workers how to use drills and
sanders. Some passersby frowned and shook their heads at the
H-O-M-E D-E-P-O-T cheers, but most stopped for free aprons and
hats.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot employees built three gazebos during the celebration.
They will be donated to New York parks.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got married, that was exciting... and when I had
grandchildren, that was exciting, but this is right up there with
all of those,'' said Ralph Armstrong, a Home Depot employee at the
South Attleboro, Mass., store. ``I stuck my head right between
Bernie's and Arthur's (on the bell platform).''
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time Home Depot rang the starting bell, a
ceremony reserved for dignitaries, initial public offerings and
company milestones. The last time Home Depot's co-founders gathered
at the stock exchange was when the company went public in 1981.
With just 16 stores at the time, investors were banking on the
retailer's potential more than its track record, Blank noted after
he left the trading floor Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot, which had sales of $38.4 billion last year, is now
one of the 40 most valuable companies trading on the NYSE, said
Dick Grasso, chairman of the exchange. ``Never in our history has a
company reached something like that in a 20-year time span,''
Grasso said.
</P>
<P>
   Stores opening this week in Mansfield, Ohio; Chicago Ridge,
Ill.; Harriman, N.Y.; and Passaic, N.J., will bring the company's
total to 1,000. With a store currently opening every 43 hours, it
will take Home Depot just over three years to open another 1,000
stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember feeling a sense of awe when we went (public), and
I've tried to keep a sense of humility,'' Blank said. ``This
morning, when I was driving up and I saw (our employees) and the
giant apron hanging outside, I felt a sense of pride _ not that I
was responsible for it so much but just that I was a part of it.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For months, Republicans in Congress have sought to
block a Federal Communications Commission program to license
thousands of new low-power radio stations. But now the first batch
of applications for the stations has come in, and it turns out that
about half are from religious organizations, mostly the sorts of
fundamentalist churches active in conservative, Republican
politics.
</P>
<P>
   From Horizon Christian Fellowship in San Diego to In His Image
Outreach Ministries in East Greenwich, R.I., hundreds of
evangelical churches are asking for space on the airwaves to spread
the Gospel. Some simply want to read Scripture verbatim; others
want to preach against abortion.
</P>
<P>
   They will not get the chance, however, if the Republican
congressional leadership _ lined up on the side of big broadcasting
companies and their lobbying group _ gets its way. And that has
left many of the applicants and their supporters frustrated, while
offering a fresh reminder of the divisions that persist in the
Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like money's talking, maybe at the expense of what
would be logical long-term _ the Republicans supporting their
supporters,'' said Rich Cizik, director of the Washington office of
the National Association of Evangelicals, which has 4,300 churches
as members.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Republicans, however, say their position is based
on the interference that broadcasters insist the new stations would
cause for the signals of existing stations. Politics, they add,
will not change that.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue goes back to interference, and that's pretty
non-ideological,'' said Rep. Michael Oxley, R-Ohio. ``You're either
interfering, or you're not.''
</P>
<P>
   Although congressional staffers, FCC officials and lobbyists
said they expected churches to apply for licenses, the makeup of
the applicant pool has caught most of them by surprise, they said.
</P>
<P>
   The applications offer the latest twist in a debate that radio
executives and media activists consider one of the industry's most
important issues since the advent of FM in the 1960s. William
Kennard, the FCC chairman, has said that adding hundreds of
low-power radio stations is one of his top priorities _a key way to
counteract the increasing consolidation of the industry into the
hands of a relatively few big, profit-minded broadcasters.
</P>
<P>
   He plans to award 1,000 new licenses for stations that could be
heard within three and a half miles of their signal. The first
could be on the air before the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Radio executives and some Republicans in Congress have said that
Kennard failed to consult others before devising a plan that would
seriously hurt existing broadcasters. ``Chairman Kennard, wanting
this as his legacy, pushed this issue before it was fully and
completely tested,'' said Rep. Billy Tauzin, R-La.
</P>
<P>
   Kennard has called the interference claims ``fraudulent'' and
simply an attempt to protect existing broadcasters.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, about 750 groups applied for about 200 licenses in
California, Maryland and eight other states that the commission
declared eligible for the first low-power radio. Officials are
reviewing the initial applications; over the next year and a half,
the FCC will examine the hundreds expected to come in from the
remaining 40 states.
</P>
<P>
   Now commission officials and other, mostly liberal supporters of
low-power radio in Washington find themselves in the unusual
position of hoping the grass-roots religious conservatives will
band together to lobby their usually dependable allies in Congress
on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, the battle over low-power radio has made for odd
bedfellows. National Public Radio has teamed up with the National
Association of Broadcasters _ among the most influential trade
groups in the country _ because both feared that the new stations
could create interference with existing stations' signals and take
away listeners. That position has also been adopted by the National
Association of Religious Broadcasters, whose members own
established radio and television stations.

 WASHINGTON: television stations. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now, nonprofit evangelical groups applying for the new stations
find themselves offering the same arguments as liberal activists
who believe ownership of the airwaves has become concentrated in
too few corporate hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a widespread belief that commercial broadcasters have
abandoned their communities,'' said Andrew Jay Schwartzman, the
president of Media Access Project, a Washington law firm that
analyzed the list of applicants and has helped groups file
applications for low-power stations. ``This does not break down on
a liberal-conservative basis.''
</P>
<P>
   And Oxley finds himself at odds with grass-roots religious
conservatives, who just last month were praising him for helping
prevent the FCC from restricting what noncommercial religious
television stations could broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the 750 applicants include many groups that have no
ties to a religious organization. The list, restricted to nonprofit
groups, also contains many schools, local governments and community
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Among the applicants are the National Jazz Hall of Fame
Foundation; Freemont High School in Oakland, Calif.; the Maine
Science &AMP; Technology Museum; the Chamber of Commerce in Baker, La.;
the Maryland Mass Transit Administration; a racing-pigeon club in
Tulsa, Okla.; and a Native American tribe in Sitka, Alaska, that
wants to broadcast whale songs from under water.
</P>
<P>
   But about half of the applicants are churches, and more than
half of those are fundamentalist or evangelical churches, according
to the Media Access Project.
</P>
<P>
   A number of other applicants, while not churches, share views
associated with religious conservatives. One such applicant is the
Crisis Pregnancy Help Center in Slidell, La., which tries to
convince teenagers to abstain from premarital sex and, if they do
get pregnant, not to have an abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Another applicant, the Calvary Chapel in Oxnard, Calif., is a
nondenominational church that teaches the Bible verse by verse.
Eric Robbins, the chapel's business manager, said it would offer an
alternative to the commercial radio stations in central California;
members of Congress, he said, are listening too closely to
lobbyists from the companies that own those stations.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's some protectionism going on there,'' Robbins said.
</P>
<P>
   The National Association of Broadcasters has a lengthy,
successful record of promoting legislation its members support. It
has also made campaign contributions to most of the key opponents
of low-power radio in the last two years, according to the Center
for Responsive Politics.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the House overwhelmingly passed a bill that
would severely restrict the FCC plan, likely barring about 800 of
the 1,000 licenses the commission plans to grant. In recent weeks,
Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H., has been trying to attach an even more
restrictive proposal, which would cancel the program, to a number
of appropriations bills, congressional aides said. Sen. John
McCain, R-Ariz., has proposed allowing the commission to grant the
licenses but giving existing broadcasters the right to file
complaints about interference in federal court.
</P>
<P>
   Because the low-power radio plan is already law, Congress is
expected to move quickly to head it off before the commission
grants any licenses. White House officials have said they support
the creation of low-power radio stations, as has Vice President Al
Gore, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president. Texas Gov.
George W. Bush has not taken a public position on the issue, said
Mindy Tucker, a spokeswoman for his presidential campaign.

U.S. IMPOSES CURFEW AND ALCOHOL BAN ON MILITARY ON OKINAWA 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: SUBS 6th graf, The two ..., to correct to Group of 8, sted
seven.) 
By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ In a concession to local concerns about the behavior of
American soldiers stationed in Okinawa, the U.S. military has
indefinitely banned the drinking of alcoholic beverages between
midnight and 5 a.m. and prohibited its personnel from leaving their
bases during those hours.
</P>
<P>
   The curfew was imposed after a hit-and-run accident involving a
staff sergeant stationed at the U.S. Air Force's Kadena Air Base
early Sunday morning. A pedestrian was injured in the accident and
the sergeant was later caught. The authorities investigating the
accident said it appeared that alcohol was involved.
</P>
<P>
   This latest incident follows an apology from the highest-ranking
U.S. military official in Okinawa after a Marine was arrested last
week for allegedly entering a house and molesting a 14-year-old
girl in her bed while she was sleeping.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal of this policy is to enhance discipline among service
members and prevent the recurrence of liberty incidents,'' the
military said in a statement Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese officials have asked the military to take steps to
address the problem of crimes committed by its servicemen, an issue
that has long bedeviled relations between local residents and the
government of the prefecture and between the prefecture and the
central government. ``The fact that another incident of this sort
has occurred at a time when we were already seeking tighter
official discipline is regrettable,'' said the chief cabinet
secretary, Hidenao Nakagawa, during a regularly scheduled news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   The two most recent alleged crimes occurred at a particularly
sensitive time for the Japanese government, which is doing its
utmost to ensure that the Group of 8 summit meeting of world
leaders scheduled for July 21-23 in Okinawa will come off without a
hitch.
</P>
<P>
   Police forces around the country have been staging drills in
preparation for any trouble that might occur, and the national
government has been working feverishly to end a dispute with the
U.S. trade representative over charges imposed by the dominant
telephone carrier.
</P>
<P>
   The incidents have also embarrassed the United States. President
Clinton's participation in the summit meeting will be the first
visit by an American president since the United States returned
Okinawa to Japan in 1972. Last week, Japan was treated to the sight
of Lt. Gen. Earl B. Hailston of the U.S. Marine Corps, the
highest-ranking American officer here, bowing deeply to the
prefecture's governor in a striking display of contrition.
</P>
<P>
   About 26,000 of the 48,000 American military personnel in Japan
are stationed in Okinawa, 1,000 southeast of Tokyo, and residents
of the island have long complained that they are unfairly burdened
with the social and economic costs of the U.S. presence.

UNKEMPT WELLS LOOKS LIKE A WINNER ON THE MOUND
</HEADLINE>
  By JACK CURRY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The monumental trade between the Yankees and the Blue
Jays took place 17 months ago, when Roger Clemens came to New York
for David Wells and two other players. The Yankees obtained a
five-time Cy Young award winner who won the decisive game of the
1999 World Series and Toronto got a rebellious pitcher who has
actually become heftier.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, there is no disputing the notion that Toronto got the best
of a trade that brought them Wells, Homer Bush and Graeme Lloyd.
The deal was really about Wells and Clemens, and Wells could be
gloating because he is 15-2 this year and was selected by Joe
Torre, his former manager, to start the All-Star Game on Tuesday
night. The National League starter will be Randy Johnson, who is
14-2 with a 1.80 earned run average and 198 strikeouts in 144 and
two-thirds innings.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens did not make the team for the second straight year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't my decision to trade me,'' Wells said. ``Obviously,
they thought it made sense to trade me. You move on. I don't hold
any grudges.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the trade, Wells is 32-12 and Clemens is 20-16. Because
the Yankees won another World Series, they could argue that the
deal was successful because the team achieved its goal. But George
Steinbrenner would surely choose Wells over Clemens if he could
make another trade. Especially since the Yankees' principal owner
has an agreement with Clemens for a two-year extension worth about
$27 million.
</P>
<P>
   When Wells was asked if he was better than Clemens, he smirked
and said: ``I don't worry about it. I move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Wells has a head that is balder than Mr. Clean and a scraggly
goatee that looks like a thorn bush. He wears a uniform jersey that
could serve as a tent for a few toddlers and pants that are baggy
enough to hold watermelons. But, for all of the attention Wells
receives for his eccentricities, he also has a rubber arm, amazing
control and a passion for winning.
</P>
<P>
   ``He might not be the best dressed pitcher,'' Torre said, ``but
he might be the best pitcher.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if Pedro Martinez, last season's Cy Young award winner, had
been healthy enough to pitch in the game, Torre said he would still
have chosen Wells as the starter because ``you can't count out 15
wins.''
</P>
<P>
   Wells, who has constantly deflected questions about Clemens and
the Yankees, said it would have been unfair to the Blue Jays for
him to pine for New York after a deal that depressed him. Someone
mentioned that the Yankees unloaded Wells to get Clemens, but also
because they were worried Wells would fizzle.
</P>
<P>
   With a bow to the children in attendance, Wells called that
``hog wash.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's a point to prove at any time,'' Wells
said. ``I know what I can do. Right now, I could strangle Joe if I
wanted to.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre, who sat beside Wells on a podium, said, ``Maybe that
would slow you down.''
</P>
<P>
   Wells said it took three days for him to get over the sting of
being traded, a bold declaration because David Cone expressed how
distraught Wells was at the time. Now Wells is with the Blue Jays
and they are tied for first place with the Yankees, mostly because
of a lopsided trade that seemed logical when it was made.
</P>
<P>
   ``When things happen like that, you have to think of it as a
business,'' Wells said. ``New York is where I wanted to play. I
wanted to finish my career there. They traded for Roger Clemens.
You can't cry about it. Life goes on.''  &QL;

JAIL TERM FOR FORMER PREMIER BRINGS CALLS FOR REFORM IN TURKEY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds., this article was filed and held on Sunday, July 9. It is now
released.) 
 By DOUGLAS FRANTZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ The increasing likelihood that a 73-year-old
former prime minister will go to prison for remarks in a political
speech six years ago is sending a chill through Turkey's political
elite and bringing widespread calls to relax laws that restrict
freedom of speech.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, an appeals court upheld the one-year sentence and
lifetime political ban imposed on former Prime Minister Necmettin
Erbakan on the charge of ``provoking hatred'' in a 1994 speech.
Since the ruling, political leaders have scrambled to diminish the
decision's impact on Turkey's efforts to portray itself as a modern
democracy and to join the European Union. Even Prime Minister
Bulent Ecevit said he was saddened at the prospect of Erbakan going
to prison.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the concerns translate into a genuine overhaul of laws
regarded outside Turkey as violations of free expression is
unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders across the political spectrum indicated that it may be
time to modify elements of the code that make it a crime to promote
religious or ethnic differences and to criticize the government or
military.
</P>
<P>
   Some in the influential military and the politicians most
strongly wedded to Turkey's secularist state still oppose change,
however, for fear Turkey will turn more toward Islam.
</P>
<P>
   A leader of the Islamic-oriented Virtue Party told Ecevit on
Thursday that the organization would consider supporting changes to
the criminal code in exchange for leniency for Erbakan, according
to the Turkish press. Backing for revisions also came from parties
that form Ecevit's coalition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to make radical improvements to the civil and criminal
codes,'' Bulent Akarcali, a member of Parliament who is deputy
chairman of the Motherland Party, one of the coalition members,
said in an interview. ``It is a must.''
</P>
<P>
   Gunduz Aktan, a former senior Turkish diplomat, said laws
categorized in the criminal code as ``crimes against the state''
need to be revised to recognize the difference between legitimate
political speech or criticism of the government and threats. ``We
need to separate violence and threats to public order from
legitimate free speech,'' Aktan, a former ambassador to Greece and
Japan, said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Erbakan was prime minister for a year in 1996 and 1997. He
resigned under pressure from the military and political opponents
who charged he was plotting against the secular order of Turkey.
His pro-Islamic party was outlawed, but later re-emerged as the
Virtue Party, with most of the same leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Last March, Erbakan was convicted of a crime against the state
for a speech he made in a Kurdish-dominated area before he became
prime minister. In the speech, he contended that Turkey had
abandoned its Islamic roots and that secular politicians had
divided the Kurds from other Turks.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this country there are two parties: the righteous and the
fallacious,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Erbakan's jail sentence and ban were upheld by the appeals
court, and he is expected to serve about five months in prison
unless the chief prosecutor's office recommends reducing the
sentence.
</P>
<P>
   A report drafted by the Council of Europe said the Turkish
government needs to improve human rights and change portions of its
law that are undemocratic, including various restrictions on free
speech. The report said Turkey needs to make these changes if it
hopes to achieve its goal of gaining membership in the European
Union.
</P>
<P>
   Seyfi Tashan, director of the Foreign Policy Institute in
Ankara, noted that the threats that validated the restrictions on
speech for many Turks appear to have eased. Kurdish separatism is
less threatening and concern over Islamic fundamentalism may also
be diminishing, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is whether the perception of threats has
decreased to the point where free expression can be condoned,''
Tashan said.
</P>
<P>
   But others argue that the Islamic threat is still too potent to
warrant easing restrictions. ``There is no such thing as mild
Islam,'' said Suna Kili, an author and political science professor
at Bosporus University. ``The republic has the right to protect
itself. Even in France and Germany there are laws protecting the
secular state.''
</P>
<P>
   The strictness of the laws was demonstrated on Friday when a
prosecutor increased charges against Nadire Mater, a Turkish
journalist who wrote a book last year recounting stories of
soldiers who fought the Kurds in southeast Turkey. The prosecutor
said the author would face two to 12 years in prison if convicted
of insulting the military.

DIANA ROSS SAYS TOUR WITH SUPREMES IS CANCELED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa.)   By NEIL STRAUSS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A high-profile reunion of Diana Ross with members of her former
group, the Supremes, was canceled Monday, according to a statement
released by Ross.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for SFX disputed Ross' statement, saying the company
had not yet decided to cancel the reunion. He said that dates in
Wantagh, N.Y., Washington, and Pittsburgh had been canceled but the
rest of the tour, which is scheduled to end in Las Vegas on Aug. 5,
would continue as planned.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for the talk of cancellation, according to executives
in the concert business, was poor ticket sales in many cities.
Premium seats for the show were priced as high as $250 and, with
the exception of Ross, the reunited group did not include group
members from the Motown group's heyday in the 1960s. Although the
group's concert at Madison Square Garden on July 6 was sold out, in
most other cities concert halls have been only half full. Even with
poor ticket sales, it is rare for such a high-profile tour to be
canceled midway through its run.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Grossweiner, a concert-industry analyst, saw the dispute as
a stand-off over Ross' high guarantee, reported to be from $15 to
$20 million. If the promoter cancels the tour, he said, it will
still be obligated to pay her the full amount. ``There has never
been a tour bought by a national promoter that's done as bad as
this one and had a clash over money like this one,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The reunion has been followed by criticism since its beginning.
It was first announced in April, when SFX, the country's biggest
concert promoter, bought the rights to what was billed as the first
reunion in three decades for the group. But the surviving former
Supremes Mary Wilson and Cindy Birdsong declined to join, saying
they were being offered much less than Ross. Instead, two members
who sang in the group three years after Ross left, Lynda Laurence
and Scherrie Payne, completed the trio. From the beginning,
however, tickets sold slowly and some concerts were postponed to
give more time for ticket sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the first times that from the first press
conference, a tour had bad press,'' Grossweiner said. ``Mary Wilson
went on national TV and blasted the tour. So you had all this
negativity coming in and high ticket prices and an audience that
was confused. Plus, it was essentially a Diana Ross show, because
she didn't interact with the other women.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1992, author Tom Clancy embarked on a philanthropic mission
worthy of Jack Ryan, the idealistic hero of his popular
techno-thrillers.
</P>
<P>
   Clancy wanted to help children who had cancer and other grave
illnesses use the nascent technology of the Internet to talk with
one another and learn about their diseases.
</P>
<P>
   The children's health network he imagined would also enable
parents to search out the best doctors, no matter how disadvantaged
or isolated the family might be. And it would let doctors tap into
the same worldwide database to share their expertise and find the
latest research.
</P>
<P>
   Clancy's inspiration was a 6-year-old Long Island, N.Y., boy,
Kyle Haydock, who sent him a fan letter while the boy lay in his
bed at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York City,
ravaged by sarcoma. At the height of his fame, Clancy fell hard for
Kyle and befriended him. He showered the boy with gifts, visited
his hospital room and even wheeled him around Disney World. ``This
little guy was a fighter,'' he later wrote in an essay.
</P>
<P>
   After Kyle died in 1991, Clancy set up a foundation and named it
for the boy. He donated more than $4 million from his fortune and
committed one-third of the proceeds from his next Jack Ryan movie,
according to his lawyer and foundation records.
</P>
<P>
   Clancy also used his fame and political connections to persuade
others to donate several million dollars more in cash and services.
The captains of powerful companies like Viacom joined the
foundation's board, as did big-name friends like the actor Tom
Selleck.
</P>
<P>
   But seven years later, Clancy is scuttling the Kyle Foundation,
which despite having spent more than $5 million on travel,
salaries, fund raising and furniture did not even have a Web site
to show for its efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The demise of one of the nation's more than 700,000 charities
typically unfolds without public scrutiny. Nameplates are removed
from doors, checking accounts are closed, and the directors move on
without comment. But the legal mud fight that has broken out in a
Denver courtroom over the failure of the Kyle Foundation offers a
rare glimpse at the inner workings of a celebrity charity.
</P>
<P>
   What went wrong is a matter of heated dispute. Clancy, in court
papers, accuses the woman he hired to run the foundation of
mismanagement and improper expenditures. She vehemently denies that
accusation and says Clancy killed off the project at the very
moment it was about to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual step, the IRS is examining the charity's financial
records to decide whether to revoke its tax-deductible status.
Donors would have to pay back taxes on their gifts if they had
reason to know the foundation was not performing its mission.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS, Clancy has said in a letter to the foundation's board,
is ``citing long delay in product rollout, limited charitable work
to date, high foundation expenses for salaries, travel and fund
raising.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends and associates say they do not blame Clancy for
undertaking what they see as a visionary project. Several, however,
faulted him for failing to keep a closer eye on a venture whose
success hinged on the deft use of an infant technology.
</P>
<P>
   A board member who ran a $29 billion computer company said he
twice told Clancy in 1997 that the foundation was floundering and
that its management was weak.
</P>
<P>
   The 53-year-old writer, who is completing his 11th novel,
brushed aside such warnings and did not act until last summer, when
he dispatched an accountant and then a retired Navy vice admiral to
take a closer look at the operation, board members said.
</P>
<P>
   Their reports in hand, Clancy sprang into action.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 11, a Friday morning, he summoned the foundation's
executive director, Katherine Gorshow, to his Maryland home and
demanded that she resign, according to court papers. Then, before
she could fly back to its offices in Englewood, Colo., he sent a
team of former agents from the FBI to secure the premises and
change the locks.
</P>
<P>
   It was an abrupt ending to a partnership that grew from a chance
meeting on the Internet to Gorshow's participation last year as
bridesmaid in Clancy's wedding.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Gorshow is suing the foundation, accusing it of breach of
contract in a state court in Denver, saying in court papers that
she had made ``significant progress'' toward taking the health
network online later this year. Indeed, new backers of the
foundation, including Sybase Inc., a software company, continue to
express enthusiastic support for the project.
</P>
<P>
   Clancy replied in court filings this month that Gorshow misused
foundation money for private purposes, including personal travel.
Gorshow denied the accusations through her lawyers. Clancy declined
to be interviewed for this article, saying, ``I'm gagged.''
</P>
<P>
   Kyle's mother, Eileen Haydock, of Baldwin, N.Y., said she began
having doubts about the foundation several years ago and
discouraged her friends from contributing. Still, Haydock said she
had nothing but admiration for Clancy and his efforts to honor her
son and help sick children. ``I think he felt that he had let down
my son,'' she said, ``and that's not true.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   There was little about Clancy's life that prepared him for
starting a multimillion-dollar foundation. He majored in English at
Loyola College in Baltimore, then sold insurance to tobacco and
corn farmers on the Chesapeake Bay.
</P>
<P>
   The unexpected success in 1985 of his first novel, ``The Hunt
for Red October,'' began a lucrative career that led to a string of
best-selling novels and popular movies made from them.
</P>
<P>
   His financial empire grew to include more than a dozen
businesses that have produced not only his major books like
``Patriot Games'' and ``Clear and Present Danger,'' but also
videogames, military manuals and serial novels written with others.
He bought a share of the Baltimore Orioles baseball team, and under
his latest deal with Putnam Publishing he earns $19 million for
each novel completed, according to court records.
</P>
<P>
   Associates say Clancy's considerable fortune has attracted
people with a host of causes and offbeat investment opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a very, very trusting man,'' said Diana Patin, Clancy's
former, longtime secretary. ``He accepted people as they put
themselves to him.''
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1990s, Clancy and his first wife, Wanda, lost $1.3
million to a coin dealer who is to be sentenced on Friday for
defrauding them and dozens of other Maryland residents. In 1996,
Clancy put $1 million into a company building a space vehicle that
uses a propeller to land like a helicopter. The company has since
scaled back its operations because of a lack of money.
</P>
<P>
   And, more recently, Clancy has helped a former CIA operative
turned cartoonist, Chip Beck, finance his investigation into
whether the U.S. government abandoned some of its troops taken
prisoner in wars fought this century. ``He gives people the chance
to prove themselves,'' Beck said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Clancy had become a fixture on the best-seller list by 1990 when
Kyle caught his attention. The boy's grandfather had read him
Clancy's first novel, and then he ``just about memorized'' a video
of the resulting movie, Clancy wrote in an essay encouraging others
to befriend a sick child. ``Each of them, however ill, is alive and
needful of the same things that we all need: love, friendship,
conversation,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   One of his first acts after creating the Kyle Foundation was to
hire Gorshow, whom he had met online in a discussion group run by
America Online, where she was a volunteer. He had a computer
glitch; she had the solution.
</P>
<P>
   Gorshow had been a college instructor and school administrator,
and she owned a mail-order, bulk-food distribution concern.
</P>
<P>
   In a chronology filed in Denver District Court, Gorshow
describes the foundation, in her first three years with it, as a
shoestring operation run from her home in Oroville, Calif., and
dogged by false starts. But by 1996, her starting salary of $43,000
had risen to $120,000, and fund raising took off when Clancy signed
a pledge to give $5 million in 10 installments, as well as the
future Jack Ryan movie proceeds.
</P>
<P>
   Clancy's enthusiasm for the project helped attract other big
gifts, including $1 million from Viacom, and $750,000 from Lew
Wasserman, the founder of MCA, and the MCA foundation. Aboard a
110-foot yacht off the coast of Vancouver, British Columbia, Clancy
secured $100,000 from John McCaw, cofounder of McCaw Cellular.
</P>
<P>
   While most of the money appears to have come from his
well-heeled friends, Clancy did use his fame to reach out to the
public as well. In November 1997 he appeared on ``Jeopardy,'' where
he announced he would donate his $10,000 consolation prize to the
foundation.
</P>
<P>
   But there were bumps on the implementation side. As the
foundation's executive director, Gorshow said she labored at a wide
range of activities _from securing an Internet address for the Web
site to building a prototype database of information about
pediatric oncology, which involved hiring college students to
translate some foreign-language documents.
</P>
<P>
   One major endeavor turned into a dead end. The foundation had
wanted to put computers in the homes and hospital rooms of sick
children. Gorshow said she discovered that other charities were
trying to do the same thing, and that pilot projects had turned up
a concern: There was not enough time to teach very ill children how
to use the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Other aspects of the original concept fell by the wayside,
including the notion of having cartoon characters answer questions
from children. But even the basic mission _ building a one-stop
directory to a million or so places to get health information _
began to seem elusive to the board.
</P>
<P>
   David R. Dukes, then the co-chairman of Ingram Micro, the
nation's largest wholesale distributor of computers, said he became
so convinced the foundation would not succeed that he resigned from
the board in mid-1997, rather than help the foundation raise more
money.
</P>
<P>
   Dukes said he told Clancy _ in person and later on the phone _
that with Gorshow as the foundation's leader, ``it became clear
this thing would not be able to go forward the way that it ought
to.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But, back at the time,'' Dukes said, ``I think, he was still
very enamored with her, and I'm not sure he wanted to hear that.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Kyle's mother was mystified. She said the foundation did
not respond to her e-mail messages inquiring about its progress,
and that it had become such a puzzle to her that she suggested that
friends seeking to honor Kyle donate to other charities.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Clancy's personal life began intersecting with the
foundation in unusual ways. When he ended a 1995 affair with a
woman he met online, the Manhattan penthouse they had shared was
cleared out by Gorshow and the foundation's director of operations,
according to foundation records.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, another woman he met online unsuccessfully
sued him for breaking off their engagement. She then alerted
federal and state officials in California to possible mismanagement
of foundation funds, the officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, Clancy's new wife, Alexandra Llewellyn, began
raising her own concerns about the foundation, prompting him to
send her family's accountant to examine the books, an associate of
Clancy said.
</P>
<P>
   The accountant delivered his report in February. Clancy, in his
Feb. 24 letter to the board, listed some of its highlights:
$636,628 spent on travel through 1998, $700,000 on consultants and
$100,154 on a one-time payout last year to Gorshow for accrued
vacation and sick pay.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation, the accountant discovered, had been fined
$20,000 by the IRS for tardy filing of its 1997 tax returns.
</P>
<P>
   Gorshow, in her letter to the board, defended the expenditures,
saying the travel was legitimate and the vacation pay stemmed from
concerns raised by the foundation's auditor.
</P>
<P>
   Clancy asked a retired vice admiral, William McCauley, to assess
whether it was worth putting more money into the Kyle Foundation.
McCauley said he concluded that other medical Web sites had
eclipsed Clancy's dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got co-opted,'' McCauley said.
</P>
<P>
   Others disagree. In January, Sybase had agreed to give the
foundation its novel Web site portal program and the services of
seven engineers to get it online, and as late as March the company
was formulating a commitment it valued at $1 million a year for as
long as a decade. At the same time, a design concern had come up
with a foundation logo and was midway through its $500,000
commitment to creating a Web site for the foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Internet venture experts say that despite the proliferation of
medical information sites in recent years, the idea behind the Kyle
Foundation remains not only viable, but potentially profitable as
well. ``There is definitely need and demand for this type of
project,'' said Deborah Buresh, a director at Shattuck Hammond
Partners, the health care investment-banking division of
PricewaterhouseCoopers Securities.
</P>
<P>
   About $700,000 in foundation money remains, and Clancy has come
up with a much simpler way to spend it. He now plans to endow a
pediatric oncology research chair at the Johns Hopkins University
School of Medicine, to be named after Kyle. Clancy entered into an
agreement with Johns Hopkins that calls for him to add to that sum
until it reaches $2 million over the next three years, the
institution said.
</P>
<P>
   No future movie proceeds are involved.

 &HT;    Rawlings factory brings pride, promise
 &HT;    By Carlos Frias
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Turrialba, Costa Rica
</P>
<P>
   On this side of the Talamanca mountains, the city of San Jose
seems much farther than 46 miles. It seems especially far after the
2 1/2-hour drive up and down winding roads, circling cliffs
hundreds of feet above the verdant, checkerboard plantations.
</P>
<P>
   The drive into the heart of Turrialba is marked by the
occasional cow in the road and dozens of little villages _ La
Pastora, Pejibaye, Santa Terresita _ that exist in people's
vocabulary but not necessarily on road maps. As the city disappears
behind the mountainous horizon, car fumes are replaced by a
perfumed country air, a mixture of fragrances from the diverse
flora of Costa Rica's countryside and the rich, reddish-brown earth
in which virtually anything grows. Coffee. Sugar cane. Home runs.
</P>
<P>
   In this village of fewer than 30,000, east of San Jose and west
of nowhere, beats the heart of America's national pastime. Since
1990, a Rawlings factory on the edge of town has produced all of
the baseballs used in every major-league game, including tonight's
All-Star Game at Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   For this agricultural community, which survived quietly for more
than 100 years on the harvest of coffee and sugar cane, the
production of baseballs has become a source of identity and pride.
However, few claim to know much about the sport, despite the recent
international attention on whether the balls are juiced.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, the new source of employment injected new life
into a town slipping into extinction.
</P>
<P>
   A better life through baseballs
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you see here?''
</P>
<P>
   Marco Vinisio Rodriguez holds up one of the dozens of baseballs
he has stitched that Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The ball is as perfect as it can be at this point in the
process. The red laces hold the seams together tightly and cleanly.
Surely, this ball will end up in a major-leaguer's hands. Vinisio
Rodriguez has some of the finest hands in the factory. He has
refused to take any promotions over the past 11 years and has
chosen to continue stitching laces onto baseballs better and more
efficiently than any other of the 500 workers on the sewing floor
of the Rawlings factory. He has made more than 70 a day and more
than 200 a week.
</P>
<P>
   To any red-blooded American baseball fan, he is holding up the
crude form of what will become the perfect baseball. For Vinisio
Rodriguez, 28, and his workmates, it represents a steady paycheck
and the promise of a better life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, there are a lot of people that look at this and see an
education,'' he said, scanning his eyes over the ball, checking his
work. ``They see a new house. They see food on the table for
another day.''
</P>
<P>
   For Americans, the factory is important because it provides
every baseball used in major-league games and sold in stores. For
Turrialbenos, baseball represents a fountain of employment _ 950
jobs, at the moment _ for a town that once suffered one of the
highest levels of unemployment in the country. ``I ask myself,
`What would happen to those 950 employees if Rawlings wasn't
there?''' said Edgar Mata Dennis, a Turrialba native and the town's
mayor for thetor around town and catch up with buses that had left
them behind.
</P>
<P>
   However, the day a new, more direct road to the coast opened,
traffic through Turrialba all but stopped. Businesses closed.
Hotels emptied. Taxi drivers, like Jose Mata, were forced to find
other means. During the week, aching for passengers, he worked
double shifts, from 6 a.m. to about 1 a.m., and traveled about 45
minutes on the weekends to the next closest town of Cartago to wash
cars. Life became difficult for all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I slept very little. It was hard,'' said Mata, 44, a father of
two. ``Everybody was in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Desperate need for jobs
</P>
<P>
   For many people, the answer was jobs picking coffee beans and
harvesting sugar cane. Even those jobs were not enough to keep
everyone employed, as the prices for these staple crops dropped at
the most inopportune time. Vagrancy and crime increased in a small
town that prides itself on cleanliness and hospitality, a respite
from city life. Some chose to leave their families and walk as far
as 15 miles to work on plantations in other towns, returning to
visit their loved ones only on weekends.
</P>
<P>
   Turrialba was aching for a new source of jobs. Baseball was the
answer.
</P>
<P>
   As tedious and painstaking as stitching more than 200 baseballs
a week might seem to Americans, the alternatives are not good.
</P>
<P>
   For young men who must work to help support their large extended
families, the only previous options were the sugar cane and coffee
fields. Higher education often is not a possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Sugar cane might be the most arduous of crops to harvest. Its
season lasts from February to June, including a suffocating April,
the hottest month of the year in Turrialba, when the temperature
regularly exceeds the high 90s with 90 percent humidity. Before the
harvest, workers burn the leaves off the stalks, which leaves a
messy black soot all over the trees. Still, some of their wiry,
serrated edges remain, and they can slice through skin like paper
cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the sharpest machete, cutting down stalks of cane,
which can be 2-3 inches thick and as hard as bamboo, requires
considerable arm strength. Workers plod through the thick black
mud, hoping that the fire scared off most of the vipers and rats
that inhabit the brush. And it's almost a given that every day,
about 2 p.m., it's going to rain to make the job even more
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   It's a hot, sweaty, sticky, laborious task, and anyone who has
done it agrees that it is sure to shorten a man's life.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Manuel Jimenez Garcia, now 45, remembers creeping out of
his house before dawn on his way to work in the cane fields, past
his wife and eight sleeping children, knowing that he would not see
them until late that night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all grew up cutting cane,'' said Jimenez Garcia, now a
street sweeper in town. ``Anything is better than cutting sugar
cane. It's very hot, very exhausting. It's a hard way of life.''
</P>
<P>
   When Rawlings moved its baseball factory to Costa Rica in 1987
because of government instability in Haiti, Turrialbenos got
another option.
</P>
<P>
   People could get better wages stitching baseballs than they
could working in the fields, where money depends on how much coffee
you pick or how many pounds of cane you cut. And they would be in a
fan-cooled building, sheltered from the beating sun. Few homes or
businesses in Turrialba have air-conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   The stitchers, who undergo three months of paid training before
they move on to making major-league-quality balls, are paid on a
sliding scale, depending on how many balls they make. It includes
incentives after they pass certain marks. Rawlings asks that they
make at least 130 a week. Those who make 150 receive a free meal
ticket and can take Friday off. People in the 200-plus range not
only earn more per ball, but also a bus ticket. Together, they help
make more than 14,000 balls a day and about 2.4 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   A week's work could yield about 28,000 colones, which equals
about $91. Rent in Turrialba costs about $100 a month. Locals were
living a better, easier life, one that was more promising for their
children. The step up is allowing poor workers from bordering
countries, Hondurans and Nicaraguans, to take the lower-echelon
jobs such as working in the coffee and cane fields.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing worse for a community than having a large
portion of its people out of work,'' Mario Rojas said. ``That's
where crime and delinquency take hold.''
</P>
<P>
   Rojas' family has owned more than 2,000 acres of coffee and
sugar cane crops in the valley for the past 52 years. ``People have
to feed themselves,'' he said. ``That's been the most important
thing. (The factory) has been a fountain of employment.''
</P>
<P>
   Jimenez Garcia said two of his children work in the baseball
factory and go to school at night, like many other baseball factory
workers, and have visions of attending the University of Costa
Rica, which has a campus in Turrialba.
</P>
<P>
   His sons are ``really happy there,'' he said. ``It's a lot
better than cutting cane.''
</P>
<P>
   When the company first moved in and also was making low-grade
balls for Little League, people often were allowed to stitch the
balls at home. Until 1994, the company would install in their homes
its special spinning vises, which hold the balls in place while the
workers sew. The major-league balls still were made in the factory.
But many housewives, whose husbands worked in the fields, could
make extra money stitching at home. Those balls now are made in
China.
</P>
<P>
   Now, just as cutting cane had become part of everyone's
histories, so has sewing baseballs. Everyone either has worked in
the complex of beige buildings on the edge of town or knows someone
who has. Those from the area of Turrialba, known for years as
azuqueros, or sugar makers, are getting a new designation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be more accurate to call us boleros (ball makers),''
Vinisio Rodriguez said. ``Don't you think?''
</P>
<P>
   Sport slow to catch on
</P>
<P>
   Why would anyone wear pajama pants to play a sport?
</P>
<P>
   It's the first thing Jose Mata thought when his bosses at
Rawlings handed him a pair of baseball pants. As the company became
a greater part of its new community, it wanted to introduce the
sport that Turrialba is supporting.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, although Costa Rica is wedged between Nicaragua and
Panama, two big baseball countries, the sport has had its
challenges in a country where futbol is king.
</P>
<P>
   ``People laughed,'' Jose Mata said. ``They thought they looked
like pajamas. We have always liked futbol, basketball, volleyball.
But baseball? Nobody knew it. I had never seen it, even on
television.''
</P>
<P>
   In the country's largest newspaper, La Nacion, there are stories
on men's and women's soccer, basketball, volleyball, cycling, river
rafting, even chess, but no baseball. In the briefs, the sports
section rounds up events as far-reaching as Lenny Wilkens signing
to coach the Toronto Raptors. But the paper has no mention of the
major-league standings.
</P>
<P>
   In a factory that sponsors 10 soccer leagues, the plant
directors, Douglas and Diane Kralik, tried to get baseball off the
ground. This husband-and-wife team, former farmers from Iowa, grew
up with America's pastime and hoped Turrialba would accept the
sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't want to be just the gringos from the States that
were starting this for our kids,'' said Douglas, whose three
children went to private school in San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   Although more than 250 youngsters showed up for the practices
every Saturday, the lack of a baseball field and waning interest
doomed the effort. But if you can't beat 'em, sponsor 'em. Rawlings
became the official sponsor of the town's traveling soccer team,
the equivalent of a Triple-A minor-league team, which is hoping to
graduate to the big time.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball is putting down some roots, though, in that it is a
Generation-Y sport, the way soccer is booming with America's youth.
</P>
<P>
   Cesar Arrieta Solis, 23, whose grandfather worked the cane
fields in Turrialba, remembers helping his mother stitch baseballs
at home for fun. Now a student at the University of Costa Rica and
a certified English professor, he realizes that baseball has become
the sport of the next generation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, futbol was what everyone talked about. But when Sammy
Sosa and Mark McGwire were chasing the (home-run) record, my
friends were always talking about it,'' he said. ``I would love
there to be (baseball) fields here so the kids could learn.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the controversy over juiced balls provided a little
excitement for the town. However, the University of
Massachussets-Lowell, commissioned by Major League Baseball, found
no significant differences between the balls used this year and
last year.
</P>
<P>
   More than fans, baseball has cultivated an industry in
Turrialba. It has helped create a new future and way of life for
Turrialbenos. Rawlings was the first factory to move into the area,
but it has been followed by the construction of an office park on
the other side of town, where ConAir has set up a hair dryer
factory. Others are set to follow, the mayor said.
</P>
<P>
   Because two major rivers run through the town _ the Reventazon
and Pacuare _ whitewater thrill-seekers have brought tourism back
to town, despite the long drive. Even a bed-and-breakfast-style
hotel, Casa Turire, built on the outskirts of Turrialba, is banking
on the revival of tourism.
</P>
<P>
   The town even could become the poster child for the IBM Internet
``Are you ready?'' commercials. The government post office built an
Internet computer center, where residents can check their e-mail or
browse the Web for free for 15 minutes a day or buy the equivalent
of phone cards.
</P>
<P>
   Although baseball is still a mystery to some, the people in this
once-quiet mountain town are thankful and proud of everything it
has done for them _ and for what they have done for baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Turrialba is definitely growing,'' said Ariel Mata, 18. He is
the taxi driver's oldest son and attends the Technical Institute of
Costa Rica three times a week in the neighboring city of Cartago;
he is 1 1/2 years from graduating with a degree in computer
science.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's changing,'' Ariel Mata said. ``I guess it is pretty
amazing.''

 &HT;    Applied Materials to unveil new chip production technology
 &HT;    By Bob Keefe
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ When it comes to semiconductors, smaller is
usually better _ except when it comes to making them, that is.
</P>
<P>
   For years, semiconductor makers have been inching toward a new
production process that would double the number of chips they could
produce on a single wafer _ the thin disks of silicon where
semiconductors get their start. But until now, they haven't had all
the equipment needed for mass production.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Applied Materials Inc. is expected to introduce the first
complete line of equipment to make chips on bigger and higher
capacity 300-millimeter silicon wafers, which could finally get the
chip industry on the fast track to building more efficient
factories.
</P>
<P>
   At the annual SEMICON West trade show that starts here today,
Applied Chairman and Chief Executive Jim Morgan plans to unveil his
company's new 21-piece line of equipment designed for
300-millimeter production.
</P>
<P>
   Equipment makers typically introduce new chip tools piece by
piece. But the move toward 300-millimeter technology is so
significant that Applied wanted to introduce a complete line all at
once, Morgan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one has ever done this before,'' he said. ``But (chip
makers) need the whole capability to build a 300-millimeter line,
so we had to bring all our products out at once.''
</P>
<P>
   Applied's move could be particularly significant in Austin,
Texas. In addition to being home to more domestic chip makers than
any other place outside than Silicon Valley, Austin is where
Applied has about 4,500 workers.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan said the new machines will be built in Austin factories,
though the company has begun hiring an unspecified number of new
workers and expects to continue to expand in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   The move from the industry-standard 200-millimeter wafer - about
the size of a salad plate - to the dinner-plate-size 300 millimeter
wafers has been a long and arduous one for the industry.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, most chip makers were planning
300-millimeter production. But chip prices dropped dramatically in
1996 and the industry went into a slump. That, coupled with a rift
between chip makers and equipment makers over specifications,
prompted most companies to put their 300 millimeter plans on hold.
A recent rebound in chip sales has prompted many chip makers to
start planning or building new factories again, and many want to
build at the 300-millimeter standard, which allows up to 2 1/2
times more chips per wafer than 200-millimeter production.
</P>
<P>
   Applied and other equipment makers including Tokyo Electron
Ltd., which also has a factory in Austin, already produce some
pieces of 300-millimeter equipment. A few companies use the tools
to make a limited number of chips, but none mass produces
semiconductors with 300-millimeter technology yet. With the
introduction of a complete, 21-piece line of 300-millimeter
equipment, chip makers can start building 300-millimeter factories.
At least a dozen chip companies, including giants like Intel Corp.,
Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and Motorola Inc., all have said they
are planning 300 millimeter factories, but in part have been
waiting on the equipment.You may contact Bob Keefe at

<P>
   Mention ``new economy'' and just what comes to mind? For many
people, dot-com companies, fancy Web sites, piles of cash.
</P>
<P>
   Those are all fine images, but these days, the big money in the
new economy is being made not by dot-coms but by the digital
plumbers.
</P>
<P>
   Most people probably never heard of the company that makes the
valves inside the pumps at their local water treatment plant. And
they probably never heard of SDL Inc., either. But that can hardly
bother SDL's investors, because the company announced Monday that
it had agreed to be acquired by JDS Uniphase Corp. for $41 billion
in stock.
</P>
<P>
   That is more than the market values of Amazon.com, At Home
Corp., eBay and Priceline.com combined.
</P>
<P>
   Modern cities are not possible without advanced plumbing, and
the wildfire spread of data communications and the Internet is not
possible without the sort of arcane components for fiber-optic
networks (think lasers and amplifiers) made by companies like JDS
Uniphase and SDL.
</P>
<P>
   That is not an original thought; over the last year, investors
have bid up the price of JDS Uniphase fivefold. But beside the
stock levitation, the financial muscle of the new economy's
plumbers has been felt mostly in explosive initial public offerings
and in rich acquisitions of private companies.
</P>
<P>
   But SDL, based in San Jose, Calif., is publicly traded, on
Nasdaq. And now the plumbers have announced what may just be the
biggest technology takeover yet.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal, each share of SDL would be exchanged for 3.8
shares of JDS Uniphase. JDS Uniphase's shares closed on Friday at
$116.1875, making the transaction worth $441.5125 for each share of
SDL. SDL's shares, meanwhile, closed Friday at $295.3125, giving
the company's investors a takeover premium of almost 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, by the time trading was over Monday, the value of the
deal had declined substantially. With such a wide spread between
the implied value of the deal, as announced, and where SDL's shares
had been trading, the arbitrage opportunity was obvious. Shares of
JDS Uniphase fell $15.0625, to $101.125, while SDL jumped $25.375,
to $320.6875.
</P>
<P>
   But even with those moves, shares of SDL still did not end up
close to JDL Uniphase's bid. With the slide Monday in shares of JDS
Uniphase, the deal is now worth $384.275 for each share of SDL,
which means that SDL could still be described as undervalued by
more than 19 percent.
</P>
<P>
   What that probably represents is moderate uncertainty among
arbitrageurs and institutional investors that the deal will
actually be completed. After all, it must be reviewed by the
Justice Department, which imposed some conditions on JDS Uniphase's
last big acquisition, of E-Tek Dynamics Inc., for about $20 billion
earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   But what is almost certain is that optical networking technology
will in some ways remain the technical foundation of the
communications revolution.
</P>
<P>
   That is because optical networks are generally the most
cost-effective way to transmit gargantuan amounts of two-way
information traffic from one point to another, especially in the
industrialized world.
</P>
<P>
   Copper wires like those used to connect most homes to the
telephone network also used to be employed for regional and
transcontinental networks. But optical networks, which transmit
information using pulses of light modulated by lasers, can be much
more efficient than copper networks using pulses of electricity.
</P>
<P>
   Big communications carriers like AT&AMP;T Corp. and WorldCom Inc.
buy optical communications systems from big equipment vendors like
Lucent Technologies Inc. and Nortel Networks Corp. of Canada. This
is like a city turning to a big water treatment company for a giant
water treatment plant. In turn, companies like Lucent and Nortel
assemble their systems from components and modules often bought
from companies like JDS Uniphase. This is like the water treatment
company turning to another concern for advanced pumps.
</P>
<P>
   Companies like JDS Uniphase then buy more specialized parts from
companies like SDL. This is like the pump company contracting out
to another firm for specialized valves.
</P>
<P>
   But imagine that only a few companies could make the valves
needed. And imagine that the overall capacity of the water
treatment plant (which determines the maximum size of the city it
serves) is closely linked to the performance of those valves. Then
it becomes clear that the valve company is quite valuable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me put it to you in a simple way,'' Anthony R. Muller, JDS
Uniphase's chief financial officer, said in a telephone interview
Monday. ``Think of Amazon and eBay and any number of other
companies that are of this genre. They all require bandwidth to
deliver their products and services. And we and our competitors
make the fundamental underlying technology that provides the amount
of bandwidth that is required for the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Don Scifres, SDL's chairman, said, ``This
combination brings together world-class technical and manufacturing
teams that promise to deliver best-in-class products at increased
volumes for today's systems while developing solutions for
tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Jozef Straus, the co-chairman and chief executive of JDS
Uniphase, said in a statement, ``JDS Uniphase and SDL share a
common vision to provide customers with the most innovative and
technologically advanced products that enhance their ability to
deliver next-generation optical systems.''
</P>
<P>
   SDL specializes in a sort of laser known as a pump laser and in
components that are used to make laser systems. JDS Uniphase is
hoping that by acquiring the company, it will be able to direct
SDL's research in ways that are more complementary to its own
technical plans.
</P>
<P>
   As that happens, the dot-com companies will continue to be the
most visible element of this new economy. And that will not trouble
the plumbers one bit.

BUSH TOOK ANOTHER OPTION TO AVOID VIETNAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: See GORE-MILITARY)  
 By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   While Al Gore was signing up to fight in (or at least write
about) a war that he did not believe in, George W. Bush was
somewhat less resolutely partying in Houston. Bush, like many young
conservatives, had doubts about the war but was nonetheless
inclined to support it _ though not necessarily to the point of
fighting in it.
</P>
<P>
   When Bush graduated from Yale in 1968, he was in roughly the
same situation as Gore was upon graduation from Harvard a year
later. Both were southern men in Ivy League colleges, and both had
fathers in Congress who might suffer politically if their sons fled
to Canada or took extraordinary measures to avoid the draft.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the two sons entered the military in markedly different
ways.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Gore, who enlisted in the Army, taking a path that he
knew would lead to South Vietnam, Bush signed up to be a pilot in
the Texas Air National Guard. It was a coveted posting that
dramatically reduced any risk that he would be sent to Vietnam and
probably would not have been obtainable if his father had been less
prominent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did I think about going to the Army post and saying, `Send me
to Vietnam?''' Bush asked in an interview. ``Not really. I wanted
to fly, and that was the adventure I was seeking.''
</P>
<P>
   The decisions they made were deeply in character.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was always a serious, ambitious young man struggling with
deep moral questions and, in the case of Vietnam, with deeply
practical calculations about how his actions would play in his
father's re-election campaign. Some critics have also suggested
that in later years he embellished his Vietnam role for his own
political career. Bush was a carefree, happy-go-lucky fellow.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, while Gore might have been more conscientious or
responsible, Bush was far more normal.
</P>
<P>
   While the Bush campaign likes to suggest that service in the
Guard was an entirely honorable alternative to Vietnam, back in
1988 one of Bush's father's strongest backers (and future chief of
staff), John Sununu, publicly criticized the Democratic vice
presidential nominee, Lloyd Bentsen, for getting his son into the
Guard. That was maladroit, since another young man in the same unit
as Bentsen's son was George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he discussed the war with his father, the younger Bush
says he must have but cannot recall any details. Likewise,
roommates and a girlfriend from that period say they do not recall
Bush saying much about the war one way or another, and he came
across as a lukewarm supporter at a time when most people were
passionate one way or the other. ``My first impulse and first
inclination was to support the country,'' Bush recalled in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Vietnam filtered into the popular consciousness in many ways,
but for Bush and many of his classmates a crucial moment came with
the death of George W. Carpenter. Carpenter, an acquaintance of
Bush and the boyfriend of a cousin, grew up on Long Island and had
been valedictorian and class president in high school, as well as
captain of the football team.
</P>
<P>
   At Yale, the dark-haired, 6-foot-4-inch Carpenter was a
striking, fun-loving figure, but he was expelled in his freshman
year for misbehaving. Having lost his deferment, he signed up for
the Marine Corps and was sent to Vietnam, where he was patrolling
on Feb. 17, 1967, when his squad came upon an obstacle on the
trail.
</P>
<P>
   It was a mine that exploded and killed him at the age of 20. The
death sent a shiver through the Yale campus, and, for classmates
like Bush, Vietnam suddenly seemed more real and dangerous than
ever.
</P>
<P>
   Yet almost anybody clever enough to get into Harvard or Yale
could find a way to evade the draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``For guys in the Ivy League at that time, there was nobody that
I recall very well standing up and saying, `Hey, my country calls
and if these guys from the inner city are going to war, then by God
so will I,''' said John T. Sartore, a friend of Bush at Yale.
``Most people were wandering around figuring out how to get out of
it, and there were so many ways: getting married, getting orthotics
for your feet, getting braces, failing the medical, joining the
Peace Corps and so on.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the routes to evade service in Vietnam were out of the
question for a man like Bush, rooted in conservative Texas values,
and he had his father's political career to worry about.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very hairy time, and I think George had a little
different pressure because his father was a public figure,'' said
Roland W. Betts, one of Bush's fraternity brothers at Yale.
</P>
<P>
   As Bush recalls it, ``There was no question in my mind that
there was going to be a military service in 1969.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the most socially acceptable routes to avoid Vietnam, for
young Democrats and Republicans alike, was the National Guard. It
counted as military service; it offered the opportunity to learn a
skill, like flying fighter aircraft. And it provided a nearly
iron-clad guarantee that its members would not wind up in Southeast
Asia.
</P>
<P>
   For Bush, the crucial step was applying for a position in the
Texas Air National Guard while back in Houston for Christmas
vacation in his senior year. Nationally, 100,000 people were on
waiting lists to get into the Guard, and the details of Bush's
admission to the unit are controversial.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the Bushes pulled rank, but there is no proof of
this. It is clear, however, that whether or not he demanded it,
Bush got special treatment because he was a congressman's son.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was not only admitted to a program with a long waiting list
but also was promoted to second lieutenant without going to officer
candidate school. Likewise, he was given pilot training despite his
lack of aviation experience.
</P>
<P>
   The Air National Guard was virtually made up of sons of the
Who's Who in Texas. It was sometimes called the Champagne Unit, and
among its members were sons of two other prominent Texas
politicians, Bentsen and John B. Connally, and several wealthy
Texas businessmen.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, sensitive to suggestions that he shirked his
responsibility in Vietnam, said that during his National Guard
service he went to his commander, who is now dead, and asked to be
admitted to the Palace Alert program, which could have sent him to
Vietnam for a short stint.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I remember doing that,'' he said, but he added: ``I
don't want to make it look that I would have been, but was thwarted
by the bureaucracy.''

<P>
   In any case, as all the pilots knew, Bush's plane, the F-102,
was virtually obsolete, and so there was little chance that he
would be accepted for a mission in Vietnam.

GANGS BLAMED AS LOS ANGELES DEFIES NATIONAL CRIME TREND
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  By DON TERRY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In the middle of a sound sleep a few weeks ago,
John W. Mack, the president of the Los Angeles Urban League, was
awakened by a sound he had hoped had vanished from the night here:
the unmistakable rattle of gunfire echoing through the streets.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, he awoke to learn that a man had been shot and
killed 50 feet from his home. Several blocks away, a woman who had
witnessed the shooting was ``blown away, too.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For a while, it looked like we had turned a corner on this
kind of thing,'' Mack said Monday before the start of another
neighborhood anti-crime meeting here. ``But this violence issue is
really, really out of control.''
</P>
<P>
   A seeming resurgence in violent crime has struck Los Angeles in
recent months, at a time when, with only a few exceptions, violent
crime is down nationwide. Compared with this time last year, the
city has experienced a 7.5 percent increase in violent crime,
including 58 more homicides, 97 more rapes, 106 more robberies and
1,437 more aggravated assaults, according to Los Angeles Police
Deputy Chief Maurice Moore.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most publicized cases was the killing of the
20-year-old granddaughter of the city's chief of police. She was
shot as she sat in a car with a childhood friend. The friend, the
intended target, was a gang member. He escaped.
</P>
<P>
   But the violence has been more widespread than was generally
known. Out of the city's 18 police areas, 15 report increases in
violent crime, with several stations experiencing what officials
consider an alarming increase in homicides. The hardest hit, the
Newton station, which includes parts of South Central Los Angeles,
has had 24 more homicides than a year ago, followed by the 77th
police area, with 14 more killings. The Wilshire police area, where
Mack lives, was actually one of only three areas that reported a
slight decrease in violent crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``That just goes to show that there is no sanctuary, no safe
haven from violence,'' Mack said. ``Everybody needs to wake up and
help.''
</P>
<P>
   The police blame much of the increased violence on the city's
65,000 ``identified gang members.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're seeing is multiple gang frictions throughout the
city,'' Moore said, adding that there appeared to be no one reason
for the increased violence. ``A lot of it has to do with turf and
of course drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   But neighborhood advocates such as Najee Ali of Project Islamic
HOPE and Earl Ofari Hutchinson of the National Alliance for
Positive Action say it is too easy to blame the gangs. And police
statistics seem to back them up. So far this year, according to
police, 42 percent of the city's homicides were gang-related,
meaning the majority were not.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a deep sense of hopelessness out there,'' Hutchinson
said. ``We spend more money on prisons than on schools. And the
leadership, particularly the African-American leadership, has
abandoned the inner city. All these factors are coming together and
I don't think this increase in the violence is just an uptick. I
think it's a long term trend.''
</P>
<P>
   It has certainly been part of the city's past. In the 1980s and
early 1990s, street gang violence was almost as much a part of Los
Angeles' image as sunshine, palm trees and bottled blondes. There
have been countless meetings of politicians, ministers,
neighborhood advocates, gang members and grieving parents searching
for ways ``to stop the violence and increase the peace.'' Those
efforts led eight years ago to a well publicized truce among gangs.
That and the overall improvement of the economy contributed to a
lowering of the crime rate here and across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, some experts say, the coming of age of younger gang
members is at least partly responsible for a seeming resurgence of
violence.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the cause, the drive-bys, the meetings and the funerals
are happening more often. Dozens of people turned out Monday for an
anti-violence meeting at the First AME Church, which became a
shelter for hundreds of people during the flames and civil unrest
of 1992. The meeting was one of two held Monday to search for new
and old ways to stop the killing.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting at AME was convened by Los Angeles County Supervisor
Yvonne Brathwaite Burke and the speaker emeritus of the California
State Assembly, Antonio R. Villaraigosa, a candidate for mayor in
next year's election. The Los Angeles city attorney, James K. Hahn,
another mayoral candidate also attended.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were patting ourselves on the back six months about crime
going down,'' Hahn said. ``We have to recognize the work is not
over.''
</P>
<P>
   Chilton Alphonse, who started an anti-violence program in the
'80s, paced in the back of the meeting. He left the country several
years ago, exhausted and heart broken after seeing so many young
people killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was completely stressed out,'' he said. ``I've been through
all of this before. If it goes away for a while and there's a lull
in the killing, everyone forgets about it. The fire will burn, then
it will smolder and then it will erupt again if they don't put
enough resources into the problem. Jobs and education.''
</P>
<P>
   A job is what Michael Jones, 27, needed when he got out of
prison a year and a half ago after serving nine years for what he
called ``gang related crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No one would give me a job,'' he said. ``I was trying to do
right, but I was living on the edge. I started cutting people's
grass and then the police would roust me and say, `Where'd you
steal that lawn mower?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, he was hired by a violence prevention group and now
``kids call me at 2 and 3 in the morning all the time, having a
nightmare about their father getting killed.''
</P>
<P>
   Burke, the supervisor, said finding jobs for young men who had
been in prison should be a major part of any effort to ease gang
violence.
</P>
<P>
   The violence is not confined to Los Angeles. Mary Simmons, a
43-year-old home care worker, lives in Long Beach and she said she
was ``scared everyday.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to get into my home before 9 every night,'' she said.
``I've lost two nephews. We can't go to school because we got to
work all the time to survive on almost no money. My son is 23. He's
tired of struggling. He can't put shoes on his feet. I can't help
him. I don't have any money.'' A big tear fell down her cheek. ``We
can't take care of our kids,'' she said. ``That's why we're losing
our children to these gangs.''

TALKS WILL EXPLORE DEEPEST MATTERS DIVIDING ISRAEL AND
PALESTINIANS

(With MIDEAST-TALKS and MIDEAST-ISRAEL) 
 By JANE PERLEZ    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When President Clinton announced the Camp David
summit meeting, he said he hoped it would resolve the deepest
matters dividing the Israelis and Palestinians, questions of
``beliefs, political identity, collective fate'' that raise dark
fears and emotions. He also sounded a note of weary familiarity,
saying that the issues were so well-known that the solutions should
be within sight.
</P>
<P>
   As the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, and the Palestinian
leader, Yasser Arafat, begin their first session of final peace
talks with Clinton, they are expected to test how far apart they
are on the future status of Jerusalem, the fate of more than three
million Palestinian refugees and the borders of a Palestinian
state.
</P>
<P>
   What is intertwined with these overarching issues is the
question of how many Israeli settlers on the West Bank would remain
in Israeli territory and how many would come under Palestinian rule
and then, most likely, be resettled in Israel. The future of the
Jordan Valley will also be on the table.
</P>
<P>
   International financial assistance is likely to be discussed,
including an American component, to compensate refugees but also to
help form a new Palestinian state. Separately, the Israelis are
seeking an upgraded security relationship with the United States,
though one that falls short of a mutual defense pact.
</P>
<P>
   The American team, led by Clinton, has not said whether it will
work on all the issues at once or single out those where the most
progress can be made. Nor has it signaled whether it will present
precise American ideas _ known in negotiating parlance as
``bridging proposals'' _ for all the issues or just for some.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Israeli prime minister, Yitzak Rabin, and Arafat
agreed in principle seven years ago on a peace settlement in which
Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization recognized each
other, these crucial issues have been kicked down the road for a
final round of talks designed to formally end the more than
five-decade conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The 1993 agreement, which was negotiated in Oslo and signed on
the White House lawn, called for the two sides to make a final
settlement by May 4, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   That deadline was extended last September _ in an agreement at
Sharm el Sheik, Egypt _ to Sept. 13, 2000, the date Arafat has set
for unilaterally declaring a Palestinian state if there is no final
peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   In the seven years since Oslo, the Israelis have withdrawn from
the Gaza Strip and about 40 percent of the West Bank. These moves
were carried out after wrenching negotiations for a series of
interim accords, including one in 1998 at Wye, Md., where Clinton
mediated between Arafat and the conservative Israeli prime
minister, Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the two sides have been called to the endgame on the
hitherto too-tough-to-deal-with issues, the differences appear
acute on every front. A senior American official said that in
on-and-off talks over the last seven months, including back-channel
negotiations in Stockholm, the two sides had ``demythologized'' the
issues. But he said that gaps had been narrowed only in some areas.
And that small progress, he said, was beginning to be eroded by
bitterness in the last month.
</P>
<P>
   The question on which the least progress has been made,
according to all participants in the negotiations, is Jerusalem. In
Stockholm, there was a little bit of ``brainstorming'' on
Jerusalem, but ``brainstorming is cheap,'' said an official
familiar with the talks. A senior Israeli official said here last
week that it was possible that agreement would be reached on
several major points but that an agreement on Jerusalem was much
more unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   The heart and soul of the Israeli position is still that
Jerusalem is the undivided and eternal capital of Israel, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Arafat said last month that he remained insistent
that East Jerusalem become the capital of a Palestinian state.
Those who disagreed, he scoffed, could ``go and drink from the Dead
Sea.'' Arafat, his aides say, will not be the Arab leader who gives
up on Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli officials have suggested that Barak is considering
granting some increased autonomy to Palestinians in East Jerusalem
_ specifically, more control of public services.
</P>
<P>
   A 1995 document by Yossi Beilin, now the Israeli justice
minister, and Abu Mazen, the secretary of the Palestine Liberation
Organization, had compromises on a range of issues, but _ showing
how tough the issue is _ not on whose capital the city would be.
</P>
<P>
   Published versions of the document, known as the Beilin-Mazen
agreement, outline compromises on all the major issues in the
Palestinian-Israeli conflict and components of it are being revived
as the talks open.
</P>
<P>
   One version of the document says that the boundaries of greater
Jerusalem would be expanded to include Palestinian districts,
including the suburban towns of Abu-dis, al-Ayzariyan and Salwan.
The Palestinian Authority would create a capital in these new
districts and call it Al-Quds and not Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   For the estimated 200,000 Arabs who live in Jerusalem, a
municipal council would be formed to manage local affairs under the
supervision of the Israeli council that is now responsible for the
whole city. And the Palestinian flag would be flown from the
Islamic holy sites.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, because the plan does not recognize Palestinian
sovereignty over East Jerusalem it has been dismissed by Arab
diplomats as the ``Jewish solution.'' It seemed impossible, they
said, that Arafat would be able to live with what would amount to
only linguistic niceties, such as Palestinian ``autonomy'' in East
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials as well as Israelis and Palestinians
have all said that if the Camp David sessions got as far as
tackling Jerusalem, the compromises necessary on both sides would
be so substantial that the talks could break down at that point. In
the days before the meeting, there have been increasing suggestions
that the White House might have to settle for an agreement that
would leave decisions on Jerusalem for another day.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   But some officials have said that in an overall package there
could be the possibility of both sides moving to fallback positions
on Jerusalem in return for a final agreement that ended all claims
by either side.
</P>
<P>
   On the question of territory _ how much and where the Israelis
will give up land on the West Bank _ there appears to have been
some behind-the-scenes movement. Indeed, both Israelis and
Palestinians say this has been where there has been the most
progress.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat and his top aides have repeatedly declared that Israel
must withdraw from the West Bank and Gaza to the borders that
existed before the 1967 Middle East War, in accordance with U.N.
resolution 242. Part of Arafat's insistence is based on what he
calls the precedent laid down by Israel in its peace deals with
Egypt in 1979, when 100 percent of the Sinai was yielded, and in
Jordan in 1994, when Israel swapped some land with Jordan to
compensate for land taken by Israel decades before along their
joint border.
</P>
<P>
   But in private, the Palestinian leader has acknowledged to
American officials that large Israeli settlements on the West Bank
are certain to be annexed by Israel in a final deal. In return for
such a concession, Arafat contends that Israel must ``swap'' some
Israeli land to be included in the new Palestinian state. Barak's
advisers are reported to be divided on this issue.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli officials said that Barak opposes swapping land because
it would encroach on the notion of Israeli sovereignty. One of the
parcels of land that has been discussed is in the Negev Desert.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the Israelis have not been precise on the amount of
territory they are prepared to give up on the West Bank. The
Israeli press has reported that between 90 and 92 percent of the
West Bank would be ceded _ much more than the 60 percent or 75
percent that had been generally thought. The Barak government has
not officially acknowledged that it is considering these higher
figures, though.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Israeli official said that land with about 70 percent
of the 175,000 settlers would be annexed to Israel. The future of
the remaining settlers _ those in outlying areas or scattered
settlements _ would have to be negotiated.
</P>
<P>
   These settlers, according to preliminary discussions, would have
a choice of taking Palestinian citizenship _ a highly unlikely
choice _ or of being moved back to Israel. The Israelis are
insisting on no ``arbitrary'' dismantling of settlements.
</P>
<P>
   In many respects, the negotiators believe that the future of
more than three million Palestinian refugees, most of whom either
left Israel after the 1948 war or are their descendants, may be the
easiest problem to solve. About a million are in camps run by
international agencies in Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, Gaza and the West
Bank.
</P>
<P>
   The mantra of the Palestinian Authority has been that these
refugees must have the right to return to Israel and that Israel
must accept responsibility for the fact they fled or were expelled
during the 1948 Arab-Israeli conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Israel says it refuses to accept responsibility and will not
acknowledge the right of return but will show ``empathy'' for the
refugees, said a special adviser to Barak, Yossi Alpher.
</P>
<P>
   The Barak government is prepared, Alpher says, as a
``humanitarian gesture,'' to allow some family reunification _ as
occurred in the 1950s and 1960s until the 1967 war _ but on a scale
to be negotiated.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian officials faced with their own budgetary and space
limitations on how many refugees they want to take into their new
state could be willing to go along with a concept that grants the
right of return in principle but stops short of actually carrying
it out, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   About 2.7 million Palestinians live on the West Bank and Gaza,
and U.N. officials estimate that the Palestinian Authority would
probably accept the return of a maximum of 500,000 refugees phased
over a number of years.
</P>
<P>
   A sizable international aid package spread over 20 years has
been suggested for compensating the refugees and the governments
that have been hosts to them. Japan, the European Union and the
United States would be the major contributors.
</P>
<P>
   On the future of the Jordan Valley, the Israelis officially
assert that the area will remain Israel's security border but that
the security presence may be phased out over a period of time. An
international force could patrol the valley, and Israeli soldiers
would be part of it.
</P>
<P>
   While the eventual loss of the Jordan Valley is not popular in
Israel, it is not nearly as sensitive an issue as Jerusalem. ``The
Israeli body politic won't go crazy if the Jordan Valley is handed
over,'' an official said.
</P>
<P>
   For Barak, particularly in his precarious political situation,
the size of the American aid package and the upgrading of the
security relationship are of utmost importance. Part of his ability
to sell a peace deal in general elections _ which he would likely
call _ would depend a great deal on how much he was able to bring
home from Washington in terms of new weaponry and radar capable of
detecting missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Arafat is expecting considerable financial aid from
the United States, as well as Japan and the European Union, to help
get his new state off the ground. Just before departing for the
summit, Arafat's chief economic adviser, Mohammed Rachid, said the
Palestinians would ask the Americans for $40 billion, much of it
for refugee assistance.

 &HT;    A time to pitch and a time to putt
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALTNATA _ John Smoltz was big-time serious. When it concerns his
golf game or his pitching, he always is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be totally honest with you,'' Smoltz said. ``If there was
ever a chance to become a free agent, I wouldn't even consider any
team that wouldn't let me play golf.''
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't been an issue for Smoltz and the Braves. Since Bobby
Cox took over as Braves manager in 1990, a golf-friendly policy has
been in effect for his multitalented starting pitchers and other
players. Cox not only allows them to take their golf clubs on the
road, he encourages it, citing physical and mental advantages.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, they have been collecting Top 100 golf courses at
an even faster pace than Cy Young Awards.
</P>
<P>
   Although Smoltz, Greg Maddux and Tom Glavine represent the core
of the Braves' golf squad, it often includes starter Kevin Milwood
or WSB producer Dave Baker, with occasional appearances by first
baseman Wally Joyner, Braves broadcasters Don Sutton and Joe
Simpson or first-base coach Glenn Hubbard.
</P>
<P>
   During dead times in the Braves' clubhouse, it is common to see
them in the back, out of view of the media, practicing on their
customized, undulating putting green. On most road trips, they
assemble early in the morning in their Softspikes to play some of
the nation's most prestigious courses.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the Cubs,'' Maddux said, ``we were allowed to stay out
all night drinking until 3 or 4 in the morning. But if you got up
at 8 to take your golf clubs out, `Whoa, don't do that.' I never
understood it, but that's kind of just the way it was.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that a multimillion-dollar salary earner is in dire need of
perks, but in this case the rich certainly get richer. Glavine's
baseball high point was Game 6 of the 1995 World Series, but among
life's cherished moments, right up there was an off Monday in San
Francisco a few years ago when the pitchers drove to the Monterey
Peninsula to play Pebble Beach, Cypress Point and Spyglass and
still made it back to the ballpark Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   A sweet one, Smoltz agreed, but his vote would be for the off
day in New York hen he, Glavine and Maddux played Shinnecock Hills,
site of the 1995 U.S. Open, and the highly regarded National Golf
Links, back to back.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of their golf adventures is The Book. That would
be Smoltz's book of course contacts and telephone numbers, which he
started in the early 1990s. Over the years, dating back to when the
group included then-Braves pitchers Pete Smith and Charlie
Leibrandt, they have developed enough nationwide relationships that
usually only a call is needed to get on Pine Valley, Baltusrol,
Winged Foot or Medinah.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux kids that Smoltz's book could be more valuable than each
player's book on opponent hitters. Or is he kidding?
</P>
<P>
   ``Hitters change,'' Maddux said, allowing one of his devilish
grins. ``Golf courses don't change. They usually just get better.''
</P>
<P>
   Golf `helps everything'
</P>
<P>
   Maddux never fails to appreciate the fact that Cox treats them
like adults in the matter, confident that they will use their best
judgment. Cox's only mandate is that the pitchers do not play the
day they are on the mound, which is a no-brainer, anyway. Maddux
takes it a step further, never playing the day before a start.
Glavine does the same when a day-game appearance is approaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played with some managers who didn't care what you did as
long as you weren't late to the ballpark,'' said Sutton, a Hall of
Fame pitcher. ``But Gene Mauch, who was an avid golfer, said,
`Wherever you play, it better be good, because it's a $500 fine.' I
never understood it. Nothing in golf is going to hurt you as a
pitcher. With some teams, it's OK to go to a topless bar, but don't
get caught with your golf clubs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they should play,'' Cox said. ``It helps everything.
It's an outlet for them. I encourage those guys, the starters, to
do it. It's a good way to loosen up after you pitch. Some managers
used to tell guys years ago, go swim after you pitch. Why not play
golf?''
</P>
<P>
   Cox insists his rules would be the same even if we weren't
talking about Cy Young Award winners who have led baseball's best
pitching staff for the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not drinkers and everything,'' Cox said, ``and they
don't hang out (at the bars) after the games like the old days.
Everybody goes to their rooms. So why not enjoy your life? If golf
helps you, great.''
</P>
<P>
   Long John
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz, who is on the disabled list after elbow surgery and does
not make road trips, even got permission to play in a pro-celebrity
tournament at Lake Tahoe last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Smoltz is the primo player of the group. All of them
have played in PGA Tour pro-ams such as Pebble Beach or the Bob
Hope and enjoyed a few rounds with tour players such as Tiger
Woods, David Duval and Mark O'Meara. But Smoltz, who can bomb his
treasured 5-wood 275 yards or his driver more than 300 yards, is
the total package.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's sickeningly long,'' Glavine said. ``To us, he's like
Tiger is to everybody else on tour. When he hits one, he's 30 yards
by us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's legit,'' Maddux said. ``A lot of guys hit a couple of
good shots a round, and they think they're good golfers, but
Smoltzie is legit. For being a baseball player, he can really go
low.''
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz ``tries not to let baseball interfere with his golf,''
Sutton said. ``The first question after surgery from John is, `When
can I start hitting wedges?' He hits the ball so far, but he also
can control it and he knows the game.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He gives me something to shoot for,'' Joyner said.
</P>
<P>
   The oddsmaker
</P>
<P>
   Other than baseball and family, golf is all that Smoltz wants to
do. He almost surely will play the Celebrity Golf Tour full-time
when he is through pitching, and he might try the Senior Tour. His
game has developed to where now a fifth of his rounds are in the
60s. He shot a 68 in Dan Marino's charity event.
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz said he improved from a 12-handicap to an 8, then a 4,
from about 1991-95. ``But it wasn't until last year that I really
got over the hump and started shooting under par almost every four
or six times,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With Smoltz sidelined, there has been a greater load on Maddux
and Glavine to make and confirm their arrangements at prospective
courses. The upside is a gain in their wallets. With Smoltz in the
rotation, the betting can be feverish, with $20 Nassaus and
automatic presses building the pot. Glavine said at one stage, it
got way too serious.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next thing you know,'' he said, ``you're complaining about
somebody moving a ball off a tree root. That's the last thing we
need, is somebody saying, `Hey, you've got to hit that,' and we've
got a broken hand and somebody's on the DL.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, it has become almost traditional to try to hold off
Smoltz's betting schemes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can stick it up a tree 40 feet in the air,'' Maddux said,
``and he'll want odds that he's still going to save par.''

<P>
   In some ways, Army Private Al Gore was never and could never
have been just one of the guys, another grunt.
</P>
<P>
   Recruiters were afraid to even sign him up without calling in a
supervisor, once they heard his name and caught on that he was the
son of that antiwar Sen. Albert Gore, and just out of Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those with lesser rank bumped him up to me because they were
scared of making a mistake,'' said Dess Stokes, the staff sergeant
on duty at the Newark Armed Forces Entrance and Examination Station
in New Jersey, where Gore went to enlist, hoping to avoid notice,
in August 1969. ``We all knew who he was because of his daddy
opposing the war.''
</P>
<P>
   No less than the Army's highest-ranking officer, Gen. William
Westmoreland, singled him out during a visit to Fort Rucker, Ala.,
where Gore was stationed for more than a year. The Army chief of
staff stopped in the middle of a farewell ceremony to pull the
young man aside for a private chat _ and kept Gore's superior
officers waiting, and watching, while he asked one of the
lowest-ranking men on the base for his thoughts on why so many
young people opposed the war.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is no evidence that Gore sought special treatment, or
that the extra notice he got anyway provided any real protection.
On the contrary, within the parameters of his job as an Army
journalist, Gore probably assumed more risk than he had to,
helicoptering around South Vietnam interviewing soldiers who had
just seen action.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who knew Al Gore in Vietnam knows he could have sat on
his butt and he didn't,'' said Michael Roche, Gore's editor on The
Castle Courier, the newspaper of the Army's Engineering Command in
Long Binh, near Saigon. ``I had 30 or 40 stringers and 3 or 4 on
staff, and I didn't have one who traveled as much as he did.''
</P>
<P>
   And if Gore has a dirty secret from Vietnam, it is not that he
spent his tour hiding in headquarters, but that he found much of
the experience exhilarating, and loved feeling ``more alive,'' to
use his words, in the middle of the war that he and millions of
other Americans hated.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a vividness in a war zone, even if you're not in
combat,'' the vice president said recently, during one of several
interviews about his military experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're driving down a one-lane road with vegetation on both
sides, and it's an area where people say, `Keep on your toes.'
That's quite vivid. A lot of people when they came home felt
disoriented just because that vividness wasn't in their lives any
more. I know a lot of guys who felt a great urge to go back, and
the camaraderie was very intense and powerful.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore is drawn to vividness, and though he is generally regarded
as cautious, he has also, throughout his life, been a little bit
attracted to risk and speed _ practicing water-skiing stunts as a
kid in Tennessee, riding his motorcycle too fast around Harvard _
or taking off in a helicopter near the DMZ with his legs dangling
out the side.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, he told Barbara Walters that he too often stays on
an intellectual level rather than going with his feelings. And the
way he speaks of his time in Vietnam suggests that he is grateful
to have been forced to feel while he was there.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about an Army friend's comment that he had a lot of
fun in Vietnam, Gore said: ``You aren't supposed to say that, I
guess. There was always the awareness of why you were there and
what was going on. But in the sense of the camaraderie and the
vividness again? In many ways, you're more alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore has occasionally added a splash of color to the tableau
when describing his military service. Years ago, he suggested to
reporters that he was shot at in Vietnam when he was not _ an
exaggeration that may have been less an attempt to mislead than an
attempt to make his experience more vivid.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about those statements, Gore said only this: ``I
wasn't shot at, but I was in areas where there was firing.'' He
mentioned a trip with Mike O'Hara, now a sportswriter for The
Detroit News, to Khe Sanh, near the DMZ, where Army engineers were
re-opening an abandoned airstrip.
</P>
<P>
   ``They sent in the infantry to secure it and there were
helicopter gunships firing,'' he added. ``My buddy kidded me for
digging a foxhole, but there was firing in the hills surrounding
there. It wasn't aimed at me, but I wasn't sure of that.'' O'Hara,
who was Gore's closest friend in Vietnam, has said that he
remembers the gunfire, too _ all outgoing.

 &HT;    Parlow prepares for move to Atlanta
 &HT;    By Karen Rosen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Cindy Parlow has been covering a lot of ground in
Atlanta with one goal in mind: finding a place to live before she
joins her team in the start-up women's soccer league, the WUSA, in
April.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking everywhere,'' Parlow said during a brief visit,
which includes a round of golf and a ticket to tonight's All-Star
Game at Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   Because the franchise hasn't yet decided where it will play or
practice, Parlow is holding off on signing a lease.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want a huge commute,'' said Parlow, who is a senior at
the University of North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   It's understandable, because Parlow is spending most of this
year on the road. The 5-foot-11 forward is the leading scorer on
the U.S. women's national team, including three hat tricks in June.
She leaves Wednesday on a 20-day trip to Europe, where the U.S.
will play Norway, Germany and China.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still developing as a team,'' Parlow said, ``trying to
get injured players back in the lineup and get them some playing
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Goalkeeper Briana Scurry, who also will play on the Atlanta
team, Carla Overbeck and Michelle Akers will rejoin the U.S. squad
for this trip.
</P>
<P>
   Since capturing the public's fancy by winning the 1996 Olympics
and the 1999 World Cup, people expect the U.S. team to win every
time they kick the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time we lose, everybody says, `What's wrong with the
women's team?''' Parlow said. ``Nobody realizes that we don't just
show up and win. We have to bring our best game to the field and
play 100 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the Memphis native was the youngest U.S. women's player
at age 18. Her most vivid memory is standing on the gold-medal
podium, hearing the national anthem, ``as we're all yelling the
words to it,'' she said. ``I wouldn't call it singing.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that Parlow's among the veterans, she appreciates the
experience more than she did four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``In '96 I was just the happy fan, just happy to be there, going
to the Olympics with all of these guys,'' Parlow said. ``Most of
these guys I had posters up on my wall at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I'm on the team, I'm more in the phase of, `I want to help
this team win.'''
</P>
<P>
   The same goes for her next team, the as-yet unnamed WUSA
franchise, which is operated by Cox Enterprises Inc., owner of The
Atlanta Journal-Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been our dream for so long,'' Parlow said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   When he first ran for president, in 1988, Gore's campaign was
criticized for using photos of young Private Gore in his uniform,
carrying a standard-issue M-16. Was he trying to create the
impression that he saw combat?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an accurate picture,'' he said, irritated. ``That's what
I looked like when I was doing my job. The fact is, I carried a
pencil and a loaded M-16 A1 outside the base camp and I worked in
areas where I had to be armed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never claimed to have been in combat,'' he went on. ``Did
I feel scared? No, not really. No way I would compare what I did
with people who came through the fire and did brave things. But
Vietnam is a subject people hear about in funny ways. If they see a
picture of you with a gun, they'll see that as an exaggeration.
Well, excuse me, but that's reality. People have such charged
feelings.''
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore's military record is in no particular need of
improvement. He was one of only about a dozen of the 1,115 Harvard
graduates in the Class of `69 who went to Vietnam. And even before
enlisting, he passed up a chance to serve in the National Guard _
the military option chosen by his presidential opponent, George W.
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   A cousin of Gore said she and her then-husband had secured the
promise of a place for him in the Alabama Guard. ``I had friends
who had gone to Vietnam, and one who had come back a paraplegic,
and I was beside myself wanting to keep Al out of there,'' said the
cousin, Gayle Byrne, of Birmingham,, who grew up near Carthage,
Tenn, where the Gores spent summers on their farm. So Byrne's
former husband, a member of the Guard, asked a well-placed contact
to hold a spot for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the word came back that yes, they would hold a slot, we
were so excited we called Al right away,'' Byrne remembered. ``But
he said, ``I appreciate what you've done, but I just don't believe
I can do this.' He talked about how small the draft roll was in
Carthage'' _ and how, if he did not serve, someone he knew would
have to take his place.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was complicated by his father's upcoming 1970
Senate race, which everyone anticipated as his toughest, in large
part because of Senator Gore's stand against the war. Though Albert
Gore did vote to authorize American involvement in early 1964, by
the end of that year he was pushing for a negotiated settlement
with the Communists.
</P>
<P>
   The war was not the only issue in the election contest, of
course, but so many of the others _ race, busing, even school
prayer _ to some extent became mixed with the war in the minds of
voters, who found the senator too tolerant of social protest of all
kinds and of change in general.
</P>
<P>
   Young Al worried that if he found a way around military service,
he would be handing an issue to his father's opponents. But once he
finally decided to enlist, he never looked back. ``I wanted to
serve honorably and well and get it over with,'' he said recently.
</P>
<P>
   But as others of his generation headed for Woodstock that month,
he was calling his old Harvard roommate, John Tyson, to ask him to
come along for moral support as he signed up for the Army.
</P>
<P>
   Though Gore says his assignment as an Army journalist came as a
complete surprise, Tyson recalls that ``the reason people enlisted
was to have a greater ability to pick'' their job _ an assessment
Army historians say is accurate. A family friend recalled that Gore
surveyed the options and hoped to serve as an Army journalist.
</P>
<P>
   Highly educated enlisted men generally did get their choice of
assignments, and with his Harvard degree, Army officials said, Gore
never ran any real risk of being assigned to the infantry.
</P>
<P>
   So after basic training at Fort Dix, N.J., he was sent to Fort
Rucker, the Army's aviation school in Alabama, where he wrote for
the base newspaper, The Army Flier, under Margaret Cobb, the
civilian who handed out assignments.
</P>
<P>
   ``She and Al were like Lou Grant and Mary Tyler Moore,'' cracked
Maurice Hendrick, who worked there with Gore and later became mayor
of Rutherford, N.C. ``She'd been there 1,000 years and was very
firm and no nonsense,'' while Gore worked hard and aimed to please.
</P>
<P>
   The real goal was to obscure the news. ``If there was a
helicopter crash, you couldn't put that on the front page,'' said
Gus Stanisic, who served with Gore and edited the paper. ``You
couldn't dwell on fatalities.''
</P>
<P>
   All the half-dozen soldiers who lived and worked together on The
Flier were against the war, same as Gore. They saw protest movies _
among them MASH and The Strawberry Statement _ right on the base,
and got away when they could.
</P>
<P>
   On weekends, they rented a house in Panama City, Fla., where
they'd play cards and drink cheap wine. One friend, Richard Abalos,
now a lawyer in Odessa, Tex., wrote home that he was rooming with a
future president _ so smart, but a good guy, too _ who had gotten
their group into playing football on the beach ``just like the
Kennedys.''
</P>
<P>
   That May, Albert Arnold Gore Jr. and Mary Elizabeth Aitcheson
were married in Washington's National Cathedral, Al in his dress
blues, Tipper in a formal, high-necked gown. Then he brought his
new bride back to Alabama, where home was a 10-foot wide ``Expando
model'' trailer.
</P>
<P>
   There was a sweetness to this anxious time, though. The night
before a friend, Bob Delabar, shipped out for Vietnam, Gore spent
hours crawling around on a highway median looking for a four-leaf
clover _ a talisman Delabar says he carried to Vietnam and back,
until it finally disintegrated in his wallet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd had a few too many beers,'' the vice president says now.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Gore was waiting to go to Vietnam, too. All his friends remember
that he wanted to go, and the usual course of a two-year hitch in
the Army included a year there.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore family could never prove their suspicions, denied by
various Nixon administration officials, that Gore's orders were
held up on purpose. At the time, his Army buddies said, they were
convinced that President Richard Nixon would not allow him sent to
Vietnam while there was even the slightest chance that it might do
Senator Gore some political good should something bad happen to his
son.
</P>
<P>
   But the fact that Gore was eventually sent to Vietnam with only
seven months left to serve in his hitch was highly unusual. In the
end, Gore shipped out the month after the election.
</P>
<P>
   The nastiest fighting Gore saw in 1970 was back in Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Gore's antiwar position was a loser there, and his son
took a couple of weekend passes and a week's leave to try to help
save his father's career.
</P>
<P>
   The son stood behind the father at rallies, sometimes in
uniform, to remind folks that the Gores opposed the war but were
still good Americans doing their duty. They also appeared together
in two commercials _ one in which he and his father were shown on
horseback and another in which the senator told him, ``Son, always
love your country.''
</P>
<P>
   But the senator, always an indifferent fund-raiser, was badly
outmatched this time. And the campaign run by his Republican
opponent, Bill Brock, who later expressed regrets, is still
considered a model of dirty politics: The Watergate investigation
would later discover that Nixon operatives poured illegal money
into the race. One donor was Richard Mellon Scaife, the same
conservative who later spent millions of dollars on anti-Clinton
investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Brock's slogan, ``Bill Brock believes in the things we believe
in,'' was a bald appeal to disaffected supporters of George
Wallace, and his campaign made Senator Gore out to be a turncoat
son of the South.
</P>
<P>
   ``A person who preceded me speaking in East Tennessee one night
called him a traitor to his country,'' said Frank Hunger, Albert
Gore's son-in-law and, later, the widower of Nancy Gore. ``At a
football game that fall when his name was announced he was
practically booed out of the stadium, but he held his head high. He
took it.''
</P>
<P>
   On election night, Albert Gore gave a concession speech
conceding nothing. ``The truth shall rise again!'' he told
supporters, in what has been interpreted as a reference to the
promise of his son's future. Those who knew the senator, though,
feel he was too lost in his own pain that night to have been
thinking any such thing.
</P>
<P>
   Though Gore no doubt learned a great deal from his father over
the years, that one campaign shaped Al Gore's own public life to a
remarkable extent.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if there was any link between his enthusiasm for
fund-raising and the fact that his father was badly outspent in
1970, he first said, ``I hadn't thought of that, but maybe that was
a factor.''
</P>
<P>
   Really? Even though some of the same people who defeated your
father were coming after you and President Clinton? Asked again,
Gore let loose, sounding much more like the son of an old Tennessee
populist than he usually does: ``One thing I did learn in the
aftermath of that election is that the people you're fighting for
should not have their interests damaged and overturned by superior
fund-raisers and political activities on the other side!'' he said,
almost shouting. ``You owe it to them! The wealthy and the powerful
will always have more money, but if you can even the odds you can't
let them down, because they're depending on you.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore then volunteered another way the 1970 campaign stayed with
him: his father, he said, ``was accused during that race of losing
touch with his constituency, which wasn't true, but later when I
was in Congress I believe I held what was the all-time record for
town hall meetings. And nobody ever said that about me, not even
unfairly.''
</P>
<P>
   Which may also explain why Gore's long campaign days now end so
often in some deserted hall where the vice president has stayed
late to answer every straggler's question _ long after Bush and
most other Americans have knocked off for the evening.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Whether the 1970 campaign also made Gore a more cautious
politician is less clear. His father got out in front of his
constituents _ on race and the war and the separation between
church and state _ and lost his seat.
</P>
<P>
   And his son, it is true, often sticks to the safety of well-worn
slogans; this week he is criticizing what he calls the
``do-nothing-for-people Congress.'' Yet he is also capable of the
in-your-face iconoclasm of ``Earth in the Balance,'' his 1992
environmental manifesto.
</P>
<P>
   In a new forward to the book, which was re-issued this spring,
Mr. Gore wrote, ``For those who want to attack my view, let me the
save you the trouble of reading the entire book. On pages 325 and
326, I wrote: `It ought to be possible to establish a coordinated
global program to accomplish the strategic goal of completely
eliminating the internal combustion engine over, say, a 25-year
period.' It is possible; it needs to be done; it will create more
jobs, not destroy jobs. I'm proud that I wrote those words, and I
reaffirm them today.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said his father had taught him when to play it safe and
when to go for it: ``My father told me, `Son, you have to pick the
walls you're going to butt your head against.' He meant some issues
are so tough that if you take on the overwhelming opinion of the
majority in your district you better keep track of how much damage
you're doing to your ability to accomplish constructive change.
Very few people will talk about that, but it's something we all
have to think about.

   ``So I use the `strict scrutiny' standard that I learned in law

very important cases. I try to be ferocious in defending what's
most important to me _ freedom of speech, religion _ and refused to
yield an inch on prayer in school even though 90 percent in my
district felt the other way.''
</P>
<P>
   Politicians cannot apply that standard to every single issue, he
said _an acknowledgement that is obvious but also pretty nervy.
Asked for an example of an issue to which he has applied a less
stringent standard over his career, Gore named gun control, saying
that ``unlike today, the 1970s did not cry out for restrictions on
guns.''
</P>
<P>
   And after his father's 1970 race, Gore felt sure he'd never have
a career in politics. He talked about writing, even farming _ and
told Hendrick, back at Fort Rucker, that he and Tipper wanted
nothing more than to move back to Tennessee, live on a commune and
raise vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM0 Right after Christmas, Al Gore finally did
ship out for Vietnam, and arrived at the 20th Engineer Brigade at
Bien Hoa, outside Saigon, on Jan. 2, 1971. The Army was in bad
shape at that point, demoralized by the scornful lack of support
for a war the country was no longer even trying to win.
</P>
<P>
   Troops had already been withdrawing for two years, and those
left on the ground were waiting to turn the war over to the South
Vietnamese. Morale was so low that a few American soldiers had shot
their own commanding officers rather than follow their orders to
fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody knew what a moronic war it was by that time, and it
was, `Do what you have to do to get home,''' said Roche, Gore's
editor in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Roche recalled that ``I was told to go North again with 35 days
left'' to serve in Vietnam ``and I said, `No, you can court-martial
me but I'm not getting killed for nothing.' The guy backed down.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So getting in a chopper to go to fire support bases at that
point in time was pretty risky'' for Gore, Roche said, and made his
relatively gung-ho attitude all the more striking.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the one thing you could do'' that didn't seem like an
utter waste in those days, Roche added, was try to build up fellow
soldiers by reporting the individual acts of bravery that did
happen amid so much despair _ and, less dramatically, the good
works of the engineers, who were building roads, hospitals and
water purification systems all over the country. That is what Gore
did in the war.
</P>
<P>
   Bien Hoa was relatively safe, though sirens occasionally warned
of mortar attacks. From the hooch Gore shared with 9 other guys, he
could hear fighter planes taking off throughout the night.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Ancona, of Manhattan, who had known Gore at Fort Rucker,
said he knew even before Gore arrived that he was on the ``watch
list.'' ``All that meant was that he was connected to someone
important. It was more like a protocol thing, but it didn't mean
anything.''

   Still, it is not inconceivable that an ambitious commander might
have wished to avoid seeing a watch-list soldier harmed on his
watch.
</P>
<P>
   And an Army photographer, H. Alan Leo, said his commanding
officer, Brig. Gen. Kenneth Cooper, called him in before Gore
arrived. ``His exact words were, `This is not a direct order, but I
want to make sure this person does not get into a situation he
cannot get out of.'''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper, now retired, has said he has no memory of either that
conversation or Leo. Several other soldiers who knew both Gore and
Leo in Vietnam said they liked Leo but either did not believe him
or thought he must have taken a comment like, ``Watch his back,'' a
little too literally.
</P>
<P>
   Leo acknowledged that he resented Gore before he ever met him,
and changed his routine only ``slightly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he did have the bug, and actually wanted to go in the
field,'' Leo said. ``There was occasional sniper fire when I was
with him, and he took his chances like the rest of us. I guess I
still had that animosity that he probably never had a hard day in
his life, but when other guys would go to the houses of ill repute,
he would stay faithful to his wife and I never saw him treat anyone
with disrespect. He wasn't my slap-on-the-back buddy, but he earned
my respect. There were some values there.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore says he more often traveled with other photographers, and
never felt restrained. Did he feel treated differently by some of
the other guys, by virtue of his name?
</P>
<P>
   ``No more so than at any other time in my life,'' he said, after
thinking for a minute. In fact, maybe less, he added; His father,
after all, was not a senator anymore.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   A few men in his company said Gore was probably best known in
Vietnam for his scathing impersonations of superior officers.
</P>
<P>
   His biggest story for The Castle Courier ran under the headline,
``Threatened Overrun of Fire Support Base Blue Thwarted By Quick
Reactions.'' In it, he wrote, ``On the night of Feb. 22 there was
no moon. The men sacked out early as usual, soon after the movie
was over _ ``Bloody Mama'' with Shelley Winters as the maniac
murderess ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Three hours later, a trip flare was set off on the outside
strand of barbed wire ... Then silence. Probably another one of
those damn rabbits _ and probably a dead rabbit by now.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There was an explosion ... The explosions kept up, and they
all seemed to be hits. Either they were damned accurate shots or
... `V.C. in the compound! VC in the compound!' Suddenly everyone
was yelling it. And dogs were barking.''

   Many of his other dispatches were less colorful. From Khe Sanh,
where engineers were opening supply lines, he filed this report:
``The fork-lift operators had their hands full _ or rather, their
forks full.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore also seems to have quoted every Tennesseean in Vietnam at
one time or another. And he offered highly detailed accounts of the
engineers' work.
</P>
<P>
   Once, he covered a mountain road Australian troops were helping
to build. ``We wouldn't call it a mountain in Tennessee, but anyway
the Viet Cong controlled it at night and the United States during
the day and my buddy and I stayed there and lived in a tent. We
took comfort from the fact that ambushes were rare, but still, it
was, ``Ok, how rare?'''
</P>
<P>
   Every night, he said in an interview, the Australians would sing
Maori folk songs _ which inspired Gore to write an admiring story
``about the diversity and multiculturalism'' of their unit. ``I
opined that we Yanks could learn a thing or two.'' The piece never
ran.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   After five months in Vietnam, Gore applied for and received an
early out to attend Vanderbilt divinity school in Nashville. The
Army was granting such outs easily at that point.
</P>
<P>
   Though he had gone in hating everything about the Vietnam War,
he was coming out with a more complicated assessment of the
situation _ and an evolving view on the use of American military
force.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still think Vietnam was a big mistake, but it was the
feelings of the ordinary Vietnamese people in the South who were
terrified of losing their freedom that had an effect on me,'' he
said recently. ``Especially Catholics were terrified of a Communist
victory and that sure didn't fit into the cartoon image I had
before I went over.''
</P>
<P>
   Vietnam certainly did not make Gore an anti-interventionist,
even in the 1970s and '80s. Unlike others in his party, he
supported the invasion of Grenada in 1983 and was one of only 10
Senate Democrats who supported the Gulf War in 1991, infuriating
his party's leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Before he left Vietnam, he wrote a letter to Gus Stanisic, who
had worked with him on the ARmy paper at Fort Rucker in Alabama. In
the letter, Gore said that when he got back, he planned to
``atone'' for his sins by attending divinity school.
</P>
<P>
   What was he atoning for?
</P>
<P>
   Stanisic says he has no idea. ``In those days you just said,
``Oh, yeah, man, I dig.''' Gore says he does not remember using the
word atone, but very much recalls his deeply unsettled feelings
about the war. And about coming home.
</P>
<P>
   He had missed Tipper desperately, of course, and was glad to be
back, yet something nagged at him for months, even years, after his
return. On many nights, his wife would wake up and find that he was
out walking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure I fully understand it,'' Gore said quietly. ``But
you know, it didn't end. You were leaving something that was still
going on. If you're a part of something, a war, you want to win it.
Not that I had a bayonet in my teeth, but part of what was screwed
up about it was that we weren't trying to win.''
</P>
<P>
   And if the highly competitive Gore was atoning, it was not
because he went to war, but because he came home.

ICE-RINK DEATH REFLECTS PARENTS' RAGE DURING EVENTS FOR CHILDREN 
</HEADLINE>
   By FOX BUTTERFIELD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A suburban Boston father charged with manslaughter in
the fatal beating of another father over rough play at a youth
hockey game pleaded not guilty Monday, as sports officials and
psychologists suggested that the incident reflected a rapid growth
in parents' violent acts at children's athletic events.
</P>
<P>
   Behind that rise in such violence during recent years, the
experts say, is more involvement by fathers and mothers in their
children's sports, greater pressure to see their offspring win
athletic scholarships or big-money professional contracts, and a
tendency to over &UR; - &LR; identify with the children, who, the parents
hope, will become the sports stars they themselves never were.
</P>
<P>
   In the case here, Thomas Junta, a 42-year-old truck driver with
no previous criminal record, turned himself in to the police Monday
and was released on $5,000 bail in Woburn District Court.
Manslaughter carries a maximum sentence of 20 years' imprisonment
in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Junta's court appearance followed by five days the assault on
the 40-year-old victim, Michael Costin, at a hockey rink in
Reading, north of Boston. Martha Coakley, the Middlesex County
district attorney, said Costin's death had resulted from a ``wanton
and reckless assault and battery.'' There is no evidence that the
two men knew each other, she said, and no ``indication of an intent
to kill.''
</P>
<P>
   Costin was beaten after a pickup hockey game where he had been
on the ice monitoring play. Junta, watching from the stands,
shouted at him, demanding that he stop some body-checking and
fighting that the police said involved the two men's 10-year-old
sons. Junta, who is 6 &UR;  &LR; feet 2 inches and 275 pounds, initially
assaulted Costin, 5-11 and 170, as he left the ice, the authorities
said, and then, after being ordered out by a rink manager, returned
and slammed Costin to the ground beside a soda machine.
</P>
<P>
   That blow to Costin's head as he hit the concrete floor
apparently caused brain death almost instantly, Coakley said, but
Junta pushed his knee into Costin's chest and continued to pummel
him in the head.
 &UR;  &LR;  Whatever the root causes that led the events of last Wednesday to
spin so badly out of control, the death of Costin and the arrest of
Junta touched off talk by experts about the harm of parental
over-involvement in children's athletics.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just the tip of an iceberg,'' said William Pollack, an
assistant clinical professor of psychiatry at the Harvard Medical
School who is an authority on father-son relationships. Pollack
said reports of assaults by parents at youth sports events ``have
gotten much worse'' in the last five &UR;  &LR; to 10 years, and statistics
show that the number of injuries in youth sports is also sharply up
during the same period, a result at least in part of parents'
encouraging their children to play more aggressively.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Still, a spokesman for the National Association of Sports
Officials, which represents 19,000 umpires and referees in
professional as well as high school and youth sports, said his
organization had seen a sharp increase in reports of violence by
parents at sports events in the last three or four years, usually
by parents attacking an official, though sometimes assaulting
another parent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get two or three reports of this kind of behavior a week,''
Still said in a telephone interview from his group's headquarters
in Racine, Wis. ``There is definitely a trend.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Still said, he received a report that a coach, the
father of a player, had broken the jaw of a 13-year-old umpire at a
Little League game in Davie, Fla., because he did not like a call.
</P>
<P>
   And last year a mother in Virginia slapped a 14-year-old
official and knocked him to the ground because she disagreed with a
call during a soccer game, Still said.
</P>
<P>
   It has reached the point, he said, where the association has
begun to offer its members assault insurance and provide legal
advice to those who have been attacked.
</P>
<P>
   Sports officials and psychologists agree that there are several
likely causes of increasing parental violence.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Engh, founder and president of the National Alliance for
Youth Sports, a nonprofit organization in West Palm Beach, Fla.,
that works to promote fun and safety in athletics, said the first
cause was ego. ``It's not the kid at bat,'' he said, ``it's the
parent,'' who is living vicariously through his child.
</P>
<P>
   A second factor, Engh said, is greed. ``So many parents today
are saying, `My child is going to get some of that money, the
millions of dollars in professional sports or a college
scholarship.''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard Zaichowsky, a professor of sports psychology at Boston
University, who grew up playing hockey in Alberta, Canada, said one
important change was the sheer increase in parental involvement in
sports. ``When I was growing up, parents were minimally involved,''
he said. ``Kids rode their bikes or walked to games, and they
settled things themselves. Now parents drive the kids to practice
and games, and as things have gotten more organized, the stakes are
higher.''
</P>
<P>
   The death of Costin may well be an example of this increased
parental pressure, Zaichowsky said. ``Who the heck used to play
hockey in July?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Murphy, who has been refereeing high school basketball games
for 20 years in Boston and its suburbs, said: ``Quite frankly, it's
gotten worse over the years because of the way society is. Now it's
win, win, win at all cost. It's no longer about the kids having
fun.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Once the parents get involved,'' he said, ``things seem to go
awry.''
</P>
<P>
   Murphy said he kept parents away from a summer basketball camp
he runs for boys in the sixth, seventh and eighth grades. ``Without
the parents,'' he said, ``there is less chance for confrontation.''

 &HT;    The old-time All-Stars from Fayette County
 &HT;    By Furman Bisher
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - Not exactly neighbors, but living within about 10
miles of each other in rural Fayette County, Georgia, are two
former American League All-Stars. Cecil Travis, 86, was born, grew
up and still lives on original Travis acreage. Billy Moran, 66,
native of College Park, was a searing-hot prospect when he came out
of high school. He got $40,000 to sign. Travis got $500. Travis was
chosen to play in three All-Star Games and played in two. Moran was
chosen to play one time and played in two. You'll see what I mean.
</P>
<P>
   This is the kind of man Cecil Travis is.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ted Williams says you belong in the Hall of Fame,'' was the
way it was put to him.
</P>
<P>
   Travis was thoughtful for a moment or two. ``I don't think
that,'' he said, finally. We sat in lawn chairs in the shade,
sheltered from the blistering heat on the bank of one of his lakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of players with records as good or better than
mine who are not in it. I just don't think it would look right.'
</P>
<P>
   Country gentleman. Solid citizen. Humble to a fault. Without
pretension.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, if I had had several seasons like 1941, then it might be
different. But the war came along, and when I got back, it was
gone. Maybe I tried to come back too quick, but Washington was in a
race for the pennant in 1945, and they thought I could help.''
</P>
<P>
   The season of 1941 was the kind any player would like to hang
from the rafters. It was the season Ted Williams hit .406, last of
the .400 hitters. It was the season Joe DiMaggio had his 56-game
hitting streak. But Cecil Travis had more hits than either, 218,
and led the league. He went to bat 608 times. He struck out only 25
times. In his career he went to bat 4,914 times. He struck out only
291 times. Here was a man with an eye keen enough to count the
stitches on a baseball flying at him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hit .359 that season, second to Williams, but I was a mile
behind him.''
</P>
<P>
   When he was first tipped as a lad to the gregarious Tubby
Walton, who ran ``Tubby Walton's Baseball University,'' with a
chicken-wire backstop, Prof. Walton was told, ``I know a boy that
can hit a curveball.''
</P>
<P>
   Tubby said, ``Ain't no boy can hit a curveball.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This one can. I've seen him do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Tubby told the informant to bring the boy in, and so, in a pair
of white duck pants and tennis shoes, 17-year-old Cecil Travis
arrived on the ``campus.'' Tubby picked out the toughest, meanest
pitcher he had. (``He'd done time on the road gang.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``That boy hit every mean thing that ex-con could throw at
him,'' Tubby said.
</P>
<P>
   Tubby wasted no time springing into action, which eventually led
Travis to the Chattanooga Lookouts, then to the old Washington
Senators, the only major-league team he ever played for.
</P>
<P>
   At the signing, on the front porch of the Travis farmhouse,
Cecil's father, an educated man, was reading the contract line by
line. ``First time anybody I signed ever read a contract,'' Walton
said. He looked up at Tubby Walton and said, ``This sounds like my
son is joining the chain gang.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Shore does,'' Tubby said, ``but they don't get paid on the
chain gang.''
</P>
<P>
   From 1933 to 1941, Travis hit below .300 only one season, when
he missed part of 1939 with an injury. His line-drive style, ``blue
darters'' to those of that vintage, was perfect for Griffith
Stadium. The outfield was as big as a prairie and the fences as
tall as redwoods, so you won't see many home runs on Travis'
record.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Moran came out of Russell High School with a variety of
options, but when the Cleveland Indians came forth with a bonus of
$40,000, which looked like $400,000 then, that took everything else
out of play. By 1958, he had arrived in Cleveland, and by 1962, he
was the All-Star American League second baseman after he had been
traded to the Los Angeles Angels, then playing in the Dodgers' new
stadium at Chavez Ravine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was special because I was voted in by my peers, with guys
like Bobby Richardson and Nellie Fox going strong,'' he said.
``With New York and Chicago fans voting, I'd never have made it.''
</P>
<P>
   That was a year of the all-star gluttony, two games instead of
one, thankfully the last year of it. The first game was played at
RFK Stadium in Washington, where Moran singled in four at-bats, the
second in Wrigley Field in Chicago, where his one base hit created
a furor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a line drive to center field, and Henry Aaron got ... a
glove on it. You couldn't tell if he caught it or not, but the
umpire ruled it was a trap. Rocky Colavito hit a home run behind me
and that was the game, 9 to 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a thrill, just being in the clubhouse with guys from
other teams, like Roger Maris, Mickey Mantle and Yogi Berra. Yogi
pinch-hit for me in the late innings. Imagine that, Yogi Berra
pinch-hitting for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Of historical significance is this, that over the next 20 years,
the American League would win only one time.
</P>
<P>
   As for twin ``classics,'' Moran says this: ``That took a lot off
it, I thought. One made it a special event. Two games sort of
watered it down, like what inter-league play is doing to the World
Series.'' That was Moran's best season in the majors, .282, 17 home
runs and 74 RBIs. He was almost as good in 1963, when he hit .275.
Then he made a decision that he lives to regret to this day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Rigney said the Angels had a hot prospect coming in from
Hawaii and wondered if I'd mind moving over to third. Well, when
the manager asks you to do something, you did it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Second base was my home. I'd grown up there. I didn't have a
third-base arm, and I never was the same again. I injured my back,
and they traded me back to Cleveland. I should have said no, but
you didn't do that then.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``hot prospect'' may be seen these days, still in the major
leagues. Bobby Knoop is a coach for Jim Fregosi at Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Cecil Travis' most vivid All-Star memory involves not him, but
Ted Williams, in the game of 1941 at Detroit. ``Arky Vaughn had
already hit two home runs, and the Nationals were leading, 5 to 3.
Two men were out when Williams hit one (out) in right field for
three runs in the last of the ninth, and we won the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Travis played the 1940 and '41 games at third base, although as
a Senator he was a shortstop. Joe Cronin was the shortstop one
year, Luke Appling the other. Travis got his only hit, a double, at
Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   There wasn't much mixing and mingling between players of the two
leagues in those years. Such comradeship was frowned upon, even in
a picnic atmosphere such as the All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   ``One player you couldn't escape talking to was Luke Appling,''
Travis said. ``Luke was always talking to you. He'd talk your ears
off.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike these times, the All-Star Game was the attraction, and
that was it. No sideshows, no supporting events, no entertainment
at all. Just show up and play.
</P>
<P>
   When the game was last played in Atlanta in 1972, baseball
commissioner Bowie Kuhn invited Travis and his wife to be his
guests. ``Joe Cronin had called. He was president of the American
League, but I had to tell him Bowie Kuhn had already invited me. He
had been a batboy and scoreboard worker in Washington when I played
there, so he had known me since he was a kid.''
</P>
<P>
   A stretch of nearly four seasons away at war pretty much spelled
the end of Travis' career. He never hit .300 again. A story
circulated that he had suffered from frozen feet on the European
front, but he shot that one down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just a couple of frozen toes. Had no effect on me. I probably
tried to make it back too soon,'' he said. ``I'd think I had it
going, then it would go away. Pitchers you used to hit got you out
on most anything.''
</P>
<P>
   He knew it was time. In late 1947, his average at a dismal .216,
Travis packed it in and came home to his farm, from which you can
get a view through the woods of Evander Holyfield's modern version
of the extreme castle.

 &HT;    Missile defense failures show futility of system
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Saturday's misfire over the Pacific should erase any doubt for
President Clinton about whether he should order the deployment of
the Pentagon's limited missile-defense system. This turkey shows no
signs it can fly.
</P>
<P>
   Let no one gloss over this fourfold failure. Most distressingly,
the missile interceptor started tumbling off-course as it streaked
toward its test target. The interceptor's ``kill vehicle'' didn't
separate from its booster, thus preventing its sensors from
detecting the incoming missile. A balloon decoy accompanying the
missile didn't inflate as it should have, so the system's ability
to distinguish between a real threat and a fake remains far from
proven. Finally, the test was delayed for two hours because of a
battery malfunction.
</P>
<P>
   This test was Pentagon-tailored for success _ simply to ``shoot
at a cooperative target in an orchestrated way,'' in the words of a
leading critic, MIT physicist Theodore Postol. Yet it was a flop,
even when the Pentagon gave itself an extra two hours to react _ a
generosity no enemy would show.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's advocacy of a limited missile shield has always seemed
contrived so as to protect himself and his chosen heir Al Gore from
attack by Republicans who favor an even grander, reincarnated
``Star Wars'' defense. Moreover, the goal of putting his proposed
system into operation by 2005, in light of its spotty test record,
seems hasty to the point of recklessness.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is supposed to make up his mind based on the nature of
the threat, the state of our technology, the cost of the project
and the effect of deployment on U.S. security. Any sensible,
objective analysis of these criteria should lead him to a negative
conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   There should be no rush to guard against a negligible threat.
The most frequently mentioned ``rogue'' nation, North Korea,
recently agreed to extend its nearly yearlong moratorium on missile
flight tests. The longer it observes this pause, the more distant
the danger it poses. As for Iran and Iraq, they are considered
years away from developing long-range missiles. In any event, no
sane enemy is likely to announce his return address, as a missile
attack would do, and thus bring on massive U.S. retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   The technology aspect, as demonstrated Saturday, is no selling
point. Neither is the cost, set at $60 billion, which is no doubt
an underestimate.
</P>
<P>
   The most crucial argument against deployment, however, is its
certain destabilizing effect on the current nuclear balance. Russia
and China are bound to see it as a U.S. effort to blunt their own
nuclear deterrent and doubtless will try to enlarge their offensive
capabilities accordingly. Now that would be a genuine threat to
American security.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said it
would be irresponsible for Clinton to hand off the deployment
decision to his successor next year. No, it would be truly
irresponsible to go ahead with deployment in the face of the weak
case for and the strong arguments against it.
</P>
<P>
   Let the Pentagon continue to research better ways to counter an
enemy's missiles, but don't commit America's defense to this
misbegotten bird.

 &HT;    Armstrong battles miserable conditions to take lead in Tour de
France
 &HT;    By Suzanne Halliburton
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOURDES-HAUTACAM, France _ The conditions were miserable Monday,
with an unseasonably cold wind whistling through the passes of the
Pyrenees Mountains, making it seem more like winter than the middle
of July. Rain, ranging from drizzle to a heavy downpour, was
compounding matters, giving the steep, narrow roads more of a
treacherous air.
</P>
<P>
   And then there was the nasty mist that shrouded the tops of the
two steepest climbs, the Col d'Aubisque and the Hautacam, which the
Tour de France cyclists would encounter later in the day.
</P>
<P>
   Austin's Lance Armstrong heard the weather report early Monday
as he was eating breakfast at his hotel outside Dax, where he and
his U.S. Postal Service teammates were staying prior to stage 10.
He laughed in anticipation.
</P>
<P>
   No other rider shared his perverse glee.
</P>
<P>
   Monday morning, Armstrong, the defending Tour champion, started
the 127-mile race in 16th place overall. A little more than six
hours after the start of this frightful stage, Armstrong burst
through the dripping mist as the new leader.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, all the sprinters who were ahead of him to start
the morning fell by the wayside. But the fact that Armstrong
dominated his chief competitors in this first mountain stage
shocked many who closely follow the world's greatest cycling event.
</P>
<P>
   ``His total domination is leaving everybody speechless,'' said
Mark Gorski, general manager of the U.S. Postal Service team. ``You
could just hear the gasps in the media room. I don't think anyone
thought he would be this completely devastating.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong finished second to Spain's Javier Otxoa, a mountain
specialist, in Monday's stage 10, which ended with a mile-high
climb to the summit of the Hautacam. Armstrong started the day 5
minutes, 44 seconds out of first place.
</P>
<P>
   He ended the afternoon with a 4:14 cushion over Jan Ullrich, the
champion of the 1997 Tour. Christophe Moreau was in third at 5:18.
</P>
<P>
   Marco Pantani, who won the 1998 Tour and has a reputation for
making up large chunks of time in the mountain stages, was 25th,
10:34 behind Armstrong. Laurent Jalabert, who wore the yellow
jersey for three days last week, was 18th and 8:01 out of first.
Alberto Elli, who donned yellow to start Monday's stage, was 57th
at the end of it, 25:35 behind Armstrong.
</P>
<P>
   The yellow jersey, which Armstrong wore for the final 12 stages
of last year's Tour, fit as comfortably as it did last July. After
his performance, he found himself answering questions about whether
he had clinched the Tour championship 11 stages from its finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because someone has the lead now, he can lose it like
that,'' Armstrong said. ``With two weeks to go, the Tour is still
anybody's race.''
</P>
<P>
   His performance suggested otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Otxoca gained the stage lead near the top of the Aubisque, which
at 1,709 meters was the highest climb for the day. Another group of
eight elite riders, including Richard Virenque and Fernando
Escartin, reached the top 10 minutes after Otxoca.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong got there almost 12 minutes after Otxoca. He was
accompanied by Pantani, who by now had shed his trademark bandana;
Ullrich and Alex Zulle, who finished second to Armstrong in the
1999 Tour. By this time, Armstrong's protectors, teammates Kevin
Livingston of Austin and Tyler Hamilton, had dropped back in the
pack.
</P>
<P>
   ``This group (of top contenders) went ahead pretty early, and by
this time I didn't have any teammates beside me,'' Armstrong said.
``I had no idea what to do. My only choice was to wait.''
</P>
<P>
   With just more than seven miles to go, as the riders approached
the Hautacam climb, Pantani pounced, making his move to distance
himself from Armstrong.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong immediately stood forward on his bike, deciding then
that it was time to increase the pace. Over the next three miles,
he made up Virenque's 1:10 margin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Armstrong went like an airplane,'' Virenque said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the fans who had waited more than six hours in the
miserable weather to see the finish stood on the course, inches
from Armstrong, urging him on. A lone American flag waved as he
neared the finish.
</P>
<P>
   Otxoa appeared to have expended most of his energy by the final
mile, as he literally wobbled toward the finish. But Armstrong
couldn't pass the Spaniard, who blew kisses to the crowd and
crossed himself as he passed the finish line.
</P>
<P>
   Over the final 22 miles, Armstrong made up more than 10 minutes
on Otxoa. Jose Maria Jimenez gave the pro-Spanish crowd even more
to cheer, finishing third. Virenque was fourth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Otxoa deserved to win,'' Armstrong said. ``He was away all
day. He rode a fantastic race. He rode hard, and about 99 percent
of those people out there were Spanish and cheering him on. I'm
proud of him.''
</P>
<P>
   As for his own performance, Armstrong said: ``I don't know if
I'm stronger than I was last year. I tell you that the tests I did
before the Tour indicate that I'm faster. But the form is a funny
thing. It comes on slowly and it goes away quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Carmichael, who has coached Armstrong for a decade,
watched Monday's stage unfold almost as he had predicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was just doing what he's been doing,'' said Carmichael, who
watched the stage with Armstrong's wife, Kristin, and son, Luke.
``It's what has been in him this whole time. I knew no one would be
stronger, and I said that before the Tour started.''

WHITMAN'S APPEARANCE IN A FRISKING PHOTO RAISES CONCERNS 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ After enduring two years of criticism for the
racial profiling practices of her state troopers, Gov. Christie
Whitman is suddenly struggling with a self-inflicted
public-relations problem: a photo of the governor herself, grinning
as she frisks a black man.
</P>
<P>
   The photo, which has been subpoenaed by two New Jersey troopers
who have filed a discrimination suit against the state, was taken
by a trooper during a trip Whitman made with officers as they
patrolled in Camden one night in 1996. The picture was obtained by
The Associated Press and published in several New Jersey newspapers
over the weekend and on Page 1 of The New York Times in some
editions Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   It shows the governor in a baseball cap, dungarees and black
Kevlar gloves, patting down a man whose arms are splayed against a
graffiti-covered wall.
</P>
<P>
   The symbolism of the photo and the facts of the frisking _ the
man was stopped for ``suspicious activity'' but not arrested or
found to be violating the law _ has drawn criticism from civil
rights leaders who have long questioned Whitman's sensitivity to
inner-city residents, and from the governor's political foes.
</P>
<P>
   The governor was at the National Governors' Association meeting
Monday in State College, Pa., and her press office did not make her
available to discuss the issue. But she told the AP that she
regretted taking part in the frisk, and was simply trying to learn
firsthand about the dangers that officers encounter in Camden, the
state's most impoverished, crime-ridden city.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman said she hoped that the shock value of the photo _ which
was taken two years before racial profiling became the state's most
consuming issue _ would not overshadow the fact that in 1999 she
became the first state official to acknowledge that state troopers
were singling out minority drivers for traffic stops, and went on
to overhaul the force to discourage discriminatory practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``That worries me, and for that I am deeply sorry,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the photo's release _ three weeks before the
Republican National Convention in Philadelphia, just across the
river from Camden _ could hardly be worse for the governor. Some
Whitman supporters still hold out hopes that George W. Bush might
choose her as a running mate, but the governor's close advisers say
she is trying to position herself for a cabinet position or
ambassador's post.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Al Sharpton and the Black Ministers Council of New
Jersey are scheduled to meet this week to plan a series of protests
around the state, and say they plan a demonstration after the
opening ceremonies of the convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it needs any explanation why it took her so long
to understand the outrage over racial profiling _ she herself
engaged in it,'' Sharpton said. ``You're not talking about
speculation, you're not talking about interpretations. Here you
clearly have a governor engaged in this and caught in the act.
</P>
<P>
   Civil-rights advocates and Whitman's political opponents have
pounced on the issue in the days since the photo first surfaced,
calling the incident a sign of her callousness towards minorities.
Deborah Jacobs, executive director of the New Jersey chapter of the
American Civil Liberties Union, said the search was also illegal
because troopers had apparently searched the man, and found no
contraband, before turning him over to the governor.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Wayne Bryant, D-Camden, said the photo would set back
the attempts to heal the state's racial divisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would never have happened in white suburbia,'' said
Bryant, who is black. ``In a state with a profiling problem, it
sends a signal that you can do things to young African-Americans
the kind of things that you wouldn't think of doing to other
people. They reduced this individual to something less than a human
being. It was like a rodeo, and they got caught up in the
roundup.''
</P>
<P>
   The photo was taken in the spring of 1996, a year before Whitman
ran for re-election. Whitman, who went on to take credit for
bringing down New Jersey's crime rate during the 1997 campaign,
enjoyed good relations with the state's law enforcement community
at the time and said she wanted to spend a few nights working
alongside the state troopers she had sent in to roust Camden's
violent drug gangs.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1998, however, two troopers shot three unarmed minority
men on the New Jersey Turnpike, and the complaints of racial
discrimination by troopers grew to dominate the state's political
agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the details that have begun to emerge about the
governor's midnight tour of Camden recall some of the most serious
discrimination allegations against the state police.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Moran, the lawyer who subpoenaed the photos, said a state
police supervisor had offered an extra week of paid vacation to the
troopers who were escorting the governor if they bring back a photo
of Whitman frisking a black suspect. The supervisor used a racial
slur to refer to blacks, Moran said, and apparently thought it was
funny to harass black civilians.
</P>
<P>
   The officer told Whitman about the bonus vacation time,
apparently without repeating the racial slur, and she agreed to be
photographed, Moran said.
</P>
<P>
   But Jayne O'Connor, a spokeswoman for Whitman, said Monday that
the governor never knew that the trooper had planned to exchange
her photo for vacation time. The governor wanted to frisk a
suspect, O'Connor said, because she wanted to take part in the same
experiences as the troopers.
</P>
<P>
   In a May 1996 interview with The Camden Courier-Post, Whitman
described her travels through that city with the troopers and said
the visit had helped her better understand the challenges facing
inner city parents. She did not mention taking part in a frisk. The
governor also recounted the tale of one man who was searched, but
was released after officers found he had $100 in his pocket. She
told the paper that the man had told her: ``Not everyone you find
with a lot of cash on them in Camden is a criminal, Governor.''
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear whether the man she described was the man she
frisked.
</P>
<P>
   Under New Jersey law, it is illegal for officers to perform a
search unless they believe a suspect is armed or has committed a
crime, said Jacobs, of the New Jersey civil liberties union.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a recent Supreme Court ruling that says a search can
only be for a law enforcement function, and not just for the
press,'' Jacobs said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's disheartening that the war on drugs can lead some elected
officials to trample on people's rights, to use people as props and
to carry out searches as photo opportunities.''

   Thousands of Iranians in exile demonstrated in Berlin against
the start of a three-day state visit by President Mohammad Khatami.
The police arrested scattered protesters after detaining dozens of
opponents of the Tehran government during overnight searches of
local residences. Security is high during Khatami's visit, the

K2 DESIGN ACQUIRING SILVERCUBE TO BETTER SERVE ADS TO MOBILE WEB
USERS 
</HEADLINE>
   By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A leading agency in the interactive services field is
branching out with its first acquisition, entering the potentially
lucrative but risky realm of wireless services.
</P>
<P>
   K2 Design Inc. in New York, which handles Internet marketing for
advertisers like Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Philips and Standard &AMP;
Poor's, plans to announce Tuesday that it will join with a venture
capital partnership to indirectly acquire for $14.8 million in
stock and cash a majority interest in SilverCube Inc., a wireless
professional services company that works for marketers like General
Motors Corp. and Edmunds, a clearing house for automotive data.
</P>
<P>
   SilverCube, based in Rochester, Mich., specializes in strategy
and content development for the new generation of cellular
telephones, pagers, hand-held computers and other devices that
deliver text in the form of news headlines, e-mail _ and yes,
advertisements. K2 and Unwired Ventures I, a partnership of Emerald
Ventures Capital in King of Prussia, Pa., will join forces for the
deal and will operate four offices under the SilverCube name.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is indicative of the growing interest in the wireless
Internet among agencies that were founded in the 1990s to
capitalize on the boom in its wired counterpart. The ability to
gain access to the World Wide Web through, say, a display panel on
a cellular telephone or a personal digital assistant is appealing
to marketers that want to aim sales pitches at consumers based on
geography or demographics, as evinced by the formation of the
Wireless Advertising Association.
</P>
<P>
   But there are daunting challenges associated with m-business
(dial ``m'' for mobile) that vary from technical shortcomings to
disparate formats to the costs of gaining wireless access to the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is doing what they did with the Internet in '94,
saying `Here are the limitations of the current technology,
therefore it won't be a component of everyday life,''' Matt de
Ganon, executive chairman at K2, said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``A pure-play wireless professional services company will help
companies sort out the morass of competing issues,'' said de Ganon,
who was joined by executives of SilverCube and Emerald Ventures in
a telephone interview as they provided a preview of the coming
deal.
</P>
<P>
   After the deal goes through, K2 will own 38.2 percent of
SilverCube, Unwired Ventures I will own 35.3 percent and current
shareholders of SilverCube will own 26.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we saw in the people at K2 was their embrace of wireless
technologies,'' said Greg Guidice, chief executive at SilverCube.
</P>
<P>
   ``The devices will continue to change,'' he added, ``but as
everyone becomes more and more familiar with the wired Web, we're
finding they want to take information where they want, when they
want, with wireless.''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Guidice said, ``our Edmunds clients say they get
phone calls on the weekend'' from car shoppers in metropolitan
Detroit, where auto dealerships are closed on Saturdays, ``who want
to compare the Oldsmobile Aurora to the Toyota Camry.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to tell the callers to check out the Web site,'' he
added. ``But with wireless, we give that ability to do comparisons
by phone.''
</P>
<P>
   Guidice will serve as chief operating officer at SilverCube
after the deal goes through; a search for a chief executive is
under way. De Ganon and Lynn Fantom, president and chief executive
at K2, will most likely join the SilverCube board. Gary Brown,
chief operating offer at K2, will serve as interim chief financial
officer at SilverCube.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been scouring the market for potential acquisitions,''
said Brown, who joined K2 in April from units of UBS, the Swiss
banking company. ``SilverCube has done some pretty significant
business in the unwired segment already with GM, among others.''
</P>
<P>
   For GM, SilverCube designed and introduced a way for users of
personal digital assistants to visit a condensed version of the
Oldsmobile Web site to obtain data like model specifications and
dealer addresses. That is being expanded to the rest of the GM
domestic divisions.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps SilverCube could persuade Leo Burnett, Oldsmobile's
advertising agency, to revive a familiar ad slogan and promote the
new wireless access as ``not your father's wired Internet.''

 &HT;    GOP: Get ready for a new convention
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GOP National Convention officials on Monday announced details of
``a different kind of convention for a different kind of
Republican.'' But a watchdog group says it will be paid for by the
same old corporate cash.
</P>
<P>
   In a report entitled ``And Now a Message From Our Sponsors,''
the Center for Responsive Politics detailed the high-dollar
donations that will help pay for this summer's national political
conventions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dozens of the nation's biggest companies, many of which have
major issues pending before Congress, are lining up to help foot
the bill for this year's conventions, some writing seven-figure
checks to each of the events' local host committees,'' said the
report from the center that monitors money and politics.
</P>
<P>
   Each party gets $13.3 million in federal funds to pay for their
conventions. The Republicans gather in Philadelphia July 31 - Aug.
3. The Democrats meet in Los Angeles Aug. 14-17.
</P>
<P>
   The government money doesn't come close to paying for the
conventions, however. The GOP event has a price tag of $50 million,
$20 million more than the party spent in San Diego in 1996.
Democrats plan to spend $35 million, a $5 million hike from four
years ago in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Both parties look to corporate America to help pick up the tab.
Sixteen corporations have given at least $500,000 for the GOP
convention. Ten corporations have been at least that generous to
Democratic convention organizers.
</P>

   Most of the high-dollar donors have high-stakes interests
pending in Washington. The top single donor, American International
Group, which gave $2 million for the Democratic convention, has
successfully lobbied for deregulation of the financial services
industry as well as open trade with China, a change that could
benefit the company.
</P>
<P>
   AIG also gave $500,000 for the Republican convention.
</P>
<P>
   US Airways, awaiting congressional support for its proposed
merger with United Airlines, has given $500,000 to the GOP
convention. United Airlines is a $500,000 donor to the Democratic
event.
</P>
<P>
   The list of top donors to the conventions also includes General
Motors, Microsoft Corp. and a variety of telecommunications firms.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Fitzpatrick, spokesman for the GOP convention organizing
committee, referred all questions about the money to the host
committee, a private entity set up to raise money for the event.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are set up to gather the resources for the convention,''
he said. ``Technically, it's not accurate to say the Republicans
are getting these contributions.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the host committee did not return Monday phone
calls.
</P>
<P>
   For the Republicans, the corporate money will help pay for a
convention aimed at putting a new face on the Grand Old Party.
Details about the convention were released Monday by Andy Card,
general co-chairman of the event and former transportation
secretary under President George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The Philadelphia event will break some of the rules of
convention scheduling and operate under the theme: ``Renewing
America's Purpose. Together.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are abandoning the tradition of dedicating an entire night
to old-style attack politics,'' Card added. ``Our primary focus
will be talking about what we stand for as a party and where
Governor Bush wants to take the country. However, elections are
about choices, and we expect our speakers to compare and contrast
Governor Bush's positions with those of Al Gore and the current
administration _ clearly defining our differences on the issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Each night will have an issue theme, beginning with education on
July 31. The speakers will include Laura Bush and retired Gen.
Colin Powell. The second night will feature national security
issues, with speeches from Elizabeth Dole, Sen. John McCain and
Condoleezza Rice, a Bush adviser who is expected to play a major
role in the White House is Bush is elected.
</P>
<P>
   Though McCain is riding to the convention in the Straight Talk
Express bus he used during the presidential campaign to highlight
campaign finance reform, his comments will be limited to national
security issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he wanted to talk about strength and security,'' Card
said.
</P>
<P>
   Maintaining prosperity is the theme of the third night, which
also will include a speech from the vice presidential nominee,
something that generally happens on the fourth and final night of
national conventions.
</P>
<P>
   Bush will offer his acceptance speech, as dictated by tradition,
on the final night. The governor is expected to arrive in
Philadelphia on the convention's third night, but he will appear in
live remotes from the campaign trail on the first two nights.
</P>
<P>
   Bush will be nominated on the convention's third night. Instead
of the usual one-night roll call of the states, voting will be
spread over the first three nights.
</P>
<P>
   In another effort to show the GOP as more inclusive than it has
been in the past, Bush is making sure that women and minorities
have key roles. The convention's co-chairs are U.S. Reps. Henry
Bonilla of San Antonio, Jennifer Dunn of Washington and J.C. Watts
of Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our party is one that is inclusive and that stands for the
issues important to Americans,'' said Bonilla, the Texas'
congressional delegation's only Hispanic Republican. ``I look
forward to to being a part of this historic event for both Texas
and America.''

 &HT;    GOP: Get ready for a new convention
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GOP National Convention officials on Monday announced details of
``a different kind of convention for a different kind of
Republican.'' But a watchdog group says it will be paid for by the
same old corporate cash.
</P>
<P>
   In a report entitled ``And Now a Message From Our Sponsors,''
the Center for Responsive Politics detailed the high-dollar
donations that will help pay for this summer's national political
conventions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dozens of the nation's biggest companies, many of which have
major issues pending before Congress, are lining up to help foot
the bill for this year's conventions, some writing seven-figure
checks to each of the events' local host committees,'' said the
report from the center that monitors money and politics.
</P>
<P>
   Each party gets $13.3 million in federal funds to pay for their
conventions. The Republicans gather in Philadelphia July 31 - Aug.
3. The Democrats meet in Los Angeles Aug. 14-17.
</P>
<P>
   The government money doesn't come close to paying for the
conventions, however. The GOP event has a price tag of $50 million,
$20 million more than the party spent in San Diego in 1996.
Democrats plan to spend $35 million, a $5 million hike from four
years ago in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Both parties look to corporate America to help pick up the tab.
Sixteen corporations have given at least $500,000 for the GOP
convention. Ten corporations have been at least that generous to
Democratic convention organizers.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the high-dollar donors have high-stakes interests
pending in Washington. The top single donor, American International
Group, which gave $2 million for the Democratic convention, has

   FCC MULLS RADIO LICENSES
</P>
<P>
   For months, Republicans in Congress have sought to block a
Federal Communications Commission program to license thousands of
new low-power radio stations. About half of the first batch of
applications are from religious organizations, mostly the sorts of
fundamentalist churches active in conservative, Republican
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of evangelical churches are asking for space on the
airwaves to spread the Gospel. Some simply want to read Scripture
verbatim; others want to preach against abortion. They will not get
the chance, however, if the Republican congressional leadership
gets its way.

   CLANCY FOLDS CHARITY
</P>
<P>
   After seven years, the writer Tom Clancy is scuttling a
foundation that he set up to help children who had cancer and other
illnesses use the Internet to talk with one another and learn about
their diseases. Despite spending more than $5 million on travel,
salaries, fund-raising and furniture, the foundation did not even
have a Web site to show for its efforts. The legal fight that has
broken out over the collapse of the foundation offers a rare
glimpse at the inner workings of a celebrity charity.

<P>
   Alcoa said that its second-quarter profit rose 57 percent,
beating Wall Street forecasts by 2 cents, as aluminum prices rose

   Stocks ended mixed in subdued trading, with blue chips pulling

Nasdaq composite index dropped 42.91 points, or 1.1 percent, to
3,980.29, while the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index fell 3.28

 &HT;    Judge, jury hear tapes discussing fire at Davidian compound
 &HT;    By MARK ENGLAND
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Discussions picked up by government-planted
listening devices about pouring fuel and keeping a fire going
inside Mount Carmel on April 19, 1993, were played Monday for a
Waco jury hearing the Branch Davidians' wrongful-death lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The fire seven years ago led to the deaths of David Koresh and
75 followers.
</P>
<P>
   There were numerous references in the audiotapes to fuel and
fire: ``Real swift thing, you can order the fire, yeah?'' ... ``The
fuel has to go all around to get started.'' ... ``Well, that's the
fuel. We should get more hay in here.'' ... ``Do you think I could
light this soon?'' ... ``I want a fire around the back.'' ...
``Let's keep that fire going.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Walter S. Smith Jr. overruled plaintiffs'
objections that the tapes were hearsay and should not be admitted
unless the voices on them could be identified.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides heard things differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the indications we have is that they were lighting fires
to burn the place down, probably as part of a suicide attempt,''
said government co-counsel Michael Bradford. ``But regardless of
what the reasons are, they set the fire and not the government as
alleged by the plaintiffs in this case.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston attorney Mike Caddell denied the tapes show the
Davidians setting fires.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were trying to survive what they viewed as a final
assault, a final attack on their home,'' said Caddell, lead
attorney for the plaintiffs. ``There was no indication in these
tapes that they were committing suicide.''
</P>
<P>
   The advisory jury that will assist Smith in reaching a verdict
listened to the tapes with the help of cordless earphones.
</P>
<P>
   They also followed two transcripts: One was prepared by the
government. The other was done by plaintiffs attorney Cynthia
Chapman and a staff member. Chapman's version has the Davidians
pursuing the tanks pouring tear gas into Mount Carmel rather than
self-destruction.
</P>
<P>
   The government's version of one fuel discussion read: ``So we
only light 'em as soon as they tell me last chance, right? Not if
they (unintelligible).''
</P>
<P>
   Chapman's version, however, read: ``So we only light 'em at
first if they come in with a tank. Not if they come with men.''
</P>
<P>
   Caddell said the tapes show the Davidians trying to defend
themselves against what they viewed as an attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think the Davidians probably started the fire in the
chapel, but ... these are not the tapes of people starting a
fire,'' Caddell said. ``These are tapes of people who feel they are
being attacked. And as misguided as they are, what you are
listening to are people pouring fuel in Molotov cocktails or
torches or whatever, and if you hear them, you hear them say, `Aim
it. Don't throw it unless a tank comes in. Don't throw it if it is
men, if men come in.'''
</P>
<P>
   Bradford disagreed with Caddell's explanation of what's heard on
the tapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what the motivations or reasons were for why the
Branch Davidians set themselves on fire and burned down the
compound,'' Bradford said. ``It may have been for religious
motivations. It may have been suicide. But there is certainly
nothing on those tapes that indicates they were lighting fires to
fend off tanks.''
</P>
<P>
   The tapes _ recorded from bugs inserted into objects such as the
cartons of milk given the group _ also show Koresh laughing at the
death of an agent with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms,
and the Davidians' fidelity to Koresh.
</P>
<P>
   Bradford played a copy of a March 15, 1993, tape that captured
Koresh saying, ``A guy came around the corner goin' (pause) then, I
looked around the corner and saw the guy over there, you know, and,
uh, in the corner all slumped. He was in the corner
(unintelligible) (laughs) head blew up.''
</P>
<P>
   An April 17, 1993, tape records the beliefs of Steve Schneider,
one of Koresh's confidants, regarding Koresh:
</P>
<P>
   ``I guarantee if you go out and he tells you not to, you are
lost. No matter what you, no matter what your will is.'' ... ``Now
I believe this man is a god. This man is the lamb.'' ... ``She
don't choose to go out unless David tells her to. She don't, he
don't, I don't, Floyd don't. There's not one person here that ever
go out unless they've been told to.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the tapes were played, three FBI agents testified Monday
that they saw fires start in three different locations: the dining
room at the back of Mount Carmel, a second-floor room on the south
side; and near the entrance.
</P>
<P>
   However, no account of the fires being spotted can be found on
FBI logs _ which were not kept by the agents.
</P>
<P>
   Agent John Morrison, who was in a house across from Mount
Carmel, said he saw a man inside the entrance make a motion similar
to someone pouring fuel shortly before noon on April 19.
</P>
<P>
   ``As he came nearer to me, he did a sidestepping motion with a
sweeping motion,'' said Morrison, who said he watched the man with
the aid of scopes.
</P>
<P>
   Morrison said the man left, but returned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't see his hands,'' Morrison said. ``He was doing a
motion I described as washing his hands. As he finished that, a
fire spring up where his hands had been.''
</P>
<P>
   Caddell, on cross-examination, showed Morrison a series of
photographs showing the front of Mount Carmel during the fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see any fire at the front door,'' Morrison
acknowledged repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
   It was only when Mount Carmel was almost fully involved that a
fire could be seen at the entrance.

<TEXT>
<P>
   In the realm of atoms and smaller particles, objects exist not
so much as objects as mists of possibilities of being here or there
and everywhere at the same time _ and then someone looks and the
possibilities suddenly collapse to definite locations.
</P>
<P>
   That is contrary to everyday experience where objects _ buses,
tacks, friends _ exist at one place at one time. Either they are
here, or they are not, and that does not depend on whether we look
for them.
</P>
<P>
   How the fuzziness of the atomic world, described by equations of
quantum mechanics, solidifies into the larger, everyday world is a
conundrum physicists have been largely able to ignore.
</P>
<P>
   New experiments at United States and European laboratories have
now pushed the eerie phenomena of quantum mechanics much closer to
the everyday world with an experiment that is a simplified version
of the concept of Schroedinger's cat.
</P>
<P>
   In 1935, Erwin Schroedinger, the physicist who devised the
central equation of quantum mechanics, described a thought
experiment encapsulating the uneasy coexistence of the atomic and
the everyday worlds.
</P>
<P>
   A cat is placed in a sealed box. Also in the box is a device
that contains a small amount of a radioactive element. There is a
50 percent chance that one of the unstable atoms will decay within
an hour. If an atom decays, the device breaks open a
poison-containing flask, killing the cat. If there is no decay, the
cat lives.
</P>
<P>
   Applying the rules of quantum mechanics to everyday objects
produces perplexing implications.
</P>
<P>
   It is not that the cat is definitely alive or dead and that one
does not know which is true without looking. Instead, all
possibilities exist. The cat, says quantum mechanics, oscillates
between life and death and only when the box is opened is its fate
decided.
</P>
<P>
   In the thought experiment, the imaginary cat remains unharmed.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of a cat, a team led by Dr. James E. Lukens and Dr.
Jonathan R. Friedman, physicists at the State University of New
York at Stony Brook, used a small square loop of superconducting
wire. The experiment combines two possibilities, known as a quantum
superposition, for the direction of the flow of electric current:
clockwise around the loop or counterclockwise.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers measured an energy difference between the two
states of the loop, a sign the current was a quantum superposition
and not simply flipping directions.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the cat is neither alive nor dead but a ghostly mix of
the two possibilities, the current flows neither clockwise nor
counterclockwise, but is a mix of the two possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier demonstrations of quantum superposition showed an
electron or an atom in more than one location at a time. The SUNY
experiment shows that the flow of billions of electrons can also be
coaxed into a quantum mechanical blur.
</P>
<P>
   ``We observe our car to be in one parking space and not the
other, and for people to be on one side of the wall or the other,''
Friedman said. ``But this says, at least on the scale of a
hair-width size superconducting loop, we can have two of these
macroscopically well-defined states at the same time. Which is
something of an affront to our classical intuitions about the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   The SUNY work, reported in the current issue of the journal
Nature, is ``the first one in which there has been reasonably
foolproof evidence you do have a superposition of macroscopic
quantum states,'' said Dr. Anthony J. Leggett, a professor of
physics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, who
first proposed the experiment in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   According to the rules of quantum mechanics, the strength of the
magnetic field passing through the loop does not rise and fall
smoothly, but jumps between certain discrete values. When the loop
is placed in an external magnetic field, the loop spontaneously
sets up an electrical current to generate an additional magnetic
field, adjusting the field strength to one of the allowed values.
</P>
<P>
   In the SUNY experiment, the loop was placed in a magnetic field
equal to half of the first allowed value. Thus, the loop could set
up either a current to raise the field strength to the first
allowed value or, with equal probability, a current of equal
magnitude flowing in the opposite direction to cancel out the
external field.
</P>
<P>
   The clockwise and counterclockwise currents differ in value by
several microamps. A measurement always gives one of the two
possible answers, clockwise or counterclockwise, never a zero
cancellation.
</P>
<P>
   Physicists at the Delft University of Technology in the
Netherlands have performed a similar experiment with similar
results. An article describing their findings has been submitted to
the journal Science.
</P>
<P>
   Most physicists believe that the reason macroscopic objects do
not appear as a quantum mechanical smudge of possibilities is a
mechanism known as decoherence, whereby the continuous jostling
against the surrounding environment nudges objects out of the blur
of possibilities into one particular reality.
</P>
<P>
   The SUNY and Delft experiments take the opposite tack: by
removing all outside interference, an object can be coaxed into a
quantum blur.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question remains, how far can we push this?'' Friedman
said. ``Can we make things on the scale of cats?''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to checking quantum mechanics at a larger scale,
macroscopic quantum states could also be used in future quantum
computers.
</P>
<P>
   For Leggett, quantum mechanics at the macroscopic level is still
uncertain _ and troubling. ``It may bother me even more now,''
Leggett said. ``I'm interested in the possibility that quantum
mechanics, at some stage, may be wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   A few physicists have devised so-called macrorealistic theories
to resolve the ambiguities of quantum mechanics. ``What you get in
quantum mechanics is not what you see,'' said Dr. Philip Pearle, a
professor of physics at Hamilton College in Clinton, N.Y.
``Schroedinger felt this acutely. He himself felt something with
quantum mechanics was wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Pearle and colleagues in Italy propose to add a term to
Schroedinger's equation that, in effect, constantly jiggles the
fabric of the universe. Atomic-scale objects only jiggle a little
and thus remain a blur, which preserves the predictions of quantum
mechanics. Larger objects, like people or the Moon, jiggle more and
quickly fall into a definite here and there, which corresponds to
everyday experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``The deeper question is, is nature really doing this?'' Pearle
said. ``The second is, how is nature doing this?'' He admits he has
no direct evidence for the jiggling and no idea what would cause
the jiggling.
</P>
<P>
   An experiment measuring how one observation affects a later one
should distinguish whether quantum mechanics or a macrorealistic
theory rules the everyday world.
</P>
<P>
   The difference between the two can be seen by thinking of a
child swinging back and forth in the dark. The two quantum states _
clockwise versus counterclockwise current or the alive versus dead
cat _ correspond to the child's being on the left- or right-hand
side of the swing's arc.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine shining a flashlight on the right-hand side of the swing
and seeing nothing. In a macrorealistic theory, the child continues
to swing back and forth, undisturbed.
</P>
<P>
   In quantum mechanics, however, the mere act of looking, whether
the child is seen or not, disturbs the possibilities because, as
Leggett explains, the superposition has been destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, in a quantum mechanical world, not seeing the child
on the right-hand side resets the child's swing to the top of left
side of the arc, altering the probabilities of where the child will
be seen later.
</P>
<P>
   That, most physicists believe, is what the experiments will
eventually show.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think most physicists, including myself, would be extremely
surprised if quantum mechanics did fail for large objects,'' Lukens
said. But, he added, ``Every so often we are surprised.''

IT'S SHOW   TIME AT THE GOP CORRAL, AS TRADITIONS YIELD TO RATING 
</HEADLINE>
   By PETER MARKS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The delegation from the great state of Florida may want to brag
from the convention floor about its championship college football
team, while the great state of Wisconsin may seek to tout its
mouthwatering cheeses. But those gushy expressions of state pride
may not command the same level of attention this year as they have
at previous party conventions.
</P>
<P>
   Saying that the traditional roll call of states had become too
long and dull to sustain an evening of prime time television,
officials planning the Republican National Convention said Monday
that they intended to dim the spotlight on the state-by-state
presidential nominating process by spreading the tally over three
nights.
</P>
<P>
   ``One giant chunk of time devoted to counting votes may be
gripping if you are a floor clerk in the House or Senate,'' said
Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for the presumptive Republican nominee,
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. ``But for 249 million other
Americans, it's not as captivating.'' Convention officials have
told the networks the votes will occur earlier in each evening's
program.
</P>
<P>
   The establishment of the ``rolling roll call'' subject to the
approval of the party's rules committee, is one of a number of
innovations the Republicans say they have developed to make their
convention in Philadelphia more palatable and engaging to viewers.
It is a gathering, vowed Andrew Card, the convention's general
co-chairman, ``that is going to look, sound and feel different from
the conventions of the past.''
</P>
<P>
   It is also a gathering, say some professional convention
watchers, that will further advance the evolution of the event into
a marketing vehicle. Steve Scully, political editor of C-Span,
which will provide pool television coverage of the proceedings,
said that traditionally the conventions were platforms for
governors and senators to speak on the issues that concerned them.
The plan for prime time outlined by Card entails speeches by just
two elected officials: Bush and Sen. John McCain of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``The era of political conventions being just for politicians is
changing, and may be over,'' Scully said. ``Now you have
conventions that are timed to the minute, to the second for the
hometown audience. It's a production, not a convention.''
</P>
<P>
   Others who were given prime time slots include Bush's wife,
Laura; Gen. Colin Powell, former head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff;
Bush's adviser on security and foreign policy issues, Condoleezza
Rice, and former transportation secretary Elizabeth Dole. Card said
while it was not certain anyone would be designated the keynote
speaker, more people might be added to the speakers' list. The vice
presidential nominee will speak on the convention's third night.
</P>
<P>
   Card, speaking with reporters by conference call Monday, said
the departures from tradition will be apparent in everything from
the benevolent tone of the proceedings _ attacks on the opposition
will be kept to a minimum, he asserted _ to the design of the
podium. The podium traditionally ``looked like the turret of a
castle,'' Card said, adding that this year, it ``will look more
like a stage,'' giving the Republicans more flexibility to use it
for performances by entertainers and ``short presentations from
people across America.''
</P>
<P>
   The slogan for the convention, which begins July 31, is
``Renewing America's Purpose. Together.'' Card said there would be
a specific theme on each of the four evenings: education and health
care on Monday; military strength on Tuesday and prosperity and
protecting Social Security on Wednesday. Thursday will be devoted
to Bush's acceptance speech.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, for instance, will speak on the evening devoted to the
military, Card said.
</P>
<P>
   Republican officials said they were mindful of the need to make
the event as attractive as possible to the networks, and one
network news official, who spoke on condition on anonymity, called
the rolling roll call a ``very smart'' idea, in that the broadcast
networks had no interest in airing the vote in prime time.
</P>
<P>
   While cable channels like CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC plan
gavel-to-gavel coverage, the much more heavily watched broadcast
networks are scaling back. Elizabeth O'Connell, executive producer
of special events for NBC News and MSNBC, said that how much
exposure NBC News would provide on its flagship broadcast network
would not be decided until convention officials unveiled a more
detailed final schedule.

 &HT;    Sampras is the greatest player ever
 &HT;    By Mark Woods
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nobody complained that Joe Montana was too composed.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody griped that Joe DiMaggio was too calm.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody whined that Jack Nicklaus was too polite.
</P>
<P>
   Yet these, I hear, are the problems with Pete Sampras. Even
today. Even after Sampras won Wimbledon for the seventh time,
surpassing Roy Emerson with a 13th Grand Slam title and earning the
right to proclaim himself the greatest men's tennis player ever _ a
right he, of course, will never exercise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll never sit here and tell you that I'm the best ever,''
Sampras once said.
</P>
<P>
   It is a pledge he has upheld.
</P>
<P>
   Even after his victory against Patrick Rafter, Sampras left the
debate to others. The one gaping hole in his resume, the lack of a
French Open title, does give detractors a little ammunition. And it
is true that Rod Laver certainly would have added to his 11 Grand
Slams if he hadn't been forced to skip majors after turning pro for
the final five years of his career.
</P>
<P>
   But to go as far as some have _ ``Is Sampras' legacy tainted?''
said a headline on one Internet site _ is absurd.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras, still only 28, has racked up his titles in an era of
parity; an era when the never-heard-of-him, No. 232-ranked player
is capable of upsetting the top-10 player; an era when it is hard
to maintain the health and intensity necessary to even stay in the
game, let alone atop it.
</P>
<P>
   He is the greatest ever.
</P>
<P>
   And although there is a temptation today to compare him to Tiger
Woods, that would be unfair _ to Sampras.
</P>
<P>
   What Woods is doing in golf _ taking modern technology and
producing a revolutionary blend of power and touch _ Sampras has
been doing for a lot longer in tennis. Since 1993, he has a 53-1
record at his game's grandest of Grand Slams. And that statistic
doesn't do his play at Wimbledon justice.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, he has been too good.
</P>
<P>
   Technology has been kinder to Woods. On the golf course, it
produces ``oohs'' and ``aahs.'' On a tennis court, it produces
yawns.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us back to the criticism.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras is boring.
</P>
<P>
   In other sports, it is enough to be the best. In tennis, we
demand more. We demand behavior, even if it's bad ... just not too
bad, mind you.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras has learned about this fine line during his annual
visits to London, a place where the tabloids aren't shy about
voicing their opinions. Before his first Wimbledon final, a meeting
with fellow American Jim Courier, one headline screamed: ``BORED ON
THE FOURTH OF JULY.''
</P>
<P>
   ``First, I was the boring guy,'' Sampras said last week. ``Then
I was the biggest, most hated man in England. I wasn't sure how you
guys wanted me to act _ boring or like a lunatic.''
</P>
<P>
   Call me a lunatic, but I kind of like boring.
</P>
<P>
   In this age of players celebrating after a tackle at the line of
scrimmage, I welcome someone who only pumps his fists after a truly
big shot.
</P>
<P>
   In this age of Dick Vermeil crying after a mid-season victory, I
appreciate someone who saved his tears for big moments like while
struggling through a five-set match in Australia after your dying
coach collapses. Or when your parents finally agree to come watch
you play in Wimbledon _ and you survive a nerve-racking,
rain-filled day and emerge with Slam No. 13.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest ever?
</P>
<P>
   In this age of everyone proclaiming themselves No. 1, I like the
fact that Sampras has resisted. Even now. Especially now.

FASHION, THE FLASH AND THE FLASHBACKS 
</HEADLINE>
   By CATHY HORYN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ ``Fashion is about never achieving anything,'' Karl
Lagerfeld said a month ago in an interview. ``You make one good
collection, it doesn't mean there will be another.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet this sense of futility, combined with the prospect of
renewal, is also what drives designers like Lagerfeld, maybe all
creative people, and he likened it to the lash that keeps newspaper
writers toiling in pulp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your work,'' he told me, ``is ready for the vegetable
drippings, and ours is for the markdowns. We know this, and that's
why we start again.''
</P>
<P>
   Knowing this makes it easier to view the frank display of
fetishism that John Galliano put on the runway for Christian Dior
on Saturday _ the start of the fall 2000 haute couture collections
_ without taking any of it too seriously. So Galliano likes the
idea of seeing women trussed up in bondage gear against a
background noise of whips and sighs? Last season it was the
down-and-out look of tramps that lit his lamp, and made front-page
news.
</P>
<P>
   But can any of this really matter if the action is constantly,
and blithely, shifting?
</P>
<P>
   Now a bum, now a voyeur peeping through a keyhole at what was,
and may still be, taboo. ``Very edgy,'' said the actress Kate
Capshaw of the show, as she made her way through a throng of
photographers and autograph seekers with her husband, Steven
Spielberg. ``Very Kubrickian,'' Spielberg said.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, it was. The show, bathed in carnal red lights,
conjured up a vision of disorder and sexual obsession that brought
to mind the violence and perversity in Kubrick's ``Eyes Wide
Shut''and ``A Clockwork Orange.''
</P>
<P>
   Here, on the runway, were suave-looking young men in smooth
Mayfair lounge haircuts and the crisply tailored regalia of empire,
circa 1912 _ officers' field coats, tails and top hats, a kilt
exquisitely worked in sequins. They strolled out among women in
reedy, quivering ivory frocks and mushrooming Edwardian hairdos.
Then the tempo changed: Galliano, who had said before the show that
he thought Christian Dior was one of the first fetishists in
fashion, because he had put women in corsets and was himself ``in
complete awe of his mother,'' parted the curtain, opened the
kimono, to reveal the mischief (naughty nurse, fleshy maid with a
hickey on her neck) of a nice, respectable Edwardian family.
</P>
<P>
   Ten or 15 years ago, before the dawn of tabloid television, one
could have been shocked by the sight of a woman with her mouth
taped shut or another with her arms held down by handcuffs chained
to her belt. And, of course, one can think of the designers who
have been this way before _ namely, Gianni Versace, Jean Paul
Gaultier and Vivienne Westwood.
</P>
<P>
   When news of the Dior show trickled back to him, Lagerfeld said
he could never bring himself to seriously design clothes with whips
and zips because he'd be laughing too hard. That's sort of the way
one felt. Many of the clothes were undeniably spectacular _ a coat
made of tiny stripes of feathers, a gown cut from a length of
alligator skin, a dress of cadet-blue silk with gold military
buttons and lacing up the back. It's also true that the Dior
workrooms were flooded with orders from the spring hobo collection,
especially from young clients, though most designs were toned down.
And so will the latest examples be.
</P>
<P>
   As I sat at lunch Monday at L'Avenue, the swanky bistro, a Dior
staff assistant happened by with a portfolio of sketches of this
collection made palatable for clients. So there's no reason to get
in a twist over Saturday's outrage. It's already history.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander McQueen has had enough uneven seasons at Givenchy to
generate rumors that this would be his last. But after his show on
Sunday, as guests poured backstage, Yves Carcelle, the president of
LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the owner, was dismissive of the
gossip. ``It's just another rumor in the perverted fashion world,''
he said. McQueen's show _ a kind of party within a party _ was
brilliant.
</P>
<P>
   The set, concealed by four walls that dropped down when the show
began, resembled the sort of funky loft one might see in the East
Village. Cool couples danced around. A D.J. flipped electronic
switches next to a refrigerator. Then came the models, wending
among the party people, in couture's version of modern club
clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Here was the model Alek Wek in patchwork leather hip-huggers
with some sort of flippy-hippy jacket over her zebra top and a
cocoon of fur around her head. Nothing really went together, yet
everything did. A strait-laced jumpsuit, a go-go girl get-up in
pastel leather, a Super Fly cap ballooning like a beanbag chair _
but of course. It's hard to make couture seem valid in a world
where sometimes the choicest thing is a cut-off T-shirt and a
pierced navel. But it's also hard to bring a sense of real
individuality to clothes without the imaginative ballast of
couture. McQueen is a genuine guide.
</P>
<P>
   On her way into Versace on Saturday night, Jennifer Lopez,
dressed in a low-cut Versace number and accompanied by her
boyfriend, Sean Combs, and the usual posse of bodyguards, said in a
plaintive voice to Donatella Versace, ``But I want to know what I'm
going to wear to the Oscars!''
</P>
<P>
   Evidently she can't wait to find out. Nor can Spielberg and
Capshaw, who were front and center. Nor can Gwyneth Paltrow, who
seems to have evolved into a karaoke couture client _ wearing this
dress from Calvin, touting that bag for Dior and surfacing, not for
the first time, in Versace.
</P>
<P>
   But this is fashion _ it's anybody's game, and Versace knows how
to play it with confidence. Her clothes this season emphasize
softness, with hints of volume in sleeves, and cool colors like
lavender, melon and chartreuse. Sun-ray pleats burst with tiny
stones. A floor-length sable coat draped over a filmy top and a
tight pair of pants _ Versace called it the new cocktail suit. The
clothes were the kind you could imagine on anyone with a body, a
taste for flashbulb glamour and the means to indulge it.
</P>
<P>
   Gaultier's approach, on the other hand, is decidedly more
French, and more in the deep grain of tradition. His show on Sunday
lacked the mesmerizing vivacity of last season, when his orders
doubled. But it was solid, with hints of the 1920s, in
loose-fitting dresses with beaded fringe and feathered wigs swathed
in netting. Gaultier's homage to the Eiffel Tower _ upturned as
heels, sparkling in beads _ could have been a hard right to the
souvenir stands of the Rue de Rivoli without his clever eye.
</P>
<P>
   So the new guard keeps advancing while the older denizens of
couture do their best to keep up. Valentino's show, on Sunday
night, was exquisitely heavy going, chic to a fault _ the right
shoe, the right display of beads, but all without feeling. Emanuel
Ungaro's show Monday, in a tunnel near the Seine, was all
lightness. Beautiful, weightless jackets floated over slender
trousers and tops as simple as T-shirts. Feathers of distressed
chiffon glazed a coral coat, and siren gowns in ivory and lavender
were a modern update of the ravish-me style.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there was that sense of family as new and old clients
swanned in blowing air kisses. As Nan Kempner, arriving at the
Ungaro show in a Saint Laurent python coat, said, ``I think my
epitaph should read, `I've kissed a heck of a lot of people I don't
know.'''

 &HT;    Bank seeks Mickey Mouse drawings for debt
 &HT;    By Gary Schwan
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOCA RATON _ Mickey Mouse could be in police custody Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   SunTrust Bank has filed a petition to seize 36 drawings of the
famed rodent valued at $3.7 million from the International Museum
of Cartoon Art as penalty for missing mortgage payments. A hearing
will be held today in Palm Beach County Circuit Court.
</P>
<P>
   The drawings were created for the 1928 cartoon Plane Crazy, the
first animated film featuring Mickey Mouse. The museum used the
drawings as collateral for a $3 million loan in 1995 to build its
showplace in Mizner Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are our `Mona Lisa,''' said museum founder and chairman
Mort Walker, creator of the Beetle Bailey comic strip. ``They are
very delicate and we have taken very good care of them. Now it
looks like the sheriff will be coming in Wednesday to take them off
the wall and march them away.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These are popular art icons, and to just remove them without
concern about protecting them is worrisome,'' said Walker's wife,
Catherine. She said the drawings are protected by security and
sophisticated temperature controls at the museum. ``We even cover
them with a black cloth at night.''
</P>
<P>
   The Walkers want the bank to leave the drawings at the museum
until refinancing can be arranged. ``We would even be willing to
put up a sign'' declaring the works the bank's property, said
Catherine Walker. ``Our concern is the care of the drawings.''
</P>
<P>
   SunTrust attorney Lisa Hermann declined comment Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The museum owes roughly $1.1 million to SunTrust, but has missed
$20,000 in quarterly interest payments since October, largely
because of a proposed partnership with Florida Atlantic University,
according to Mort Walker. The deal fell through last month after
criticism from city officials. Under the agreement, the FAU
Foundation would have picked up the museum's debt in return for
using part of its building for classrooms and other projects, he
said. Foundation officials couldn't be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had been negotiating with FAU for six months, and there was
an agreement that they would pay all our bills'' if the deal was
approved by the city, said Walker. ``We asked for an extension in
October, and by January we were talking with FAU'' and thought the
bills would soon be paid.
</P>
<P>
   Walker said the museum is refinancing its mortgage with another

</P>
<P>
   The Mickey Mouse drawings were given to the museum in 1993 by
former board member Stephen A. Geppi, owner of a comic book
distributorship in Timonium, Md. They appear on six ``storyboards''
holding six drawings each. Plane Crazy was the first Mickey Mouse
film, and the third actually released to theaters.
</P>
<P>
   Walker said the museum had permission from Geppi to sell the
works if necessary. He said the American Museum Association advised
that the drawings could also be put up for collateral as long as
they weren't part of the museum's collection. The association's
guidelines frown on selling or collateralizing valuable art. ``They
aren't an official part of our collection,'' Walker said.
</P>
<P>
   Walker founded the museum in Connecticut in 1972. It moved to
Boca Raton in 1990 from Rye Brook, N.Y., and opened a $15 million,
52,000-square-foot building in Mizner Park in 1996. The first floor
exhibits portions of a 150,000-piece collection of vintage
cartoons, comic strips, films and animation art.
</P>
<P>
   Fund-raising problems have left the building's second and third
floors empty. The museum has a roughly $700,000 annual budget and
attracted some 70,000 visitors last year.

STRONG NEWSPAPER AD SALES BOOST EARNINGS FOR TIMES CO. AND
GANNETT 
</HEADLINE>
   By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The flood of advertising that has carried newspaper
company profits to record earnings during the last year continued
almost unabated in the second quarter for both The New York Times
Co., whose net income increased 18.6 percent, and the Gannett Co.,
whose profit increased by 13 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Times Co. posted net income of $101.7 million, or 59 cents a
share, compared with $85.8 million, or 48 cents a share, in the
quarter a year earlier. Including special items, net income in the
period a year earlier was $83.5 million, or 47 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue jumped 13.6 percent, to $885.6 million from $779.4
million. Excluding figures from The Worcester Telegram &AMP; Gazette in
Massachusetts, which the company acquired in January, revenue rose
10.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The results beat analysts' estimates by 3 cents a share,
according to First Call/Thomson Financial, which tracks company
earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Gannett reported net income of $265.8 million, or $1 a share,
compared with profit from operations of $234.8 million, or 84 cents
a share, in the period a year earlier. Revenue rose 16 percent, to
$1.49 billion from $1.28 billion. In the quarter a year earlier, a
gain of $33 million, or 11 cents a share, related to an exchange of
television stations in Texas and California, and profit of $9.4
million, or 3 cents a share, from discontinued cable operations
made net income $277 million, or 98 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   Gannett's results matched Wall Street expectations, according to
First Call.
</P>
<P>
   For the Times Co., excluding results at The Telegram &AMP; Gazette,
advertising revenue increased 14.3 percent, to $564 million, fueled
by a 16.5 percent increase in advertising revenue at The New York
Times and 14.8 percent at The Boston Globe. Including The Telegram
&AMP; Gazette, advertising revenue was $580 million, up 17.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   At New York Times Digital, the company's Internet division,
revenue grew to $13.5 million from $5 million, while operating
losses rose to $15.5 million from $4.6 million. The company
attributed the increased losses to higher staff and promotion costs
associated with Abuzz Technologies Inc., which the company acquired
last year.
</P>
<P>
   The Times Co. has registered with the Securities and Exchange
Commission to issue a stock tracking the results of New York Times
Digital and has won shareholder approval, but it has not set a date
for the offering.
</P>
<P>
   William Drewry, an analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette, said
the Times Co. results exceeded expectations ``by a very, very
comfortable margin.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's been the trend and will probably continue to be the
trend,'' he added, saying that he expected increases in the price
of newsprint _ a newspaper's biggest cost outside of labor _ to be
manageable.
</P>
<P>
   Gannett's results were announced amid a large-scale expansion at
the company, which has during the last year bought two newspaper
companies in Britain, 21 daily newspapers from Thomson Newspapers
Inc. and, most recently, Central Newspapers Inc., the publisher of
The Arizona Republic and The Indianapolis Star.
</P>
<P>
   For the second quarter, Gannett's newspaper advertising revenue
increased 21.4 percent, to $957 million.
</P>
<P>
   But Michael Beebe, an analyst with Goldman, Sachs, said that
some analysts had been concerned by a one-month ``softness'' in
advertising in June at the company's flagship newspaper, USA Today.
``What they attributed it to was softness in travel and retail
categories in particular due to tough comparisons _ due to some
advertisers taking a mid-year pause,'' Beebe said. ``That's what
spooks investors. We don't now how long this pause may last.''
</P>
<P>
   Drewry said: ``Gannett's numbers were good. The market was
disappointed that they didn't show an upside surprise. The stock's
being punished for that. But they have a lot of upside potential
for the next few quarters, given their acquisitions.''
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Gannett fell $1.875 Monday, to $57.0625, while shares
of the Times Co. rose 93.75 cents, to $40.9375.

 &HT;    Bank seeks Mickey Mouse drawings for debt
 &HT;    By Gary Schwan
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOCA RATON _ Mickey Mouse could be in police custody Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   SunTrust Bank has filed a petition to seize 36 drawings of the
famed rodent valued at $3.7 million from the International Museum
of Cartoon Art as penalty for missing mortgage payments. A hearing
will be held today in Palm Beach County Circuit Court.
</P>
<P>
   The drawings were created for the 1928 cartoon Plane Crazy, the
first animated film featuring Mickey Mouse. The museum used the
drawings as collateral for a $3 million loan in 1995 to build its
showplace in Mizner Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are our `Mona Lisa,''' said museum founder and chairman
Mort Walker, creator of the Beetle Bailey comic strip. ``They are
very delicate and we have taken very good care of them. Now it
looks like the sheriff will be coming in Wednesday to take them off
the wall and march them away.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These are popular art icons, and to just remove them without
concern about protecting them is worrisome,'' said Walker's wife,
Catherine. She said the drawings are protected by security and
sophisticated temperature controls at the museum. ``We even cover
them with a black cloth at night.''
</P>
<P>
   The Walkers want the bank to leave the drawings at the museum
until refinancing can be arranged. ``We would even be willing to
put up a sign'' declaring the works the bank's property, said
Catherine Walker. ``Our concern is the care of the drawings.''
</P>
<P>
   SunTrust attorney Lisa Hermann declined comment Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The museum owes roughly $1.1 million to SunTrust, but has missed
$20,000 in quarterly interest payments since October, largely
because of a proposed partnership with Florida Atlantic University,
according to Mort Walker. The deal fell through last month after
criticism from city officials. Under the agreement, the FAU
Foundation would have picked up the museum's debt in return for
using part of its building for classrooms and other projects, he
said. Foundation officials couldn't be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had been negotiating with FAU for six months, and there was
an agreement that they would pay all our bills'' if the deal was
approved by the city, said Walker. ``We asked for an extension in
October, and by January we were talking with FAU'' and thought the
bills would soon be paid.
</P>
<P>
   Walker said the museum is refinancing its mortgage with another
institution, and has begun talking again to other schools and arts
groups about sharing the Mizner Park building and bills. The groups
include the Boca Raton Museum of Art, which has formed a committee
to see if ``there might be a fit between the two museums,'' said
Joseph Borrow, president of the art museum's board of trustees. The
museum will open its new building in Mizner Park in January.
</P>
<P>
   The Mickey Mouse drawings were given to the museum in 1993 by

</P>
<P>
   Walker said the museum had permission from Geppi to sell the
works if necessary. He said the American Museum Association advised
that the drawings could also be put up for collateral as long as
they weren't part of the museum's collection. The association's
guidelines frown on selling or collateralizing valuable art. ``They
aren't an official part of our collection,'' Walker said.

CHEERS! IRELAND FREEZES THE COST OF DRINKS TO RESTRAIN INFLATION 
</HEADLINE>
   By BRIAN LAVERY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN, Ireland _ Ireland's booming economy has made it harder
for some Dubliners to find time to grab a pint at the pub these
days, what with so many people working late at the office, but they
are still angry over the soaring price of Guinness.
</P>
<P>
   Evidently, so thought the Irish government when it took steps
last week to slow the country's racing inflation rates: It began by
temporarily capping the prices of all alcoholic beverages and some
soft drinks.
</P>
<P>
   An order from the minister for consumer affairs, Tom Kitt,
limits prices to May 15 levels for six months, and covers all
drinks sold in pubs and restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time the government has interceded to
control the cost of a drink in a country where hoisting a few is,
for many, a celebrated part of life. The government capped alcohol
prices temporarily in 1997 and 1983. Neither of those efforts did
much to suppress prices, and the latest effort may not work either.
But as Ireland wrestles with the highest inflation in the 15-nation
European Union, the government wants to show that it is at least
trying to do something.
</P>
<P>
   Economists called the price cap politically motivated,
insufficient and a poor substitute for what many have described as
a basic lack of competition in the Irish pub business. The
government regulates the number of pub licenses in Ireland, and
critics have said that one way to keep drink prices down would be
to allow more places to sell them. Legislation to do that is likely
to be debated later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Pub owners themselves reacted as though the price controls were
a bit of a joke, designed to strengthen the government's low
public-approval rating. They also noted that the greatest increase
in pub prices this year came before May, so the government decree
missed the opportunity to make a difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the government copped out,'' said Brian Smyth, 30, who
works in central Dublin at J.J. Smyth's pub, owned by his father.
``If the price was over the top, it's still over the top.''
</P>
<P>
   The price of a pint, at 2.50 Irish pounds, or about $3, has
risen about 5 percent this year, roughly comparable to the
inflation rate. Smyth estimated that the price of a pint, left
unrestricted, could have increased by another 2 percent by the end
of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Other pub owners reacted more indignantly. Dick Dunne, a
third-generation pub owner and chief executive of the Vintner's
Federation of Ireland, a trade group that represents more than
6,000 pub owners, called the price cap ``a crude and discriminatory
measure.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It removes a publican's control over his or her own
business,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With almost 10,000 pubs around the country, the Department of
Consumer Affairs will have a tough time enforcing the regulation,
even though Kitt doubled the number of inspectors _ to 24.
</P>
<P>
   More broadly, however, there is widespread agreement that drink
inflation is a relatively minor cause of Ireland's spiral of rising
prices, which at 5.2 percent is triple the average of other
European Union members. Michael Crowley, an economist at Davy
Stockbrokers, estimated that the price cap would hold down the
overall inflation rate by two-tenths of a percent at the most this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line here is that you can't do a lot to hold down
inflation rates,'' he said. ``It wouldn't surprise me at all if we
had an inflation rate near 6 percent in late July or early
August.''
</P>
<P>
   For customers, though, a price freeze on a drink is reason
enough to buy one. Patrick Murray, 40, a customer at J.J.'s in
Dublin, said the measure would help maintain pub life as a social
fixture in Ireland. ``For where the working people go, it keeps
prices down to what they can afford,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   In some ways, Army Private Al Gore was never and could never
have been just one of the guys, another grunt.
</P>
<P>
   Recruiters were afraid to even sign him up without calling in a
supervisor, once they heard his name and caught on that he was the
son of that antiwar Sen. Albert Gore, and just out of Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those with lesser rank bumped him up to me because they were
scared of making a mistake,'' said Dess Stokes, the staff sergeant
on duty at the Newark Armed Forces Entrance and Examination Station
in New Jersey, where Gore went to enlist, hoping to avoid notice,
in August 1969. ``We all knew who he was because of his daddy
opposing the war.''
</P>
<P>
   No less than the Army's highest-ranking officer, Gen. William
Westmoreland, singled him out during a visit to Fort Rucker, Ala.,
where Gore was stationed for more than a year. The Army chief of
staff stopped in the middle of a farewell ceremony to pull the
young man aside for a private chat _ and kept Gore's superior
officers waiting, and watching, while he asked one of the
lowest-ranking men on the base for his thoughts on why so many
young people opposed the war.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is no evidence that Gore sought special treatment, or
that the extra notice he got anyway provided any real protection.
On the contrary, within the parameters of his job as an Army
journalist, Gore probably assumed more risk than he had to,
helicoptering around South Vietnam interviewing soldiers who had
just seen action.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who knew Al Gore in Vietnam knows he could have sat on
his butt and he didn't,'' said Michael Roche, Gore's editor on The
Castle Courier, the newspaper of the Army's Engineering Command in
Long Binh, near Saigon. ``I had 30 or 40 stringers and 3 or 4 on
staff, and I didn't have one who traveled as much as he did.''
</P>
<P>
   And if Gore has a dirty secret from Vietnam, it is not that he
spent his tour hiding in headquarters, but that he found much of
the experience exhilarating, and loved feeling ``more alive,'' to
use his words, in the middle of the war that he and millions of
other Americans hated.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a vividness in a war zone, even if you're not in
combat,'' the vice president said recently, during one of several
interviews about his military experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're driving down a one-lane road with vegetation on both
sides, and it's an area where people say, `Keep on your toes.'
That's quite vivid. A lot of people when they came home felt
disoriented just because that vividness wasn't in their lives any
more. I know a lot of guys who felt a great urge to go back, and
the camaraderie was very intense and powerful.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore has occasionally added a splash of color to the tableau
when describing his military service. Years ago, he suggested to
reporters that he was shot at in Vietnam when he was not _ an
exaggeration that may have been less an attempt to mislead than an
attempt to make his experience more vivid.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about those statements, Gore said only this: ``I
wasn't shot at, but I was in areas where there was firing.'' He
mentioned a trip with Mike O'Hara, now a sportswriter for The
Detroit News, to Khe Sanh, near the DMZ, where Army engineers were
re-opening an abandoned airstrip.
</P>
<P>
   ``They sent in the infantry to secure it and there were
helicopter gunships firing,'' he added. ``My buddy kidded me for
digging a foxhole, but there was firing in the hills surrounding
there. It wasn't aimed at me, but I wasn't sure of that.'' O'Hara,
who was Gore's closest friend in Vietnam, has said that he
remembers the gunfire, too _ all outgoing.
</P>
<P>
   When he first ran for president, in 1988, Gore's campaign was
criticized for using photos of young Private Gore in his uniform,
carrying a standard-issue M-16. Was he trying to create the
impression that he saw combat?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an accurate picture,'' he said, irritated. ``That's what
I looked like when I was doing my job. The fact is, I carried a
pencil and a loaded M-16 A1 outside the base camp and I worked in
areas where I had to be armed.''
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore's military record is in no particular need of
improvement. He was one of only about a dozen of the 1,115 Harvard
graduates in the Class of `69 who went to Vietnam. And even before
enlisting, he passed up a chance to serve in the National Guard _
the military option chosen by his presidential opponent, George W.
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   A cousin of Gore said she and her then-husband had secured the
promise of a place for him in the Alabama Guard. ``I had friends
who had gone to Vietnam, and one who had come back a paraplegic,
and I was beside myself wanting to keep Al out of there,'' said the
cousin, Gayle Byrne, of Birmingham, who grew up near Carthage,
Tenn, where the Gores spent summers on their farm. So Byrne's
former husband, a member of the Guard, asked a well-placed contact
to hold a spot for Gore.

   ``When the word came back that yes, they would hold a slot, we
were so excited we called Al right away,'' Byrne remembered. ``But
he said, ``I appreciate what you've done, but I just don't believe
I can do this.' He talked about how small the draft roll was in
Carthage'' _ and how, if he did not serve, someone he knew would
have to take his place.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was complicated by his father's upcoming 1970
Senate race, which everyone anticipated as his toughest, in large
part because of Senator Gore's stand against the war. Though Albert
Gore did vote to authorize American involvement in early 1964, by
the end of that year he was pushing for a negotiated settlement
with the Communists.
</P>
<P>
   The war was not the only issue in the election contest, of
course, but so many of the others _ race, busing, even school
prayer _ to some extent became mixed with the war in the minds of
voters, who found the senator too tolerant of social protest of all
kinds and of change in general.
</P>
<P>
   Young Al worried that if he found a way around military service,
he would be handing an issue to his father's opponents. But once he
finally decided to enlist, he never looked back. ``I wanted to
serve honorably and well and get it over with,'' he said recently.
</P>
<P>
   But as others of his generation headed for Woodstock that month,
he was calling his old Harvard roommate, John Tyson, to ask him to
come along for moral support as he signed up for the Army.
</P>
<P>
   Though Gore says his assignment as an Army journalist came as a
complete surprise, Tyson recalls that ``the reason people enlisted
was to have a greater ability to pick'' their job _ an assessment
Army historians say is accurate. A family friend recalled that Gore
surveyed the options and hoped to serve as an Army journalist.
</P>
<P>
   Highly educated enlisted men generally did get their choice of
assignments, and with his Harvard degree, Army officials said, Gore
never ran any real risk of being assigned to the infantry.
</P>
<P>
   So after basic training at Fort Dix, N.J., he was sent to Fort
Rucker, the Army's aviation school in Alabama, where he wrote for
the base newspaper, The Army Flier, under Margaret Cobb, the
civilian who handed out assignments.
</P>
<P>
   ``She and Al were like Lou Grant and Mary Tyler Moore,'' cracked
Maurice Hendrick, who worked there with Gore and later became mayor
of Rutherford, N.C. ``She'd been there 1,000 years and was very
firm and no nonsense,'' while Gore worked hard and aimed to please.
</P>
<P>
   That May, Albert Arnold Gore Jr. and Mary Elizabeth Aitcheson
were married in Washington's National Cathedral, Al in his dress
blues, Tipper in a formal, high-necked gown. Then he brought his
new bride back to Alabama, where home was a 10-foot wide ``Expando
model'' trailer.
</P>
<P>
   There was a sweetness to this anxious time, though. The night
before a friend, Bob Delabar, shipped out for Vietnam, Gore spent
hours crawling around on a highway median looking for a four-leaf
clover _ a talisman Delabar says he carried to Vietnam and back,
until it finally disintegrated in his wallet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd had a few too many beers,'' the vice president says now.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was waiting to go to Vietnam, too. All his friends remember
that he wanted to go, and the usual course of a two-year hitch in
the Army included a year there.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore family could never prove their suspicions, denied by
various Nixon administration officials, that Gore's orders were
held up on purpose. At the time, his Army buddies said, they were
convinced that President Richard Nixon would not allow him sent to
Vietnam while there was even the slightest chance that it might do
Senator Gore some political good should something bad happen to his
son.
</P>
<P>
   But the fact that Gore was eventually sent to Vietnam with only
seven months left to serve in his hitch was highly unusual. In the
end, Gore shipped out the month after the election.
</P>
<P>
   The nastiest fighting Gore saw in 1970 was back in Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Gore's antiwar position was a loser there, and his son
took a couple of weekend passes and a week's leave to try to help
save his father's career.
</P>
<P>
   The son stood behind the father at rallies, sometimes in
uniform, to remind folks that the Gores opposed the war but were
still good Americans doing their duty. They also appeared together
in two commercials _ one in which he and his father were shown on
horseback and another in which the senator told him, ``Son, always
love your country.''
</P>
<P>
   But the senator, always an indifferent fund-raiser, was badly
outmatched this time. And the campaign run by his Republican
opponent, Bill Brock, who later expressed regrets, is still
considered a model of dirty politics: The Watergate investigation
would later discover that Nixon operatives poured illegal money
into the race. One donor was Richard Mellon Scaife, the same
conservative who later spent millions of dollars on anti-Clinton
investigations.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Brock's slogan, ``Bill Brock believes in the things we believe
in,'' was a bald appeal to disaffected supporters of George
Wallace, and his campaign made Senator Gore out to be a turncoat
son of the South.
</P>
<P>
   On election night, Albert Gore gave a concession speech
conceding nothing. ``The truth shall rise again!'' he told
supporters, in what has been interpreted as a reference to the
promise of his son's future. Those who knew the senator, though,
feel he was too lost in his own pain that night to have been
thinking any such thing.
</P>
<P>
   Right after Christmas, Al Gore finally did ship out for Vietnam,
and arrived at the 20th Engineer Brigade at Bien Hoa, outside
Saigon, on Jan. 2, 1971. The Army was in bad shape at that point,
demoralized by the scornful lack of support for a war the country
was no longer even trying to win.
</P>
<P>
   Troops had already been withdrawing for two years, and those
left on the ground were waiting to turn the war over to the South
Vietnamese. Morale was so low that a few American soldiers had shot
their own commanding officers rather than follow their orders to
fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody knew what a moronic war it was by that time, and it
was, `Do what you have to do to get home,''' said Roche, Gore's
editor in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   ``So getting in a chopper to go to fire support bases at that
point in time was pretty risky'' for Gore, Roche said, and made his
relatively gung-ho attitude all the more striking.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the one thing you could do'' that didn't seem like an
utter waste in those days, Roche added, was try to build up fellow
soldiers by reporting the individual acts of bravery that did
happen amid so much despair _ and, less dramatically, the good
works of the engineers, who were building roads, hospitals and
water purification systems all over the country. That is what Gore
did in the war.
</P>
<P>
   Bien Hoa was relatively safe, though sirens occasionally warned
of mortar attacks. From the hooch Gore shared with 9 other guys, he
could hear fighter planes taking off throughout the night.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Ancona, of New York City, who had known Gore at Fort
Rucker, said he knew even before Gore arrived that he was on the
``watch list.'' ``All that meant was that he was connected to
someone important. It was more like a protocol thing, but it didn't
mean anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore says he never felt restrained. Did he feel treated
differently by some of the other guys, by virtue of his name?
</P>
<P>
   ``No more so than at any other time in my life,'' he said, after
thinking for a minute. In fact, maybe less, he added; His father,
after all, was not a senator anymore.
</P>
<P>
   After five months in Vietnam, Gore applied for and received an
early out to attend Vanderbilt divinity school in Nashville. The
Army was granting such outs easily at that point.
</P>
<P>
   Though he had gone in hating everything about the Vietnam War,
he was coming out with a more complicated assessment of the
situation _ and an evolving view on the use of American military
force.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still think Vietnam was a big mistake, but it was the
feelings of the ordinary Vietnamese people in the South who were
terrified of losing their freedom that had an effect on me,'' he
said recently. ``Especially Catholics were terrified of a Communist
victory and that sure didn't fit into the cartoon image I had
before I went over.''
</P>
<P>
   Vietnam certainly did not make Gore an anti-interventionist,
even in the 1970s and '80s. Unlike others in his party, he
supported the invasion of Grenada in 1983 and was one of only 10
Senate Democrats who supported the Gulf War in 1991, infuriating
his party's leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Before he left Vietnam, he wrote a letter to Gus Stanisic, who
had worked with him on the ARmy paper at Fort Rucker in Alabama. In
the letter, Gore said that when he got back, he planned to
``atone'' for his sins by attending divinity school.
</P>
<P>
   What was he atoning for?
</P>
<P>
   Stanisic says he has no idea. ``In those days you just said,
``Oh, yeah, man, I dig.''' Gore says he does not remember using the
word atone, but very much recalls his deeply unsettled feelings
about the war. And about coming home.
</P>
<P>
   He had missed Tipper desperately, of course, and was glad to be
back, yet something nagged at him for months, even years, after his
return. On many nights, his wife would wake up and find that he was
out walking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure I fully understand it,'' Gore said quietly. ``But
you know, it didn't end. You were leaving something that was still
going on. If you're a part of something, a war, you want to win it.
Not that I had a bayonet in my teeth, but part of what was screwed
up about it was that we weren't trying to win.''

SPEAKING TO GOVERNORS, CLINTON SOUNDS CONCILIATORY NOTE 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARC LACEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ President Clinton toned down his partisan ``Al
Gore for President'' pronouncements Monday at the National
Governors' Association summer conference, knowing that more than
half the governors in the room had a different take on the upcoming
election.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, in what he described as a ``make-a-deal speech,''
Clinton argued before the bipartisan audience that the two parties
could still make progress on a variety of issues _ from Medicare
prescription drug coverage to an increase in the minimum wage _ if
they toned down all the pre-election sparring.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton still made the case, without explicitly naming
names, that large tax cuts like those proposed by Gov. George W.
Bush of Texas, would endanger the longest economic expansion in the
nation's history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've got to keep the economy going by hewing to the
same principles of fiscal discipline that got us where we are,''
Clinton told the governors in State College, Pa. ``And that means I
think whatever combination of spending and tax cuts any candidate
for any office proposes, there ought to be enough left over to get
us out of debt over the next dozen years.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those in the audience were Gov. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania,
a Republican who has been mentioned as a top vice presidential
prospect for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Ridge said he appreciated the president's
``very conciliatory tone,'' but disagreed vigorously with Clinton
on which economic plan of those proposed by Bush and Gore was more
sound.
</P>
<P>
   ``As he was speaking I was thinking of George Bush's `Prosperity
With a Purpose' plan,'' Ridge said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton turned up his partisan tone later at a fund-raising
speech in Philadelphia for Rep. Ron Klink, who is running for
Senate against Sen. Rick Santorum.
</P>
<P>
   The president condemned Republican lawmakers for failing to
endorse some blacks and Hispanics that he has nominated for federal
judgeships and he accused Republicans of ignoring the poor and
elderly.
</P>
<P>
   But as he spoke to the governors association, the group that
helped catapult him into White House, Clinton was clearly pulling
his punches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know all the press coverage is always on the fights that we
have, but let me tell you, we actually agree on things every now
and then in Washington,'' Clinton said. ``And there are a lot of
things we could do in the next six months.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton added: ``I ask you to help ensure an election season
that is positive, open and vigorous about the real and honest
differences, but devoid of the poison that has too often clouded
the judgment of everybody involved in the public process.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as he offered his views, Clinton acknowledged that his
thoughts matter far less in these waning days of his presidency. He
said his opinions plus a quarter ``will get you half a soda pop.''
</P>
<P>
   After the speech, Clinton met briefly with Sherry Pope, whose
husband, Edmond, a retired Navy officer, was arrested in Moscow on
April 3 on espionage charges. The president told Mrs. Pope that he
was following the case.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the president stopped at the creamery on the campus of
Pennsylvania State University, from where he emerged with a
double-scoop cone of ice cream. He said the flavor was ``Peachy
Paterno,'' named for Joe Paterno, the school's longtime football
coach.

JUSTICE DEPT. DETAILS ITS CASE AGAINST FORMER STARR SPOKESMAN 
</HEADLINE>
  By ADAM CLYMER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Justice Department detailed its case Monday
against Charles Bakaly, the former spokesman for Independent
Counsel Ken Starr, accusing Bakaly of lying when he denied leaking
information last year to The New York Times about a possible
indictment of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Bakaly will go on trial here on Thursday on charges of criminal
contempt of court.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department's brief said Bakaly's false answers to
government lawyers obstructed justice by delaying a federal judge's
investigation into the news leaks and causing ``unnecessary work
and costs'' for the court and others.
</P>
<P>
   In the investigation, Judge Norma Holloway Johnson of federal
District Court had been trying to determine the source of reports
by the Times and other news organizations, specifically a January
1999 article in the Times, that said Starr had concluded that a
sitting president could be indicted.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief filed in response to the charges, Bakaly's lawyers
insisted that his statements were not false and that in any case,
they were not relevant to an investigation of possible leaks of
grand jury evidence.
</P>
<P>
   In their brief, defense lawyers conceded that Bakaly had
discussed the subject with a reporter for the Times, but had not
discussed anything that was not already public knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the lawyers argued, guilt can only be established in a
criminal contempt case by actions that amounted to ``a public wrong
against the court,'' not against others.
</P>
<P>
   Bakaly's lawyers said in the brief that Congress wrote the
contempt law ``specifically to preclude a judicial power to hold a
witness in criminal contempt any time the court believes that the
witness has testified falsely and thereby prolonged or complicated
proceedings.''
</P>
<P>
   While accusations of improper leaks had plagued Starr's
investigation of President Clinton's relationship with Monica
Lewinsky from its start in early 1998, the Jan. 31, 1999, article
in The Times caused a particularly intense response.
</P>
<P>
   The article by Don Van Natta Jr. was published during the
president's impeachment trial by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   It said Starr had decided that he had the authority to seek an
indictment of Clinton before he left office. It said he had not
decided whether to do so.
</P>
<P>
   The article also said: ``Inside the independent counsel's
office, a group of prosecutors believes that not long after the
Senate trial concludes, Mr. Starr should ask the grand jury of 23
men and women hearing the case against Mr. Clinton to indict him on
charges of perjury and obstruction of justice.''
</P>
<P>
   The report was attributed to ``several associates of Mr.
Starr.'' It said Bakaly had ``declined to discuss the matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson sought to prosecute Bakaly for leaking grand jury
material in violation of federal rules. But last September, a
federal appeals court here said that the rule barred prosecutors
from publicly discussing ``matters occurring before the grand
jury,'' and that the views of Starr and his associates about a
possible indictment of a president did not fit that definition.
</P>
<P>
   Bakaly was accused of lying three times in a sworn statement to
Johnson, specifically when he said that he had refused ``to discuss
nonpublic matters'' with both Van Natta and Jill Abramson, a
reporter who is now the Washington editor of the Times; that he had
``refused to confirm or comment'' on what Starr ``was thinking of
doing''; and that Van Natta had ``assured me that his sources were
outside'' the independent counsel's office and that the reporter
``intended to make it clear'' in his article.
</P>
<P>
   Bakaly was also accused of withholding information from outside
lawyers hired by Starr's office to investigate the leak to the
Times.
</P>
<P>
   Because he withheld the information, the Justice Department
brief said, ``Mr. Bakaly knowingly caused a materially false and
misleading statement to be made in a brief filed by the OIC with
this court, as follows: `Mr. Van Natta further told Mr. Bakaly that
all his information came from sources `outside' the OIC.''' OIC is
the Office of Independent Counsel.
</P>
<P>
   In their defense, Bakaly's lawyers accused the lawyers who
prepared the statement of ignoring much of what Bakaly told them
about his dealings with Van Natta.
</P>
<P>
   Bakaly acknowledged, they said, that he had dealt with Van Natta
on the story and had even sent him portions of an internal
memorandum on the constitutional issues.
</P>
<P>
   They insisted that when Bakaly confirmed to Van Natta that Starr
had the four options _ indicting the president, not indicting him,
indicting him under seal or indicting him after he left office _
the spokesman was in fact revealing nothing but merely acting to
``confirm a truism.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Oreskes, Washington bureau chief of the Times, said
Monday night, ``The Times does not discuss its sources.''
</P>
<P>
   Bakaly won some public support from a consistent, intense critic
of Starr and his investigations, Julian Epstein, the chief
Democratic lawyer on the House Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Epstein called the case ``a terrible prosecution.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the appeals court had found that no offense against grand
jury secrecy had been committed, making this case against Bakaly
amounted to no more than ``a semantical game of gotcha,'' Epstein
said Monday.

SOURCE SAYS `BIG DIG' COULD COST $14 BILLION-PLUS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Budgeted as Bigdig-Slater)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS C. PALMER JR. AND ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ An independent consultant's detailed assessment of cost
overruns at the Big Dig will push the estimated total cost of the
project up to or beyond the $14 billion mark, a source familiar
with the not-yet-released report said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The estimated cost increase would indicate that the Central
Artery/Ted Williams Tunnel project's finance were even more out of
control than state and federal officials have known or acknowledged
to date.
</P>
<P>
   Deloitte &AMP; Touche, the accounting firm hired by then-Secretary
of Administration and Finance Andrew Natsios before he was tapped
to take over the Big Dig, will estimate the cost overruns at $2.2
billion or more, according to the source, who asked not to be
identified.
</P>
<P>
   The the bad news came at an awkward time for Gov. Paul Cellucci,
who was in Washington meeting wiht US Transportation Secretary
Rodney E. Slater for the first time since a humiliating federal
audit of the Big Dig in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   Slater Monday reassured the Massachusetts governor about his
handling of the highway budget crisis, indicating his agency would
approve the state's new financing plan by the end of this month,
though even that plan may now have to be adjusted.
</P>
<P>
   Slater also gave unwavering approval of newly installed Turnpike
chairman Natsios, attendees of the meeting said.
</P>
<P>
   Ten weeks before he was forced to resign in mid-April, Turnpike
Chairman James J. Kerasiotes made a sudden, shocking announcement
of a $1.4 billion cost overrun. During the previous five years or
so, project officials had insisted that its bottom line would not
exceed $10.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Highway Administration officials swooped into Boston and
made their own analysis, raising the estimate of overruns to about
$1.8 billion. Along with a huge insurance credit that the project
was forced to give up, that meant the project would cost about
$13.6 billion when it is completed in 2005.
</P>
<P>
   But Natsios, who as Secretary of Administration and Finance had
questioned Big Dig officials's accounting methods, hired Deloitte &AMP;
Touche to make an independent evaluation.
</P>
<P>
   ``A &AMP; F was concerned that the full extent of the cost overrun
and total project cost were not yet fully known or understood,''
says a June 15 letter from Deloitte &AMP; Touche to Natsios.
</P>
<P>
   Before federal highway officials sign off on the state's latest,
corrected official finance plan, that independent evaluation must
be complete.
</P>
<P>
   According to the letter, which was attached to the June 16
finance plan that the state submitted to Federal Highway, ``the
final report will not be completed until the end of July.''
</P>
<P>
   But the source, who was given a preview of what is in the
Deloitte &AMP; Touche report, said it will apparently force the
Legislature to go back to work to figure out how to pay an even
bigger Big Dig bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``It kind of presents problems for everybody,'' the source said,
referring to state transportation officials and Federal Highway, as
well as state legislators.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature put together a $2 billion bailout package in the
spring, after news of the overruns burst out and federal officials
warned that they did not want any more US highway money used on the
megaproject.
</P>
<P>
   If the cost overruns indeed exceed $2 billion, the Legislature's
work _ even though it was believed to contain a ``cushion'' against
further increased costs _ might not do the trick.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's at least $2.2 billion,'' said the source. ``It could be
higher than that.''
</P>
<P>
   A $2.2 billion increase is $400 million over what federal and
state officials have said they believed it to be. With the accepted
cost of the project at about $13.6 currently, a $400 million
increase would shove the total figure up to the $14 billion range.
</P>
<P>
   The Deloitte &AMP; Touche contract called for its accountants to
examine the project's management costs, redesign costs, and
assumptions on estimating contractors' requests for additional
money.

   BUDGET PROBLEMS IN TEXAS
</P>
<P>
   One thing George W. Bush has known in his more than five years
as governor of Texas is prosperity. But now Texas is facing a
budget shortfall as high as $750 million, fueled by deficits in
Medicaid and other state programs and rising costs for prison
inmates, according to The Houston Chronicle. Members of the
Legislative Budget Board, which oversees the budget, are scheduled
to meet privately with state budget officials Tuesday to plan an
emergency appropriations bill for January. Rob Junell, chairman of
the House Appropriations Committee, said the state's economy will
provide enough new revenues to cover the shortfall.

   A PEROT ALLY IS REPLACED

   Ross Perot's unsuccessful effort to place a ``no endorsement''
choice on the Reform Party ballot, beside the names of candidates
Pat Buchanan and John Hagelin, has cost his close colleague,
Russell J. Verney, his position as chairman of the convention
credentials committee. Responding to complaints by the Buchanan
campaign Verney would not be impartial in settling disputes over
delegates, the party chairman, Gerald R. Moan, replaced Verney with
Frank Reed, the Ohio state party chairman. As many as two dozen
states have competing groups of delegates. Verney said he was
``very saddened that the party leadership buckled down under
pressure'' from the Buchanan campaign.

</P>
<P>
   AN UNLIKELY RUNNING MATE
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Gray Davis of California came just inches Monday from
ruling himself out of the running to be Al Gore's ticket mate.
Davis has frequently been mentioned as a possible choice, someone
whose considerable popularity in the Golden State could help Gore
win its biggest-of-all trove of electoral votes. But the job has
not been offered to him, he said in an interview, and therefore he
would not address a theoretical question about whether he would
accept it. ``However,'' he went on, ``what I will say is that I
told the people of California when they elected me in 1998 that I
would serve a full four-year term, and that is what I intend to
do.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Everyone digs the long ball
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dixie digs the long ball. Hell, even Dixie Chicks dig the long
ball. Doesn't everyone? Indeed, when a capacity crowd and national
TV audience look on tonight in Turner Field, what has become for
many the highlight of baseball's All-Star weekend _ the Home Run
Derby _ will glorify what's long been the most majestic moment in
sports.
</P>
<P>
   And as much as we revel when someone _ Big Mac, Sammy, Rafael
Belliard _ goes yard, imagine how the yardman himself feels about
his handiwork.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing better,'' said Chipper Jones. ``To be able to
make 50,000 people get up out of their seats just by the crack of
your bat, I don't know if there's anything better than that.''
</P>
<P>
   There hasn't been since the '20s, when Babe Ruth transformed
baseball with the home run and transfixed the nation with 60 homers
in 1927. Yes, Roger Maris smacked 61 in '61, but it wasn't until
the summer of 1998 that Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa took our
national love affair with the long ball to the next level. To the
upper level, with 70 and 66 dingers, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Yet not even last season, when a big-league record 5,528 home
runs were smacked (an average of 2.3 per game), could prepare us
for this year's Home Run Orgy. It's not only McGwire, Sosa and
their ilk, but slap hitters who now go deep at such an alarming
rate, they're all on pace (2.56 a game) to shatter last season's
mark.
</P>
<P>
   Is it possible to have too many homers? ``What's wrong with
getting 10 presents for Christmas instead of five?'' asks Greg
Maddux, who has as many Cy Youngs (four) as career homers and feels
hitting a home run is better than throwing a shutout. ``It's still
special.''
</P>
<P>
   For many baseball purists, however, reaching the cheap seats has
never seemed cheaper. For some, the allure of the homer is going,
going, almost gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think home runs are losing their luster,'' said Tom Glavine.
``You see guys hit 30 homers and no one blinks an eye. Or they're
wondering, how many times is Mac gonna break 70? Maris' record
lasted what, 37 years?
</P>
<P>
   ``You used to look at guys at the All-Star break, and 20 homers
and 50 RBIs was a really good year. Now, guys have 30 bombs and 70
RBIs. A guy hits 25 homers and you don't even bat an eye.''
</P>
<P>
   Not with baseball gone batty, and goin' deep, as never before.
</P>
<P>
   While the home run's appeal is undeniable, it carries no
ultimate guarantees. The last major-league homer champ whose team
won the World Series? Mike Schmidt of the 1980 Philadelphia
Phillies. Only thrice in the '90s did a league home run leader's
team even make the playoffs. Albert Belle hit 50 for Cleveland in
'95, the same year Colorado's Dante Bichette led the NL with 40;
Ken Griffey Jr. led the AL with 56 in '97.
</P>
<P>
   Even the team historically linked to the home run has learned to
win without relying on it. The Yankees haven't led the American
League in homers since 1961 (when Mickey Mantle smacked 54 to
Maris' 61) and they've since won six world championships, including
three of the last four. Last season, the Yanks were eighth in the
AL with 193 homers, 51 behind league-leading Seattle (244).
</P>
<P>
   The Braves? They were fourth in the NL last year with 197 homers
(No. 1: Colorado, 223) and led the league twice during their decade
of dominance in the '90s (1993, with 169; and 137 in 114 games in
the strike-aborted '94 season). And then there are the Cardinals.
Somewhere, the Babe is smiling.
</P>
<P>
   In the sweet used-to-be, Babe Ruth was literally the king. After
leading the majors with 29 homers for the 1919 Red Sox, the Sultan
of Swat was sold to the Yankees for $100,000 and abused the short
right field pennant porch in Yankee Stadium for 54 homers in '20,
59 the next, 60 in '27. Seventy-three years hence, Ruth is reborn,
wearing red shoes and a red goattee in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Mark McGwire personifies one of several big bang theories about
the glut of homers in today's game: The ball's juiced. Diluted
pitching, an argument made long before big-league expansion
(Headline in The Sporting News in 1950: ``It's Putrid Hurling, Not
Rabbit In Ball.''). New bandbox ballparks. The ball's juiced(cq).
Better-made and lighter bats that increase bat speed. The
incredible shrinking strike zone. The ball's juiced(cq). And, in
McGwire's case and many of his contemporaries, today's bionic
sluggers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got football players playing baseball now,'' said
Maddux. ``That never used to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The players are in better shape now,'' said Andres Galarraga,
a 20-homer All-Star again after a miraculous recovery from cancer.
``A couple of years ago, players came to spring training out of
shape. They didn't even lift weights. Now they're living in the gym
all year. The players are hungry. They want to make money, be
strong, be a superstar.''
</P>
<P>
   They want to be like Mac. From 1968-92, the Cardinals reached
100 homers in just three of those 25 seasons, hitting 50 in '81. In
1998, with McGwire obliterating Maris' mark with 70 home runs in
his first full season in St. Louis, the Cardinals socked a
club-record 233 homers. They led the NL for the first time since
1944, when the Cards hit exactly 100.
</P>
<P>
   All that was mere prelude to this year's launch(cq) buffet. With
newly-acquired Jim Edmonds aboard, St. Louis hit 55 home runs in
April (three less than its 1986 total) to tie the 1947 Giants' NL
record for homers in a month. The Cards belted 100 homers in their
first 52 games, 125 in their first 74 for the fastest start in NL
history.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire's 20th homer in his(cq) 35th game gave him the fastest
20-homer start ever. Earlier this season, he was averaging an
otherworldly one home run every 5.5 at-bats,
</P>
<P>
   a 90-homer pace. When this past weekend's games began, St. Louis
had 145 homers in 84 games, a 280-homer pace that would break the
major-league record of 264 set by Seattle in 1997. Toronto, which
led the AL with 142 home runs in 86 games, is on a 267-homer pace.
</P>
<P>
   In a word, ``Ka-BOOM!'' Yet it's not just the Cards and Blue
Jays, not just McGwire (30 homers entering Friday's games), Edmonds
(24) and Toronto's Carlos Delgado (28) and Tony Batista (24), who
are clearing fences with impunity.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody's doing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first came in the league, maybe five guys hit the ball
out of the park to the opposite field,'' said Glavine. ``Murph
(Dale Murphy). Jack Clark. Later, (Barry) Bonds. (Mike) Piazza. Cat
(Galarraga). Now, you've got second basemen doing it. I'm not
knocking second basemen. But now, almost everybody in the lineup
can hit the ball out of the ballpark to the opposite field. That's
not bad pitching. That's the ball, and the smaller ballparks.''
</P>
<P>
   Juiced-ball conspiracy theories were in vogue in 1987, the first
year of the home run glut. McGwire hit 49 homers as an Oakland
rookie. Wally Joyner, in his second year with the Angels, improved
his rookie homer total of 22 to 34. Joyner's best year since: 21,
in '91.
</P>
<P>
   Suspicions about the ball were rampant in 1996, after baseball's
precipitous attendance decline in '95 following the
strike-shortened 1994 season. ``If you're trying to get people back
into the ballparks and give them what they want to see,'' said
Braves pitcher Terry Mulholland, ``that's one way of doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   That season, each of the 30 major-league teams averaged a
then-record 1.09 homers per game. So far this season, that average
has leapfrogged to 1.28. With help from seemingly every spot in the
lineup, including the most unlikely of sources.
</P>
<P>
   The latest poster boys for this summer's power surge? Indians
rookie Russell Branyan, with 11 homers in his first 79 at-bats; and
Keith McDonald, whom St. Louis just called up from Class AAA
Louisville and promptly became the second player in major-league
history to homer in his first two big-league at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   They are not alone.
</P>
<P>
   _ Last month, Colorado's Jeff Cirillo, a deserving, first-time
NL All-Star who'd never hit more than 15 homers in a season, hit
three in one game. He was the third player to do so in six days,
joining San Diego's Bret Boone and Detroit's Bobby Higginson.
</P>
<P>
   _ Higginson's Tigers, in business since 1901, slugged a
club-record eight homers June 21 against Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   _ In 220 games in the Astrodome, the Cubs hit 111 homers. In
their first three games at Houston's new Enron Field, the most
obscenely homer-friendly of the new parks, the Cubbies slugged nine
homers.
</P>
<P>
   _ When Barry Bonds blasted his 25th homer to briefly take the NL
lead, it was the first time in his 15-year career he'd homered in
four straight games. Until now, Bonds had never hit more than 24
homers before the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   _ Mike Bordick managed a total of 21 homers in six seasons in
Oakland before signing with Baltimore in 1997. The shortstop
surpassed his '98 season high of 13 homers by hitting his 14th June
21.
</P>
<P>
   _ Boston's Carl Everett, a first-time All-Star, already has 24
home runs, one shy of his career-best 25 in '99. Although his 23
homers already top his season high of 15, Houston's Richard Hidalgo
wasn't named to the NL All-Star team. Jose Cruz Jr. of Toronto has
19 homers, five more than his previous high.
</P>
<P>
   When Montreal's Jose Vidro homered from both sides of the plate
here last Monday, that gave the second baseman 15, topping the
first-time All-Star's previous best of 12 in '99. The NL's starting
second baseman, San Francisco's Jeff Kent, merely leads the league
with 82 RBIs. He's also hit 23 homers while playing a position
that's no longer just for singles hitters with slick gloves.
</P>
<P>
   But then, is any position immune to the lure of the long ball?
And is baseball better off with homers, homers everywhere? Is it
coincidental that ESPN's ``Classic Sports'' network has already
shown _ several times _ the May 28 Sunday night pitchers duel
between Pedro Martinez and Roger Clemens, anointing it an instant
sports classic?
</P>
<P>
   ``If you say to a fan walking into Enron Field, what would you
rather see, a 12-10 slugfest or a 1-0 pitchers duel?'' said Chipper
Jones. ``I know what I want to see: a 12-10 slugfest.''
</P>
<P>
   Not Terry Mulholland. ``If I wanted to watch eight, nine homers
in a game,'' he said, ``I'd go watch a beer league softball game
somewhere. There's a lot more to this game.''

 &HT;    Players agree ball is harder, tighter wound
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was time for more exploratory surgery. Already, Billy Koch
had sat in the bullpen one night in Oakland and spent three innings
unraveling a 1999 model baseball. Koch was hoping to unravel the
mystery of this year's ballistic ball.
</P>
<P>
   Now, back home in SkyDome in May, the Toronto closer sat in
front of his locker, trying to get to the core of the conundrum.
</P>
<P>
   Koch had a pair of scissors in one hand, a 2000 ball bearing
commissioner Bud Selig's signature in the other. ``Gonna be some
headlines made here,'' he said. Koch snipped the red seams off the
ball, ripped off the leather cover and unwound the yarn to expose _
what? A Spaldeen, the high-bouncing, pink rubber ball? A half-pint
of spiked Juicy Juice? A marble made of plutonium?
</P>
<P>
   Nope. A rubber core, the one at the heart of every major-league
baseball. It looked identical to the one from the '99 ball Koch had
dissected. After writing the year on each ball, he conducted a
highly scientific test. Koch dropped one ball from chest level,
then the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``In each bounce test I did,'' Koch said, ``the core from the
2000 model jumped two to four inches higher.''
</P>
<P>
   In a word, ``Boing!'' But then, they don't call this game
hardball for nothing. And to many players, Bud Ball 2000 is the
hardest ball they've ever beheld. The slickest and liveliest, too,
and the prime culprit behind the home-run derby that baseball is
becoming.
</P>
<P>
   Wound tighter than Tyson
</P>
<P>
   Major-league teams hit 931 home runs in April _ 195 more homers
than in April '99. While the new ball is hardly the lone
explanation for the long ball, there's little doubt the Bud Ball is
different. And hardly the pitcher's best friend.
</P>
<P>
   The consensus? It's more tightly stitched, wound tighter than
Mike Tyson. The tight stitching results in lower seams and slicker
surfaces. They make it more difficult for pitchers to get a grip
and make the ball move on command. The ball's just plain harder,
too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to be able to squeeze a baseball and feel it give a
little bit, more than it did now,'' Braves pitcher Greg Maddux
said. ``My hand could've gotten weaker.'' Pause. Smile. ``Not
likely.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question in my mind the ball has changed,'' Tom
Glavine said. ``It's just harder. It flies. The combination of a
harder baseball and smaller ballparks are turning people who
shouldn't be into home-run hitters.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this season, one American League hitting coach decided,
``Instead of aluminum bats, we have aluminum balls.''
</P>
<P>
   Cubs first baseman Mark Grace knows the new ball has helped make
Wrigley Field's confines friendlier than ever. ``When I first got
to the big leagues, maybe five, six guys could hit balls out of the
ballpark to center and the opposite way,'' Grace said. ``Now,
you've got little 150-pound backup second basemen hitting
opposite-field homers out of the park. So, something's changed,
however you want to do the math.''
</P>
<P>
   Harder material
</P>
<P>
   Gord Ash, the Blue Jays president and general manager, advocates
a less-destructive test than Koch's. ``If you ask a player to close
his eyes and put two balls on a table _ an old one and a new one _
he can tell you the new one by feel,'' Ash said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, when you gave up a smash or a line drive, the ball
would come back and have a flat spot on it,'' Cubs right-hander
Kevin Tapani said. ``Now, they stay perfectly round. Now, when
someone hits a home run and some fan picks it up, the ball's still
a pearl. The bat's not affecting it like it used to.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Koch, Tapani won't be conducting any at-home comparative
tests on the 1991 keepsake ball he has at home. .``You don't really
saw that one open,'' he said, referring to a ball from the 1991
World Series, when Tapani, then with the Twins, beat the Braves in
Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves' Terry Mulholland, 37, who broke in with the Giants
in 1986, said, ``It's definitely a harder baseball, which
translates into longer home runs and harder-hit balls through the
infield. Everybody wants to talk about homers, but you get a lot of
hard shots back through the mound. Being a ground-ball pitcher, I
get my share.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Koch, Mulholland won't be opening up any baseballs. ``You
don't have to,'' he said. ``You see enough balls hit nowadays where
the ball jumps off the bat like a golf ball. It's not necessarily
Mark McGwire swinging the bat.''
</P>
<P>
   And like Tapani, Mulholland sees few flat balls these days.
``The only thing getting flat now is the wood on the bat,'' he
said. ``When you throw a ball that's harder than the wood ...''

NBA SUES TIMES CO. OVER SALE OF PHOTOS 
</HEADLINE>
   By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The National Basketball Association has sued The New York Times
Co. for selling a collection of five photographs from the 1999 NBA
playoffs, saying that the sale violated the terms of the contract
written on the back of the press passes of newspaper photographers.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, filed in New York state Supreme Court, argues that
the press credentials limit The Times' ``use of NBA photographs to
`news coverage' of the specific games for which the credential was
issued.''
</P>
<P>
   The suit reflects a new battlefront in a continuing struggle
between news organizations and sports leagues, arenas, theaters and
other entertainment forums over the line between news gathering
protected under the First Amendment to the Constitution, and the
infringement of the property rights of the people paying for and
producing the events that journalists cover.
</P>
<P>
   But the emergence of the Internet as a worldwide mass medium _
coupled with technological developments that are increasing the
capabilities of paging systems, cellular phones and personal
digital assistants _ has increased the stakes in these battles,
according to legal experts.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, legal debates have centered on whether game
developments can be distributed instantaneously by pager (they
can), who has the right to post the shot-by-shot progress in golf
tournaments on Internet sites (generally, the organization
arranging the tournament and its licensees), and whether the image
of an athlete can be used to promote a newspaper's sports coverage
(it can).
</P>
<P>
   The basketball league, which had been one of the parties suing
to prevent the distribution of real-time game information by pager,
filed its suit on Friday, several weeks after The Times began
promoting the sale of these pictures.
</P>
<P>
   The basketball collection is part of a larger offering of images
taken by photographers of The New York Times and sold on its
Internet site. The photos include the moon landing in 1969, civil
rights struggles and images of what the online brochure refers to
as ``the golden age of baseball.'' The five-photograph basketball
collection sells for $900, or $801 for home-delivery subscribers.
Individual photos can be purchased for $195.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA's suit against The Times is narrowly drawn as a
breach-of-contract issue.
</P>
<P>
   Richard W. Buchanan, the league's general counsel, said: ``To
me, our view is that The Times is selling photographs of NBA game
action on their Internet site without our permission in violation
of their agreement not to do so. We've asked them to stop, but they
continue.''
</P>
<P>
   The league has for years engaged its own photographers to take
pictures of games, which are sold through the NBA's chosen outlets.
At the same time, many newspapers, including The Times, have resold
their game images on news and syndication services or as images in
books or on posters or calendars.
</P>
<P>
   George Freeman, the assistant general counsel of The Times,
said: ``The NBA has a huge publicity machine trying to gain
attention for the league all over the world. When a company tried
to distribute the scores of games on a real-time basis, they
claimed they owned the scores.'' The league lost that suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now,'' Freeman continued, ``they claim that we can't sell
photographs _ on the basis of a credential that photographers don't
read, don't sign, and are forced to wear to do their jobs. They
love publicity, but not so immediate that media could compete with
their Web site or so historic that media could compete with the
NBA's desire to monopolize all sales of products. They want to
allow us a tiny sliver of coverage limited to the day after'' the
event.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA game press credentials include the stricture that ``the
use of any photograph, film, tape or drawing of the game, player
interviews or other arena activities taken or made by the
accredited organization of the individual for whom this credential
has been issued shall be limited to news coverage of the game.''

GORE TURNS TO TARRING BUSH AND CONGRESS WITH THE SAME BRUSH 
</HEADLINE>
   By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW BRITAIN, Conn. _ Vice President Al Gore took a new tack in
his presidential campaign Monday, beginning a series of broadsides
against the Republican-controlled Congress and seeking to align
Gov. George W. Bush, his Republican rival, with antipopulist stands
that he says are a result of the control of Congress by special
interests.
</P>
<P>
   Gore branded Congress repeatedly with a mouthful phrase _ the
``do-nothing-for-the-people Republican Congress'' _ in an effort to
sharpen the differences between him and Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's face it. Never has so little been done, in so much time,
to benefit so few,'' the vice president said, pointing to Congress'
failure to pass legislation he favors, like raising the minimum
wage, protecting the environment, making drugs cheaper for the
elderly and strengthening gun control laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is time for the Congress to listen to the people and not
the powerful,'' Gore said, speaking in an incongruously soft voice
to about 300 people in the ornate auditorium of Central Connecticut
State University. ``It's time for them to do something instead of
doing nothing. I've heard from people all over this country who
can't wait for them to work up the gumption to come out from under
the thumb of the special interests.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said that Congress, in which he served for 16 years, was
controlled by big oil companies, big drug companies, big insurance
companies and health maintenance organizations and that Bush, who
has so far largely sidestepped association with congressional
Republicans, was doing the bidding of these industries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gov. Bush, who is now head of the Republican Party, says
nothing about this,'' Gore said, ``and his silence aids and abets
the do-nothing Republican-led Congress and the same special
interests who are contributing so much to his own campaign: the
HMOs, the insurance companies, the pharmaceutical companies, the
oil companies and the big polluters.''
</P>
<P>
   In essence, Gore was trying to lump Congress with institutions
that, polling shows, people love to hate.
</P>
<P>
   The venue he chose to launch this scorching of the Republican
leadership was a blue-collar region of southwest Connecticut that
is represented in Congress by a Republican, Nancy Johnson.
Connecticut, which voted for President Clinton and is home to two
Democratic senators, is considered a toss-up state this year, a bad
sign for Gore, whose strongest region should be the Northeast, the
most liberal and reliably Democratic part of the country.
</P>
<P>
   A recent poll by the Hartford Courant and the University of
Connecticut showed the two candidates in a statistical dead heat,
with Gore winning 45 percent of the vote and Bush, who has family
roots here, with 43 percent.
</P>
<P>
   G. Donald Ferree Jr., director of the poll, said in an interview
that Gore appeared to be falling back on the strategy of attacking
big institutions because he was having a hard time overcoming the
perception that Bush was more likable and was stronger on personal
matters like leadership and credibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going after Bush personally is not working and may not seem
fair,'' Ferree said. ``The less Gore focuses on personality, the
better for him. It's better for Gore not to treat him as a person
but to treat him as a front for the Republicans. The Congress is
impersonal.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore has been trying to frame the race as a dramatic ideological
choice, between his own moderate, centrist views and those of a
candidate who would be following the dictates of the right wing,
especially with nominations of Supreme Court justices who would
oppose abortion.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore camp has long believed that the vice president would
win the election because the positions he held were more carefully
crafted to public opinion than those of Bush. Gore has spent much
of the spring fine-tuning his positions and is now on a mission to
make the public aware of his differences with Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Working to Gore's advantage, his supporters contend, is that his
positions meld with those of most Democratic officeholders. While
Republicans are splintered along numerous lines, the Democrats are
speaking with more or less one voice, the exception being trade.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, that message was delivered by Sen. Joseph Lieberman, the
Connecticut Democrat who has been mentioned as a possible vice
presidential running mate and who introduced Gore here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am here to fight to protect Connecticut's voters from
deceptive politics,'' Lieberman told the audience. ``Don't let
yourself be cheated by Republican offers that sound good but don't
deliver. Don't let yourself be cheated by statements that seem
centrist, but in the end, end up on the fringes, that talk the
compassionate talk but, believe me, I've looked at the details,
simply do not walk the compassionate walk. Al Gore is the real
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``In Stevie Wonder's words, Al Gore is singing in the
key of life.''
</P>
<P>
   Before his speech Monday, Gore took part in an online discussion
with readers of The Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
   He was asked what effect the results of the recent failed test
of the proposed national missile defense system had on his opinion
of the necessity of its deployment.
</P>
<P>
   He said he still favored the missile system, adding: ``The
failure of the test last Friday night doesn't mean that such a
system is impossible to build, although the specific lessons from
the failure will have to await a more thorough analysis.''
</P>
<P>
   He was also asked why he supported the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I support it for particularly heinous crimes because I believe
there are some offenses for which it is just,'' Gore responded. ``I
know that many feel it does not really have a deterrent effect, but
I think it probably does.''

   NFC Q&AMP;A
</P>
<P>
   Changes in personnel, coaching will have effect on NFC
</P>
<P>
   Cox News Service writer Ken Sugiura answers some key questions
on the state of the NFC and AFC:
</P>
<P>
   Q:Who is the favorite to get to the Super Bowl?
</P>
<P>
   A: Washington is a lot better, but there is no telling what
effect bringing in so many new players will have.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay traded for wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson, but no one
knows whether he will be enough to push the Buccaneers over the
top.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis is the defending champion, but, as folks in Atlanta
know all too well, it isn't always easy getting back.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What possible roadblocks do the Rams face?
</P>
<P>
   A: One place to look is the sidelines. After shedding blood,
sweat and a lot of tears, coach Dick Vermeil retired. Offensive
coordinator Mike Martz took over and made lots of changes to his
staff.
</P>
<P>
   Four assistants close to Vermeil were sent on their way. It
might make the staff stronger, but it seems a risky move to shake
up a winning formula so much.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, the Rams have changed their team colors, switching
from royal to navy blue.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis also lost two starters from the offensive line, but
did pick up center Steve Everitt from Philadelphia. The schedule is
more difficult, and the Rams can't expect to have the same good
fortune with injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What will Johnson do for the Buccaneers?
</P>
<P>
   A: Most likely a lot. Johnson can do it all as a wide receiver.
He has great hands, catches passes over the middle and will be a
big target for quarterback Shaun King. Johnson won't turn King into
Johnny Unitas, but he doesn't have to.
</P>
<P>
   He will be a constant threat and will open things up for the
running game.
</P>
<P>
   King held his own last season and in the playoffs. If he takes
care of the ball and finds Johnson every so often, Tampa Bay will
be in great shape.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who's the next Kurt Warner?
</P>
<P>
   A: A very tough question, because pretty much no one had Warner
pegged as Super Bowl MVP material this time last year.
</P>
<P>
   For what it's worth, the Buffalo Bills signed all-NFL Europe
League wide receiver Kevin Drake, formerly of the Arizona
Cardinals. Drake set an NFL Europe League record with 12 touchdowns
on just 37 receptions. His quarterback, ex-Florida Gator Danny
Wuerffel, tore up Europe by completing 161 of 260 passes in 10
games for 2,042 yards and 25 touchdowns against only seven
interceptions. He signed with the Packers.
</P>
<P>
   Both played for the World Bowl champion Rhein Fire.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is James Stewart, the Lions' new running back, worth $25
million for five years?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Lions think so. Having let go Ron Rivers, who signed with
the Falcons, and Greg Hill, their running backs from last year, the
Lions are committed to the ex-Tennessee Volunteer.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart ran for 931 yards and a league-high 13 touchdowns last
year. He started seven games for the Jacksonville Jaguars in place
of the injured Fred Taylor and averaged 3.7 yards per carry.
</P>
<P>
   However, in Stewart's five years in the NFL, he only once has
played a full 16-game season. Also, he has a per-carry average of
4.03 yards on natural grass and 3.41 on artificial turf. The Lions
will play 11 games on the fake stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Q: After Washington, Tampa Bay and St. Louis, who comes next?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Cowboys have brought back assistant coach Jack Reilly to
put in the old offense that quarterback Troy Aikman wanted, and
they traded for wide receiver Joey Galloway to try to replace
Michael Irvin.
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings tied Dallas for the third-best record in the
conference at 10-6, but that was before they let Jeff George go and
named second-year quarterback Daunte Culpepper their starter.
Culpepper appeared in one game and didn't throw a pass.
</P>
<P>
   The Packers missed the playoffs for the first time since 1993
and could be shaky on defense. But with Brett Favre, it's difficult
to rule them out.
</P>
<P>
   The Bears are a trendy pick, but they will have to improve a
defense that gave up an average of 356.5 yards per game last year.
</P>
<P>
   The answer should be clearer after the first four games of the
season. Carolina has Washington, San Francisco, Atlanta and Dallas,
and the Falcons play San Francisco, Denver, Carolina and St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, it's probably Carolina.

WHAT OLYMPIANS WILL WEAR AND THE ART OF WINDOW DRESSING 
</HEADLINE>
   By   GUY TREBAY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ What will the U.S. Olympics athletes wear during
medal ceremonies for the summer Olympics, which begin Sept. 15 in
Australia? The quick answer is warm-up suits by Adidas. But anyone
tuned in to the drama of branding knows there are bigger issues
here than a sporty silhouette.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the corporately innocent days of the 1992 Barcelona
Olympics, Michael Jordan made headlines by draping himself in an
American flag during the medal ceremonies. Jordan wasn't being
patriotic. He was safeguarding his brand. The uniforms worn by
athletes to that year's ceremonies happened to be provided by
Reebok. Jordan was a Nike shill.
</P>
<P>
   In the fallout over this logo skirmish, the U.S. Olympic
Committee concluded that the time had come to abandon what one
official at the time called ``ambush marketing,'' with sponsors
throwing money at athletes willy-nilly during games' years and then
blowing out of town.
</P>
<P>
   The committee got serious about marketing the games themselves
as a brand, forming Olympic Properties of the United States, which
last year signed a sports marketing firm, the International
Management Group, to translate stirring gold medal moments into
profits. Enter, among many others, Adidas.
</P>
<P>
   In New York this week to unveil the company's new medal outfits,
Susan Halliday, an Adidas product manager, remarked that, in the
past, ``You'd have a Coca-Cola do a year of the games and then
they're gone.'' By contrast, Adidas, which has signed on for two
years, ``is about long-term contracts and commitment,'' Halliday
said. It's also, presumably, about a revived presence in a
Nike-dominated market.
</P>
<P>
   Designed by Mireille Poujol, the asymmetric outfits have fitted
jackets and stitched-on chevrons that converge to emphasize not
only the medals but the athletes' physiques _ a novel idea.
Formerly, Olympics' sportswear came in unisex styles, Halliday
said, ``which tended to be gaudy and flamboyant, with bells and
whistles.''
</P>
<P>
   In Sydney, you won't be seeing any unseemly logo brouhaha. When
American athletes show up for team processing, not only do they
submit to random drug testing, they also sign waivers guaranteeing
that, should they happen to win a medal, they'll do so wearing the
official sponsor's clothes.
</P>
<P>
   THE ART OF SHOPPING
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved the idea of looking through the words to see the
merch,'' said Barbara Kruger, the artist, taking a break Monday
during the installation of a career retrospective, which opens at
the Whitney Museum of American Art on Thursday. Kruger wasn't
referring to anything in a gallery, however. She was talking about
a display at Saks Fifth Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   The 55-year-old artist was invited to install a series of her
epigrammatic text-based images in the store's Fifth Avenue windows.
Previous contributors have included Kenny Scharf, who installed
green-skinned, one-eyed mannequins wearing John Bartlett camouflage
leather; and William Wegman, who presented his long-suffering
Weimaraners, Chip and Battina, decked out in Dolce &AMP; Gabbana and
wearing Donatella Versace-look-alike wigs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an ongoing commitment to contemporary art,'' said
Michael Macko, a Saks spokesman. Using fine artists in place of
window dressers, he added, ``shows how fashion, art and design
influence each other.'' It also incidentally honors a fine
tradition. Andy Warhol, Robert Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns all
did windows, albeit at a hungrier stage in their careers.

   One can only conjecture how pedestrians will react to Kruger's
work, which is probably as recognizable for its social critique as
for its graphic oomph. In block letters dropped out of a signature
red background, one text reads, for example: ``You've got the look
and you intend to keep it. You know how superficial an ornamental
life can be, but at times you live one anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a long way from fashion's traditionally loopy
pronouncements: ``Banish the black, think pink!'' Or is it? The
Saks project, Kruger explained, ``actually came out of a piece I
did for Harper's Bazaar.''
</P>
<P>
   It all ``originates in the fact that I worked at Conde Nast for
11 years,'' said Kruger, who was employed as a picture editor at
House &AMP; Garden and Mademoiselle. ``On a formal level, that's what
my work came from: taking images and putting words across them.
It's sort of fun to be on Fifth Avenue, with all this density of
bodies and eyes, still taking images and putting words across them,
but instead of `Wear This Sweater' I'm using my own words.''

MRS. CLINTON SEEKS NEW FORMULA FOR STATE MEDICAID FINANCING 
</HEADLINE>
  By JONATHAN P. HICKS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLONIE, N.Y. _ Hillary Rodham Clinton continued her focus on
economic issues Monday as she called for a new formula to calculate
the amount of money New York receives from the federal government
for Medicaid expenditures. Her formula, she said, could cut
residents' taxes by an average of $400 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who made the recommendations in a speech to about 100
people at an American Legion hall in this Albany suburb, said that
the current formula reimbursed New York at the lowest rate of
federal subsidy for Medicaid. Since New York's counties share the
cost of Medicaid with the state, the change she proposes would
provide the state with about $3 billion a year, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Her proposal is similar to recommendations made by Sen. Daniel
Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., the man she hopes to succeed. The
difference, Clinton said, is that an expected increase in the
federal budget surplus would make her plan more palatable
politically, with the increased subsidy coming from those funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, because of the surplus, we can present this choice,''
Clinton said. ``And I think we have a better chance than we've ever
had to create a coalition that would enable us to pass this.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposal came at the end of a five-day campaign tour that
has taken Clinton to a dozen communities from western New York to
the Albany area. As she has done frequently during the tour,
Clinton told the audience that her most pressing priority, if she
is elected senator, will be to work to stimulate the economy of
upstate New York.
</P>
<P>
   The plan being pushed by Clinton would use a formula that
largely takes into account the percentage of the population
classified as living in poverty. Under the current system, Medicaid
reimbursement is determined by the state's per capita income.
</P>
<P>
   The current method, Clinton said, means that the federal
government covers about 50 percent of New York's Medicaid expenses,
while other states receive more than 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that her proposal was likely to be viewed
skeptically by Republicans in Congress. ``Obviously I'm in an
election, so people on the other side of the aisle will probably
come out against it within 10 or 15 minutes, if not sooner, because
they don't want me to present an idea that sounds like a good
idea,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think it could provide a way out of the dilemma we've
been in,'' she added. ``We couldn't have presented it too much
earlier because we didn't have the proected surpluses that would
have provided the funding for it.''
</P>
<P>
   In addressing other economic issues, Clinton again discussed her
interest in bringing better airline service and lower fares, as
well as lower utility rates, to upstate cities. She has also talked
often about promoting tourism in upstate New York.
</P>
<P>
   While she has offered few specifics on many of the items in her
plan, she has nonetheless made economic issues the centerpiece of
this campaign trip. At every stop, her staff has distributed
brochures with the headline, ``Hillary's Upstate Economic Agenda.''

SAMPRAS ON SAMPRAS: HE REFLECTS ON WIMBLEDON, HIS PARENTS AND HIS
FUTURE 
 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Less than 24 hours after capturing what he called the
most defining victory in his career, Pete Sampras still seemed
blinded by the flashbulbs from Wimbledon's Center Court. ``It's
huge for me,'' he said, trying to digest the meaning of his seventh
Wimbledon title and his record 13th singles Grand Slam
championship. ``All the slams for me are, but especially Wimbledon.
It has always been the biggest tournament in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Trailing by 4-1 in the second-set tie breaker, already having
lost the first set to Patrick Rafter, Sampras thought he was headed
for defeat. Instead he was headed for history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe things just happen,'' he said Monday from a
Manhattan hotel room. ``I felt like it was going to happen at 9
o'clock when the light was going out. I felt like this is it, this
is maybe my destiny. I believe in destiny.''
</P>
<P>
   After a sleepless night followed by a morning flight from
London, Sampras spent 45 minutes Monday with a Times reporter, Liz
Robbins, and several editors, recounting the emotion of the
tournament. Relaxed and open, he discussed a variety of issues,
ranging from his parents, the match that changed his career and how
the shin injury that had troubled him during Wimbledon has caused
him to re-evaluate playing in the U.S. Davis Cup semifinals in
Spain next week.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What were the last 24 hours like for you?
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, after the match I did a lot of press and I went to the
ball in my warm-ups and jacket, said a few words and thanked the
people. My head was still at that point spinning, a lot of emotion,
and spent a lot of time with my folks after the match, which was
nice.
</P>
<P>
   So last night I got home at about 1. They had the matched
replayed on one of the channels there, so I was able to relive it.
It was amazing, it really was. It still hasn't hit me quite yet.
</P>
<P>
   Q. So what's the most amazing part of watching your own match?
When you were down 1-4?
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, I felt throughout the match I was outplaying Pat; for
the majority, that I had a lot of chances. And he's the type of
player who kind of grinds you down. And I played a very, very tight
tiebreaker [in the first set) _ double-faulted a couple of times.
And it's a lot a pressure and a lot of nerves, and I don't care how
many times I've been in that situation, you still feel it.
</P>
<P>
   After the changeover when I lost the set, I tried to reflect on
the match I played against Becker where I lost the first set 7-6
[the 1995 final that Sampras won in four sets). On grass, you don't
have a lot of time to really sulk. You can't afford to lose any
concentration. Down 4-1 in the tiebreaker, I didn't like my
changes. I really didn't. Luck just wasn't on my side. He
double-faulted, I hit a couple of good shots and before I knew it,
I was serving for the tiebreaker and it just changed the whole
complexity of the match.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing that I did any differently. He finally felt the
nerves in the second-set tiebreaker. Once I won the second set, I
just kind of could relax, you know.
</P>
<P>
   Q. At the point where you saw yourself at match point and
winning it _ you're watching yourself in this outburst of emotion.
</P>
<P>
   A. It was spontaneous. It was a bit of an emotional roller
coaster throughout the day. Even in the match, because I felt like
I was going to lose the match at a stage. At 5-2 in the changeover
_ that's when it hit me. I felt like it was going to happen. And
it's always an eerie feeling when you're in that position when 45
minutes before then, I was struggling.
</P>
<P>
   It happened so quickly that it all hit me, the emotion of the
whole tournament, the fact that my parents were there, the
historical impact of breaking the record. I mean it all was inside
of me. But I think mostly that my parents were there, and I knew
that. I was thinking about them throughout the match and the fact
that I was torturing them.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How did you get them to fly over?
</P>
<P>
   A. Before I came on this trip, I mentioned to them if I get to
the final I want them to be there. My dad told me, ``My bags are
packed.'' Every time I get into a final I call and invite them. And
he says: ``No, you're doing fine. I don't want to get in the way.''
He always kind of keeps his distance.
</P>
<P>
   This year I just made it a goal of mine that if I ever got to a
final in a slam that I want them there, I want them to be a part of
this. They're not going to come with me every week, but Wimbledon's
been such a big part of my tennis, and that court is so special to
me. And they're obviously the reason that I'm able to play. And you
want the people that helped to get you there to be there. It was
just an amazing moment after the match.
</P>
<P>
   The last slam they saw me in was the '92 U.S. Open loss, which,
ironically, changed my career.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How?
</P>
<P>
   A. Because up until that point, I was happy being in the finals,
quarters and semis at the slams. I was content just being Top 10 in
the world. But that match changed my career. It just finally showed
me that I do hate to lose. Because I remember in that match with
Stefan Edberg, I gave in a little bit at the end and got a little
soft. And months after that loss, it would just really eat away at
me. I felt that I kind of gave it away. Unfortunately, it's a good
effort getting into the finals, but nobody remembers who comes in
second. And you learn that the hard way.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do you think that this match will also change your career?
</P>
<P>
   A. Oh, yeah. Absolutely. Just because of what I was up against _
with my injury and not having a chance to practice and not feeling
very confident in the second week of a slam, which is the time I
play my best.
</P>
<P>
   The scene there was unbelievable. It was getting dark, and those
light bulbs. It was scripted, in a way.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Q. Has there been one surprising phone call of congratulations?
</P>
<P>
   A. I just got one from Dave Matthews. I'm a big fan of his
music. I've met him a couple of times, so he just called. But I
haven't, obviously, been home.
</P>
<P>
   Q. You made the announcement that you would be planning to play
Davis Cup. When did you come to that decision?
</P>
<P>
   A. I'm not sure. I need to let my shin heal properly. As much as
I'd like to think I could play, I have recommendations from the
doctor to take some time off. I was treating it pretty aggressively
to go out and play. And looking at the whole summer, you know, I
need a couple weeks to let this thing heal. And so it's _ at this
point I'm not sure what I'm going to do. I'm going home and get
some more tests done, get some more treatment. But I need to let it
heal properly. I have good doctors.
</P>
<P>
   I need to treat my shins and make sure this is not a prolonged
injury that if I keep on playing on it it's not going to get
better.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How badly did you want to win the French Open to complete a
career Grand Slam?
</P>
<P>
   A. I'd love to win it. I feel like I played pretty well there
this year and lost a tough match [in the first round to Mark
Philippoussis). It's always a priority. It's the one people want to
talk about _ why haven't I won there? _ and it's obviously not an
easy slam for me to win. Next year I'll have to get a good
schedule, and this year I wasn't able to play on clay and this year
I think I will make it a goal to play on clay. I think I can do
well there. And possibly win there. You need some good fortune and
I know at the French I need a bit more. It's not the reason why ``I
am going to play the game until I am 35 _ if I haven't won the
French, I would play the French every year.'' But it is my biggest
challenge at this point in my career.
</P>
<P>
   Q. You'll be getting married later this year [to Brigette
Wilson). How do you think marriage and eventually having children
will affect your tennis career?
</P>
<P>
   A. It will change my life off the court, responsibilities to my
wife or my kids. When I play it will be the same. I don't see a big
change.
</P>
<P>
   Q. In 1990, when you won the U.S. Open [at age 19), did you
think you'd get to 13?
</P>
<P>
   A. No. In '90, I was so young, and my game at that point was not
good enough. I just had two unbelievable weeks. And I didn't have
the confidence to back it up. I had the post-Grand Slam blues, but
I never ever thought that I'd be here today. That '92 Open loss
changed my career. The ability was there; it's just a matter of my
heart and my mind taking it a step further.
</P>
<P>
   The easiest slam of my career was my first slam. And my most
difficult was a day ago. &QL;

KARL SWEETAN, PROFESSIONAL QUARTERBACK ACCUSED IN SCHEME, DIES AT
57 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD GOLDSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Karl Sweetan, a National Football League quarterback in the late
1960s who was later accused of orchestrating a football espionage
scheme involving a stolen playbook, died July 2 in Las Vegas. He
was 57.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was complications of vascular surgery, his family
said.
</P>
<P>
   Stealing a baseball catcher's signs or a football team's plays
by peering through a telephoto lens may be morally repugnant to
some, but what Sweetan allegedly did was considered by federal
authorities to be a crime.
</P>
<P>
   What one newspaper headline termed ``The Case of the Purloined
Playbook'' unfolded in July 1972, when J.D. Roberts, the New
Orleans Saints' coach, reported to the NFL security office that
Sweetan had contacted him in hopes of selling him a Los Angeles
Rams playbook, the closely guarded listing of a team's offensive
and defensive schemes.
</P>
<P>
   The league notified FBI agents, who arrested Sweetan and a
cousin while they were allegedly trying to sell the playbook to
Roberts in a predawn meeting at a New Orleans motel.
</P>
<P>
   Sweetan and the cousin, Wayne Boswell, were handcuffed, spent a
night in jail and were charged with wire fraud and interstate
transportation of stolen property.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams, then rivals of the Saints in the National Football
Conference West, determined that the item offered, reportedly for
$2,500, was a photostat of the Rams' 1971 playbook _ secrets from
the previous season.
</P>
<P>
   In February 1973, Gerald Gallinghouse, the U.S. Attorney in New
Orleans, reported that the consensus of ``numerous experts on pro
football'' he surveyed put the playbook's monetary value at less
than $5,000, the threshold for the sale of a stolen object across
state lines to be a federal crime. As a result, Gallinghouse did
not seek indictments.
</P>
<P>
   Sweetan, a native of Dallas, debuted in the NFL in 1966 with the
Detroit Lions, their 18th draft pick a year earlier out of Wake
Forest. When quarterback Milt Plum suffered a knee injury, Sweetan
became the starter and threw a 99-yard touchdown pass to Pat
Studstill against Baltimore that tied a league record, held by
several players, for the longest passing play.
</P>
<P>
   Sweetan threw 10 touchdown passes for Detroit in 1967, then
played as a backup for the Saints in 1968 and the Rams in 1969 and
1970. He was cut by Los Angeles in September 1971.
</P>
<P>
   At his arraignment in 1972, Sweetan said, ``Once this is cleared
up, I would like to play again.''
</P>
<P>
   But he never did _ at least in the pro ranks. He retired to
Nevada, played semipro football and became a blackjack dealer in
Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by a son, Karl R. Sweetan III, and four
daughters, Christhia Ann Bryan, Virginia Sweetan, Heather Sweetan
and Robin Sweetan. &QL;

SATELLITE VENTURE SET TO REPORT BIG COMMITMENTS BY INVESTORS 
</HEADLINE>
   By BARNABY J. FEDER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ICO-Teledesic Global Limited, the satellite telecommunications
venture controlled by Craig O. McCaw, said it had received
commitments for nearly $300 million from a number of influential
investors, including William H. Gates, chairman of Microsoft, and
the private investment firm Clayton, Dubilier &AMP; Rice Inc.
</P>
<P>
   While Gates is the most famous name, Clayton, Dubilier is the
more important catch for McCaw. The New York investment company is
putting up more money _ $150 million to Gates' $100 million. And it
will provide experienced management help in the form of George W.
Tamke, a partner who is the former co-chief executive of Emerson
Electric.
</P>
<P>
   Tamke, who will join the ICO-Teledesic board, has been
consulting with the company's management on a variety of operating
and strategic issues for several months, according to Donald J.
Gogel, Clayton, Dubilier's chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``George will be doing a lot more than sitting and listening at
board meetings,'' Gogel said.
</P>
<P>
   The investments, which are to be announced Tuesday, also give
Clayton, Dubilier an option to invest $200 million more over the
next two years.
</P>
<P>
   ICO-Teledesic is the holding company for ICO Global
Communications and Teledesic LLC, a McCaw-led partnership.
Teledesic, which was founded in 1994 by McCaw and Gates, has a
long-range goal of creating a system of satellites to provide data
and Internet services to computer users anywhere in the world. ICO
Global, which planned a voice service for mobile users, went
bankrupt last year.
</P>
<P>
   McCaw organized a group of investors that brought ICO Global out
of bankruptcy in May. His announced strategy is to merge the two
satellite ventures, reshape ICO's capabilities to provide wireless
data services in addition to voice and then use it as a
steppingstone to the far more ambitious vision of Teledesic.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the investments by Gates and Clayton, Dubilier,
ICO-Teledesic plans to announce Subhash Chandra, an entrepreneur
from India, and Burtington Resources Inc., a private Swiss
investment firm, are investing $65 million.
</P>
<P>
   Some $22.5 million represents Chandra's investment in the group
that brought ICO Global out of bankruptcy. ICO-Teledesic will also
confirm that McCaw's investment firm, Eagle River Investments LLC,
provided $500 million of the $1.2 billion bankruptcy package.
</P>
<P>
   The investments will not be enough to carry ICO-Teledesic all
the way through to early 2003, its projected start-up date. But the
financial vote of confidence stood in stark contrast to financial
and operating disappointments announced recently by satellite
companies like Orbcomm Global and Globalstar Telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
   Orbcomm, which delivers messages to truckers and other mobile
consumers, said late last month that it would lay off 112 employees
and slow the construction of satellites. Globalstar, which offers
voice and limited data services, defaulted last week on a $250
million line of bank credit.

   (NYT13) UNDATED -- July 10, 2000 -- SCI-SPACE-STATION -- In
order to continue the exploration of outer space, NASA is working to
sucessfully build and launch a critical piece of equipment.  The
long-overdue service module, called Zvezda, which means "star" in
Russian, is to be launched into orbit on Wednesday. Zvezda, is
Russia's primary contribution to the space station. The rest of the

SETH WARD, ARKANSAS BUSINESSMAN INVOLVED IN WHITEWATER CASE, DIES
AT 79 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID STOUT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Seth Ward, a hard-driving Arkansas businessman who was a
peripheral figure in the scandals that embarrassed the Clinton
administration and brought down his son-in-law, Webster L. Hubbell,
died on Sunday in Little Rock. He was 79.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death was heart failure, the family said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seth was one of those old-line Southern patriarchs who
overwhelmed his family with his forcefulness,'' Hubbell wrote in
his book, ``Friends in High Places,'' (William Morrow, 1997).
</P>
<P>
   The book recalled Hubbell's journey from Arkansas lawyer to
Washington power figure as associate attorney general in the
Clinton administration, then his resignation and imprisonment in
what became known as the Whitewater scandal.
</P>
<P>
   In the book, Hubbell said he was overwhelmed not just by his
father-in-law's personality, but also by his generosity. Recalling
the early years of his marriage to Ward's daughter Suzanna, Hubbell
wrote, ``We furnished our house from the Wards' attic.''
</P>
<P>
   Ward left college to become a Marine Corps fighter pilot in the
Pacific in World War II. He also served in the Korean War. He
started an insurance company, then an aluminum siding company, a
burglar alarm company, a storm window company and a business that
made parking meters.
</P>
<P>
   ``People often said of Seth that his instinct for when to sell
was even more golden than his hunch for when to buy,'' Hubbell
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, Ward became associated with a real estate
entrepreneur and banker named James B. McDougal, who was developing
a tract known as Whitewater in northern Arkansas. The plan included
a section, Castle Grande, that was being financed by a savings and
loan association owned by McDougal and his wife, Susan.
</P>
<P>
   Before coming to Washington, Bill Clinton and his wife, Hillary,
were partners for a time with McDougal. The Whitewater venture
eventually collapsed and with it the McDougals' savings and loan
association, at a cost to taxpayers of several million dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Ward was never charged with a crime, although government
investigators concluded that he had been a ``straw buyer'' of parts
of Castle Grande to hide the heavy involvement of the McDougals'
savings institution. The McDougals were convicted of fraud and
other crimes in 1996 and sentenced to prison, where McDougal died
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, Hubbell represented Ward's parking meter
company in an unsuccessful suit against another manufacturer.
Hubbell's law partners later raised questions about billings and
expenses filed by Hubbell, leading to accusations that he had
bilked the firm. Hubbell resigned his Justice Department position
early in 1994 and served 18 months in prison on various charges
arising from the Whitewater investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Hubbell, in his book, writes that his father-in-law's impatience
was nearly fatal one day in 1989. Annoyed that the gutters on
Hubbell's house were neglected, Ward decided to repair them. He
leaned too far out a window and fell two stories, breaking his
back.
</P>
<P>
   Ward spent weeks in the hospital, Hubbell wrote, and wore an
expression whose meaning was clear: ``If I had done my
man-of-the-house duty and gotten the drainage system fixed, he
wouldn't be in a back brace.''
</P>
<P>
   Ward is survived by his wife, Yvonnie; a son, Seth II of Little
Rock; two daughters, Suzanna Hubbell of Washington and Sally Ward
of Little Rock; nine grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.

NEW YORK GOVERNOR SIGNS HATE-CRIME BILL INTO LAW 
</HEADLINE>
   By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Gov. George Pataki on Monday signed into law a
bill that for the first time imposes harsher sentences on criminals
in New York who single out their victims on the basis of sexual
orientation, race, religion or age.
</P>
<P>
   In signing the legislation, Pataki, a Republican, reiterated his
view that crimes spurred by bias can pose a greater threat than
other crimes to the victims and to society as a whole. ``People who
act on hate need to know that their punishment will be swift,
severe and just,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hate crimes do more than threaten the safety and welfare of
our citizens,'' he added. ``They disrupt entire communities and
cannot be tolerated. By signing this legislation today, we are
insuring that these heinous acts, so inherently destructive to our
society, will no longer be tolerated.''
</P>
<P>
   The version approved Monday marks the first time the words
``gay'' and ``lesbian'' or the phrase ``sexual orientation'' appear
anywhere in the dozens of volumes of New York state laws. The
Republican Senate had balked for years at including any language
pertaining to gays or sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new law, a judge or jury weighing a defendant's guilt
or innocence will also be asked to say whether the defendant,
beyond a reasonable doubt, chose the victim because of prejudice.
If a guilty verdict is returned, the defendant will face a longer
prison term if there is a finding of bias than if there is not.
</P>
<P>
   For low-level felonies, the maximum penalty will increase by
three years. For more serious crimes, the additional term for a
bias crime will be greater _ adding a decade or more to the
possible sentence in some cases.
</P>
<P>
   The new law also requires all of the state's law enforcement
agencies to keep statistics on bias crimes and the groups singled
out, something that only a few police agencies now do.
</P>
<P>
   Under the law, a jury or judge can find that a crime was
motivated by prejudice even when the defendant was mistaken about
the victim's identity. For instance, a defendant who believed his
victim was Hispanic can be convicted of a hate crime even if the
victim was not.

SPORTS COLUMN: THE CLASSIC THAT LOST ITS MEANING 
</HEADLINE>
   By MURRAY CHASS   
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ They will play the 71st All-Star Game here Tuesday
night, and it will be the first played without league presidents.
Sort of makes one wonder why they're even bothering.
</P>
<P>
   As in the first 70 games, from 1933 through last season, the
game at Turner Field will match the American League against the
National League, but it won't be the same. The leagues exist in
name only. The baseball offices in New York still have signs
designating the league offices, but if summer tourists want to see
them just to confirm their understanding of what the baseball
structure used to be, they better visit soon. Neither the signs nor
the offices will be there much longer.
</P>
<P>
   The league presidents have already disappeared. Their absence
creates a void at the All-Star Game. Chub Feeney's old heart would
ache if he were still with us, knowing there was no one left to
carry on his practice of delivering a pregame pep talk, his version
of win-one-for-the-Gipper, except in this case, the Gipper was an
entire league.
</P>
<P>
   Katy Feeney, Chub's daughter and a high-ranking baseball
official herself, explained that the old president's All-Star
intensity had its roots in his longtime executive role with the
Giants. ``He came from a team, and he lived and died by the team,''
she said. ``When he became National League president and had to be
neutral, the All-Star team and the World Series team were his
teams. He felt very strongly that the National League was the
best.''
</P>
<P>
   Feeney urged the NL All-Stars to ``show our pride.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a long history,'' he told the players. ``Let's show
what we can do. Don't think this is an exhibition game. You guys
are the best.''
</P>
<P>
   Feeney presided at 17 All-Star Games during his tenure, 1970
through 1986. The National League won 14 of the games, including 11
in a row from 1972 through '82, giving the senior league a run of
19 victories in 20 games.
</P>
<P>
   For 10 of the Feeney years, Lee MacPhail was the American League
president. A forthright and gentlemanly executive, MacPhail didn't
have Feeney's fire when it came to the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never gave them any speeches,'' MacPhail said the other day
from his retirement home on Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   MacPhail rooted hard for his AL All-Star teams, but rooting
obviously wasn't enough because the American lost the first nine
games under his stewardship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did lose a few,'' said MacPhail, no revisionist of history.
He made a comeback briefly two years ago at the game in Denver.
``When they picked me to be honorary captain,'' he related, ``I
said someone had failed to look up my record or else they figure
the law of averages would catch up with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Leonard Coleman, the last NL president, and Gene Budig, the last
AL chief, limited their pregame clubhouse visits to handshakes and
hellos. But they at least were in position where if they ever felt
the urge to erupt with verbal fire and brimstone, they would have
had the players' attention.
</P>
<P>
   No one in either league is in that kind of position today
because the leagues no longer have officials. Katy Feeney, in the
NL, and Phyllis Merhige, in the AL, could be viewed as the
highest-ranking league officials, which they became after the
departure of Coleman and Budig. But they don't work for the leagues
any more; they work for Major League Baseball. So even though each
has taken care of her ``league's'' team here, neither was inclined
to offer a pep talk Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have my father's erudition and charm,'' Feeney said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't and I won't,'' Merhige said.
</P>
<P>
   Bud Selig could speak to the teams. But he's the commissioner of
all of baseball. What's he supposed to do, go into the NL clubhouse
and tell the players there to beat the bejabbers out of the other
guys, then go to the AL clubhouse and urge the players there to do
the same thing to the players he spoke to five minutes earlier?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the managers could assume the role. On second thought,
their credibility might be strained. Bobby Cox, the NL, manager,
played in the American League, and Joe Torre, the AL manager,
played in the National League.
</P>
<P>
   What the game needs is a league lifer like Feeney. But the
leagues are on the wane, too. In the first 67 All-Star Games, when
a pitcher faced a batter, fans knew they were seeing the matchup
for the first time that season. When David Wells pitches against
Chipper Jones and Andres Galarraga in the first inning or two
Tuesday night, the encounters will look familiar. Jones and
Galarraga batted against Wells only five weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Interleague games come, league presidents go.

STEINBRENNER SAYS METS' PROTEST TAKES FOCUS OFF THEIR LOSING 
</HEADLINE>
   By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ George Steinbrenner says the Mets are a good team.
But he also wonders if they are good at spinning a story.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' principal owner suggested Monday that the Mets had
harped on the beaning of Mike Piazza and a contested umpire's call
over the weekend to draw attention from having lost four of six
games in the Subway Series this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I don't blame Bobby Valentine and the Mets for doing what
they did,'' Steinbrenner said. ``They had to take the focus off the
fact that they got their fannies handed to them this time _ this
time _ and they are a great team. I'm not sure it wasn't a very
wise public relations move for them to take the focus off the way
they were beaten.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Bobby Valentine and his people would love to take the
focus off of that, and have the people forget about the results. It
would probably be the same for us, if we lost. I'd probably be
trying to think about what I would do. I don't blame him for what
he's doing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets' director of media relations, Jay Horwitz, declined to
comment on Steinbrenner's remarks, or to reach Valentine, the Mets'
manager, for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees and Mets split two games played at Yankee Stadium
last month, and the Yankees won the first three games of the four
games over the weekend. But Roger Clemens' beaning of Piazza in the
second inning on Saturday night, which left Piazza with a
concussion and unavailable to play Sunday or in Tuesday night's
All-Star Game, dominated the talk.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza addressed the news media before Sunday's game and said he
believed Clemens threw at him intentionally _ as Valentine and
other members of the Mets organization maintained angrily on
Saturday, when Piazza was being examined at a hospital. Valentine
was also incensed by a rare interference call made against the Mets
in the first inning of the first game of Saturday's two-borough
doubleheader, arguing until he was ejected and then protesting the
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bobby Valentine is a good manager,'' Steinbrenner said. ``He's
also a smart PR guy. He knows there were rumors about his position,
and he came in looking for a big series. I'm sure they were just a
little frustrated, and the frustration all caught up with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a very, very fine team, but so do we. They came in
really looking to try to prove something to us, and the facts of
the matter are it didn't happen. We won the city championship, if
that means anything. We won four out of six games, and that's
pretty convincing, especially against a team as good as they are.''
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner said he was sure Clemens did not try to injure
Piazza. ``The fastball pitchers, they have to live inside,''
Steinbrenner said. ``Look at Pedro Martinez _ he's hit 11 men this
year, almost twice as many as Roger. Roger lives inside. But to say
he intentionally threw at him _ no way. I know Roger, I know he's a
family guy who loves his kids, and there's no way a future Hall of
Famer like him is going to try to hurt somebody.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike Piazza is one of the best players in the history of the
game. We're sorry for Mike, we're sorry it happened. Now let's get
the focus back on the games. I'm sorry this happened. It took away
from the real results of what happened. If they don't get over
this, I feel sorry for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Phillips, the Mets' general manager, would not allow the
Yankees to use the Mets' workout room at Shea Stadium Sunday
because it is part of the Mets' clubhouse and Phillips said he
wanted to eliminate the chance of confrontation. Folks in baseball
have long memories, Phillips said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have long memories, too,'' said Steinbrenner, who did not
disagree with Phillips' decision about the workout room. ``I think
some of it might have been frustration on Phillips' part. I think
that they pointed to this series more than possibly we did. We had
not been playing good baseball coming into this series, and they
had two or three great pitchers ready to go against us. We had been
in some disarray, and we pulled together for this. They had to be
somewhat frustrated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody would take that easy. Nobody. I'm a poor loser, and I
don't know how I would react.''

<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. - The practical man got soaked last week.
</P>
<P>
   At the movies.
</P>
<P>
   He thought he was going to see ``The Perfect Storm `` _ a
tough-minded sea-going tragedy based on a gripping book of the same
name. But it turned out to be ``The Perfect Corn'' _ a sappy
sea-going snoozer based on a dozen other cheesy melodramas he's
moped through in his moviegoing life.
</P>
<P>
   The practical man hasn't time to enumerate the innumerable
stupidities in this fetid flick, which somehow manages to turn the
tragic tale of six swordfishermen wiped out by a 100-foot wave into
a perfect bore. But two things really bugged him.
</P>
<P>
   First, there were no fishing tips. For the love of God, in a
film about pro anglers, you'd think the moviemaker could cough up
at least one clue on how to catch big fish. But no. ``The Perfect
Storm'' is perfectly silent on the bread-and-butter business of its
protagonists. What bait do you use? What rig? What is
``longlining'' anyway? Instead of answers, we see guys tossing
6-foot bobbers in the drink and then magically yanking in fish big
enough to feed a family for a month. Sketchy info like that doesn't
do you much good on the Lake Worth Pier.
</P>
<P>
   Second, it made him giggle. That was because the doomed
swordboat crew, captained by some handsome but untalented TV actor,
laughs in the face of death _ over and over again. Faced with dire
warnings that a killer storm approaches, they guffaw, slap each
other on the back and sail on. Impossibly surrounded by snarling
seas, they cackle fiendishly at every murderous, mountainous wave.
With their boat capsized and death imminent, they make dark jokes.
</P>
<P>
   Like pro wrestling, such romantic rot often entertains the
practical man, for few things are funnier than pathetic macho
fantasies. Thus, he generally gives four stars to sidesplitting
comedies such as ``Terminator,'' ``Rambo `` and anything with Jean
Claude Van Damme, for they generally generate a howl a minute.
</P>
<P>
   But while it's OK to laugh at moronic machismo in the abstract,
``The Perfect Storm'' is about real people. To his chagrin, the
practical man found himself chortling like a chucklehead every time
the valiant crew stared down death with a sneer and a swagger. He
couldn't help it. When the haggard hero, hopelessly doomed, puts on
the handsome face and hisses his hackneyed war cry _ ``This is
where we separate the men from the boys!'' _ that's comedy.
</P>
<P>
   And that was the problem, for the practical man didn't want
funny. He wanted truth. He wanted to know what kind of pride or
greed or stupidity or bad luck put those poor schmoes in the middle
of the worst storm of the century. And he wanted some insight into
what they were really doing and feeling when they knew they were
about to die. The practical man once had a gun held to his head
during a carjacking, so you can trust him: They weren't laughing.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Practical Man: My wife, in my opinion, spends far too much
money and time acquiring all sorts of unctions and potions and goo
for her hair, skin, feet, cuticles, eyelashes, nail beds, the list
goes on. She says it's fun; I say it's frivolous. She says
frivolous is fun. I say fun is overrated. I have a feeling you'll
side with me, but you may have better luck setting her straight.
</P>
<P>
   Slow down, Slim! You're asking at least three questions in one.
But the practical man is in a generous mood. He'll answer them all.
</P>
<P>
   First, you're right. Cosmetics are a waste of time and money,
for they serve no practical purpose. In theory, your wife is
dropping dough to make herself more attractive (presumably to you),
but as you know, the opposite results. Instead of a soft angel
offering you the sweet succulence of flesh on flesh, your gooped-up
bride becomes a greased pig extending an odious invitation to slip
on slime. Nauseated, you pass. Hurt, she counters with more gunk _
and back and forth you go ... it's a sad old story the practical
man is powerless to rectify.
</P>
<P>
   Second, she's right. Frivolous is fun _ if you're 6 years old.
It's not fun if your brain is firing on all cylinders, for any sane
person hates to squander time on stupid stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the practical man never believes people who justify idiocy
by appealing to frivolous fun. They claim lighthearted, childlike
innocence trumps practicality, but of course childlike innocence in
an adult is a sign of mental deficiency, not moral superiority.
Assuming your wife if not deficient, the practical man must
conclude she's invoking frivolous fun to mask the painful truth:
She's addicted to cosmetics because she's either grotesquely vain
or grossly insecure.
</P>
<P>
   Third, you're wrong. Fun isn't overrated. Doing what makes you
happy is the greatest thing in life, the goal of human existence.
But fun takes lots of forms, from downright destructive to yes,
practical.
</P>
<P>
   Smoking cigarettes, as the practical man knows all too well, is
fun. And fun to a serial killer is something few like to think
about.
</P>
<P>
   More benign activities _ like swinging on a swingset, playing
touch football, watching TV, and OK, even gallivanting with goo _
are fun for some people as well, and the practical man will indulge
in similar pastimes in a pinch. But he generally avoids fleeting
fun because it lacks substance and staying power. Once you get off
the swing, the fun is done. Instead, he goes for fun that has some
purpose beyond immediate pleasure and continues to satisfy _
pumping iron or building things, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   So argue your case against makeup this way. Yes dear, you could
do worse than play with makeup. You could, for instance, get your
jollies from banging me over the head with kitchen utensils. But
you could also do better. If, for example, you spent your extra
money and time gardening, or learning to play an instrument, or
fooling with the kids, you'd not only have fun while it lasted.
You'd also have satisfaction that lasts.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Practical Man: What do you think of parents who bring
little kids to R-rated movies? Every time I go to one, I see at
least a few kids under 10 in the audience, and my brother routinely
takes his 7-year-old to anything _ ``Gladiator,'' ``Shaft'' -
whatever my brother wants to see. Is that wise?
</P>
<P>
   No, it's not wise. It's lazy and selfish. What young child wants
to see a movie full of sex, sawed-off shotguns and swear words when
Disney is still choking theaters with kid-pleasers? Your brother
and his ilk sound like the same folks who force 5-year-olds to play
chess, switch off ``Rugrats'' to watch Dan Rather, take tykes out
on the golf course and vacation with them in New York and Las
Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   They need to suck it up and face facts: Parents don't get to do
what they want. If you're going to play, it's going to be on the
floor. If you're going out of town, you're going to Orlando. And if
you're going to a movie, it's going to have an action figure or
singing mermaid or talking lion in it.
</P>
<P>
   If you break these rules, you're a lousy parent and you're going
to hear about it big time _ when Franky says the f-word in front of
Grandma.

 BUG HAS WINERY ON THE MOVE  &HT;     By PETER SINTON 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A little brown bug known as the glassy-winged
sharpshooter is not only devastating vineyards, it is uprooting
entire wineries.
</P>
<P>
   Callaway Winery, Southern California's largest wine producer,
said Monday that it is shifting its main source of grapes from
Temecula Valley, Calif., near San Diego, northward to California's
Central Coast. A major reason is that sharpshooters are spreading a
devastating bacteria known as Pierce's disease as they suck sap
from succulent grape vines. Callaway, which produces 250,000 cases
of wine a year, has lost 120 of its 720 acres to the incurable
disease.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a recent emergency pledge of $22 million by the federal
government to fight the pest, Callaway spokesman George Rose said,
``The problem is not going to get better anytime soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Callaway cites pressures of commercial and residential growth in
Riverside County, Calif., as well as Pierce's disease for becoming
a major buyer of grapes from Santa Barbara to Monterey. Last year,
Callaway bought about 40 percent of its grapes from the Central
Coast. Rose expects the figure to rise to 60 percent this year and
75 percent in 2001. The winery, a unit of Allied Dome Wines USA, is
interested in buying vineyards as well as signing long-term
contracts with independent grape growers.
</P>
<P>
   A problem for vintners around the state is that Pierce's disease
is not limited to Temecula Valley. The glassy-winged sharpshooter
has jumped and hitchhiked to at least 10 California counties,
including Alameda, Contra Costa, Napa, Sacramento, San Joaquin and
Sonoma.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst-case scenario is that Pierce's disease could wipe
out the whole coastal crop within five years,'' said Jon
Fredrikson, a wine industry economist in San Francisco. However,
pesticides are often effective against the carrier of the disease
and the state is expected to implement tough inspection and
eradication measures.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the sharpshooter and a 115-degree heat wave that fried
some North Coast grapes one day last month, grape broker Barry
Bedwell expects that generally healthy growing conditions and
40,000 acres of new plantings could generate a record California
wine grape harvest. He estimates a 3.2 million-ton crop this year,
about 10 percent more than the 1997 2.9 million-ton bumper crop.

 CHIRON DRUG MAY FIGHT AIDS  &HT;     By TOM ABATE 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Shares of Chiron Corp. continued a five-day
surge Monday after the Emeryville, Calif., company said that an
influential medical journal will publish a study showing that one
of its cancer-fighting drugs also seems to greatly strengthen the
immune systems of people with AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Chiron's findings about the effectiveness of Proleukin as an
AIDS treatment were first reported at a scientific conference last
year, but the significance of the study was underscored this
weekend at the international AIDS conference in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Jim McCamant, editor of the Medical Technology Stock Letter in
Berkeley, Calif., said publication of the study in the Journal of
the American Medical Association could encourage more physicians to
prescribe Proleukin as a supplement to current anti-AIDS drugs, and
yield more sales for Chiron.
</P>
<P>
   Chiron stock gained 4 percent yesterday to close at $59.13,
extending a run that has added 24 percent to the value of Chiron
shares since June 30.
</P>
<P>
   McCamant said Chiron has surged on rumors that it is close to
settling a patent dispute with Roche Molecular Systems Inc. over
certain diagnostic tests technology. McCamant said Wall Street
believes Chiron will get a large payment and ``significant
royalties.''
</P>
<P>
   A Chiron spokeswoman declined comment and Roche officials did
not return calls.
</P>
<P>
   Chiron has already begun the final stages of clinical tests on
Proleukin for U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval of the
drug as an AIDS remedy.
</P>
<P>
   If that were to occur, FDA approval would enlarge the market for
Proleukin, clearing the way for patients to get insurance to pay
for the drug.
</P>
<P>
   Chiron clinical director Bruce Scharschmidt said Proleukin,
which was approved in 1992 to fight kidney cancer and OKd in 1998
as a therapy for melanoma, seems to fight cancers by increasing the
potency of the patient's immune system.
</P>
<P>
   The study that will appear in JAMA asked if Proleukin could also
help people with AIDS. Chiron tracked 78 AIDS patients, half of
whom got Proleukin in addition to other AIDS drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The Proleukin group experienced a 112 percent increase in the
number of disease-fighting T-cells, a key measure of immune system
strength. This compared with an 18 percent increase in T-cell count
among those who used standard AIDS therapies.
</P>
<P>
   But, Scharschmidt said, the 78-person study tracked patients who
already had moderately strong immune systems, as indicated by
T-cell counts above 200.
</P>
<P>
   The latest study will seek to enroll up to 1,400 patients with
T-cell counts as low as 50, to determine whether Proleukin can
strengthen these very weak immune systems and buy AIDS patients
more time.
</P>
<P>
   Chiron's Proleukin news, along with other reports coming out of
the AIDS conference, boosted biotech stocks, which have been
staging a summer rally despite weakness in the technology sector.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, the American Stock Exchange biotech stock index, a
basket of 17 large companies that includes Chiron, eked out a gain
of just under 1 percent while the tech-weighted Nasdaq sank 1
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Although that difference is small, analysts took yesterday's
results as another sign that biotech is beginning to win back the
independent momentum it enjoyed before March, when a crash in
Nasdaq caused biotech stocks to plunge.
</P>
<P>
   According to BioCentury, the San Carlos, Calif., industry
newsletter, biotech stocks have gained 59 percent during the last
six weeks. Year to date, the 200 stocks in one closely watched
biotech stock index have gained 51 percent. By comparison, the
Nasdaq is still down 2 percent from from its December 31 close.

 FTC ALLEGES DECEPTION BY TOYSMART.COM   &HT;     By CAROLYN SAID  
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Federal Trade Commission on Monday sued
Toysmart.com to stop the bankrupt toy e-tailer from selling names
and other personal information about its customers.
</P>
<P>
   The Toysmart case comes as a wave of consolidations and company
failures is roiling the e-commerce market. Privacy advocates fear
that other dot-com companies under financial pressure also might
choose to sell customer information.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most valuable asset these companies have isn't their
warehouses and PCs; it's the data they have collected,'' said David
Steer, spokesman for TRUSTe, which issues seals to online companies
that have privacy policies. ``There will be temptation for them to
sell that data.''
</P>
<P>
   Toysmart of Waltham, Mass., which is 60 percent owned by the
Walt Disney Co., ceased operations in mid-May. After seeking
federal bankruptcy protection, it advertised assets for sale,
including the customer lists.
</P>
<P>
   Its customer roster contains home addresses, e-mail addresses,
phone numbers, transaction history and family profiles, such as
children's birth dates. Customers who provided the data were told,
``You can rest assured that your information will never be shared
with a third party.''
</P>
<P>
   David Medine, FTC associate director for financial practices,
said the agency stepped in to send a message to consumers ``that we
are policing Web sites' adherence to their privacy policies. This
is all about developing consumer confidence in e-commerce.''
</P>
<P>
   The FTC's complaint, filed in U.S. District Court in Boston,
charges Toysmart with unfair or deceptive acts for failing to live
up to its stated privacy policy.
</P>
<P>
   Online privacy is now largely a voluntary effort. TRUSTe has
issued seals to some 2,000 Web sites, ranging from e-tailers to
media sites to children's sites. To earn the seal, sites must have
a written policy that discloses what information they collect and
who they share it with; offer a way for consumers to ``opt out'' of
sharing their data and correct inaccurate data; and provide
security tools to protect the data.
</P>
<P>
   Companies that share data with third parties can earn the TRUSTe
seal as long as they disclose that practice.
</P>
<P>
   Toysmart had pledged never to share data and earned the TRUSTe
seal on that basis. So TRUSTe filed a complaint with the FTC,
spurring yesterday's actions. TRUSTe also plans to file a brief in
bankruptcy court arguing against sale of the customer lists.
``Toysmart is hiding behind the veil of bankruptcy to try to
hoodwink their customers,'' Steer said.
</P>
<P>
   Medine of the FTC said the agency is in negotiations with
Toysmart and may reach a resolution before the July 26 bankruptcy
sale. The FTC would accept another firm taking over Toysmart and
reinstating its business, as long as that firm agreed to abide by
the privacy policy, Medine said. ``We're not shutting the door and
saying they can't sell to anyone; just not (the customer lists) as
a discrete asset,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Medine declined comment on whether the FTC is investigating
other recent failed e-tailers that have already sold their customer
lists. Emeryville's Petstore.com last month sold selected assets,
including its customer list, to San Francisco's Pets.com. Britain's
Boo.com sold its customer database and other assets to
Fashionmall.com.
</P>
<P>
   TRUSTe's Steer said his group is reviewing matters at Boo.com,
which was a TRUSTe member. Petstore was not.
</P>
<P>
   Some privacy advocates said the Toysmart situation proves that
self-regulation doesn't work. ``Legislation is definitely needed,''
said Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy
Information Center, a Washington, D.C., public interest research
group. ``The FTC is taking a baling-wire-and-scotch-tape approach
to privacy protection. This is too hit-or-miss.''
</P>
<P>
   Rotenberg said he is optimistic that the next session of
Congress will address the issue.
</P>
<P>
   In May and June, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., held committee
meetings on Internet privacy. Rep. Spencer Bachus, R-Ala., plans to
introduce a bill this week that would forbid bankrupt companies
from sharing information they had pledged to keep private.

 HOT SEMICONDUCTOR SALES BRING SMILES TO TRADE SHOW  &HT;     By HENRY NORR 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Heartened by a year of strong growth but
frustrated by the battering they have taken from Wall Street in
recent months, makers of semiconductor equipment and material _ the
companies that supply production machinery and materials to others
that actually produce chips _ gathered in San Francisco on Monday
for the opening of the annual Semicon West trade show.
</P>
<P>
   Worldwide, semiconductor capital equipment sales rose 18.4
percent last year to a total of $25.5 billion, according to
Semiconductor Equipment and Materials International, the trade
association that sponsors the event. That was a welcome change from
1998, when the comparable figure plunged 22 percent; or the
previous two years, when the annual growth figures were less than
10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The strongest growth for the equipment-makers last year,
according to the association's figures, came from a recovering
South Korea, where sales were up more than 60 percent, and Taiwan,
which recorded 40 percent growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The numbers aren't good _ they're fantastic,'' said Mark
Fitzgerald, who tracks the industry for Bank of America Securities
in San Francisco. ``There are a lot of happy faces around here this
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the companies that make up the industry watched their
stock prices soar from last summer until about April of this year.
Many of them, including such industry leaders as Applied Materials,
KLA-Tencor and Novellus, were up roughly threefold.
</P>
<P>
   After that, however, the tech panic that began in the dot-com
sector spread to the semiconductor equipment sector, even though
its major players are well-established companies with seasoned
management, real products, actual profits and strong prospects.
Many of these companies have seen their share prices plummet by a
third over the past three or four months.
</P>
<P>
   Industry leaders and analysts say they are confident, though,
that the fundamentals of their business are still solid. ``Believe
you me, there's no evidence of a slowdown, none,'' said Fitzerald.
The association itself forecasts that equipment sales will nearly
double, to $48.4 billion, by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgerald warned, though, that the industry hasn't completely
overcome its boom-and-bust history. ``I see a lot of upside for the
rest of this year, but the risk starts to build in the second half
of 2001.''
</P>
<P>
   On the show floor, the watchword this year was ``300
millimeter,'' the emerging standard _ roughly 12 inches _ for the
diameter of the silicon wafers from which chips are built. Since
the mid-1980s, most chips have been made from 200mm _ 8-inch _
wafers. Industry leaders began planning a shift to 300mm more than
five years ago. They originally predicted that the transition would
be well under way by now, but it was delayed because chipmakers
hesitated at the high cost of replacing nearly all the equipment in
their plants, or ``fabs'' as they are called in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   A 300mm wafer has 225 percent the area of 200mm chip, making it
possible for chipmakers to increase the number of chips per wafer
by at least by a factor of about 2.5. On the other hand, a new fab
that would cost $500 million with 200mm equipment will cost roughly
five times as much with machines to handle the larger wafers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem,'' said James Morgan, chief executive officer of
Applied Materials, the equipment industry giant, ``was that all of
our customers wanted to be second with a 300mm fab _ no one wanted
to be first.'' Last year, however, Intel signalled its commitment
to proceed with the changeover, and since then, the rest of the
industry has fallen into line.
</P>
<P>
   Applied on Monday announced 21 new machines for 300mm
manufacturing. The company said its 300mm products encompass almost
75 percent of the processes needed to produce state-of-the-art
processors.
</P>
<P>
   The company, however, continues to face stiff competition from a
variety of smaller, more specialized players.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Novellus Systems, a San Jose company that focuses
on machines that deposit the thin films of chemicals that make up a
chip, announced a new 300mm unit that elicited enthusiasm from
analysts and potential customers. Unlike most 300mm machines, the
new one, called Vector, is smaller and already cheaper than current
200mm equivalents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vector will be huge,'' said Fitzgerald. ``It's a
category-killing product _ in terms of bang for the buck, there's
nothing else like it.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the 30th year for Semicon West. Until 1992, it was held
in modest quarters at the San Mateo (Calif.) Fairgrounds. This
year, it fills all available space at both San Francisco's Moscone
Center, where it will continue through Tuesday, and at the San Jose
Convention Center, where it will run Tuesday through Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Attendance is expected to top last year's record of 67,729,
making the show the San Francisco Bay Area's largest. Association
officials last year toyed with moving it to Las Vegas, out of fear
that the Bay Area wouldn't be able to handle its growth but have
decided to keep it here.

 FIBER FIRMS IN $41 BILLION STOCK DEAL  &HT;     By TODD WALLACK 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ JDS Uniphase, already the 800-pound gorilla of
fiber-optics-components-makers, is putting on more weight.
</P>
<P>
   Just two weeks after buying E-Tek Dynamics for $15 billion, JDS
unveiled plans Monday to buy crosstown rival SDL Inc. for a
stunning $41 billion in stock. All three companies are based in San
Jose, though JDS has a second headquarters in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, one of the largest technology mergers ever,
underscores the race to build increasingly faster networks, using
beams of light instead of streams of electrons, to power the
Internet and zap everything from phone calls to movies around the
world. A strand of glassy fiber, the width of a human hair, can
carry data at speeds 10 to 100 times faster over long distances
than a conventional communications cable, said SDL chief executive
Donald Scifres. Instead of pouring money into dot-coms, investors
have increasingly shifted their focus to fiber optics.
</P>
<P>
   Component-makers like JDS and SDL produce parts like tiny lasers
smaller than the point of a pen and amplifiers to strengthen the
signal along the way.
</P>
<P>
   But fiber-optics-components firms have struggled to keep up with
demand from telecommunications-equipment-makers, like Cisco
Systems, Lucent Technologies and Nortel Networks. Those companies
in turn build the equipment used mainly by telephone companies and
Internet service providers.
</P>
<P>
   By combining, JDS and SDL executives say they can shift around
scarce supplies and people and boost capacity to keep up with
skyrocketing demand.
</P>
<P>
   But Wall Street signaled it was too early to uncork the
champagne. JDS shares fell 13 percent yesterday to $101.13, down
$15.06, on concern that JDS paid too much or that antitrust
regulators will torpedo the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Justice Department held up JDS' purchase of E-Tek
for five months before approving it _ with conditions _ on June 22.
</P>
<P>
   This time, analysts say, JDS will likely face even more
scrutiny. ``There is certainly a bit of uncertainty surrounding the
deal,'' said Bill Gorman, an analyst with PNC Advisors.
</P>
<P>
   Both Gorman and J.P. Morgan analyst Charlie Willhoit said they
figured the deal had better than a 50 percent chance of getting
approved, but approval is by no means assured. Gorman said a key
factor is whether customers like Nortel object. ``If none of the
big equipment providers have a problem with it, I don't know why
the Justice Department would,'' Gorman said. JDS predicted it will
complete the deal by December.
</P>
<P>
   Another issue is price. JDS offered SDL 3.8 million shares, or
$441.51 per share, a 49 percent premium over Friday's closing
price. Analysts said the deal may have been unusually sweet because
SDL was already in negotiations with other players, including
Corning. ``There were a number of suitors,'' said SDL's Scifres, in
a telephone interview from a plane bound for New York. JDS appears
to have come late to the table because it was tied up with the
E-Tek acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   But the moment the E-Tek deal closed, Scifres said he called JDS
chief executive Jozef Straus to see if he was interested in making
a bid. In addition to being a competitor, JDS is also a major
customer, buying pump lasers, a key part in the amplifiers JDS
builds to boost the intensity of light beams.
</P>
<P>
   Less than 10 days after the phone call, JDS and DSL executives
hammered out a deal at a luxury hotel near San Francisco
International Airport. Two San Francisco investment banks advised
the companies.
</P>
<P>
   Bank of America Securities, formerly Montgomery Securities,
acted as co-adviser to JDS, a coup for an investment banking
operation that had been hurt by defections of key employees. And
Thomas Weisel Partners, founded by the former chief executive of
Montgomery Securities a year-and-a-half ago, took a big step into
the big leagues by representing SDL.
</P>
<P>
   Corning spokesman Paul Rogoski said his company walked away from
a deal because it thought the bidding had become too steep.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the high price, JDS and SDL executives insist the
deal will help fuel growth and immediately add to profits.
``There's a lot of upside,'' J.P. Morgan's Willhoit said.
</P>
<P>
   JDS is already the largest stand-alone fiber-optics firm with
17,000 employees, while SDL is second with 1,700, including 800 in
the Bay Area. No job cuts are expected.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from Corning and startups, JDS will mostly face
competition with larger companies with fiber-optics parts
divisions, such as Nortel and Lucent.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, the SDL deal is massive. The record for a pure tech
acquisition was set last year when Lucent paid $25 billion for
Ascend Communications, though there are some larger deals involving
tech firms. America Online's engagement with Time Warner was pegged
at $145 billion when it was announced.

 &HT;    For the love of Lilly
 &HT;    By Heather Graulich
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ It's a hot one in Palm Beach, but Lilly
Pulitzer Rousseau is keeping cool at home, her island retreat with
the thick tropical jungle, the one she playfully calls ``the Palm
Beach Taj.''
</P>
<P>
   There's going to be a party on this night to celebrate some
family birthdays, and she plans to be ready for a summery fiesta,
right down to the margarita machine.
</P>
<P>
   These are the days Lilly loves in Palm Beach; sleepy, sultry and
full of sunshine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I live behind my jungle,'' says Lilly, a fixture on the island
and in the world of fashion for more than 40 years. ``It's like
(Palm Beach) has been discovered. It's a little overcrowded for me.
That's why I love summer _ you can't pry me out of here with a
stick.''
</P>
<P>
   So it's appropriate that starting next month, in the depths of
summer's steaminess, fans of Lilly Pulitzer's bright and bold
designs will be able to buy her first collection for the home: a
line of luxury linens for bed and bath featuring her signature hot
pinks and cool greens.
</P>
<P>
   The line is being manufactured by Dan River and will be
available at selected stores, including Pioneer Linens in West Palm
Beach and C. Orrico in Palm Beach. There are six mix-and-match
patterns, including one called ``Palm Beach,'' with prices ranging
from $38 for a washcloth to $600 for a king-size duvet cover.
</P>
<P>
   It's a dream come true for Lilly, 68, who says she's wanted to
launch a home collection for years but never did, largely because
it was such a completely different process than clothing
production, requiring different fabrics and factories.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always, always craved pretty sheets,'' she says. ``But I
didn't know how to go about (manufacturing) them. I have never been
so happy to see anything follow through in my life. I think we've
been overdue for sheets. Lilly has been everywhere but in the
bedroom.''
</P>
<P>
   In truth, Lilly has been everywhere and back, and then some.
</P>
<P>
   While she was married to Peter Pulitzer _ who would later make
headlines during his scandalous divorce from second wife Roxanne _
Lilly Pulitzer ran a small citrus shop in Via Mizner. It was the
early '60s, and Pulitzer wanted some simple shifts for work that
would fit comfortably and hide juice stains. She bought bright,
loud-print fabric at Woolworth's and hired a seamstress to create
dresses to her specifications: straight cut, side slits with bows
atop them, lace tape on the hems.
</P>
<P>
   Customers loved the dresses as much as the fruit, so Lilly began
selling them in the shop. They became wildly popular, and the
citrus business eventually morphed into a clothing company with
more than 30 stores nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   That lasted until the mid-'80s, when a combination of factors
sent the company into bankruptcy. Basically, she had opened shops
when friends needed jobs, not necessarily because her friends lived
in good markets for Lilly stores. And her summery prints fell out
of favor during the '80s heyday of serious, big-shouldered
corporate attire.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1994, with '60s and '70s nostalgia booming, Sugartown
Worldwide bought the licensing rights to the Lilly Pulitzer label
and relaunched the clothing line, with Pulitzer lending her
expertise as a ``consultant-plus-plus.''
</P>
<P>
   After some initial hesitation (Lilly devotees rejected the
company's early attempts to revive the line with more sedate
colors), the line took off _ again. In no time, Lillys had found
their way back to Palm Beach and the Hamptons as the warm-weather
frock of choice.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it appears, the time is ripe for even more Lilly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Home fashion follows the fashion world, that's just the way it
is,'' says Penny Murphy, vice president of Pioneer Linens. ``And
people are ready for color. Things have been tone-on-tone for so
long.''
</P>
<P>
   Personally, Murphy can't wait for the Lilly home line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up with Lilly and all the Lilly skirts,'' she says. ``I
have a pair of the old bell-bottoms that I just could never part
with, in the green and the pink. Lilly is just Palm Beach. A few
years ago, everything was Rodeo Drive. Then it was South Beach. And
now it's Palm Beach.''
</P>
<P>
   And when it comes to Palm Beach style icons, it's hard to top
Lilly, who _ no surprise here _ likes things bright and cheerful in
her own bedroom. ``I love lots of windows, very airy, cool,
overhead fans, no curtains and tile on the floors. I like to see,
to wake up with the light and look out at the trees. I don't like
being hermetically sealed.''
</P>
<P>
   There's certainly nothing stuffy about the new home prints,
which should sell well to Lilly lovers everywhere, says Casey
Orrico of C. Orrico. The Palm Beach boutique has always carried
Lilly clothing, but the Orricos were inspired by her new home
collection to add 1,000 square feet for linens and accessories.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (Lilly) is going to sell in Florida as a master
bedroom, but in the rest of the country as a guest bedroom or
summer home,'' says Orrico, who is decorating two of her own guest
rooms and her main bathroom in Lilly. ``But I don't know _ people
are such Lilly freaks right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Which all comes as a wonderful surprise to Lilly herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am totally speechless,'' she says of her refound success.
``How can anything go on that long? All it does is get bigger and
better and more fun, and brighter and cuter. It's amazing.''

 MONEYBAG: STOCK SPLIT, DIVIDEND 2 NAMES FOR SAME GAME  &HT;     By ARTHUR M. LOUIS 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Q: In January I received what was described as a 10 percent ``stock
dividend'' from Consolidated Products. I wound up with 11 shares
for every 10 I held before. Is this the same as a stock split, or
is there some distinction that requires me to adjust the cost basis
of my shares differently than I would with a stock split?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: A stock split and a stock dividend are essentially the same. You
wind up with more shares, and you adjust the cost basis per share
by dividing the increased share total into the amount you paid for
the stock.
</P>
<P>
   The term ``stock split'' usually is reserved for occasions when
the shareholder receives at least five shares for every four held.
A 5-for-4 stock split could also be called a 25 percent stock
dividend, but under common usage it normally is not. Exchanges of 4
for 3, 3 for 2, 2 for 1 and upward also are called stock splits.
</P>
<P>
   The 10 percent stock dividend you received also could be called
an 11-for-10 split. A 2 percent stock dividend could be called a
51-for-50 split _ but that seems silly.
</P>
<P>
   Any stock split of less than 2 for 1 could pose tax
complications, because it could involve fractional shares. For
example, when you got your 10 percent stock dividend from
Consolidated Products, if you originally held 125 shares, you
theoretically were entitled to receive 12.5 shares more, for a
total of 137.5.
</P>
<P>
   Most companies will not issue fractional shares. Instead, in the
example above, you would wind up with 137 shares, and the company
would give you the cash value of the remaining half share. In such
cases, the cash usually is taxable as ordinary income _ not as a
capital gain. But you should always check with the company about
the appropriate tax treatment of the fractional share and how the
cash payout will affect the cost basis of the remaining shares.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Weighing Options
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Q: I have a job as a customer-service assistant but am considering
going back to school to finish my degree in computers. It would
take two or three years to finish the degree if I attend school
full time, and it will cost about $20,000 in tuition, fees and
other expenses. Do you think I should quit my job?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: If I were a computer myself, I would reply, in a robotic voice:
``Insufficient data.''
</P>
<P>
   To answer your question with confidence, I would need to know
your age, your present compensation and the compensation you could
expect if you finish school and change your line of work.
</P>
<P>
   If you are near retirement age _ which I doubt _ then it
probably wouldn't be worth the bother. If you are just starting out
and have the opportunity to significantly improve your pay, then
you probably ought to go for it.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps you can work out the mathematics yourself. How much more
per year can you earn for the rest of your working life by
switching fields? Multiply that figure by the number of years that
will be left to retirement once you get your degree. Then, subtract
two or three years of your present salary and the $20,000 education
cost.
</P>
<P>
   However, one essential fact shines through: You aren't satisfied
with your current line of work. If you would be much happier in
computers, that counts for a lot in peace of mind alone.
</P>
<P>
   (I hope I can say that without getting into a territorial
dispute with Dear Abby.)
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Bargaining With Your Broker
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Q: Until recently I owned 250 shares of a high-technology stock,
purchased at $16.50 per share. When its price reached the high $20s
after three months, I placed an order with my full-service broker _
good until canceled _ to sell at $32 per share or better. The price
shot up that week, finishing on Friday at $31.94.
</P>
<P>
   I then had second thoughts, figuring that the stock could rise
much more, so I called my broker to cancel the order. He had gone
for the weekend, so I left the message on his voice mail. On
Monday, he called to tell me that he had arrived late at the
office, and that my stock had been sold at $32. It has since gone
up several more points. Is there some way I can get the broker to
cancel the sale and restore the stock to my account?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: I think you can make a case that what happened was the broker's
fault. It's worth a try.
</P>
<P>
   Your first step should be to write a formal letter to the
manager of the branch where you have your account, explaining what
happened. Ask to have your stock restored.
</P>
<P>
   You should send copies of the letter to the National Association
of Securities Dealers _ a self-regulatory industry group _ and to
the state Department of Corporations, which regulates corporations
doing business in California.
</P>
<P>
   It also might help to send a copy to the Securities and Exchange
Commission. While the SEC normally doesn't get involved unless a
broker violates securities laws or regulations, the legend ``cc:
Securities and Exchange Commission'' at the bottom of your letter
could intimidate the branch manager, particularly if he believes
that his employee goofed.
</P>
<P>
   However, the manager may hang tough and insist that the matter
be taken to arbitration. The standard contract between brokers and
their customers mandates that unresolved disputes must be settled
by arbitration, rather than lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, your plight provides yet another argument against
using live, full-service brokers and in favor of trading online.
The main advantage of online trading is that the commissions are
generally lower. Now we also are reminded that computers don't get
to the office late.

 CONSUMERS RACKING UP AIR MILEAGE  &HT;     By BENNY EVANGELISTA 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ David Phillips has taken extraordinary steps to
earn more than 2 million frequent-flier miles. He once peeled the
labels off 12,150 cans of chocolate pudding to cash in on a special
promotion.
</P>
<P>
   He's also had to resort to some fancy footwork to use those free
trips, like when he treated his family to a vacation in Italy this
spring.
</P>
<P>
   To get around the limited seating and other restrictions the
airlines have erected around frequent-flier programs, they had to
endure a grueling 20-hour journey that took them first from
Sacramento to Dallas, before a connecting flight to Newark, N.J.
They then continued on across the Atlantic to London before
completing the last leg to Milan.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the dirty little secret, the problem with these
frequent-flier programs,'' said Phillips, a civil engineer for the
University of California at Davis. ``It's not impossible, but they
sure make it difficult for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips may be an extreme example of frequent-flier mania.
Today, travel experts say the average person no longer has to rely
solely on frequent-flier points for free airline trips.
</P>
<P>
   That's because a growing number of incentive programs now award
mileage points based on credit card purchases of consumer goods.
Experts say that in the next few years, more free flights will be
booked by frequent buyers than frequent fliers.
</P>
<P>
   But the hard part for consumers is finding ways to get the most
value from those points.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no trouble at all getting frequent-flier seats from San
Francisco to Dallas, but that's not a very good use of your
mileage,'' said Ed Perkins, a longtime consumer travel advocate who
now works for the American Society of Travel Agents.
</P>
<P>
   Perkins said consumers should treat their frequent-flier points
like money. In this regard, it pays to study how the airlines and
frequent-flier programs work.
</P>
<P>
   Two decades ago, American Airlines pioneered the frequent-flier
concept to build loyalty by simply rewarding customers who flew
tens or hundreds of thousands of miles per year with free trips.
</P>
<P>
   In the past five years, banks and Web-based programs that award
mileage points for credit card purchases have transformed frequent
flying programs into frequent buying clubs.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Purchasing Power
</P>
<P>
   Last year, more than half the frequent-flier trips awarded by
American, which has about 40 million AAdvantage members, came from
points earned from nonflying sources such as programs tied to
credit card use, said Randy Petersen, the renowned ``guru'' of
frequent-flier programs.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the airline industry will be hitting that level in
the next two or three years, said Petersen, publisher of Inside
Flyer magazine, which also operates the consumer-oriented Web site
 &LR; www.flyertalk.com &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   There are about 90 different frequent-flier awards programs
around the world, he said. Mileage points have become like currency
for an estimated 61 million frequent-flier members in the United
States alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a number of people I know that literally will not
take a vacation unless it comes from redeeming their points,''
Petersen said.
</P>
<P>
   The skies are full of stories about consumers doing wild stunts
to take advantage of loopholes in frequent-flier promotions and
rack up points.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips, for example, became nationally known earlier this year
as the Pudding Man because he took advantage of an offer from
Healthy Choice brand foods that offered 500 frequent-flier miles
for every 10 Healthy Choice brand food products purchased.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips bought 12,150 cups of Healthy Choice pudding for 25
cents per cup, clipped the proof-of-purchase coupons from the label
and donated the pudding to food banks in his area.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mileage programs are the crack cocaine of the travel
industry,'' said consumer travel advocate Christopher Elliott.
``People do the most bizarre things for frequent-flier miles. They
collect them faster than they can spend them.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A Growing Demand
</P>
<P>
   And that's one of the problems. The growing demand for
frequent-flier seats is outpacing the number of seats designated
for those trips, especially for more popular destintions.
</P>
<P>
   Major airlines traditionally set aside only a small percentage
of seats, as low as 7 or 8 percent according to industry
calculations, on any flight for frequent fliers. The percentage is
higher for less popular destinations and lower for popular routes.
And there may be no seats available on popular travel holidays like
Thanksgiving and Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott estimates that only 10 percent of travel-related rewards
points are redeemed each year. And Petersen, after studying
airline, hotel and credit card industry documents, along with stock
market filings, estimates that consumers have now banked about 14
trillion unused miles.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you want to to go Disney World in June with the kids,
it's you and 14 million other people who want to do the same
thing,'' Petersen said.
</P>
<P>
   Understanding the roadblocks helps frequent fliers get the most
out of their points. The first rule is to always be prepared to
look for alternative flights and airlines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just keep trying and be flexible,'' Perkins said. ``If you
can't get to New York, go to Philadelphia. If you can't get to
London, go to Manchester.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Feldman, a professor of biology at University of
California at Santa Cruz who accumulates most of his frequent-flier
points on the ground through credit card purchases, said he had to
readjust his schedule to book a trip next month to Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was unable to get seats on any of the United Airlines
nonstop flights from San Francisco to Philadelphia,'' he said.
Instead, he found a connecting flight through Delta Air Lines,
which has an agreement with United to honor frequent-flier points.
</P>
<P>
   The flight times still were not ideal, but acceptable, Feldman
said. ``We were able to redeem miles. It just took a lot of
adjusting of our schedules.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Perkins and Petersen said it helps to look at mileage
points for what they are worth if redeemed for cash. Generally,
airline mileage points are worth 1 to 2 cents per mile, but that
depends on what rules and restrictions apply to the individual
frequent-flier programs.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a trip from a West Coast city to Hawaii that costs
30,000 points would be worth about $600. That would be a bad deal
because ``most of the time you can find a regular ticket to Hawaii
for less than that,'' Perkins said.
</P>
<P>
   And a ticket to Orlando booked 10 months in advance for a
25,000-mile award, or about $500 at 2 cents per mile, might not be
a good deal because ``that far in advance, you might be able to buy
a ticket for $250,'' Petersen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would never use an award on something I could buy for below
$250,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Help on the Net
</P>
<P>
   The Web is helping consumers navigate the frequent-flier skies.
Web sites like FlyerTalk.com and MileageWorkshop.com have bulletin
boards that help even seasoned frequent fliers like Phillips. They
offer tips on a wide variety of questions such as how to make sense
out of confusing frequent-flier program rules, how to sort out
which airline has the best rewards program and where to look for
available seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really puts the power of information on the side of
consumers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at tips posted by other travelers on FlyerTalk.com
helped Phillips plan the cheapest airline routes to rack up another
1 million miles in another promotion offered by a consortium of
Latin American airlines. Phillips said he figures he has only
redeemed about 200,000 of the 2.25 million frequent-flier points he
has racked up.
</P>
<P>
   ``They post a lot of detailed information on how programs work,
information on ticket prices and what to do under certain
situations,'' said Feldman.
</P>
<P>
   New Web-based programs like ClickMiles.com and WebMiles.com,
which turn online purchases into frequent-flier points, are also
designed to help take the confusion out of traditional airline
frequent-flier programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody loves free travel,'' said West Shell, chief
executive officer of Netcentives Inc., the San Francisco company
that offers ClickMiles.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips was enthusiastic about WebMiles, a program started
earlier this year by Utah entrepreneurs Jeff Crapo and Tim Olson.
</P>
<P>
   Launched in January, WebMiles promises to simplify the art of
accumulating frequent-flier miles so that consumers can pick any
flight on any airline. WebMiles members earn from 1 to 5 miles for
every dollar they spend on merchandise at such online sites as
Borders.com, DisneyStore.com and JC Penney.
</P>
<P>
   The first 8,000 points gets a $100 discount off flights, while
180,000 gets a trip around the world. WebMiles Inc. books the seats
for the member, and because the company creates its own rewards
points, Crapo said it isn't subject to the same airline seat
restrictions placed on regular frequent fliers.
</P>
<P>
   Crapo said the miles can be redeemed for round-trip tickets if
booked 14 days or more in advance or for discounts of $100 or more
for tickets purchased with no advance notice.
</P>
<P>
   WebMiles advertises that it can get tickets for ``any airline,
any flight, any time.'' Crapo admits that while no company can
guarantee a seat during a heavy travel day like the day before
Thanksgiving, when airlines sell out flights, WebMiles has a better
chance than standard frequent-flier programs that usually offer no
seats for those dates.
</P>
<P>
   Petersen, though, said WebMiles ``is really nothing new, just
another player out there among many who use travel as an award.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said WebMiles points may not work as well for real
frequent fliers because points can't be combined with regular
airline mileage.
</P>
<P>
   Netcentives' more established ClickMiles, started in April 1998,
also allows consumers to accumulate mileage points by buying at one
of 90 online sites like Barnesandnoble.com, or starting a brokerage
account at E-Trade.
</P>
<P>
   Netcentives has also worked out agreements with 10 airlines to
allow ClickMiles points to be combined with regular frequent-flier
mileage, which makes the company ``the leader in that area,''
Petersen said.
</P>
<P>
   Being able to combine buying points with flying points gives the
consumer a better chance of finding that free flight he or she
wants, even though the consumer might have to spend more points to
book the seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no free ticket you can't get, but you just have to be
prepared to pay the miles for it,'' Petersen said. ``The reality
is, for 40,000 miles, you can have any seat. If you have the miles,
you will never be turned away.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he said the airlines must do a better job of managing
seats designated for frequent fliers, domestic airlines served up
about 12 million free tickets last year, Petersen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There'll always be a John or Jill who can't get what they
want, but the fact is, someone is getting something for free out
there,'' he said. ``I know people who redeem six awards a year and
never have problems.''

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ It's hard to keep a good stock down, but some
investors think JDS Uniphase could be headed for another lull while
regulators decide whether to approve the company's brash takeover
of chief rival SDL Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of work that will have to be done to convince
both the government and customers that this deal should be allowed,
and shares of JDSU will likely go back to the arbitrage penalty
box,'' J.P. Morgan analyst Charlie Willhoit says in a research
note.
</P>
<P>
   JDSU served a couple months in the penalty box while investors
awaited a decision on its acquisition of E-Tek Dyanmics _ its other
big competitor in the fiber-optics components business.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department approved the E-Tek deal, with conditions,
in late June, and JDSU was barely back on the ice before announcing
the SDL takeover.
</P>
<P>
   JDSU shares plunged $15.06 _ about 13 percent _ to $101.13
Monday. They hit a high of $146.53 in March and had been climbing
back from a six-month low of $79 in May.
</P>
<P>
   SDL on Monday rose $25.38 to $320.69 per share, which is 16
percent below the price JDSU offered. That discount is high for a
normal merger but typical for one that raises immediate antitrust
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   The gap on the E-Tek deal was 20 percent when it was announced
and got as high as 25 percent, says Ken Smith, co-manager of the
Munder NetNet and Future Technology funds.
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts think the deal, if it gets done, will make JDSU an
even more formidable competitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``If your outlook is six months or longer, it's positive,'' says
Jeffrey Wrona, manager of the momentum-oriented PBHG Technology and
Communications fund, which has large positions in both companies.
</P>
<P>
   But, Wrona added, ``from a very short-term perspective, I'm
disappointed. We thought the stock would start rocking and rolling
when the E-Tek deal closed. I thought it would be added to the S&AMP;P
500.''
</P>
<P>
   Stocks get a boost when they join the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index because index-fund managers have to buy them. But JDSU ``was
passed over 10 times while the E-Tek deal was pending,'' says
Wrona. Now he thinks it will be passed over again.
</P>
<P>
   Another question weighing on the stock is whether the merger
will dilute earnings. JDSU has said it won't, but some investors
aren't so sure.
</P>
<P>
   And then there are ``integration issues,'' whether JDSU can
smoothly combine its operations with SDL's and E-Tek's.
</P>
<P>
   Should JDSU have digested E-Tek before it attempted another big
gulp like SDL?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, but that's from a short-term, selfish standpoint,'' Wrona
says. ``Long term, if they can get the (Justice Department) to
approve this, the gap between the No. 1 and No. 2 supplier (of
fiber-optics components) will be bigger than the gap between Intel
and AMD.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not music to Justice Department ears.
</P>
<P>
   But ``if the (Justice Department) looks at (the two companies)
on a product-by-product basis,'' the merger could win approval,
says Giri Devulapally, a telecom analyst with T. Rowe Price.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies make lots of components, but very few of the same
ones. In fact, JDSU probably competes with SDL on fewer products
than it did with E-Tek.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest overlap with SDL is in 980-nanometer pump lasers,
which amplify the power of the light source so it can be
transmitted over longer distances.
</P>
<P>
   This is SDL's biggest product line, and Smith has heard
estimates that together, SDL and JDSU would control 90 percent of
that market.
</P>
<P>
   The DOJ could approve the merger on the condition that JDSU and
SDLI take steps to ensure competition in overlapping products, as
it did with the E-Tek deal.
</P>
<P>
   But the government may not approve the deal at all if it looks
at the two companies as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the DOJ takes the attitude, `You know what, these guys are
just too big,' it's going to be tough for them to get approval,''
says Devulapally.
</P>
<P>
   William Kovacic, who teaches antitrust law at George Washington
University, thinks JDSU may face some tough questions from the
government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Often, if you have two companies that have non-overlapping
product lines, but similar capabilities, the question always comes
up: Are these the companies most likely to invade the other's
product areas?'' If the answer is yes, the government may conclude
that the merger is anticompetitive.
</P>
<P>
   In such cases, the government ``talks to the purchasers of the
components,'' he says. If the customers don't mind the merger, that
``tends to weigh heavily on the agency's assessment.''
</P>
<P>
   JDSU's customers include companies like Nortel, Lucent, Ciena
and Alcatel. But these companies also compete with JDSU in some
products.
</P>
<P>
   Another question the government has in what Kovacic calls
``complementary product'' cases is: ``How easily could someone else
adjust to make the same product?''
</P>
<P>
   In fiber optics, the answer is often not easily. The industry is
plagued by chronic shortages of components and people who know how
to make them.
</P>
<P>
   Working in JDSU's favor is the ``avalanche of work'' facing
antitrust officials, the complexity of fiber optics and the fact
that neither company makes a consumer product, Kovacic says.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it is risky to do a deal thinking it will slip past (the
government's) field of vision, especially because it has identified
high technology as a priority and has a little bit of learning''
from JDSU's previous deals.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Froewiss, manager of the Internet Infrastructure fund,
gives the deal a 50-50 percent chance of passing.
</P>
<P>
   Smith put the odds at 60-40, ``but that's just a guess.''
</P>
<P>
   POTENTIAL TAKEOVER TARGETS: Monday's takeover announcement drove
up the price of other fiber-components companies. None are as big
as SDL, and some have only been public a few months.
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts think any of the public companies listed here are
potential takeover targets, but Smith said he thinks the most
likely are Bookham, a British company, and Avanex of Fremont,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   MRV Communications ``is more of a portfolio (or incubator)
company,'' so it would be less likely to be taken over, Smith says.
However, ``they're expected to spin out an optical company sometime
this year,'' and that could become a target.
</P>
<P>
   Stratos Lightwave was spun off Methode Electronics in June.
Methode still owns 86 percent of Stratos and plans to distribute
that stake to its shareholders. So Stratos would be a less likely
target than the others, says Froewiss.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said he thinks the company most likely to benefit from the
merger is Corning. Its main product is glass fiber, but it's also
building a components business.
</P>
<P>
   Corning stock fell Monday, as investors worried about
competition from a larger JDSU. ``But this just positions Corning
as the alternative to JDSU. It also takes JDSU out of the
acquisition game for a while. It gives Corning (which made an offer
for SDL) a window of opportunity.''

IT'S BEEN A LONG RIDE FOR ANGELS' GM STONEMAN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Bill Stoneman probably thought he'd never come back.
Not after Angels general manager Harry Dalton's request that
Stoneman, a sore-shouldered pitcher, accept a demotion to the minor
leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Stoneman, who had thrown two no-hitters during an otherwise
undistinguished major-league career, was 30 years old at the time
and felt he was ready to move into a different line of work. But
Dalton persisted.
</P>
<P>
   When it was clear Stoneman wouldn't go to the minors, Dalton
then worked out a deal with the Cardinals. The Angels would get
$20,000, and Stoneman would pitch for the Cardinals' Triple-A team.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he'd split it with me,'' Stoneman said. ``But I still
wasn't throwing any better. I could use $10,000, but it would be
like stealing. So I went home.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As a general manager in those days, you tried to get close
enough to the players to know how they felt about the business and
their jobs,'' said Dalton, who is retired and living in Arizona.
``Bill was a very knowledgeable pitcher. A good competitor. It's a
shame he hurt his arm.''
</P>
<P>
   So in 1974, Stoneman's baseball career was over. Or so he
thought.
</P>
<P>
   Stoneman returned to Anaheim as the club's general manager last
Nov. 1, but his baseball life and professional career have been by
no means typical. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
HUMBLE BEGINNINGS
</P>
<P>
   By his own admission, Stoneman was a mediocre pitcher at West
Covina (Calif.) High School. He played football one year on the 'B'
team but quit when after snapping the ball on a punt, he got his
nose smashed in (they didn't wear facemasks in those days). He also
played basketball.
</P>
<P>
   In the spring of 1962, Stoneman pitched for West Covina, but
graduation was approaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a pretty good student and I wanted to focus on my
studies,'' he said. ``I wasn't a standout on the team, just another
guy who pitched. I was neck-and-neck with one of my buddies for top
male student GPA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't pitching that much, so I figured the time I spent
practicing, I could spend that time studying and beat Mike out. So
that's what I did.''
</P>
<P>
   Stoneman quit the baseball team, and lost the GPA race with
Mike.
</P>
<P>
   Stoneman continued his education at Mt. San Antonio College, but
nearly quit the baseball team there, too.
</P>
<P>
   After working out with the team in the fall, Stoneman went to
register for classes for the second semester but couldn't get the
classes he wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was ready to drop out,'' he said. ``I wasn't going to waste
a semester there. I went to (Mt. SAC coach John) Arrambide to wish
him well. I was just going to take off and pick pineapples in
Hawaii or something. I hadn't found myself yet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Back in those days they gave you classes alphabetically,''
said Arrambide, who is retired and living in Huntington Beach. ``By
the time they got to 'S' the class he needed was filled up. I
talked to one of the counselors and we were able to get him in. It
was a class he needed to get into a university. He was a real good
student at that was important to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time we get together now, he goes through that whole
rigmarole. 'You saved me from dropping out of school.' It's
embarrassing.''
</P>
<P>
   Stoneman became an all-conference pitcher that year, but
scholarship offers to a four-year university were nowhere to be
found.
</P>
<P>
   However, an article in the San Gabriel Valley Tribune noting
Stoneman's all-conference selection made it into the hands of the
University of Idaho baseball coach, thanks to one of Stoneman's old
high school buddies attending Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   Stoneman was offered a partial scholarship, and he was
Idaho-bound. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
POTATO PICKERS
</P>
<P>
   In Stoneman's senior year at Idaho, the team was ``almost
unbeatable'' according to Stoneman. They had four pitchers that
eventually would play professionally Stoneman, Frank Reberger, Al
Simmons and Ken Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   They won an NCAA Regional Tournament in Greeley, Colo., and then
made a trip to Tucson, Ariz. to play the University of Arizona for
the right to go to Omaha, Neb., for the NCAA College World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``He were were, these potato-picking guys from Idaho, wearing
these baggy uniforms,'' Stoneman said. ``We had to play under the
lights, and none of us had ever played under the lights.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona won and advanced, and Idaho's players flew home thinking
they were the better team. But all was not lost. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
FROM FIRESTONE TO FIREBALLER
</P>
<P>
   After Idaho was eliminated, Stoneman, now a college graduate,
returned home to West Covina. His plan was to resume his summer job
driving a truck for Firestone Tires, then go to graduate school.
His ambition was to coach baseball at the college level, and he
needed a master's degree. He had been accepted to the University of
Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   One night after work, Stoneman got a call from a scout from the
Chicago Cubs. It was a week after the baseball draft and Stoneman
had been drafted by the Cubs in the 34th round. But it took the
Cubs a week to find Stoneman.
</P>
<P>
   The scout came to Stoneman's home to sign him, but when Stoneman
asked about a signing bonus, the scout told him there wasn't any
bonus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him to get out of the house,'' Stoneman said.
</P>
<P>
   In the following days, Stoneman's parents stepped in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both my parents were from Chicago,'' he said. ``My dad was
always pushing education. My mom was a baseball fanatic. And now,
both my parents, including my dad, were saying, 'You've got a
degree, baseball is offering you an opportunity. All you're doing
is driving a truck.' Both wanted me to go and forget the bonus.
It's the opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   The scout called back a couple days later and offered Stoneman a
$500 bonus, and he accepted. Stoneman would play in the Cubs'
minor-league system and spend the offseason going to school. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
FAST TRACK TO THE BIGS
</P>
<P>
   Stoneman played in Caldwell, Idaho (rookie league), then in
Lodi, Calif. (Single-A), then in Fort Worth, Texas (Double-A) in
1966. In 1967, he began the season in Triple-A at Tacoma, Wash.,
and soon was called up to the big club, joining Billy Williams, Ron
Santos, Ernie Banks, Joe Niekro, Randy Hundley, Ferguson Jenkins
and Ken Holtzman.
</P>
<P>
   After the 1968 season, he was selected by the Montreal Expos in
the expansion draft and pitched there for five seasons. He threw
his no-hitters vs. the Phillies (1969) and Mets (1972) while with
Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a power pitcher,'' Stoneman said. ``I had a good
fastball and a pretty good curveball. I had a lot of strikeouts,
but I walked a lot of guys too. I was the kind of guy where I could
have full command of the game, but when I lost I beat myself.''
</P>
<P>
   In the spring of 1973, Stoneman was slated to start opening day
for the Expos. But while throwing during spring training, his
shoulder popped.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like getting shot,'' Stoneman said.
</P>
<P>
   The following year his contract was sold to the Angels, with
whom he went 1-8. His shoulder would never be the same, and he knew
it. That's when he had his meeting with Dalton, ending his playing
career. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
TRADING BASEBALL JERSEY FOR BUSINESS SUIT
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't long before Stoneman was back in Montreal, working for
Royal Trust, a financial institution. He quickly ascended in the
company and eventually became a regional manager in charge of 28
branches.
</P>
<P>
   He had been with the firm about nine years when on a vacation
with his wife, Diane and their two children, Jill and Jeff,
Stoneman stopped by the ballpark to see some old friends. While
talking with a writer in the press box, the Expos' president and
general manager, John McHale, asked Stoneman to meet with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He asked me if I wanted to come back to baseball,'' Stoneman
said. ``I said no, I'm doing fine with Royal Trust. But what John
said was that baseball was evolving and becoming more of a
business. He said I've got the business exposure, and now I could
take those skills with my baseball background and bring it all
together.''
</P>
<P>
   Stoneman accepted the job in 1983 as assistant to the president,
and worked there until last year, when he got a call from Angels
president Tony Tavares. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
TIME IS RIGHT
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, Stoneman had rejected opportunities to become
a general manager during his days in Montreal. But last year,
because his children were grown and living on their own, he figured
the time was right.
</P>
<P>
   He has been labeled as a bottom-line guy because of his years
with the Expos, but says it is different now.
</P>
<P>
   ``The budget here is very generous compared to Montreal,'' he
said. ``For whatever reason, the perception is Disney pulls a lot
of strings in my office, but they don't. That's not an accurate
perception at all. I have guidelines and I have a budget. ... I've
had the flexibility to move things around a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Stoneman was criticized early in his Angels tenure for how he
handled the situation with free-agent pitcher Chuck Finley.
Stoneman explained he didn't want to make an offer until having a
face-to-face meeting with Finley, but couldn't get ahold of him.
When the two finally talked on the phone, Finley said he didn't
have time that week, and that he'd get back to Stoneman the
following week.
</P>
<P>
   ``That call never came,'' Stoneman said. ``It became pretty
evident that he just didn't seem to have an interest here.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
BACK HOME
</P>
<P>
   Stoneman and his wife have purchased a home in Orange, Calif.,
but Southern California looks nothing like it did when he left to
go to Idaho nearly 40 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were still orange groves back then,'' he said. ``They
just plowed through them to build housing tracts. And there are a
lot more freeways now.''
</P>
<P>
   He has come full circle, and says he has enjoyed the ride.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly owe a lot to a number of people,'' he said.
``Whether it's John Arrambide or Freddie Martin, my first pitching
coach with the Cubs, or the guy who brought me into the trust
company after my playing career. Talking with John McHale was a
chance meeting. Would he ever have called me if I didn't go to the
game? Who knows. But I'm certainly happy with how it's all worked
out.'' &QL;

BROWN, SHEFFIELD WOULD BE HAPPIER IF DODGERS WEREN'T STRUGGLING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The honor is humbling, both left fielder Gary
Sheffield and right-hander Kevin Brown agree. Both are All-Star
veterans accustomed to rubbing elbows with the greatest in the
game, and it never gets tiresome.
</P>
<P>
   But both men said it would be a heck of a lot more fun to
represent the Dodgers in today's All-Star Game in Atlanta if the
Dodgers were playing better.
</P>
<P>
   Things aren't as miserable as they were a year ago when the
Dodgers were hopelessly lost at this point, but the situation is
hardly ideal. The Dodgers, riddled by injuries and attempting to
get away from the cloud caused by the fight at Wrigley Field two
months ago, staggered to the All-Star break losing 10 of their last
17 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we were in first place, it would (feel better),'' said
Sheffield, a six-time All-Star. ``Being six games out, I feel
disappointed. I felt like we achieved a lot as a team, and it just
seems for some reason we can be at a place where things are looking
bright and we don't grow from it. That's the thing that's
frustrating.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not a dire position, but after winning a National
League-leading 25 games on the road, the Dodgers thought they'd be
closer than six games and three teams from first place in the
National League West. Instead, at 44-42, including a horrid 19-19
at home, they trail Arizona, Colorado and San Francisco in the
division.
</P>
<P>
   ``The All-Star stuff is great, but it would be a lot sweeter if
we started playing better as a team and we had the chance to play
in the postseason,'' said Brown, heading to his fifth All-Star
game. ``Those individual honors mean so much more when they're set
in the backdrop of a team playing competitive ball.''
</P>
<P>
   And just think where the Dodgers would be without Sheffield and
Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Brown missed 16 days and three starts with a broken right
pinkie, which he suffered in his second start of the season. But
he's 8-2 with a 2.38 ERA, and if not for him, a Dodgers starter
wouldn't have a win in close to a month. The last time another
Dodgers starter won a game was June 18, when Chan Ho Park beat St.
Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brownie should have 11 or 12 wins,'' Dodgers manager Davey
Johnson said. ``If we could score some runs for him, even though
he's been out, he'd have a lot more wins.''
</P>
<P>
   But the most telling statistic showing Brown's first-half value
is his 17 starts. The Dodgers are 12-5 in Brown's starts and 32-37
when he doesn't start.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not (rattled off a long winning streak) this year,
yet,'' Brown said. ``We have the ability to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield isn't just leading the Dodgers in batting (.334),
homers (27), RBI (71) and walks (58), and he's tied for the team
lead with 64 runs scored, but he's taken on the leadership role the
organization hoped he would.
</P>
<P>
   That was apparent from the first week of the season when on
Black Saturday a day Brown, Sheffield, Gregg Olson and Mike Fetters
all suffered injuries Sheffield badly twisted his ankle, needed a
wheelchair to get through the airport in New York, then played two
days later in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield experienced similar mishaps through the first month of
the season, but he didn't miss playing time.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield is the first one to admit one of the reasons he's had
the best first half of his career is the arrival of right fielder
Shawn Green. Though Green is slumping (his average is down to
.294), his left-handed bat provides the kind of protection for
Sheffield in the No.3 spot that right-handed Eric Karros couldn't
last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a team, we have to go higher,'' Sheffield said. ``The
locker room is great, a great bunch of guys, but we have to go
higher. We have to shoot for the sky. We can't just sit here and be
comfortable with where we're at.''
</P>
<P>
   NOTES: The Dodgers are expected to recall catcher Paul LoDuca
for Thursday's game against Anaheim to provide depth at catcher
until Chad Kreuter returns from his eight-game suspension on
Sunday. LoDuca hit .346 with two homers and five RBI earlier this
season.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers thought they could get by with Todd Hundley doing
all of the catching, but he injured his right hand Friday in
Seattle and didn't start at catcher either Saturday or Sunday. ...
Right-hander Jeff Shaw also is slated to be activated and
right-hander Gregg Olson likely will be asked to make at least one
more rehab appearance so he can be evaluated by front-office
personnel. &QL;

EDITORIAL: UNTIMELY TURBULENCE IN ISRAEL  

</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Tuesday, July 11:  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is unfortunate that the center-right parties in Prime
Minister Ehud Barak's coalition have deserted the Israeli leader
just as peacemaking in the Middle East reaches a critical juncture
this week at Camp David. Had they not resigned from the cabinet
Sunday, and voted against him in a failed no-confidence vote Monday
the parties could have helped shape the agreement Barak hopes to
negotiate with the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Barak will have to proceed on his own considerable
authority. Just over a year ago 56 percent of Israeli voters
elected him prime minister on a platform of negotiating peace with
the Palestinians. Under recent changes in Israeli election law,
prime ministers are directly elected, making them less dependent on
Parliament's shifting coalitions. Barak heads to Camp David rightly
determined to rise above party politics and work hard for an
honorable peace.
</P>
<P>
   The main issues awaiting him and Arafat are delineating borders
between Israeli- and Palestinian-ruled territory, resolving
competing claims over greater Jerusalem and defining the rights of
Jewish settlers and Palestinian refugees. Barak has long promised
Israelis that there are clear ``red lines'' beyond which he will
not compromise on these issues. He insists, for example, that the
city of Jerusalem will remain united and under Israeli sovereignty,
and he has promised that a majority of Jewish settlers will be able
to stay in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   But within these parameters, Barak has wisely left room to
negotiate with Arafat. If the Palestinians are prepared to make
compromises on these sensitive issues, a fair agreement can be
reached. Should he come home with an honorable deal, Barak will
have a good chance of getting it approved by a majority of voters,
either in a special referendum or through new national elections.
It is a reasonable assumption that many of the Russian immigrants
and Sephardic Jews whose party leaders quit the government this
week would themselves welcome a realistic peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton summoned Barak and Arafat to Camp David
because lower-level negotiations had reached a dangerous impasse.
The unresolved questions are the hard ones, and only the top
leaders have the authority to make the necessary compromises.
Clinton should be ready to back them up with American guarantees,
promises of financial aid and even draft diplomatic language. But
this summit meeting can succeed only if the two leaders themselves
are ready to deal. Barak appears ready to do so, despite the
untimely collapse of his cabinet majority.

EDITORIAL: DIMINISHING THE WELFARE ROLLS  
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Tuesday, July 11:  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When Eli Segal started three years ago to round up corporations
to hire welfare recipients, many of his CEO friends scoffed.
Experts told him that only about a third of the recipients were
ready for steady work, the rest untrained, undisciplined or worse.
Today Segal's group _ The Welfare to Work Partnership _ has grown
from five companies to 12,000. They have hired more than 650,000
welfare recipients, a huge bite out of the welfare rolls that has
helped shrink them to about 2.5 million adults.
</P>
<P>
   Among the heroes in this story are the nonprofit neighborhood
groups to which the partnership turned to help recruit, train and
screen welfare applicants. The local groups took much of the risk
and fear out of hiring welfare enrollees. The partnership's goal
was to make hiring from the welfare rolls profitable, therefore
self-sustaining. It succeeded. Corporate members of the partnership
report that welfare hires stay on the job longer than their
ordinary hires, cutting down retraining costs.
</P>
<P>
   The partnership's record has disproved many pessimistic
predictions, made after passage of the welfare law in 1996, that
welfare recipients would be unemployable or confined to low-skilled
retailing jobs. In fact, Chase Manhattan and other financial
service behemoths have absorbed thousands of recipients. So have
United Airlines, Xerox and companies in other high-paying
industries. In 1997 Segal predicted he would have to twist the arms
of corporate CEOs to get them to hire from the welfare rolls. But,
with mighty help from an economy that cut the unemployment rate in
about half, corporations now come to Segal desperate for
applicants.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hardest to hire turn out to be not so hard to hire,'' says
Gerald Greenwald, former chairman of United Airlines. CEOs started
out as skeptics, he recalled. ``Now we are the optimists.''

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: A NOVEL THAT IS A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM
</HEADLINE>
 By STEVEN R. WEISMAN 
  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In publishing circles, the frenzy over ``Harry Potter and the
Goblet of Fire'' has been compared to the reader excitement that
once greeted Dickens, Tolstoy or ``Gone With the Wind.'' It is an
imperfect analogy, but one scene in the new novel struck me as
reminiscent of Margaret Mitchell's classic. It takes place at the
Yule Ball, a Christmas dance for which Harry, his friend Ron and
some other boys have had a tough time finding dates.
</P>
<P>
   Harry is now 14 years old, and his hormones are beginning to
stir. At the Yule Ball his jaw drops when he sees that his
archrival and possible ally of the evil Voldemort has come with,
and is dancing with, his friend Hermione Granger. Hermione! The
sidekick Harry and Ron have come to rely on for her brains and
common sense has been transformed like magic into a lovely young
woman.
</P>
<P>
   Except that it is not the magic of spells and charms that has
changed these characters, but the ordinary and perhaps equally
puzzling magic of time and growing up. This particular scene
reflects the achievement of J.K. Rowling's new book. It works on
two levels. One is her invention of new characters, settings and
enchanting objects with each new page, from the witch who lives in
a toilet to the Pensieve, which stores memories for overstuffed
brains. More seductive, however, is the author's vision of
friendship, community and maturity. The context of the book is
magic, but its subject is society.
</P>
<P>
   Like Hermione, who Rowling has said in interviews is the
character with whom she most identifies, the reader of these books
is drawn to and frightened by evil. The inflamed descriptions of
evil characters remind one of William Blake's famous comment that
John Milton, in ``Paradise Lost,'' was an ally of Satan without
knowing it. The paradox yielded by this writing is that while good
and evil are powerful forces destined to be in combat, the way they
manifest themselves to mortals, even to wizards and witches, is
ambiguous and confusing.
</P>
<P>
   More than the previous books, ``Goblet'' is filled with dizzying
reversals in which good characters are found to be evil and vice
versa. As they mature, Harry and his friends must learn to be both
trustful and distrustful of the world around them. The irony is
that now that ``Harry Potter'' has been relegated to the children's
book lists, its themes are increasingly adult in nature.
</P>
<P>
   The Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry is an
imaginatively conceived parallel universe _ with sadistic teachers,
bullies, cramming for exams and acne that resists being removed by
curse _ with which any schoolchild can identify. But it also
bristles with grown-up satire. The Ministry of Magic is a
bureaucracy run amok. With their sexual awakening, the young adults
also experience a coming of age politically, as when Hermione tries
to organize the house elves at Hogwarts to demand better working
conditions _ and is outraged that all the histories of the school
ignore the fact that it has long relied on ``slave labor.''
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview with The Times of London, Rowling talked
not only about her life of poverty but also experience with
psychological depression. She also acknowledged that she was
thinking about her own mental despair when she created the evil
Dementors, the hooded characters whose lethal kiss sucks all hope
from their victims. Once you know that, you cannot think of the
terror they present in these books in quite the same way.
</P>
<P>
   As Rowling says at one point, the magical world she has created
is one in which spells, letter-delivering owls and transformations
take the place of radar, computers and electricity in the real
world. For all its frenzy of publicity, this book has arrived like
a midsummer night's dream. Enter it and you find a place where the
enemies are obsessed with racial purity and the heroes are the ones
who have to learn tolerance, community and reaching across
boundaries of fear. If children learn and adults re-learn that
lesson in this season of reading, they will find the book very
rewarding indeed.

 &HT;    Airlines tell subscribers about weekend bargains with Wednesday
e-mails.
 &HT;    By Mary Ellen Flannery
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. - So I'm sitting at lunch on a recent
Wednesday, and I say to my co-workers, ``Guess what I'm doing this
weekend?'' And they can't possibly guess because it's just so
spontaneous. And it seems like something I couldn't possibly
afford.
</P>
<P>
   I'm flying to Boston on just 60 hours notice!
</P>
<P>
   Every Wednesday, I get e-mails from a handful of airlines:
Delta, USAirways, Continental and American. And they all tell me
about last-minute ``e-saver'' sales on their Saturday flights _ one
week, I can fly from West Palm Beach to Boston and back for $159.
(If I were to buy a regular round-trip ticket just three days in
advance, it would likely cost more than $400.)
</P>
<P>
   I have to be back at work Monday, and the airlines specify the
return trip must be taken either Monday or Tuesday. It's a really
short vacation, but 2-year-old Mollie and 5-year-old William
haven't seen their favorite aunt in a whole month. And their
favorite aunt (that's me, by the way) is craving a Wellfleet
lobster.
</P>
<P>
   Two days on Cape Cod gives me enough time to eat too many fried
clams at Sir Cricket's in Orleans, and share a Ben and Jerry's
coffee ice-cream soda with Buzz! Buzz! ice cream. And it gives
Mollie a chance to stuff my bellybutton with rocks and shells she
finds on Nauset Beach. With those opportunities in mind, a short
vacation actually might be better _ one more day in Cape Cod, and
I'd be fat and impaired.
</P>
<P>
   I buy the tickets Wednesday afternoon on Delta's Web site,
www.delta-air.com. On Saturday morning _ 6:30 a.m.! _ I check in at
the gate, where Delta's agent looks over my credit card. By midday,
I'm eating an eggplant sandwich in the historic village of
Sandwich, Mass. Hours later, I've been tricked into buying a $5
Massachusetts instant lottery ticket by the 5-year-old. Five
dollars?!
</P>
<P>
   Of the four airlines I get notices from _ Delta, USAirways,
Continental and American _ the first two occasionally offer deals
from West Palm Beach to places like Washington, D.C., Philadelphia,
Cleveland and Boston. Delta also offers something called ``fan
fares,'' which are trips tied to special events.
</P>
<P>
   Continental flies more often from Fort Lauderdale, and American
offers discount fares from Miami.
</P>
<P>
   I get a weekly message about American's international flights,
too _ Dominican Republic, Costa Rica, the Netherlands ... I can
dream, can't I?
</P>
<P>
   Anyone with Internet access can sign up to get Wednesday
e-mails. Just sign up at each airline's Web site. I use
www.delta-air.com; www.usairways.com; www.continental.com;
www.AA.com. Other airlines also offer special Internet fares. These
include ``dot deals'' at www.twa.com; ``click and save'' at
www.southwest.com; and e-fares on www.united.com.

 &HT;    Clermont promises change from Disney attractions
 &HT;    By Michael Browning
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLERMONT, Fla. _ If you are looking for a pleasant, inexpensive,
un-Disneyfied weekend getaway, within three hours' drive of Palm
Beach County, then take the high ground.
</P>
<P>
   Here, within a few minutes' drive of each other, are three
inexpensive tourist attractions, an atmospheric old downtown, and a
profusion of more than 1,400 blue lakes where you can bicycle and
picnic atop the rolling hills of the Florida Ridge.
</P>
<P>
   But you better come quick: Lake County is growing by leaps and
bounds, becoming a bedroom community for burgeoning Orlando. New
housing divisions are being sculpted in fanciful swirls over hills
that once were clad with orange groves as far as the eye can see.
</P>
<P>
   And the eye can see pretty far from the top of the Citrus Tower,
where owner Greg Homan has an office just below the observation
deck. He thinks he may be the highest office-holder in the state,
when you add the 226 feet of the tower to the 225-foot natural
elevation of the hill on which it stands. The combined height would
put Homan's desk at well over 40 stories high, from sea level.
</P>
<P>
   ``It rocks a little in a big thunderstorm,'' Homan said. ``The
first time it happened to me, I thought it was my blood pressure
surging. But it was just the tower in a storm.''
</P>
<P>
   It costs just $3.50 to ride the elevator of the 1956 tower to
the top (there are stairs, but they are only used in emergencies)
and one is rewarded with one of the most tremendous panoramas in
Florida. On clear days you can practically see across the state, 60
miles east, 60 miles west. The faraway profile of Orlando's skyline
glows against the morning wash of sunlight, and a small blocky
structure on the very horizon is the gigantic building at Cape
Canaveral where Saturn moon rockets were assembled and housed
upright.
</P>
<P>
   You can see up to eight counties from here: Lake, Orange, Polk,
Sumter, Pasco, Osceola, Seminole and Marion, in wide-cast horizons
of watery blue.
</P>
<P>
   The tower contains 5 million pounds of concrete and 149,000
pounds of reinforcing steel. Homan boasts it can withstand winds of
up to 190 mph. The observation deck at the top is enclosed by glass
and has a curious steel tube, which drops down the full height of
the structure, and is equipped with two ear-tubes, one on either
side.
</P>
<P>
   You're supposed to drop a quarter in a slot, put your ear to the
ear-tube, and listen to it fall, ka-ching, ka-ching, ka-ching, all
226 feet. The coin finishes up with a little bell-like chime at the
bottom.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get about $800 worth of quarters out of the drop each year,
and give them to the Green Isles Children's Ranch,'' Homan said. He
just repainted the tower a creamy white and pastel green, and
regards himself as the trustee of a lofty piece of Florida's past.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Citrus Tower,'' Homan declared, ``is Clermont's claim to
fame.''
</P>
<P>
   The Citrus Tower is open from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. every day except
Thanksgiving and Christmas; Sundays from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Adults
$3.50; children 3 to 15, $1; children under 2 free. Group rates
available. Call (352) 394-4061 for more information.
</P>
<P>
   The House of Presidents
</P>
<P>
   filled with memorabili
</P>
<P>
   A stone's throw away from the base of the Citrus Tower is one of
the most remarkable museums in Florida: The House of Presidents.
Small and unprepossessing from the outside, the white-columned
cinder-block building contains an extraordinary miscellany of U.S.
presidential memorabilia and some fascinating, detailed models of
the White House and its Oval Office under various administrations
going back to 1909.
</P>
<P>
   The lordly height of the nearby Citrus Tower makes this little
place seem a mere footnote at the edge of the parking lot. But the
House of Presidents is a highly original, quirky, almost fanatical
tribute to the American presidency assembled over the space of
nearly 40 years by Orlando entrepreneur and modeler John Zweifel.
It is well worth a visit.
</P>
<P>
   A gigantic original lithograph of President William McKinley
hangs by the door, and behind the cash register is a 1900 election
poster for William Jennings Bryan, decrying imperialism, showing
the great trusts as an evil octopus whose limbs are about to be
chopped off by Liberty. This is hot stuff, and it is only the
beginning.
</P>
<P>
   A half-hour film introduces you to Zweifel and his lifelong love
affair with U.S. presidential history. The masterpiece of the
collection, a 60-foot-long, 20-foot-highcutaway model of the White
House, isn't here now. It is on tour and will return in November.
But what is here, is amazing.
</P>
<P>
   Zweifel acquired huge wooden replicas of the American battleship
fleet that fought during the Spanish-American War: the Maine, the
Olympia and others that were commissioned by then-secretary of the
Navy Theodore Roosevelt, and later acquired by circus master James
Bailey. The models are not named because they pre-existed the
actual ships. Thus the wooden Maine here is older than the real
Maine, which was blown up in Havana Harbor and later refloated,
towed out to sea and sunk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not political. I'm an admirer of every president, really I
am,'' Zweifel said in a phone interview. ``It's such a tremendous,
demanding position that you have to respect anyone who takes it on.
And really, there have only been a handful of presidents who didn't
measure up.''
</P>
<P>
   On permanent display here is a very large model of the White
House under construction, being visited by then-president
Washington. The affair is so large it practically occupies an
entire room and is full of amusing details, like one man running
from an outhouse, doing his trousers up, to be on time to see the
president. Parts of the model move, and sounds of sawing and
hammering, backed up by fife and drum music, add to the
authenticity.
</P>
<P>
   Zweifel managed to acquire an original chair (Number H17) from
Ford's Theater in Washington where Abraham Lincoln was
assassinated. The place was remodeled in the 1950s. He bought
``extras'' of presidential china going back to Garfield's
administration. Original issues of newspapers announcing Lincoln's
murder, FDR's death, Truman's ``defeat'' by Dewey in 1948,
Kennedy's assassination, are all on display here, along with
thousands of other presidential memorabilia and waxworks of the men
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   First ladies' gowns, presidential gift cufflinks, autographs, a
campaign torch from a rally for Lincoln in 1864, a glass bowl
commemorating James Garfield's assassination with the words, ``We
Mourn Our Nation's Loss'' on it. The place is filled to the roof
with an attic-like profusion of artifacts one could spend hours
looking at. The gift shop is as quirky as the museum: I was
attracted by a large gold head of Richard Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you see is only about 15 percent of what I've got,''
Zweifel said proudly.
</P>
<P>
   The House of Presidents is open from 9 a.m to 5 p.m. daily.
Admission is $7.95 for adults, $3.95 for children, with children
under 4 free. One ticket is good for a whole year's return visits.
Call (352) 394-2836 for more information.

   Lake Ridge Winery
</P>
<P>
   is Florida's largest
</P>
<P>
   ``Wine is part of civilized life, when consumed intelligently,''
says the video at Lake Ridge Winery, Florida's largest, 7 miles
north of the Citrus Tower on U.S. 27. Set on a hill overlooking two
lakes and several rolling hills, the winery is open free to
visitors and makes its money off sales of wine after a short,
pleasant tour has worked up a gentle thirst, and a free
wine-tasting has titillated the taste buds.
</P>
<P>
   The 127 acres of muscadine, Suwannee and Blanc du Bois grapes
produce 106,000 gallons of various wines, 97 percent of which are
sold right on the premises. The tour takes you through the large
room in which the stainless steel fermentation tanks, each holding
5,000 gallons, stand in rows and along the way you learn a lot
about grapes and wine-making.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the reason champagne costs so much is not that
there is a worldwide conspiracy to make this treat punishingly
expensive, but that champagne is difficult, occasionally even
dangerous to produce (bottles can explode under pressure). It
requires immense coddling, injections of yeast, regular rotation in
racks of steeper and steeper-angled slots to separate out the
sediment, uncorking, recorking, wiring, etc.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors are at last invited to a free tasting of some of Lake
Ridge's vintages _ not the really expensive ones, like the Marquis
Reserve, which goes for $19.95 a bottle, but a fair selection of
about six different whites and reds, with a splash of pink
champagne as well. (Guide Thomas Joaquin slyly turns on a bubble
machine beneath the counter to introduce the champagne).
</P>
<P>
   How good are they? I am no oenologist, but it seemed to me that
the lower-priced wines at Lake Ridge actually had more character
and originality than the upper-tier vintages. The Cuvee Noir
Reserve, a dry red wine similar to a Merlot, was very well-balanced
and dignified, while the Blanc du Bois got off to a great start,
then rather vapored away at the back of the palate.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the chablis, the Southern white and the Southern
red, while too sweet to be ranked with the great wines of
California, Italy and France, had a refreshing short-sleeved
Floridian authenticity to them. Florida's muscadine grape is its
own danged fruit, irrepressible, wildly sweet, sunshiny and
appealing. There was a quality of freshness and spontaneity to its
wine, very sincere and pleasant, very easygoing and amiable, the
way a Beaujolais Nouveau can be on a bright day. The chablis was on
sale for about $4 a bottle if you bought a case, and the more you
buy of anything, the more discounts you get.
</P>
<P>
   The winery supplies little red wagons for you to fill with boxes
and bottles. Wineglasses, corkscrews, olive oils, vinegars, jellies
and other dainties are also on sale in the tasting room.
</P>
<P>
   There is a pretty picnic area adjacent to the winery where you
can lunch and look down, in the distance, on the silver barbed wire
of the Lake County Corrections Institution, whose inmates are, in a
way, trampling out the vintage of their own grapes of wrath.
</P>
<P>
   Lake Ridge Winery is open to the public free, Monday through
Saturday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. and Sundays from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Closed Christmas, New Year's Day and Easter. Call (352) 394-1839

 &HT;    Thrill of the chase for a home run ball
 &HT;    By Jenn Hildreth
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - Even though it caused two skinned knees, two skinned
elbows, and a bleeding right wrist, it was worth it.
</P>
<P>
   At least that's what the guy who caught one of Sammy Sosa's home
run balls told me as he applied a napkin to his wrist.
</P>
<P>
   That's right, when he went diving in between the rows to grab
one of the eventual Home Run Derby champion's bombs to left field,
I was about six rows up elbowing some kids for position.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that this guy, named Ben Johnson, was sitting in
section 136, row 23, seat 102, while my seat was in section 136,
row 24, seat 103.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that another guy two seats over in section 136 also
has a ball to take home (off the bat of Ivan Rodriguez in batting
practice), and I merely have the memories of the slightly scuffed
ball that he let me hold - briefly.
</P>
<P>
   I think at least two balls even flew into the auxiliary press
box where my laptop was set up in left field.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about being in the wrong place at the wrong time.
</P>
<P>
   But I've got to tell you, honestly, even though I didn't catch a
ball, I could not think of a place that I would have rather been
than where I was tonight.
</P>
<P>
   I thought that hitting a golf ball cleanly was possibly the best
feeling in the world (not that I've felt it that often).
</P>
<P>
   Connecting with the sweet spot on a baseball bat and swishing a
basketball cleanly through the net are tied at a close second, but
seeing that home run ball come hurtling through the air blows them
all away.
</P>
<P>
   It's amazing how everything - the people around you raising
their gloves, the sound of the crowd in anticipation of the home
run, your heart beating in your chest - just swells into a giant
crescendo.
</P>
<P>
   There's that split second when you feel like it really might be
coming your way, when you start to wonder how much you're going to
have to stretch and run and push to get to where it might land, and
that is, to me, one of the best feelings in sports.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so I'm trying really hard to mask the fact that I failed at
my assignment.
</P>
<P>
   And I'd tell you about how I came really close to one of Ken
Griffey Jr.'s shots that richocheted off a few gloves in right
field (I sprinted over there from my spot in left field for the
second round), and how I could probably have gotten another one of
Sosa's hits to left if I had just stretched a little further over
the rail, but I know, close only counts in romance and horseshoes.
</P>
<P>
   Or something like that.
</P>
<P>
   I really did try everything I could think of ... I tried telling
people that I could get their picture in the paper.
</P>
<P>
   I planned to stay away from small children and the elderly -
people that I knew I couldn't push out of the way without feeling
really guilty.
</P>
<P>
   I even secretly urged on all of the people in the section
directly in front of me who were shaking those long, skinny
balloons, hoping their arms would tire out.
</P>
<P>
   But when it all wound down, after Sosa's explosion for nine home
runs in the final round that had me rooting along to ``Rock and
Roll Part Two'' and chanting ``Sa-mmy'' like an audience member on
the ``Jerry Springer Show'', my glove was as empty as the Budweiser
Blimp that sailed over Turner Field all night.
</P>
<P>
   I kind of feel guilty that I don't have any war wounds.
</P>
<P>
   A vendor selling cracker jacks and peanuts who had worked at the
All-Star game at Fenway in 1999 told me before the game that it
could get brutal. He wished me luck and told me not to get hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe if I had actually dove head-first over the seats like one
guy did in batting practice, I would have fared better.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, I'll wear a helmet and pads

PUDGE MIGHT BE BEST CATCHER EVER SAW

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Ivan Rodriguez picked up another bauble to add to the
trophy case yesterday. The Rangers' catcher received an award for
garnering the most votes in fan balloting for the All-Star Game
today at Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an honor for me,'' Rodriguez said. ``I'm very happy for
that. I never expected in my career that would happen. That means a
lot for me.''
</P>
<P>
   The trophy can take its place next to Rodriguez' 1999 American
League MVP award, his eight Gold Gloves and his six Silver Slugger
Awards.
</P>
<P>
   While perhaps not as prestigious as the others, this latest
award is nevertheless significant. It indicates that baseball fans
throughout the country recognize what the other achievements prove:
That Rodriguez is the best catcher in the game today, and perhaps
the best ever to squat behind the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the best,'' said Joe Torre, the manager of the New York
Yankees and the AL All-Stars. ``Johnny Bench was that one catcher
who used to get all that recognition. But Ivan, he's done it
batting average-wise, power-wise, and you change your whole
offensive scheme when he's the catcher whether you're going to
steal a lot because he's dominant in that area. It's very unusual
to be a catcher and be that effective both offensively and
defensively.''
</P>
<P>
   Modesty forbids Rodriguez from talking about his place in
history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't consider myself the best catcher,'' he said. ``I just
consider myself another player in the game. I don't want to talk
about myself. I'm just trying to do my best.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez might be reluctant to pat himself on the back, but his
awards and statistics state the case very eloquently.
</P>
<P>
   The MVP award, all the Gold Gloves and Silver Sluggers, and the
nine All-Star appearances bear testimony that Rodriguez possesses a
rare combination of lethal bat and game-changing defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen anyone like him,'' said Yankees catcher Jorge
Posada, Rodriguez's All-Star backup. ``Every day he does something
different to help the team win. He could go 0-for-4, but he can
throw two guys out and help the team. He's that good.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past season and a half, Rodriguez has transformed himself
from dangerous hitter to deadly-as-they-come hitter.
</P>
<P>
   He batted .332 with 35 homers, 113 runs batted in and 116 runs
scored last season. The 35 homers were a record by an AL catcher,
and he became the first catcher in league history with 30 homers,
100 RBI and 100 runs scored.
</P>
<P>
   This year, he's doing even better. He's batting .366 with 26
homers and 80 RBI, and is on pace for 50 homers and 152 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   His willingness to swing at any pitch, in any count, in any
location, and more often than not to make contact and hit it hard,
makes him one of the toughest players to pitch to in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to approach him like you have two strikes on him,''
said Oakland Athletics All-Star Tim Hudson. ``You can't throw any
kind of get-me-over off-speed pitches because you'll be backing up
third or he'll be rounding the bases after a homer. He's very
impressive. He's probably one of the best hitters out there. He
hits everything. He really doesn't have a weakness. He's one of
those guys that when he gets out, he gets himself out. As a
pitcher, you really don't get him out much.''
</P>
<P>
   The only catcher in the game today who compares offensively to
Rodriguez is the New York Mets' Mike Piazza, who led the National
League in fan balloting but will miss the game with a mild
concussion.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza has more power, or at least did before this year. He's
the only catcher in history with two 40-homer seasons, but his 24
at the break are two fewer than Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone considers Mike the best offensive catcher in the
game,'' said Rangers pitcher Kenny Rogers, who played with Piazza
for the Mets last season. ``But this year and last year have shown
that Pudge is right up there with anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if Piazza still is considered a better overall hitter
because of his power, Rodriguez has the edge defensively. National
Leaguers say that Piazza is underrated defensively, but even so he
can't compare to the Rangers' Gold-Glover.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take my hat off to Mike Piazza,'' Torre said. ``Mike Piazza,
along with \RMark\S McGwire and \RSammy\S Sosa, is one of the most
feared sluggers. I think Mike is a better hitter than those other
two guys, and he hits almost as many home runs. But Ivan I think is
the total package.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez always has had the quick release and the cannon arm, a
combination that allowed him to throw out 54.2 percent of runners
attempting to steal last year, the best percentage since the
statistic first was kept in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``You steal them off the pitcher,'' Chicago White Sox speedster
Ray Durham said. ``You try to get the best jump you can, and if you
don't you'd better turn around and get back to first. And even
taking your lead off first, you can't get too far out or he'll snap
a throw down there and you'll be walking back to the dugout.''
</P>
<P>
   If there was a criticism of Rodriguez, it was his ability to
call games. But like his hitting, even that has improved.
</P>
<P>
   ``What impressed me the most about him in the past two years was
his ability to call the game, to get on the same page as me and
remember things in the heat of battle we had talked about before
the game,'' said Seattle Mariners All-Star Aaron Sele, a former
Ranger. ``He would call timeout and run out and say remember what
we talked about, this is what we want to do here, stay with this
plan. He really kept his pitcher on the same page and on focus.
That is something that doesn't get talked about a lot with Pudge,
but in the two years I worked with him he got better and better and
better every day.''
</P>
<P>
   The All-Star voters recognized that this year. Along with the
other awards and honors, it's another indicator that the AL's
starting catcher today just might be the best ever at his position.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never played with \RJohnny\S Bench or saw him catch,''
Rogers said. ``I know he was great. But did he throw as well as
Pudge? I don't think so, and I don't think he could hit as well as
Pudge. He's head and shoulders above anybody that's ever played at
doing everything.''  &LR; tagtop:Simon Gonzalez, (817) 390-7760

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For months, Republicans in Congress have sought to
block a Federal Communications Commission program to license
hundreds of new low-power radio stations. With the first batch of
applications now in, half are from religious organizations,
including fundamentalist churches active in conservative Republican
politics.
</P>
<P>
   From Horizon Christian Fellowship in San Diego to In His Image
Outreach Ministries in East Greenwich, R.I., hundreds of
evangelical churches are asking for space on the airwaves to spread
the Gospel. Some simply want to read Scripture verbatim; others
want to preach against abortion.
</P>
<P>
   They will not get the chance, however, if the Republican
congressional leadership _ lined up on the side of big broadcasting
companies and their lobbying group _ gets its way. And that has
left many of the applicants and their supporters frustrated, while
offering a fresh reminder of the divisions that persist in the
Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like money's talking, maybe at the expense of what
would be logical long-term _ the Republicans supporting their
supporters,'' said Rich Cizik, director of the Washington office of
the National Association of Evangelicals, which has 4,300 churches
as members.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Republicans, however, say their position is based
on the interference that broadcasters insist the new stations would
cause for the signals of existing stations. Politics, they add,
will not change that.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue goes back to interference, and that's pretty
non-ideological,'' said Rep. Michael Oxley, R-Ohio. ``You're either
interfering, or you're not.''
</P>
<P>
   Although congressional staffers, FCC officials and lobbyists
said they expected churches to apply for licenses, the makeup of
the applicant pool has caught most of them by surprise, they said.
</P>
<P>
   The applications offer the latest twist in a debate that radio
executives and media activists consider one of the industry's most
important issues since the advent of FM in the 1960s. William
Kennard, the FCC chairman, has said that adding hundreds of
low-power radio stations is one of his top priorities _a key way to
counteract the increasing consolidation of the industry into the
hands of a relatively few big, profit-minded broadcasters.
</P>
<P>
   He plans to award 1,000 new licenses for stations that could be
heard within three and a half miles of their signal. The first
could be on the air before the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Radio executives and some Republicans in Congress have said that
Kennard failed to consult others before devising a plan that would
seriously hurt existing broadcasters. ``Chairman Kennard, wanting
this as his legacy, pushed this issue before it was fully and
completely tested,'' said Rep. Billy Tauzin, R-La.
</P>
<P>
   Kennard has called the interference claims ``fraudulent'' and
simply an attempt to protect existing broadcasters.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, about 750 groups applied for about 200 licenses in
California, Maryland and eight other states that the commission
declared eligible for the first low-power radio. Officials are
reviewing the initial applications; over the next year and a half,
the FCC will examine the hundreds expected to come in from the
remaining 40 states.
</P>
<P>
   Now commission officials and other, mostly liberal supporters of
low-power radio in Washington find themselves in the unusual
position of hoping the grass-roots religious conservatives will
band together to lobby their usually dependable allies in Congress
on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, the battle over low-power radio has made for odd
bedfellows. National Public Radio has teamed up with the National
Association of Broadcasters _ among the most influential trade
groups in the country _ because both feared that the new stations
could create interference with existing stations' signals and take
away listeners. That position has also been adopted by the National
Association of Religious Broadcasters, whose members own
established radio and television stations.

 WASHINGTON: television stations. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now, nonprofit evangelical groups applying for the new stations
find themselves offering the same arguments as liberal activists
who believe ownership of the airwaves has become concentrated in
too few corporate hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a widespread belief that commercial broadcasters have
abandoned their communities,'' said Andrew Jay Schwartzman, the
president of Media Access Project, a Washington law firm that
analyzed the list of applicants and has helped groups file
applications for low-power stations. ``This does not break down on
a liberal-conservative basis.''
</P>
<P>
   And Oxley finds himself at odds with grass-roots religious
conservatives, who just last month were praising him for helping
prevent the FCC from restricting what noncommercial religious
television stations could broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the 750 applicants include many groups that have no
ties to a religious organization. The list, restricted to nonprofit
groups, also contains many schools, local governments and community
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Among the applicants are the National Jazz Hall of Fame
Foundation; Freemont High School in Oakland, Calif.; the Maine
Science &AMP; Technology Museum; the Chamber of Commerce in Baker, La.;
the Maryland Mass Transit Administration; a racing-pigeon club in
Tulsa, Okla.; and a Native American tribe in Sitka, Alaska, that
wants to broadcast whale songs from under water.
</P>
<P>
   But about half of the applicants are churches, and more than
half of those are fundamentalist or evangelical churches, according
to the Media Access Project.
</P>
<P>
   A number of other applicants, while not churches, share views
associated with religious conservatives. One such applicant is the
Crisis Pregnancy Help Center in Slidell, La., which tries to
convince teenagers to abstain from premarital sex and, if they do
get pregnant, not to have an abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Another applicant, the Calvary Chapel in Oxnard, Calif., is a
nondenominational church that teaches the Bible verse by verse.
Eric Robbins, the chapel's business manager, said it would offer an
alternative to the commercial radio stations in central California;
members of Congress, he said, are listening too closely to
lobbyists from the companies that own those stations.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's some protectionism going on there,'' Robbins said.
</P>
<P>
   The National Association of Broadcasters has a lengthy,
successful record of promoting legislation its members support. It
has also made campaign contributions to most of the key opponents
of low-power radio in the last two years, according to the Center
for Responsive Politics.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the House overwhelmingly passed a bill that
would severely restrict the FCC plan, likely barring about 800 of
the 1,000 licenses the commission plans to grant. In recent weeks,
Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H., has been trying to attach an even more
restrictive proposal, which would cancel the program, to a number
of appropriations bills, congressional aides said. Sen. John
McCain, R-Ariz., has proposed allowing the commission to grant the
licenses but giving existing broadcasters the right to file
complaints about interference in federal court.
</P>
<P>
   Because the low-power radio plan is already law, Congress is
expected to move quickly to head it off before the commission
grants any licenses. White House officials have said they support
the creation of low-power radio stations, as has Vice President Al
Gore, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president. Texas Gov.
George W. Bush has not taken a public position on the issue, said
Mindy Tucker, a spokeswoman for his presidential campaign.

<P>
   College basketball's summer game is in full swing. Division I's
three-week evaluation/recruiting period started Saturday. For the
rest of this month, at dozens of tournaments nationwide, players
will play and coaches will watch.
</P>
<P>
   And, if the NCAA has its way, summer recruiting will never be
the same. Next year, the summer recruiting period will be trimmed
from 24 to 14 days. By 2002, the NCAA hopes to have a new
recruiting model in place with the goal of ``eliminating summer
basketball environments as we now know it,'' said Penn State
president Graham Spanier, chairman of the Division I board of
directors. The NCAA wants a system ``fair to all schools \Rthat\S
doesn't exploit the student-athlete,'' spokesman Wally Renfro said.
</P>
<P>
   While the NCAA plans to address the problem, many college
coaches believe it wants to do more than that, and eliminate summer
recruiting. The National Association of Basketball Coaches has
called an emergency meeting this weekend in Las Vegas to discuss
the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea isn't to eliminate summer recruiting, it's more to
examine and restructure it,'' said Kim Anderson, Big 12 director of
basketball operations. ``The problem with fixing it is that not
everybody is going to agree with the solution.''
</P>
<P>
   Southwest Missouri State coach Barry Hinson is skeptical,
though. Asked if he thought the NCAA wants to eliminate summer
recruiting, he said, ``You bet I do.''
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't think it'll happen, however. ``I think there will be
some changes but I don't think they'll eliminate it completely. I
think the \RNCAA\S will realize the summer evaluation period is
cost effective. But if they eliminate it completely, the medium
fish will quickly become little fish. The rich will get richer. It
will be Robin Hood in reverse.''
</P>
<P>
   NCAA staff members are attending this month's summer recruiting
events to gather information to make recommendations to the
recently formed basketball issues committee, which will meet for
the first time in August. Its first task will be recommending
changes for the summer recruiting process.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that we believe we need a new summer recruiting model
has been interpreted universally that the NCAA wants to eliminate
summer recruiting,'' Renfro said. ``That's not the intent ... The
concern is there are too many individuals whose interest in the
recruiting process doesn't necessarily reflect the best interests
of the student-athlete. \RThose individuals\S are influence or
profit motivated.''
</P>
<P>
   This past season, a high-profile scandal pointed the spotlight
on the summer basketball scene. Myron Piggie, a Kansas City summer
coach, was indicted for mail fraud and tax evasion. Testimony
during the trial indicated that Piggie had given money to players
on his summer league team. Those players later enrolled at Oklahoma
State, Duke, Missouri and UCLA. That is the type of recruiting
problem the NCAA wants to eliminate.
</P>
<P>
   Since the mid-1980s, the evaluation period each July has allowed
coaches to watch _ but not actively recruit _ players at
tournaments and camps. Combined with scholarship limitations, the
summer recruiting period has helped the lower two-thirds of the
300-plus Division I schools recruit better players. Those schools
hope that through their summer recruiting diligence they can find
the late-bloomer, the diamond-in-the-rough, the player that the top
Division I schools don't need.
</P>
<P>
   UT-Arlington's $20,000 recruiting budget, for instance, is about
one-fifth that of the University of Texas. But UTA coach Eddie
McCarter and his staff can maximize that budget through planning
and hard work in the summer. Typically, UTA identifies about 50
players it can recruit. That list is pared to 10 to 15 players.
They hope to sign three to five of those.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they do away with summer recruiting, we'd be in a financial
bind,'' McCarter said. ``We'd have to find some money somewhere to
add to recruiting.''
</P>
<P>
   Coaches see other problems, should the summer recruiting period
be further cut or eliminated, including more travel and expense
during the school year and fewer coaches with the team during the
season.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, the 10 days trimmed from the summer recruiting period
will be added to the days that coaches can recruit during the
school year. And if summer recruiting is eliminated completely, all
24 days would be moved to the school year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that happens, assistant coaches will be on the road all the
time during the season recruiting,'' SMU coach Mike Dement said.
</P>
<P>
   And even if coaches are prohibited from summer evaluations, the
events likely would continue. Mike Kunstadt, director of the Great
American Shootout that concluded in Denton yesterday, said that he
would continue to hold his event, which drew 184 teams and just
over 2,000 players. ``The kids want to play, they want to face
different competition and travel a little,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Coaches would still need to get updated evaluations on players.
Video services, live Internet feeds and scouting services would
likely fill the void.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coaches will still have to talk to these summer coaches to
find out how the players they're interested in are playing,''
Dement said. ``It's not the \Revents\S that are the problem. It's
some of the people, a small number of people, involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Kunstadt agrees. He estimates that of the 800 to 900
summer-league teams in Texas, only about 10 are coached by people
he suspects of being ``street agents,'' similar to Piggie. Through
the National Association of Basketball Coaches, Kunstadt has
recommended that the NCAA sanction coaches of summer teams. Any
coach that violates the rules could be suspended from coaching
teams in NCAA-sanctioned events.
</P>
<P>
   ``What needs to be done is control the street agents,'' Kunstadt
said. ``If we sanctioned or registered the summer league coaches,
we could eliminate some of the problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone seems to agree the current system is beset with
problems. Solutions are tougher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you make summer recruiting fit into some sort of halcyon
notion of how college basketball should operate? I don't think
anybody knows that,'' the NCAA's Renfro said. ``That's part of the
process that we're going through.''

   It would be wrong to say Pudge Rodriguez is concerned. Concern
doesn't register in any conversation. Not yet, anyway. But does
Pudge currently ponder over his future in Arlington with a bit of
uncertainty?
</P>
<P>
   I'd say yes. And to that, you might answer, ``But how could that
be?'' Well ... because. Just because.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight, it's the All-Star Game in Atlanta, where this
one-of-a-kind Ranger shows the baseball world what the baseball
world has already recognized.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez is the very best in the business. On that, there is no
debate. The Rangers, in their 29 years of existence, have never had
a player recognized as the very best at his position.
</P>
<P>
   Is Pudge the best all-around catcher who ever lived? And if not
now, will he someday be hailed as even better than the immortal
Johnny Bench? That, of course, is today's on-going argument, one
that continues to pick up steam as Pudge's offensive numbers
mushroom.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, the Rangers were hoping for 26 homers and 80
runs batted in from Rodriguez. In a season.
</P>
<P>
   But those are his current stats at the All-Star break. Along
with a .363 batting average. Don't look back, Mr. Bench. Somebody
is gaining on you.
</P>
<P>
   Mix in on-the-field performance with Pudge's immense popularity
with local fans (second in franchise history to only Nolan Ryan.
Don't look back, Mr. Ryan. Somebody is also gaining on you), and
his self-taught sense of maintaining proper public relations and a
family-values image, and his anti-baseball-greed stance of 1997,
and you combine all of it, and what we have here is Ivan Rodriguez,
a native son of Puerto Rico who has become a local institution.
</P>
<P>
   The Fort Worth Stockyards District would be traded to Dallas
before Tom Hicks would ever allow Rodriguez to wear anything other
than a Rangers' uniform. Or so would be the logical assumption.
</P>
<P>
   But this is also baseball. Uniforms do change. And the money is
so staggering that baseball's international goodwill ambassador of
two years ago, Sammy Sosa, can now be portrayed, fair or unfair, as
Greed Inc. in Chicago. At times, it's the player who demands more,
more, more. At other times, it's the club saying enough is enough.
See Juan Gonzalez last winter.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez has two more years after this season on his Rangers'
contract. but it is later than you think. Pudge is baseball's
biggest bargain at $8 million a season, the contract he negotiated
for himself in '97, personally ending a tense standoff with
management. By this time next year, the sports page will be full of
speculation on whether the Rangers are going to keep Pudge. The
team could not allow him to go to a free-agent season in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa's PR mistake with the Cubs was he demanded a new contract,
and much more money, with still two years remaining on his current
deal. Even with most players, that goes against protocol. Pudge
will not do that next season. He's too smart and too PR savvy. But
it goes without him saying it outright that Pudge is hoping to get
a long-term deal done by the end of next season. Actually, right
now would suit him, and also be the proper move for the Rangers.
Which is why Pudge is already dropping subtle hints.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no better place for me ... absolutely,'' he was
saying one day last week in the clubhouse. ``These fans, this
ballpark, the community ... This is where I want to finish my
career. I'd like a lifetime contract. It's important to me to be
able to say I played my entire career right here.''
</P>
<P>
   As Pudge was talking, a team media-relations guy informed the
press that the pregame clubhouse access was over (the clubhouse
must be cleared of media 45 minutes before the first pitch). Pudge
politely waved him off. ``Stay here,'' he told a guy with a
notepad. Rodriguez continued to stress his strong desire to remain
in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   Later, a friend of Pudge's said it worried the catcher every
time he read a Doug Melvin quote about Melvin being unwilling to go
to the $10 million level with a player's salary. Pudge took
under-market value in 1997 in agreeing to the current deal, but at
age 28, what is his present worth? And in two years, what could it
be? Barring injury, that worth will certainly be far beyond $10
million a year. At what point in today's baseball market would it
become stupid to undervalue yourself no matter how much you want to
remain in Arlington?
</P>
<P>
   From the Rangers' standpoint, they will wonder how many years
Pudge can catch beyond age 30, when this current contract is up,
``Five more years,'' answered Pudge last week, meaning three more
after 30, ``and then I will play another position.''
</P>
<P>
   Again, we are one year away from Pudge's future with the Rangers
becoming an issue, and becoming for the team, a potential PR
disaster of nuclear strength. For Pudge, it's not an immediate
concern, but obviously a nagging worry. For Hicks, Melvin and Co.,
however, the clock is already ticking. / nn

DESPITE SKULL FRACTURE FROM BRICK, WOMAN SYMPATHETIC TO ATTACKER 
</HEADLINE>
   By C.J. CHIVERS and JOHN W. FOUNTAIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A young woman who was attacked Sunday afternoon with
a concrete block on a Manhattan street left the hospital Monday,
sounding upbeat and expressing a measure of understanding for her
attacker.
</P>
<P>
   Simultaneously, dozens of detectives participated in an intense
manhunt but failed to turn up the assailant.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, Tiffany Goldberg, 25, was discharged from Bellevue
Hospital Center at 4:45 p.m. just one day after a man rushed up to
her from behind on East 29th Street and, in what the police
described as a botched robbery attempt, slammed her head with a
five-pound shard of concrete, fracturing her skull. The attack
occurred minutes after she had left services at Marble Collegiate
Church, where she is a member of the gospel choir.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg, a 1996 graduate of Sarah Lawrence College, has been
accepted to a master's program in clinical social work at Columbia
University. She said Monday that she herself had struggled
academically as a child, but succeeded with the help of adults, and
that the man who attacked her might have needed similar attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy who attacked me, 20 years ago, was probably a
struggling kid,'' she said. ``If anyone had reached him when he was
younger, maybe he wouldn't have done what he did.''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting up in her bed before leaving the hospital, Goldberg said
she had been lucky to survive the assault but remembered little of
it, other than the image of the man who came to her aid, Lt. James
Hurley, an off-duty city firefighter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was walking down 29th Street, and the next thing I remember
I was waking up,'' she said. ``Some gentleman was kneeling over me,
trying to wake me up.''
</P>
<P>
   Lorinda Klein, a hospital spokeswoman, said that in addition to
suffering a skull fracture, Goldberg had a large cut on the back of
her head, a black eye and two shattered front teeth, injuries that
apparently occurred when she pitched face-first into the sidewalk
after she had been struck.
</P>
<P>
   But two CAT scans revealed no neurological damage, Klein said,
and Goldberg was expected to recover without complications.
Goldberg walked from the emergency ward accompanied by Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani's community assistance aides, bound for an
undisclosed location. Her spirits were high.
</P>
<P>
   The attack on Goldberg, with its similarities to the brick
attack on another young woman, Nicole Barrett, in Midtown last
fall, spurred an intense and wide-ranging police investigation.
Late Sunday night, the police began circulating a sketch of the
attacker, whom they described as a chubby and unkempt black man
with a crooked nose. They said he was about 5 feet 7 inches tall,
weighed 180-200 pounds and was believed to be homeless.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives were canvassing locations where homeless people
gather. One investigator said a witness, a homeless man, told
detectives that he had seen the assailant running down the street
after the attack and recognized him as a familiar street person.
But the investigator said the police had not corroborated this
account, and had not narrowed their search to a specific
individual.
</P>
<P>
   By nightfall Monday, the police said they had no clear suspects.
They detained a few men based on their resemblance to the sketch,
they said, but released them all after interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials said they also discounted speculation that the
man who had attacked Goldberg was the same man who had attacked
Barrett. A street hustler with an extensive criminal record, Paris
Drake, has been charged with attempted murder in connection with
the attack on Barrett and is being held at the Queens House of
Detention.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials said the latest attack had not given them any
doubts about their case against Drake, who has pleaded innocent.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As the investigation into the attack on Goldberg continued,
Goldberg's friends clustered around her in the hospital or waited
for news of her condition. From her hometown in Madison, Wis., to
her apartment building in Spanish Harlem, to the Bryant Park Grill,
where she worked, her friends all described a responsible young
woman with a charitable streak.
</P>
<P>
   Alfred Colucci, a retired principal of Madison West High School,
from which she graduated in 1992, remembered her as someone who
``never, ever caused anyone any problems.''
</P>
<P>
   One friend, Rachael Blair, supervised Goldberg in February when
she was part of a 13-woman team of volunteers that traveled to
Coban, Guatemala, and built three homes for Habitat for Humanity
International. She impressed Blair as a collegial and hard worker.
</P>
<P>
   ``She never complained; she was an absolute delight,'' she said.

c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ As soon as Don Nelson plucked Sidney Moncrief out of
the college coaching ranks two months ago, the speculation started.
Was Moncrief, the former Arkansas Razorbacks star and Milwaukee
Bucks standout under Nelson, being groomed to succeed his onetime
mentor as Mavs head coach?
</P>
<P>
   Fair enough question and nothing new for the myriad of Mavs
assistants. Whether it's Donnie Nelson or Del Harris or the
recently departed Gar Heard, most Mavs aids have been the subject
of similar conjecture.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike those other guys, Moncrief welcomes the talk.
Moncrief wants to be the Mavs coach when Don Nelson moves into the
general- manager role full time in three years and he's not afraid
to say it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a head-coach position becomes open, I'm certainly qualified
to be a head coach in the NBA,'' Moncrief said after a minicamp
practice recently. ``I have a lot to learn, obviously, but working
under Nellie is going to help the learning process happen a lot
quicker.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not any doubt in my mind that I can be a head coach in
the NBA and I want to do it here with the Mavericks.''
</P>
<P>
   If that's the plan, no one is saying, but Don Nelson and Mavs
owner Mark Cuban are in agreement when it comes to Moncrief's
value.
</P>
<P>
   ``He brings the level of intensity that Sidney Moncrief was
known for on the court,'' Cuban said. ``He's been-there, done-that
and he's respected by the guys. He's young enough that he can
relate and talk to all the guys. It's a world that's not foreign to
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Nelson: ``He's another quality guy on the bench. Sidney is
quality all the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Moncrief proved his playing worth during an 11-year career, 10
of which were spent with the Bucks and eight under Nelson. Moncrief
averaged 15.6 points and 4.7 rebounds over that span, made the
All-Star team five times and earned Defensive Player of the Year
honors twice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think a lot of these guys are old enough to remember
my career; some remember my name in passing,'' said Moncrief, 4-23
in one season as Arkansas-Little Rock coach. ``But that doesn't
mean they don't relate to me. If you respect them as people and
have a genuine concern for their game on the basketball court, I
think players do respond to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the past two years, Nelson has offered Moncrief several
front-office positions with the club, but those jobs didn't fit
with Moncrief's career goals. Moncrief acknowledged the timing of
Nelson's latest offer was awkward _ he felt leaving Arkansas-Little
Rock after one season wasn't fair to the school _ but he jumped at
the chance to get back into the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``To get in with an organization that's going places, with a
knowledgeable aggressive owner, to coach under Don Nelson and have
the opportunity to learn under him was something I couldn't pass
on,'' he said. ``It had to be a good opportunity for me
professionally to even go anywhere and it also had to be a place I
wanted to live, and the Metroplex is someplace we feel
comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   Moncrief is also excited about the Mavs' prospects in the coming
years. The team got rolling after Cuban came on board last season
and rallied to finish 40-42 _ its best record in a decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the nucleus,'' Moncrief said. ``They have players that
can play more than one position, which has always been important to
me as a player and as a coach that you have players that are very
versatile. I think they're very hungry to win and they're good
people.''
</P>
<P>
   And he's ready to lead the charge ... someday.
</P>
<P>
   ``That certainly doesn't intimidate me, but I'm realistic enough
to know that Mark Cuban has very high expectations for this
ballclub and he's going to do what he feels is in the best interest
to move the team forward,'' Moncrief said. \Nsubheds:Buckner,
Grizzlies agree Restricted free-agent guard Greg Buckner has agreed
to a three-year, $2.5 million deal with Vancouver and plans to sign
with the Pacific Division team on Aug. 1. The Mavs have offered
Buckner a contract starting at about $500,000 per year.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban said he would probably match any offer Buckner receives to
keep him. Buckner, who participated in minicamp, won't play in the
summer league games starting today.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavs' other free-agent guard, Hubert Davis, is being courted
by seven teams, including the Mavs, who have offered a one-year
deal worth between $3.5 million and $4 million. Davis, who has not
ruled out the Mavs, is seeking a contract for approximately four
years and $10 million. \Nsubheds:Briefly The Mavs' summer league
team left for Long Beach, Calif., last night and they'll play the
Los Angeles Clippers at 5:30 p.m. today. Willie Sublett won't be
making the trip as the only minicamp cut.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's second-round pick, 7-foot center Wang Zhi Zhi,
recently completed a solid regular season for the China CBA
All-Stars in the Asian Basketball Association League. He scored 17
points while playing in an all-star game against players from the
United States. Former TCU star Mike Jones scored 22 points for the
Americans, who beat the Chinese team, 95-78.
</P>
<P>
   Zhi Zhi averaged 14.7 points and 5.4 rebounds, and shot 61.8
percent from the field and 83.6 percent from the free-throw line.
The All-Stars are facing the NBA Ambassadors in the ABAL
best-of-there finals, which began last night in Beijing.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1992, author Tom Clancy embarked on a philanthropic mission
worthy of Jack Ryan, the idealistic hero of his popular
techno-thrillers.
</P>
<P>
   Clancy wanted to help children who had cancer and other grave
illnesses use the nascent technology of the Internet to talk with
one another and learn about their diseases.
</P>
<P>
   The children's health network he imagined would also enable
parents to search out the best doctors, no matter how disadvantaged
or isolated the family might be. And it would let doctors tap into
the same worldwide database to share their expertise and find the
latest research.
</P>
<P>
   Clancy's inspiration was a 6-year-old Long Island, N.Y., boy,
Kyle Haydock, who sent him a fan letter while the boy lay in his
bed at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York City,
ravaged by sarcoma. At the height of his fame, Clancy fell hard for
Kyle and befriended him. He showered the boy with gifts, visited
his hospital room and even wheeled him around Disney World. ``This
little guy was a fighter,'' he later wrote in an essay.
</P>
<P>
   After Kyle died in 1991, Clancy set up a foundation and named it
for the boy. He donated more than $4 million from his fortune and
committed one-third of the proceeds from his next Jack Ryan movie,
according to his lawyer and foundation records.
</P>
<P>
   Clancy also used his fame and political connections to persuade
others to donate several million dollars more in cash and services.
The captains of powerful companies like Viacom joined the
foundation's board, as did big-name friends like the actor Tom
Selleck.
</P>
<P>
   But seven years later, Clancy is scuttling the Kyle Foundation,
which despite having spent more than $5 million on travel,
salaries, fund raising and furniture did not even have a Web site
to show for its efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The demise of one of the nation's more than 700,000 charities
typically unfolds without public scrutiny. Nameplates are removed
from doors, checking accounts are closed, and the directors move on
without comment. But the legal mud fight that has broken out in a
Denver courtroom over the failure of the Kyle Foundation offers a
rare glimpse at the inner workings of a celebrity charity.
</P>
<P>
   What went wrong is a matter of heated dispute. Clancy, in court
papers, accuses the woman he hired to run the foundation of
mismanagement and improper expenditures. She vehemently denies that
accusation and says Clancy killed off the project at the very
moment it was about to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual step, the IRS is examining the charity's financial
records to decide whether to revoke its tax-deductible status.
Donors would have to pay back taxes on their gifts if they had
reason to know the foundation was not performing its mission.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS, Clancy has said in a letter to the foundation's board,
is ``citing long delay in product rollout, limited charitable work
to date, high foundation expenses for salaries, travel and fund
raising.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends and associates say they do not blame Clancy for
undertaking what they see as a visionary project. Several, however,
faulted him for failing to keep a closer eye on a venture whose
success hinged on the deft use of an infant technology.
</P>
<P>
   A board member who ran a $29 billion computer company said he
twice told Clancy in 1997 that the foundation was floundering and
that its management was weak.
</P>
<P>
   The 53-year-old writer, who is completing his 11th novel,
brushed aside such warnings and did not act until last summer, when
he dispatched an accountant and then a retired Navy vice admiral to
take a closer look at the operation, board members said.
</P>
<P>
   Their reports in hand, Clancy sprang into action.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 11, a Friday morning, he summoned the foundation's
executive director, Katherine Gorshow, to his Maryland home and
demanded that she resign, according to court papers. Then, before
she could fly back to its offices in Englewood, Colo., he sent a
team of former agents from the FBI to secure the premises and
change the locks.
</P>
<P>
   It was an abrupt ending to a partnership that grew from a chance
meeting on the Internet to Gorshow's participation last year as
bridesmaid in Clancy's wedding.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Gorshow is suing the foundation, accusing it of breach of
contract in a state court in Denver, saying in court papers that
she had made ``significant progress'' toward taking the health
network online later this year. Indeed, new backers of the
foundation, including Sybase Inc., a software company, continue to
express enthusiastic support for the project.
</P>
<P>
   Clancy replied in court filings this month that Gorshow misused
foundation money for private purposes, including personal travel.
Gorshow denied the accusations through her lawyers. Clancy declined
to be interviewed for this article, saying, ``I'm gagged.''
</P>
<P>
   Kyle's mother, Eileen Haydock, of Baldwin, N.Y., said she began
having doubts about the foundation several years ago and
discouraged her friends from contributing. Still, Haydock said she
had nothing but admiration for Clancy and his efforts to honor her
son and help sick children. ``I think he felt that he had let down
my son,'' she said, ``and that's not true.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   There was little about Clancy's life that prepared him for
starting a multimillion-dollar foundation. He majored in English at
Loyola College in Baltimore, then sold insurance to tobacco and
corn farmers on the Chesapeake Bay.
</P>
<P>
   The unexpected success in 1985 of his first novel, ``The Hunt
for Red October,'' began a lucrative career that led to a string of
best-selling novels and popular movies made from them.
</P>
<P>
   His financial empire grew to include more than a dozen
businesses that have produced not only his major books like
``Patriot Games'' and ``Clear and Present Danger,'' but also
videogames, military manuals and serial novels written with others.
He bought a share of the Baltimore Orioles baseball team, and under
his latest deal with Putnam Publishing he earns $19 million for
each novel completed, according to court records.
</P>
<P>
   Associates say Clancy's considerable fortune has attracted
people with a host of causes and offbeat investment opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a very, very trusting man,'' said Diana Patin, Clancy's
former, longtime secretary. ``He accepted people as they put
themselves to him.''
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1990s, Clancy and his first wife, Wanda, lost $1.3
million to a coin dealer who is to be sentenced on Friday for
defrauding them and dozens of other Maryland residents. In 1996,
Clancy put $1 million into a company building a space vehicle that
uses a propeller to land like a helicopter. The company has since
scaled back its operations because of a lack of money.
</P>
<P>
   And, more recently, Clancy has helped a former CIA operative
turned cartoonist, Chip Beck, finance his investigation into
whether the U.S. government abandoned some of its troops taken
prisoner in wars fought in the 20th century. ``He gives people the
chance to prove themselves,'' Beck said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Clancy had become a fixture on the best-seller list by 1990 when
Kyle caught his attention. The boy's grandfather had read him
Clancy's first novel, and then he ``just about memorized'' a video
of the resulting movie, Clancy wrote in an essay encouraging others
to befriend a sick child. ``Each of them, however ill, is alive and
needful of the same things that we all need: love, friendship,
conversation,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   One of his first acts after creating the Kyle Foundation was to
hire Gorshow, whom he had met online in a discussion group run by
America Online, where she was a volunteer. He had a computer
glitch; she had the solution.
</P>
<P>
   Gorshow had been a college instructor and school administrator,
and she owned a mail-order, bulk-food distribution concern.
</P>
<P>
   In a chronology filed in Denver District Court, Gorshow
describes the foundation, in her first three years with it, as a
shoestring operation run from her home in Oroville, Calif., and
dogged by false starts. But by 1996, her starting salary of $43,000
had risen to $120,000, and fund raising took off when Clancy signed
a pledge to give $5 million in 10 installments, as well as the
future Jack Ryan movie proceeds.
</P>
<P>
   Clancy's enthusiasm for the project helped attract other big
gifts, including $1 million from Viacom, and $750,000 from Lew
Wasserman, the founder of MCA, and the MCA foundation. Aboard a
110-foot yacht off the coast of Vancouver, British Columbia, Clancy
secured $100,000 from John McCaw, cofounder of McCaw Cellular.
</P>
<P>
   While most of the money appears to have come from his
well-heeled friends, Clancy did use his fame to reach out to the
public as well. In November 1997 he appeared on ``Jeopardy,'' where
he announced he would donate his $10,000 consolation prize to the
foundation.
</P>
<P>
   But there were bumps on the implementation side. As the
foundation's executive director, Gorshow said she labored at a wide
range of activities _from securing an Internet address for the Web
site to building a prototype database of information about
pediatric oncology, which involved hiring college students to
translate some foreign-language documents.
</P>
<P>
   One major endeavor turned into a dead end. The foundation had
wanted to put computers in the homes and hospital rooms of sick
children. Gorshow said she discovered that other charities were
trying to do the same thing, and that pilot projects had turned up
a concern: There was not enough time to teach very ill children how
to use the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Other aspects of the original concept fell by the wayside,
including the notion of having cartoon characters answer questions
from children. But even the basic mission _ building a one-stop
directory to a million or so places to get health information _
began to seem elusive to the board.
</P>
<P>
   David R. Dukes, then the co-chairman of Ingram Micro, the
nation's largest wholesale distributor of computers, said he became
so convinced the foundation would not succeed that he resigned from
the board in mid-1997, rather than help the foundation raise more
money.
</P>
<P>
   Dukes said he told Clancy _ in person and later on the phone _
that with Gorshow as the foundation's leader, ``it became clear
this thing would not be able to go forward the way that it ought
to.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But, back at the time,'' Dukes said, ``I think, he was still
very enamored with her, and I'm not sure he wanted to hear that.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Kyle's mother was mystified. She said the foundation did
not respond to her e-mail messages inquiring about its progress,
and that it had become such a puzzle to her that she suggested that
friends seeking to honor Kyle donate to other charities.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Clancy's personal life began intersecting with the
foundation in unusual ways. When he ended a 1995 affair with a
woman he met online, the Manhattan penthouse they had shared was
cleared out by Gorshow and the foundation's director of operations,
according to foundation records.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, another woman he met online unsuccessfully
sued him for breaking off their engagement. She then alerted
federal and state officials in California to possible mismanagement
of foundation funds, the officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, Clancy's new wife, Alexandra Llewellyn, began
raising her own concerns about the foundation, prompting him to
send her family's accountant to examine the books, an associate of
Clancy said.
</P>
<P>
   The accountant delivered his report in February. Clancy, in his
Feb. 24 letter to the board, listed some of its highlights:
$636,628 spent on travel through 1998, $700,000 on consultants and
$100,154 on a one-time payout last year to Gorshow for accrued
vacation and sick pay.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation, the accountant discovered, had been fined
$20,000 by the IRS for tardy filing of its 1997 tax returns.
</P>
<P>
   Gorshow, in her letter to the board, defended the expenditures,
saying the travel was legitimate and the vacation pay stemmed from
concerns raised by the foundation's auditor.
</P>
<P>
   Clancy asked a retired vice admiral, William McCauley, to assess
whether it was worth putting more money into the Kyle Foundation.
McCauley said he concluded that other medical Web sites had
eclipsed Clancy's dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got co-opted,'' McCauley said.
</P>
<P>
   Others disagree. In January, Sybase had agreed to give the
foundation its novel Web site portal program and the services of
seven engineers to get it online, and as late as March the company
was formulating a commitment it valued at $1 million a year for as
long as a decade. At the same time, a design concern had come up
with a foundation logo and was midway through its $500,000
commitment to creating a Web site for the foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Internet venture experts say that despite the proliferation of
medical information sites in recent years, the idea behind the Kyle
Foundation remains not only viable, but potentially profitable as
well. ``There is definitely need and demand for this type of
project,'' said Deborah Buresh, a director at Shattuck Hammond
Partners, the health care investment-banking division of
PricewaterhouseCoopers Securities.
</P>
<P>
   About $700,000 in foundation money remains, and Clancy has come
up with a much simpler way to spend it. He now plans to endow a
pediatric oncology research chair at the Johns Hopkins University
School of Medicine, to be named after Kyle. Clancy entered into an
agreement with Johns Hopkins that calls for him to add to that sum
until it reaches $2 million over the next three years, the
institution said.
</P>
<P>
   No future movie proceeds are involved.

FUTURIST KNOWN AS FM-2030 DEAD AT 69 
</HEADLINE>
   (Attn: Calif., Fla., Ariz.) 
 By DOUGLAS MARTIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A futurist who changed his given name to something a
little more forward looking, FM-2030 to be specific, died Saturday
night at a friend's Manhattan apartment. An author, teacher and
consultant to corporations, he was 69 and lived in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   The FM might have stood for Future Man, Future Modular or Future
Marvel, but he never said. He also did not like to answer questions
about his nationality, because he apparently considered himself a
citizen of the world and unconcerned with national boundaries. He
avoided questions about his age, because his latest artificial hip
was only two years old, making the question, in his view,
meaningless.
</P>
<P>
   But FM-2030 would have turned 100 in 2030. And, if his plans are
realized, he still might.
</P>
<P>
   FM-2030, who was known for his sunny optimism, had directed that
his body be frozen by an Arizona foundation specializing in such
things in the hope that doctors in the future will find a cure for
pancreatic cancer, which his longtime friend Flora Schnall said was
the cause of death.
</P>
<P>
   Part of his futuristic vision is the idea that people will
eventually become wholly made of synthetic parts, as their minds
are transported vast distances through space. He predicted that
humans would become ``post-biological organisms.''
</P>
<P>
   He was ``launched,'' his word for birth, F.M. Esfandiary on Oct.
15, 1930, and legally changed his name in the mid-1970s.
</P>
<P>
   He said that someday a Santa Claus machine would produce
three-dimensional objects in the manner of copying machines. This,
combined with free energy from the sun, would produce limitless
resources and eliminate competition.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional families would be replaced by a Club Med morality, a
good thing in the estimation of a man who never married because he
resented the idea of humans belonging to other humans. Energy and
other natural resources would be essentially limitless, he
contended. Humans would become immortal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a matter of time before we reconstitute our bodies
into something entirely different, something more space-adaptable,
something that will be viable across the solar system and beyond,''
he wrote in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``He thought that death was tyrannical,'' said Schnall, a
Manhattan lawyer. ``He wanted to do away with death.''
</P>
<P>
   He saw himself as an anachronism. ``I am a 21st-century person
who was accidentally born into the 20th,'' he said. ``I have a deep
nostalgia for the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of his predictions were prescient. In a 1977 interview, he
spoke of correcting genetic flaws and of fertilization and
gestation outside the body. In 1980, he wrote of teleconferencing,
telemedicine and teleshopping. He argued against the assumption
that many more nursing homes would be needed in the 21st century,
on the basis that health standards would improve, making nursing
homes less necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is gutsy and truly a visionary,'' the futurist Alvin
Toffler told the Los Angeles Times in 1989. ``One doesn't have to
agree with everything he says to be refreshed by it.''
</P>
<P>
   F.M. Esfandiary was the son of an Iranian diplomat. He was born
in Belgium and lived in 17 countries in the first 11 years of his
life. He said the experience influenced him to think of himself as
a global citizen, and said there were no illegal immigrants, just
irrelevant borders.
</P>
<P>
   His looks and abilities helped him play citizen of the world.
Courtly and handsome, he spoke Arabic, French, Hebrew and English.
In the 1948 Olympics, he competed in basketball and wrestling for
Iran. His novels were ``The Day of Sacrifice,'' ``The Beggar'' and
``Identity Card.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the Iranian Revolution in 1979, the novelist Anne
Tyler wrote that ``Identity Card,'' published in 1966, was ``the
perfect way to find out why so many fists are raised in Iran
today.'' She called the book ``funny, infuriating and very, very
good.''
</P>
<P>
   His books about the future were ``Optimism One,''
``Telespheres'' and ``Are You Transhuman?'' He was revising two
others, ``Countdown to Immortality'' and ``The Coming Age of
Abundance'' when he fell ill.
</P>
<P>
   He taught at the New School for Social Research in Manhattan,
the University of California at Los Angeles and Florida
International University in Miami. He was a consultant for
Lockheed, J.C. Penney and Rockwell International, Florida
International University officials said.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by four sisters, Fereshteh Jahanbani of New York;
Farideh Sadjadi of Baltimore; Behjat Ghanbari of Bushehr, Iran; and
Fouruzandeh Moghimi of Baltimore and Tehran; and a brother, Mohsen
Esfandiary of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   For now, his body is in Scottsdale, Ariz., immersed in liquid
nitrogen in a thermos tank at the Alcor Life Extension Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation noted in a news release that no frozen mammal has
been successfully thawed.
</P>
<P>
   Though FM-2030 acknowledged that he would have no money if he
woke, he said he would not care.

 GASOLINE PRICES DROP BELOW $1.50 A GALLON AT MANY kc AREA STATIONS (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 BY GENE MEYER, THE KANSAS CITY STAR   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gasoline prices dropped below $1.50 a gallon Monday in much of
the Kansas City area for the first time since the start of the peak
summer driving season.
</P>
<P>
   The drop wasn't universal however.
</P>
<P>
   While many QuikTrips and nearby competitors were posting $1.499
a gallon for lead-free regular as the morning commute began, a
midday check of other stations across the metropolitan area found
the $1.52 to $1.65 prices that AAA of Missouri reported in its
latest survey, taken Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Saudi Arabia's announcement last week of planned production
increases and the correction of some Midwestern market troubles
probably contributed most to the latest drop, federal government
analysts and other industry observers said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   What happens next is open to question.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prices will probably go a little lower, but I don't think
we're going to see last year's prices any time soon,'' said Mike
Right, spokesman for AAA of Missouri in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City motorists were filling up for an average of about
$1.06 a gallon this time last year. But crude oil prices at $30 a
barrel and wholesale gasoline prices at 87 cents a gallon are about
50 percent higher than then, Right said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our expectations are for a flattening out or a modest
decline'' in gasoline prices in July, said David Costello, a
spokesman for the Energy Information Administration in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Prices so far have fallen further and faster from mid-June peaks
in the Midwest than in most other parts of the United States, and
the pressure in places such as West Coast markets is pushing up
rather than down, Costello said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe prices will be volatile,'' said Debbi Graham, a
spokeswoman for QuikTrip Corp. ``There is no way we are going to
predict in any form what they will do.''
</P>
<P>
   Cities with some of the nation's dirtiest air were required to
start using cleaner-burning gasoline June 1. That caused storage
and distribution problems in many places.
</P>
<P>
   Prices at the pump have been gradually falling since about
mid-June as those storage and distribution problems were overcome.
Saudi Arabia's announcement last week that it intends to increase
crude oil production by 500,000 barrels a day will help bring
production nearer in line with expected demand, the Energy
Department said in a short-term energy outlook report for July.
</P>
<P>
   Presuming events unfold as expected, the department calculates
that prices through the rest of the summer will balance out
nationally somewhere near $1.63 a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Monday, President Clinton announced a plan to borrow 2
million barrels of oil from the nation's strategic petroleum
reserve to provide price relief for heating oil users in the
Northeast this winter if it is needed.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is expected to have no effect on fuel prices, Costello
said.

LAND CHARGES FILED IN INVESTIGATION OF LAND TRUST OF JACKSON COUNTY
 
</HEADLINE>
 BC- LAND-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 BY CHRISTINE VENDEL and LYNN HORSLEY, THE KANAS CITY STAR   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Prosecutors on Monday accused the former
office manager of Land Trust of Jackson County, her husband and the
agency's former attorney of engaging in questionable land deals.
</P>
<P>
   Ardie Khan, 53, and Hameed M. Khan, 55, were charged with three
felony counts of violating the state's Land Trust law. Henry Duke
Bledsoe, the attorney for Land Trust, was charged with one count.
Each felony count carries a penalty of two to five years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the three were not in custody but had agreed to
surrender later this week. They could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Land Trust is a state agency that disposes of tax-foreclosed
properties in Jackson County that do not sell at courthouse
auctions. It has an inventory of about 3,000 lots, mostly vacant
and in the inner city.
</P>
<P>
   The trust, acting in a caretaker role, is set up to sell
properties under its control. Proceeds from those sales are to be
distributed by a set formula to Kansas City, Jackson County the
Kansas City school district.
</P>
<P>
   In February, a state audit found that the agency was mismanaged
and had scores of missing or incomplete files. Kansas City fraud
detectives then seized the agency's records, and the office ceased
operations. A special prosecutor, Mark Jones, was assigned to the
case.
</P>
<P>
   According to court records, a four-month investigation by police
and the FBI found that two properties were allegedly stolen from
the Land Trust inventory. The properties were deeded to Hameed Khan
and the deals were made with the help of Ardie Khan, who was
employed by Land Trust under the name of Ardie Shannon.
</P>
<P>
   Court records showed that Hameed Khan submitted a bid of $2,000
to buy a house at 2202 E. 14th St. in 1997. Hameed Khan paid $1,300
for the house and received the title without paying the remaining
$700.
</P>
<P>
   The property was subsequently condemned. The Khans filed a
lawsuit to recover their ``losses,'' and Bledsoe assisted with the
lawsuit. The city paid $10,602 to Hameed Khan as part of a
court-ordered settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Hameed Khan also bid $6,200 in 1998 to buy a house at 2019
Benton Blvd. The property was deeded to him, but no payments were
received, according to court records.
</P>
<P>
   Another alleged violation came in the form of a lawn mowing
contract. Hameed Khan was the highest paid mower for Land Trust,
even though the law forbids spouses of employees from being
employed as vendors. Hameed Khan received more than $60,000 as a
mowing contractor.
</P>
<P>
   The court records stated that Bledsoe knew of the Khans'
marriage and the mowing contract, but he did nothing to correct the
violation.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Monday's charges were part of an ongoing
investigation, with the possibility of more people being charged.
</P>
<P>
   After the audit was released, Mayor Kay Barnes named former City
Councilwoman Aggie Stackhaus to replace Robert Newsome as chairman
of the Land Trust Board. The board consists of representatives from
the city, the county and the Kansas City School District.
</P>
<P>
   Stackhaus said Monday she was determined to reform the way the
agency does business.
</P>
<P>
   ``The No. 1 priority of the new Land Trust of Jackson County is
to serve the taxpayers of Jackson County,'' Stackhaus said.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the police raid, the board fired Ardie Khan. It
later shut down the Land Trust offices and dismissed the remaining
employees, including Bledsoe and Land Commissioner Willie McCann.
</P>
<P>
   The offices remain closed, but the board has been trying to get
the files back from police and get the agency's financial affairs
in order so it can hire new staff and resume normal operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remain optimistic and hopeful we will be selling properties
again by the fall,'' Stackhaus said. ``It's all dependent upon when
we get all the records back, the condition of the files, and the
forthcoming funding from the city and county to operate this.''
</P>
<P>
   Employees from the city and the county have been sorting through
available files to try to resolve land sales that were pending when
the police investigation began.

DEMOCRATS ACCUSE ASHCROFT OF IMPROPER ACTIVITIES IN 1984 CAMPAIGN
 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 BY KEVIN MURPHY, THE KANSAS CITY STAR   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ While he was Missouri attorney general, John
Ashcroft improperly used state resources and employees during his
successful 1984 run for governor, the State Democratic Committee
alleged Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The party released a copy of an old 34-page memo that called for
using the attorney general's staff ``both in their existing on-duty
functions and in off-duty time'' for the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   David Ayres, who is managing Sen. Ashcroft's current re-election
effort, said Monday that the document was ``not our 1984 campaign
plan.''
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear who prepared the document. Ashcroft's former
staffers denied the campaign was run out of the state office.
</P>
<P>
   Ayres countered by alleging that Ashcroft's opponent, Missouri
Gov. Mel Carnahan, was the one who used state resources for
political purposes.
</P>
<P>
   He cited as one example Carnahan's listing the number of a phone
in his lieutenant governor's office in 1991 and 1992 as his
gubernatorial campaign headquarters phone in the Jefferson City
directory.
</P>
<P>
   ``This can only mean that his political campaign was run
directly out of his public office with his full knowledge and
consent,'' Ayres said.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Wyche, spokesman for the Carnahan campaign, said the phone
in question was a private line paid from political funds.
</P>
<P>
   Roy Temple, Democratic executive director, sent a letter to
Ashcroft on Monday asking him to explain how ``misuse of taxpayer
dollars'' squared with the senator's ``Missouri values'' campaign
theme.
</P>
<P>
   Several former aides to Ashcroft when he was attorney general
said they did not know the source of the memo.
</P>
<P>
   A section of the memo, dated 1983, shows the name ``DeGregorio''
at the top, an apparent reference to Paul DeGregorio, a campaign
coordinator in St. Louis. DeGregorio, who was not a state employee
at the time, said he did not recall such a memo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't remember what went on 16 years ago,'' he said earlier
this year. ``I'm sure there are many plans that may have been
written in this country for all kinds of politicians.''
</P>
<P>
   Chip Robertson, a one-time deputy attorney general, told
Ashcroft in a letter written last month that the memo, ``if it even
exists, never served as the basis for any decision or establishment
of responsibilities for your campaign for governor.'' Robertson
wrote the letter after being contacted by a reporter.
</P>
<P>
   He said Ashcroft insisted that any political work be done on
personal time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can recall waiting until 5 p.m. before doing something
(political),'' said Robertson, who later was appointed to the state
Supreme Court by Ashcroft and who now is in private law practice.
``It was a strict policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Temple charged that the policy was breached. The Democrats also
released depositions, taken during unrelated litigation, by two
former employees acknowledging some political work done during
weekday hours at the time.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-1983, Ashcroft office scheduler Tom Deuschle testified
that he attended campaign meetings during work hours, that
political calls were referred to him at the office and that he used
the office to contact potential Ashcroft supporters or
contributors.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about it six years ago, Deuschle said he worked 60
hours a week during the Ashcroft campaign, 20 percent of it on
politics. As scheduler, Deuschle would have to sometimes handle
both political and state appointments, Ashcroft said at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Sissel, press secretary then, said in a deposition in the
same case that he traveled from Jefferson City to St. Louis in
October 1982 for a weekday afternoon meeting with Deuschle,
Robertson and Duncan Kincheloe, an assistant attorney general. The
meeting was about the Ashcroft campaign, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sissel and Robertson said recently they might have taken a
vacation day that day, although vacation records are no longer
available in state archives. Kincheloe said he also took days off
from time to time for the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign memo called for expanding the capacity of the
attorney general's staff and said Ashcroft's ``programs and
positions should be aggressively communicated on a regular basis
with members of the press _ particularly in metropolitan areas.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ashcroft campaign had its own press secretary, and state
records show virtually no increase in the size of the total office
staff between early 1983 and the November 1984 election.
</P>
<P>
   But in-state travel spending by Ashcroft's office increased from
$95,253 for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1982, to $128,814 the
following year, to $191,221 the year after that and to $238,078 in
fiscal year 1985, of which only six months were during Ashcroft's
term.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1984 Republican primary, Ashcroft took heat from opponent
Gene McNary of St. Louis for taking 122 flights on the state
airplane during the first three years and five months of his second
term. By contrast, his predecessor had taken 18 flights in his last
four years.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Sissel called the trips ``completely legitimate''
efforts to apprise state residents of the attorney general's
activities in the state's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Bills for long-distance and other phone services also increased
during Ashcroft's term as attorney general. They were $122,983 in
fiscal year 1982, $119,235 the following year, $196,158 the next
year and $145,696 in fiscal year 1985, only half of which was
during his tenure.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson said an explanation for the higher phone bills may
have been litigation being carried out in Kansas City in 1983 on
the school desegregation case. Office policy, Robertson recalled,
was that using state phones for political purposes was improper.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic Party's criticism of Ashcroft's 1984 campaign is
similar to objections voiced over his using U.S. Senate employees
in his current re-election bid.
</P>
<P>
   The Ashcroft 2000 Committee showed more than 100 campaign-fund
reimbursements to Senate employees in 1998 and 1999 for travel and
other expenses. Records from the early 1980s also show about 50
reimbursements to employees of the attorney general from Ashcroft's
gubernatorial campaign committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pattern we've seen repeated,'' Temple said.
</P>
<P>
   But then, like now, the work was done on the employees' own
time, Ashcroft allies insisted. Political work by U.S. Senate
staffers is allowed under Senate rules, if voluntary and at the
expense of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Using another example against the Democrat, Ayres alluded to a
1981 incident in which an employee of Carnahan, who was then
serving as state treasurer, carried some ``Carnahan for Missouri''
files from the office and took them away in a state vehicle.
Carnahan admitted some work like that had been done.
</P>
<P>
   Wyche said Carnahan took prompt action as treasurer to make sure
the employee engaged in no more political work.
</P>
<P>
   State and federal laws prohibit using public resources, such as
employees, for personal gain, but prosecutions are relatively rare
because lines between government and political work are often
blurred.

HOME DIALYSIS MACHINE IMPROVES LIFE FOR KIDNEY PATIENTS 
</HEADLINE>
 -KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 BY ALAN BAVLEY, THE KANSAS CITY STAR   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lucille Shirley has gained a new sense of independence. Sandra
Hampton feels better than she has in years.
</P>
<P>
   Both of these kidney dialysis patients credit Zbylut Twardowski,
a University of Missouri-Columbia professor emeritus, for
dramatically improving their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Twardowski, 66, has been instrumental in developing a home
dialysis machine that Shirley, Hampton and 21 other patients are
testing.
</P>
<P>
   The high-tech device is the realization of Twardowski's
decades-old dream to improve the health and simplify the lives of
many of the more than 200,000 dialysis patients in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   If the Food and Drug Administration approves, the machine could
start appearing in homes across the country next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I strongly believe this is the best kind of dialysis,'' said
Twardowski, an internationally known kidney specialist and native
of Poland.
</P>
<P>
   ``I work on other kinds of dialysis, but I always have in mind
that this is the ultimate goal. I feel if I can accomplish this, it
will be a fulfillment of some long-term desire, some long-term
goal.''
</P>
<P>
   About 300,000 people in the United States suffer kidney failure
caused by diabetes, high blood pressure or other maladies. About
86,000 of these patients have received kidney transplants, but
because donor organs are in short supply, the rest depend on
dialysis to stay alive.
</P>
<P>
   Most dialysis patients now get their treatments three times each
week at clinics. They sit in reclining chairs for three to four
hours as their blood circulates through machines that filter out
the impurities their kidneys no longer can remove.
</P>
<P>
   Twardowski and many other researchers have concluded that
dialysis six or seven days a week is vastly superior to the three
dialysis sessions per week that have been the standard treatment
for the past quarter century.
</P>
<P>
   Patients on daily dialysis feel better, have more energy and
develop fewer infections and other medical problems, researchers
have found. They also take fewer medications and spend less time in
the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   But the expense of providing patients with additional dialysis
and the difficulty of traveling to centers several more times each
week have kept daily dialysis from catching on.
</P>
<P>
   Another form of home dialysis uses the body's peritoneum, the
membrane that surrounds the abdominal organs, to filter impurities.
But peritoneal dialysis can only be used by patients who retain
some kidney function and who weigh less than 200 pounds. And the
large amount of work it requires has limited its popularity among
patients.
</P>
<P>
   Twardowski hopes his machine will make dialysis six days per
week as affordable as conventional thrice-weekly dialysis and easy
enough for patients to perform at home. As many as half the
patients now receiving conventional dialysis may be candidates for
the home machine, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Patients connect themselves to the machine by an intravenous
catheter or needle, then turn the machine on using push-button
controls on a small computer screen. Dialysis sessions usually last
two to three hours.
</P>
<P>
   The machine is programmed to disinfect itself after each use and
then prepare for the next dialysis session. Patients replace the
machine's tubing and blood filter once a month.
</P>
<P>
   Patients in Missouri, Seattle and Jackson, Miss., are
participating in the machine's clinical trial.
</P>
<P>
   Final results will be in this fall. At that time, Aksys Ltd., a
suburban Chicago company that was started to develop the machine,
will apply to the FDA for permission to market it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have to deal with dialysis in your life, definitely,
this is the way to go,'' said Hampton, 58, of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton suffers from an inherited condition called polycystic
kidney disease. Her kidneys began to fail when she was in her 20s
and she has been completely dependent on dialysis for close to 10
years.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton used to take seven pills a day to control her high blood
pressure, a problem common among kidney patients. Now she is down
to one pill a day, and her blood pressure is better controlled.
</P>
<P>
   Dialysis three times per week at a clinic left her feeling
exhausted, Hampton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You crash,'' she said. ``You have what we call the dialysis
hangover.''
</P>
<P>
   Now she feels energetic enough to cook more meals and work
longer hours at her job selling Avon products.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get up in the morning, clean my blood and get on with my
day,'' Hampton said.
</P>
<P>
   When patients receive dialysis three times per week, their body
is on a constant, stressful roller-coaster ride, doctors say.
Toxins build up in their blood, are removed and then build up
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, daily dialysis is better than three times a week.
Three times a week doesn't make sense,'' said Robert Lockridge, a
Lynchburg, Va., kidney specialist.
</P>
<P>
   Lockridge has 16 patients on daily home dialysis, using
conventional dialysis machines.
</P>
<P>
   After going on daily dialysis, his patients have scored higher
on tests of psychological well-being, their time spent in the
hospital has been cut by 50 percent, and several have returned to
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a better quality of care,'' Lockridge said.
</P>
<P>
   Shirley, 60, of Fayette, Mo., had been on daily home dialysis
with a conventional machine before receiving one of Twardowski's
experimental models.
</P>
<P>
   The old machine was too complicated for Shirley to operate, so
she relied on her husband, Robert, to do the work.
</P>
<P>
   ``To look at it was intimidating. I did not know how to do any
of it alone,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   That meant Robert spent an hour each day rigging the machine
with new tubing and filter, stayed with her during three hours of
dialysis and then spent another hour pulling off the old tubing.
</P>
<P>
   Lucille Shirley felt she had imposed an enormous burden on her
husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was my disease, but it took my husband the time every day
to do it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   With the new machine, Shirley said she feels confident doing
home dialysis on her own.
</P>
<P>
   Two big obstacles stood in the way of developing a daily home
dialysis machine, said Leslie Spry, a kidney specialist in Lincoln,
Neb., and a spokesman for the American Kidney Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Because dialysis machines circulate a patient's blood outside
the body, they must be highly reliable, Spry said. And connecting
tubes to patients' veins every day to carry blood to and from the
machine increases the risk of infection.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are the two critical issues that no one has solved
yet,'' Spry said. ``If (Twardowski) has, the dialysis world will
beat a path to his door.''
</P>
<P>
   Twardowski believes he has surmounted those obstacles. His
machine contains a variety of sensors that detect leaks and monitor
the temperature and composition of the chemical solution used by
the machine.
</P>
<P>
   Infections have not been a problem, Twardowski said. Lockridge
also said infections have been rare among his daily dialysis
patients.
</P>
<P>
   Twardowski has been an advocate of daily dialysis since he did
his first studies on patients in Poland about 25 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought about this machine even in Poland, but I really
didn't have support from industry. Industry wasn't interested,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin Cowley, a kidney specialist at the University of Kansas
Medical Center, called Twardowski ``one of the old gurus of
dialysis.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been one of the leaders in dialysis therapy for years, an
elder statesman, if you will, for optimizing care for people on
dialysis.''
</P>
<P>
   With the help of Aksys founder Rodney Kenley, Twardowski
co-designed and patented his home dialysis machine. In 1996, Aksys
was able to interest a group of venture capitalists in backing the
project.
</P>
<P>
   Once it receives FDA approval, Aksys plans to lease its machines
to dialysis centers, which will provide the machines to patients.
Home dialysis patients still will need to visit clinics once a
month for check-ups and stay in phone contact in-between times.
</P>
<P>
   Dialysis centers receive about $20,000 per year from Medicare to
provide treatment to a patient. The machines will lease for less
than that, Twardowski hopes.
</P>
<P>
   If the machines are successful, Twardowski stands to make a
substantial amount of money.

BUSINESS JANUS BATTLED TO GO IT SOWN WAY IN KC SOUTHERN'S SPINOFF

   KANSAS CITY, _ Mo. To the eyes in Denver, the setup looks like a
shopping spree waiting to happen, with Rowland and the other
Stilwell executives, all of whom come from Kansas City Southern,
picking the merchandise and with Janus' cash flow footing the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no basis to justify the holding company other than
Rowland's desire to have a platform to do other acquisitions,''
said Stolper, who still owns shares in Janus and makes no secret of
his allegiance to Bailey.
</P>
<P>
   Constant, the Lehman Brothers analyst, said the fear was
unfounded. He said Kansas City Southern had made assurances in
meetings with analysts that it didn't plan to use Stilwell's
capital for a string of acquisitions. Most likely it will use the
cash to buy back Stilwell shares in the open market, he said.

value, and the lO(Wv16OQ &QL; $3M

BAY AREA ACTIVISTS FILE LAWSUIT TO STOP CONSTRUCTION OF
DELANO  PRISON
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By HENRY K. LEE 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A coalition of activists filed a lawsuit Monday in hopes of
blocking a planned maximum-security prison in the Central Valley,
saying a decline in the state inmate population makes it
unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   In a lawsuit filed in Kern County Superior Court in Bakersfield,
two Bay Area anti-prison groups accused the state Department of
Corrections of not considering alternatives to the planned $335
million prison in Delano, such as using the money for schools and
rehabilitation programs.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, citing the California Environmental Quality Act,
said corrections officials did not adequately provide ways to
lessen the effect the 4,700-bed prison would have on local schools
and transportation, water and sewage systems.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs, Critical Resistance of Oakland and the National
Lawyers Guild Prison Law Project in San Francisco, also cited
figures, released by the corrections department last week, showing
that the state prison population over the last year dropped for the
first time in more than two decades, a period that coincided with a
prison-building boom.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all for investment in Delano but we're not for more
prisons,'' said Rose Braz, program director of Critical Resistance
and an Oakland criminal defense lawyer. ``The way to reduce
juvenile crime is not through further incarceration.''
</P>
<P>
   State corrections department spokeswoman Jeanie Esajian said
Monday that she could not comment on the lawsuit because the
department had not been served with it.
</P>
<P>
   But Esajian did say there is a need for the prison.
Inmate-population projections to be released in the fall are
expected to to be higher, she said, because the figures will be the
first to factor in the effect of Proposition 21, the voter-approved
initiative that toughens the penalties for juvenile offenders.
</P>
<P>
   As for the lawsuit's assertion that the state did not meet
provisions of the environmental quality act, Esajian said it was
the Corrections Department's policy to ``fully comply'' with the
statute.
</P>
<P>
   As of June, California's 33 state prisons housed 161,000
inmates. Esajian said the figure will grow to nearly 179,000 by
2005.
</P>
<P>
   Delano, a city of 30,000, has been home since 1993 to the North
Kern State Prison, a medium-security facility. The bulk of the
money for the new prison, known as Delano II, is to come from
revenue bonds, and the Legislature last year allocated $24 million
to purchase land for the facility.
</P>
<P>
   Delano II would house 4,100 maximum-security inmates considered
to be violent offenders, 408 minimum-security inmates and 192
juvenile offenders.
</P>
<P>
   Even after the prison is built, Esajian said, the state will
still have 6,000 maximum-security inmates who are housed in
converted, lesser-security facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Dean Florez, D-Shafter (Kern County), the author of
the bill calling for the prison, said the lawsuit is ill-advised
and the result of groups unfamiliar with Delano.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once again we have urban-oriented groups trying to tell rural
communities what's good and not good for our communities, Florez
said. He said the citizens and leaders of Delano, a city of 30,000,
have embraced the new prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody wants to talk tough on crime, but yet when it comes
to building institutions, no one wants it in the backyard,'' Florez
said. ``The city of Delano has said we do want it in our
backyard.''
