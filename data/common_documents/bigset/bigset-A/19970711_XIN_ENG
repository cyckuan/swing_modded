<HEADLINE> French Government to Create 2,000 Railway Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The leftist government of Prime
Minister Lionel Jospin has decided to create 2,000 jobs in the
state railway company SNCF this year, as part of its fulfilment of
promise on job creation during the legislative campaign.
</P>
<P>
The Minister of Transport, Jean-Claude Gayssot, who is from the
Communist Party, has made the decision after consulting with the
president of SNCF, Louis Gallois, reported the daily Le Monde
today.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government will reduce the 68 billion franc
deficit of SNCF by 20 billion francs (3.4 billion U.S. dollars) as
compensation for the cost of the job program, which will be paid
by the state by 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
Gayssot also has decided to maintain a decision made by the
former government and voted by parliament to open competition in
the French railway business by separating management of rail
tracks from that of trains, to turn SNCF into a user of the
railway infrastructures rather than the owner of it.
</P>
<P>
The rail tracks are now managed by the Reseau Ferre de France
(RFF), a state management administration which is in charge of
maintenance, construction and reparation of the tracks, while the
SNCF is only running the trains.
</P>
<P>
The reform of SNCF has met with strong opposition from some
unions, including the powerful and pro-Communist Confederation
Generale du Travail (CGT), whose secretary general Bernard
Thibault has asked Gayssot to scrap the reform.
</P>
<P>
The SNCF job program is believed to be a "token" given by
Jospin to his Communist allies, after the Communist Party National
Secretary Robert Hue had warned Jospin of not going back to his
campaign promises.
</P>
<P>
Jospin promised to create 350,000 public jobs as the most
important part of his campaign programs. How to apply this program
will be decided sometime around September after the Ministry of
Employment submits an investigative report.
</P>
<P>
The SNCF now has 175,000 employees, a clear drop from the
200,000 in 1991.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Senate Votes Base Closing Delay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Senate voted Wednesday
to delay the next two rounds of closings of military bases until
the government can study the economic effect of past and future
shutdown.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration had upheld that the closings of the
bases were key for the military to pare down defense budget and to
modernize the weapon systems.
</P>
<P>
The vote, 66-to-33, was seen as an ominous sign that
legislators were no longer willing to endure the political pain
for themselves and the economic pain for their constituents that
the base closings have sometimes caused.
</P>
<P>
It also revealed the doubts existing among many lawmakers that
the closings are achieving the savings that the Clinton
administration is seeking.
</P>
<P>
In its Quadrennial Defense Report released earlier this year,
the Defense Department proposed two rounds of base closings
between 1999 and 2001 to save 2.7 billion U.S. dollars a year for
the purchase of more sophisticated weapons.
</P>
<P>
The House of Representatives has omitted base closings from its
fiscal year 1998 defense spending bill.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian New Minister Denies Fire in Office </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Newly-appointed Egyptian Minister of
Public Works and Water Resources today denied that the fire which
broke out early this morning in his office was intentional, the
Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Mahmoud Abu Zeid, one of the four new comers in the country's
limited cabinet reshuffle made on Tuesday, assumed the post that
has been vacant since the death in November of Mohammed Abdel-Hadi
Radi.
</P>
<P>
The fire had caused no casualties or damage to important
equipment and communications and computer sets, according to the
minister. But the fire completely destroyed the furniture of the
office.
</P>
<P>
The fire was quickly extinguished by fire engines from Cairo
and Giza after it broke out at 0400 (0100 GMT) today on the fifth
floor of the building of the Ministry of Public Works and Water
Resources at the Cairo district of Imbaba on the Nile bank.
</P>
<P>
The minister denied that the fire had been deliberate. He was
at his office until a late hour Wednesday night and when he left,
workers were cleaning the place.
</P>
<P>
Experts of the criminal lab have been examining the place
since this morning to determine the cause of the fire and the
prosecution is carrying out investigations.
</P>
<P>
Experts and technicians suspect that the fire was caused by a
short circuit.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's cabinet shake-up brought in four new faces and
changed the ministerial portfolios among six others, in a drive to
enhance the government's efficiency and speed up its economic
reform.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda Recognizes Joining War in Former Zaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 10 (Xinhua) -- A spokesman of the Rwandan army
today confirmed that Rwanda played "a major role" in the war in
former Zaire, by supporting the forces of Laurent-Desire Kabila
engaged with the forces of President Mobutu Sese Seko, according
to Agence France-Presse (AFP).
</P>
<P>
AFP quoted Emmanuel Ndahiro, the spokesman, as saying in Kigali
that the Rwandan government has decided to recognize participation
in the war in former Zaire, because "the more we repel (an
admission), the more speculations there would be."
</P>
<P>
Rwandan Vice-President Paul Kagame told the U.S. newspaper
Washington Post published on Wednesday that the Rwandan army had
participated in the battles for the capture of several Zairian
cities, including Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
Besides Rwanda, Angola, Burundi, Uganda and Zambia are also
suspected to have been involved in the war in former Zaire, all of
them supporting Kabila.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman refused to say whether Rwandan troops are still
staying in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRCongo) or not.
</P>
<P>
Some humanitarian groups have accused Rwandan troops, manned by
Tutsis who toppled a Hutu government three years ago, of
participating in the massacre of Rwandan Hutu refugees in eastern
DRCongo during the war, as 200,000 Hutu refugees are still
unaccounted for.
</P>
<P>
The Hutu refugees fled Rwanda in the summer of 1994 after the
former Hutu government forces suffered a defeat at the hand of the
Tutsi soldiers led by the Rwandan Patriotic Front which is now in
power in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
The Hutu troops and militiamen were accused to having killed
half a million Tutsis and moderate Hutus from April to June of
1994.

<HEADLINE> Apple Computer's Head Removed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Apple Computer Inc., the pioneer
of the personal computer industry, announced Wednesday the
resignation of its chairman and chief executive, Gilbert F.
Amelio, in what was described a surprising move that cast doubt on
whether the company can be revived.
</P>
<P>
Amelio was hailed as turnaround specialist when he was named
Apple's chairman a year and half ago. Under Amelio, apple was
streamlined as operating costs and the payroll were cut sharply.
Yet, losses mounted as sales continued to fall. In the quarter
ended March 31, Apple lost another 708 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
"We've made progress in last year and half. But we're not yet
on a growth path and not on a path to sustainable profitability,"
said Fred Anderson, Apple's chief financial officer who will
temporarily take over while the board searches for a new chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
The abrupt ouster of Amelio is the latest unsettling
development for Apple. According to a report of the New York
Times, Apple's troubles today are a legacy of technological
stagnation, product missteps and management turmoil that several
rounds of layoffs and revised corporate strategies have been
unable to correct.
</P>
<P>
In the first quarter of this year, Apple's share of personal
computer sales in the United States fell sharply, to just 3.3
percent, according to the International Data Corporation, as
computer users continued to shift towards machines that operate
using the Microsoft Corporation's popular Windows software.
</P>
<P>
The departure of Amelio did not mean that the company was
falling behind in product plans or that the company would shift
course suddenly, Apple's executives said.

<P>
DHAKA, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The fifth session of the seventh
Bangladeshi Parliament was prorogued today after Speaker Humayun
Rasheed Chowdhury read out the Presidential Order of Prorogation
of the budget session.
</P>
<P>
Beginning on June 10, the session, which passed the national
budget for the 1997-98 fiscal year, also gave passage to one law
-- the Biman (anti-security) Offenses Act 1997 and introduced two
other bills for consideration of the House.
</P>
<P>
The session also witnessed several walkouts by the lawmakers of
the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP).
</P>
<P>
The BNP also enforced a nationwide half-day strike on July 3 in
protest against the national budget placed by the government.
</P>
<P>
In his valedictory speech today, Deputy leader of the House
Zillur Rahman called upon the opposition to do constructive
criticism of the government to ensure better service to the
electorate.
</P>
<P>
He also sought full cooperation for the opposition,
particularly from the main opposition BNP, in the formation of the
parliamentary standing committees.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, deputy leader of the opposition Badruddoza Chowdhury
expected "a more tolerant attitude" from the government side while
conducting the parliamentary business.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the BNP would extend full cooperation in
making the parliament more effective.

<HEADLINE> Britain Confirms Bosnian Warcrimes Suspect Killed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The British Foreign Office
confirmed today that Bosnian Serb police chief Simo Drljaca, a
warcrimes suspect, had been killed in a clash with British
peacekeeping troops who had come to arrest him.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after a Downing Street meeting, Foreign Secretary
Robin Cook said Drljaca was killed in the northwestern town of
Prijedor early today after he tried to pull a gun as British
troops moved in to arrest him.
</P>
<P>
Drljaca shot a British soldier in the leg during the operation
but the injuries were not life-threatening, Cook said.
</P>
<P>
Cook also confirmed that another alleged war criminal Milan
Kovacevic, a hospital director, was under arrest as a result of
another separate operation.
</P>
<P>
"I'm very proud of the performance of the British forces in
this operation. They have shown very considerable courage. The use
of firearms on this occasion does demonstrate the risks that they
took," he said.
</P>
<P>
"These two men were within the British sector of Bosnia, they
were known to our forces and that is why they were apprehended,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
When asked whether similar operations would be staged against
other alleged war criminals, Cook said: "Nobody knew of this
operation before it took place and nobody will know of any future
operation."

<HEADLINE> Rescue Work Continues in Venezuela's Quake Wreckage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Rescue workers are searching the
rubbles of buildings in Venezuela's northeastern cities after the
coastal area was struck by a deadly earthquake Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
At least 36 people were reportedly killed, more than 160 others
injured and thousands left homeless in the quake measuring 6.3 on
the Richter scale, the worst in the country in 30 years.
</P>
<P>
Rescuers found more survivors today in the ruins of houses in
Cumana, one of the worst hit cities, local television reported.
But authorities said casualties could still rise.
</P>
<P>
Power, water and communication were cut for hours after the
tremor rocked Cumana, the oldest city in South America. Deaths
were also recorded in Cariaco and Casanay.
</P>
<P>
The tremor took place around 3:23 p.m. local time (19:23 GMT)
and the epicenter was about 49 kilometer off Venezuela's
northeastern Caribbean coast.
</P>
<P>
As six aftershocks were recorded later in the day, officials
warned that more earth movements could follow in coming days.
</P>
<P>
Venezuela suffered its last disastrous earthquake in 1967,
which was measured at 6.6 on Richter scale and in turn killed 245
people at the time.

<HEADLINE> Young Ethiopians Get Better Reproductive Health </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Youngsters who constitute
about 35 percent of Ethiopia's population, are getting better
services especially in the areas related to reproductive health,
a government official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Negussie Tefera, head of the National Office of Population of
Ethiopia made the remarks in a statement to mark the World
Population Day which will be observed globally tomorrow on July
11.
</P>
<P>
Negussie said population and sex education are being given to
youngsters along with the formal education in a number of
elementary and high schools across the country.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, population and environmental protection
clubs where youngsters could freely discuss their views regarding
sexual behavior and reproductive health issues, have been set up
in many schools by the national office of population in
collaboration with the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs, the
Ministry of Education, the Ethiopian Family Guidance Association
and other non-governmental organizations.
</P>
<P>
With regard to youngsters who are not students, the office is
striving to reach them through their respective associations,
Negussie said, adding that it has been also dispatching health
professionals to schools and various youth associations in
different regions to render guidance and counseling services to
the youngsters.
</P>
<P>
He further said his office plans to set up youth center in
major towns in the future to equip the youth with the necessary
knowledge on population affairs as well as social and economic
matters.
</P>
<P>
Youngsters are liable to various reproductive health problems
of which early marriage of young girls accompanied by several
negative consequences is the most threatening hazard currently in
the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
Negussie said the other problem that puts the life of young
girls in jeopardy is unwanted pregnancy which often results in
illegal abortion, adding that the latter is mercilessly claiming
the lives of tens of thousands of young girls.
</P>
<P>
The theme of this year's World Population Day is ''promoting
the general condition and health care for the youth''.

<HEADLINE> Greek, Turkish Experts May Meet Directly: Pangalos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Greece's Foreign Minister Theodoros
Pangalos today said that he did not rule out the possibility of a
direct meeting between members of the Greek-Turkish committees of
experts.
</P>
<P>
Pangalos's announcement came after Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel and Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis issued a joint
communique in Madrid Tuesday with the aim of improving relations
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"This is something which will become apparent in the next few
days, because up to now the Turkish answers have been very general
and did not create the conditions for a face-to-face meeting,"
said Pangalos.
</P>
<P>
The committees of experts were set up in May to examine
procedural approaches for resolving differences between Greece and
Turkey, but Greece later rejected a European Union (EU) proposal
calling on the experts to meet directly.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the committees exchange their study reports through
EU rotating presidency.

<HEADLINE> Britain likely to Help Islanders to leave Montserrat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The British government may offer
people on Montserrat to settle either in Britain or in other parts
of the Caribbean if the islanders decide to quit the Caribbean
island, which has been ravaged by volcanic eruptions, according to
government sources.
</P>
<P>
International Development Minister George Foulkes was quoted by
Rueters as saying today the offer was being considered after
geological advice that the Soufriere Hills volcano could continue
to rumble for up to five more years.
</P>
<P>
"That means the south of the island will not be usable," he
said. But "As long as there is a significant number of people
wishing to remain, I am certain that there is a scheme that can be
implemented for keeping the north viable."
</P>
<P>
The British government is trying to "explore the detail of an
assisted package and resettlement grant scheme which could include
either the United Kingdom or other parts of the Caribbean," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Early today, Britain's International Development Secretary
Clare Short announced that Britain would give Montserrat 6.95
million pounds (about 12 million U.S. dollars) in an effort to
help the islanders.
</P>
<P>
"We are taking emergency action to deal with the crisis in all
its aspects," Short said, "We are also drawing up an urgent
package of options which will be put to the people of Montserrat
to enable them to choose the best future for themselves in the
face of this disaster."

<HEADLINE> 4 Jailed Americans deported After Cypriot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot President Glafcos
Clerides has pardoned four Americans who were convicted last
month for beating an off-duty Cypriot policeman into a coma.
</P>
<P>
The four men, three professional basketball players playing
for local teams and a Marine assigned to the U.S. Embassy here,
were released July 4 after serving only two weeks of a
12 to 14-month sentence, Nicosia Central Prison Director George
Anastasiades told reporters here today.
</P>
<P>
He said that basketball players Kip Stone, 25, Anthony reed,
26, Randy davis, 27, and Marine Christopher Wallace, 25, have
been deported from Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Nicosia District Court sentenced on June 20 Stone and Reed to
14 months, while Davis and Wallace were given a 12-month
sentence.
</P>
<P>
They had pleaded guilty to charges of causing bodily harm to
Greek Cypriot policeman Christodoulos Christodoulou, 25.
</P>
<P>
Christodoulou, who was with his girlfriend at a popular
Nicosia cafe on March 13, asked the Americans sitting at an
adjacent table to stop harassing his girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
After an exchange of words, Christodoulou was attacked with
tables and chairs and was kicked repeatedly in the head, which
left him in a coma for about a week.
</P>
<P>
The law in Cyprus provides for a sentence of up to seven
years in prison for anyone found guilty of causing bodily harm.
</P>
<P>
However, in rendering its decision, the court took into
consideration that Christodoulou had been financially compensated
and had dropped charges, as well as the fact that none of the
defendants had a criminal record.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Boasts Highest Literacy Rate in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe now boasts the highest
literacy rate in Africa with over 78 percent of its population
able to read and write, a senior official said today.
</P>
<P>
Education Minister Gabriel Machinga said this has been
achieved through the government's concerted efforts to open up
more schools and non-formal adult education centers.
</P>
<P>
At the launch of a second donkey-drawn mobile cart library in
Nkayi district in west Zimbabwe, the minister said his government
has embarked on an all out program to make education accessible
to every child in the country since independence in 1980.
</P>
<P>
''From 2,400 primary schools before independence, today we
boast of over 4,600. Similarly, secondary schools increased from
less than 200 to over 1,500,'' he noted.
</P>
<P>
Machinga said while the country has succeeded in the
quantitative expansion of the education system, there is now need
to improve on its quality.
</P>
<P>
''One way of doing so is what you have done by making
available reading materials not only to the adult population but
to school pupils as well,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said his ministry knows that where such libraries
have been introduced, the pass rates among school pupils is
improved, particularly in languages.
</P>
<P>
The mobile cart library was provided by the rural libraries
and resources development program which has 72 rural libraries
throughout the country.

A government statement made public recently said the famine
has threaten districts in north, northeastern and western Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Famine threats in the districts of Gulu Kitgum, Arua and
Moyo in the north and Kasese in the west were due to the large
scale displacement following the civil strife caused by the raids
of rebel Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) and the Allied Democratic
Forces (ADF); whereas the other districts were plagued by drought
when rains failed to come during the rainy season in March and
April this year.
</P>
<P>
Most people in the affected areas are in serious food
shortage, compelling them to live on grass roots or mango fruit.
Some even starved to death.
</P>
<P>
To alleviate human sufferings, the Ugandan government has
released 852 million Shillings (about 852,000 U.S. Dollars) to
purchase emergency food for the needy, and will allocate more to
this end.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that a total of two billion Shillings (about
two million U.S. Dollars) has been earmarked for famine relief in
the next six months.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan President Y. Museveni expressed great concern on the
famine recently, saying if necessary, the government will use its
own reserves to ensure that the menace is fought and minimized.
</P>
<P>
The government has worked out a strategy to implement
immediate and long-term interventions to ensure increased food
production and security, which includes irrigation, use of
appropriate technology for production of adequate and improved
seeds and the enforcement of food by law by local authorities.
</P>
<P>
Internationally, Kampala has approached Inter-Governmental
Organizations (IGOs), Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) and
United Nations agencies to help mitigate the effects of the
famine.
</P>
<P>
In response to an appeal made by Ugandan Vice President S.
Kazibwe, the World Bank has released 215,000 U.S. Dollars for the
purchase of seeds and farm inputs in the famine-stricken areas.
</P>
<P>
The U. N. Development Program has also committed half a
million Dollars assisting Kampala in putting in place an
anti-disaster policy.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the World Food Program has offered to supply food to
the displaced people in Kitgum and Gulu for six months and to
those displaced in the western district of Kasese following the
attack by ADF rebels. So far, 540 tons of food relief have been
delivered to the area.
</P>
<P>
Several NGOs, IGOS and U. N. agencies have promised to render
support in various emergency relief services of food, non-food
items, cash and agricultural inputs to Gulu, Kitgum and Arua
districts which are frequently being raided by LRA rebels.
</P>
<P>
With the above measures assured by the government, situation
in some districts such as Mpigi, Kabarole and Kasese has been
alleviated despite inadequate rains, although shortage still
plagues other areas.
</P>
<P>
Experts here hold that the long-term solution to the famine
which occurs nearly every year in the drought-hit country lies in
the creation of disaster preparedness and management commission
in accordance with the country's constitution.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The manager of a security company
in Harare today opened fire on his demonstrating employees,
wounding 15 of his security guards, Zimbabwe News Agency Ziana
reported.
</P>
<P>
Details of what exactly transpired outside the Fawcett
Security Company Fawcett Headquarters were sketchy with the
officer commanding Harare province senior assistant
commissioner Osborne Mawere saying he was still to receive a full
report from the investigating team.
</P>
<P>
However, witnesses said that Fawcett General Manager D.B.
Thomas opened fire on the security guards in full view of the
police riot squad who were monitoring the otherwise peaceful
demonstration.
</P>
<P>
Members of the riot squad were said to have taken cover as
Thomas, who was later picked up by the police, fired on the
demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
Thomas allegedly fired from the roof of a guard room as the
security guards who are demanding a 50 percent salary increase
sang revolutionary songs outside the company.
</P>
<P>
Officials at Harare Hospital's casualty department confirmed
that Fawcett Security Guards had been brought to the hospital.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe has been hit by a spate of strikes beginning Monday
with workers from the construction, clothing, cement, lime and
national railways of Zimbabwe downing their tools demanding
better salaries.

<P>
PYONGYANG, July 10 (Xinhua) -- A banquet was held here today to
commemorate the 36th anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of
Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance between the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) and China.
</P>
<P>
The function was sponsored by the DPRK's Committee for Foreign
Cultural Relations and the Central Committee of the Korea-China
Friendship Association (KCFA) and hosted by Choe Huijong, chairman
of the Central Committee of the KCFA.
</P>
<P>
Jin Yongxiang, the Chinese Ambassador to the DPRK and other
Chinese diplomats joined DPRK officials at the event.
</P>
<P>
In his address, Choe said the signing of the treaty by the late
DPRK President Kim Il Sung and the late Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai
36 years ago was an epoch-making event which has promoted the
friendship between the DPRK and China to a new high.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his belief that the ties of friendship, unity and
cooperation between the peoples of the DPRK and China will be
further enhanced through their joint efforts.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Jin said the Chinese people have always
cherished Kim Il Sung's outstanding contributions to the
establishmen and development of the friendship between China and
the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
The further development of the Sino-Korean friendship is in
line with the fundamental interests of the two peoples and is an
important assurance for the peace and stability in Asia, Jin
said.

<HEADLINE> Al Chief Leaves for Lebanon to Inaugurate Arab </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Arab League Secretary General Esmat
Abdul-Meguid left here today for Lebanon where he will inaugurate
the Eighth Arab Games Tournament.
</P>
<P>
In a departure statement, he told reporters that he will meet
with Lebanese President Elias Hrawi, Prime Minister Rafik
Al-Hariri and Foreign Minister Fares Boueiz on the latest
developments of the staggering Mideast peacemaking and current
drives to revive it in the light of Israeli intransigence.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Lebanese newspaper Al Nahar published
today, he pointed out that Israel now feels the pressure of the
Lebanese resistance against Israeli occupation in southern
Lebanon more than ever before.
</P>
<P>
"The Lebanese resistance should go ahead with its activities as
long as Israeli occupation in southern Lebanon is going on," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The Jewish state has occupied a self-declared "security zone"
in South Lebanon since 1985 in defiance of U.N. resolutions and
stationed 2,000 troops along the border.
</P>
<P>
Meguid ruled out the possibility of holding an Arab summit at
the present, but he pointed out that contacts are under way within
this framework.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have called for holding such a summit to
counter the Israeli government's hardline practices in the Mideast
peace-making that has deadlocked for over three months.
</P>
<P>
The Arab leader also voiced his opposition to the Doha economic
conference slated for November, which would be the fourth Middle
East and North African Economic Conference if held.
</P>
<P>
"I do not believe in the so-called economic problems while
political issues remain unsolved," he said.
</P>
<P>
A number of Arab countries have decided to boycott the regional
economic cooperation forum which Israel is invited to attend,
saying that such a conference would only have negative impact on
the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Arab League said earlier that it has not received any
invitation from Qatar, the host.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Benin special envoy Emile-Derlin
Zinsou delivered a message from President Mathieu Kerekou to
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe today, wishing to strengthen
ties with other African countries.
</P>
<P>
Zinsou told journalists after the meeting that Kerekou wished
to strengthen economic, cultural and bilateral cooperation with
other African countries as Benin reduced its dependence on
Europe.
</P>
<P>
He said, ''we, Africans, are used to having relations with the
countries of the west. Time has come to develop ties with Africa,
and for the people of west Africa to cooperate with those in
southern Africa.''
</P>
<P>
''We often forget that what we get from Europe can be found in
southern Africa. We will do well to look first for these products
in Africa,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Zinsou arrived in Zimbabwe Wednesday and is expected to leave
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He is the special advisor to President Kerekou on
international issues and is also former president and foreign
minister of the west African nation.
</P>
<P>
He said, ''I have come with a friendly message to President
Mugabe so that we can have development ties in economic, cultural
and political fields.''

<HEADLINE> Russian Legislator: NATO Expansion a "Historical Mistake" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The expansion of the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO) is a "historical mistake," a Russian
parliamentary leader asserted here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The expansion will complicate Russia's relationship with the
NATO and its members, Sergei Baburin, deputy chairman of the State
Duma, or the lower house of parliament, told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
Baburin said NATO's recent decision to take Poland, Hungary and
the Czech Republic as its new members will make Russian parliament
more difficult to rectify the Start II arms-reduction treaty.
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement made by the parliaments of Belarus, Latvia
and Ukraine, Baburin said the NATO expansion will pose threats to
European security and that of the world's other parts.
</P>
<P>
After the breakup of the Warsaw Pact Organization, the NATO has
lost its reason to exist. But the Western alliance still insists
on enlargement despite the end of the "Cold War," it noted.
</P>
<P>
The expansion will lead to a sharp increase of military
spendings in NATO countries, especially in its new members, and
make countries more difficult to agree on arms reduction, it said.
</P>
<P>
The statement also appealed parliaments of NATO countries not
to accept new members.

<HEADLINE> Botswana to Participate in UN Peace-keeping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Botswana said today that its
army would join any United Nations peace-keeping mission in
Congo-Brazzaville.
</P>
<P>
"The U.N. has asked us to provide men if it decides to send a
force to Brazzaville," Botswana Defense Force spokesman Bernard
Ragalase said, adding that about 500 Botswana army men would be
involved in the mission.
</P>
<P>
Congolese President Pascal Lissouba appealed to the U.N. early
this month for sending a peace-keeping force to Brazzaville to
help end the fighting in his country.
</P>
<P>
Lissouba said his government has offered one million U.S.
dollars to encourage sending a peace-keeping mission.
</P>
<P>
Fighting has been going on for a month since clashes erupted
between the forces of President Lissouba and the militias loyal
to former president Sassou Nguesso and a cease-fire collapsed.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the U.N. agreed to send peace-keeping
troops to Congo on condition that a cease-fire is realized in the
country.

<HEADLINE> AL Chief in Beirut for Pan-Arab Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Arab League Secretary General
Esmat Abdul-Meguid arrived here this afternoon for attending
the opening ceremony of the Eighth Pan-Arab Games which is to be
held in the Beirut Sports City Saturday.
</P>
<P>
During his four-day stay here, the Arab League chief is to
hold meetings with the Lebanese leaders on the latest
developments in Lebanon and in the region, especially the
situations in south Lebanon and the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters at the Beirut International Airport,
Meguid described the Pan-Arab Games in Beirut as a "historical"
event.
</P>
<P>
On a possible absence of Iraqi athletes from the contests,
the secretary general expressed the hope that athletes from all
the Arab countries can participate in the Pan-Arab games and that
the problem can be solved by the countries concerned through
consultations.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese officials in charge of the organization of the
Pan-Arab Games announced today that the Iraqi athletes may be
allowed to enter Lebanon "but will not be allowed to take part
in the games."
</P>
<P>
But the Iraqi National Olympic Committee said Wednesday that
his country's athletes were leaving for Lebanon via Syria
today.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon has not invited Iraq to the games for fear of a
protest walkout by Iraq's principle Arab adversaries Kuwait and
Saudi Arabia, both of which are main funders of the
reconstruction of the Beirut Sports City Stadium. The two
countries have repeatedly requested Iraq be kept out of the games
just as what Syria did in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Abdul-Meguid held talks this evening with Lebanese Foreign
Minister Farez Boueiz, which is to be followed by a meeting
between the Arab League chief and Lebanese House Speaker Nabih
Berri.
</P>
<P>
Abdul-Meguid is to hold meetings with Lebanese Prime Minister
Rafik Hariri and President Elias Hrawi.

<HEADLINE> Poor UK Parents Sacrifice to Bring up Their Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 10 (Xinhua) -- One out of ten children in Britain
is poor as their families cannot afford at least three things most
families take for granted, such as three meals a day, a bed of
their own and shoes bought new and properly fitted, says a study
published today.
</P>
<P>
The report, by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation which tracked the
expenditure patterns of a cross section of 1,200 children,
estimates that the average cost of a child from birth to 17 is
50,000 pounds (83,000 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
However, the difference between the better-off and families
without much income was surprisingly small as poor parents tried
to protect their child from poverty often by going without
themselves.
</P>
<P>
The survey finds that three percent of children are "severely
poor" as they lack at least five or more necessities.
</P>
<P>
As many as 85 percent of mothers said they sometimes went
without clothes, shoes, holidays or entertainment to provide for
their children.
</P>
<P>
More than a quarter, especially lone mothers on Income Support,
sometimes went without food to ensure their children had enough to
eat.
</P>
<P>
The key finding of the survey is that welfare falls far short
of even the most frugal child budget. For children aged 11, it
only covers 57 percent of the cost.
</P>
<P>
"This study makes it clear that policy makers need to improve
their understanding of what it costs to be a parent," says one of
the authors of the report.
</P>
<P>
The survey findings "also raise the question of how far it is
reasonable to expect low-income parents to make sacrifices on
their own food and necessities in order to prevent their children
from going without."

<HEADLINE> UK Population Age Structure Unevenly Distributed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Britain is increasingly divided by
the greying areas of retirement and the growing youthfulness of
many inner cities, according to official figures published today.
</P>
<P>
The Office for National Statistics says in the Regional Trends,
the annual digest of localized economic and social indicators,
that youthful London and Northern Ireland pointed to growing age
divide in Britain as the two areas have the least pensioners while
the Southwest and Wales have the most.
</P>
<P>
Compared with a national average 18.2 percent pensioners in the
population, London has 15.5 percent, Northern Ireland 15 percent,
the Southwest 21.1 percent and Wales 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that in contrast to the trend in the nation as a
whole, London's pensioner population will fall further from
970,000 in 1991 to 828,000 in 2011.
</P>
<P>
Figures also show that while across the country 6.5 percent of
the population is under five, in London the figure is 7.2 percent
and in Northern Ireland 7.7 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, July 10 (Xinhua ) -- The Angolan government held a
ceremony here today marking the founding of its Unified National
Army (UNA).
</P>
<P>
Joan De Matos, Chief of Staff of Angolan armed forces said at
the ceremony that the establishment of the Unified National Army
has strengthened the country's armed forces by uniting formerly
waring military forces, and thus is a victory of peace and
reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
The new forces should safeguard national independence,
sovereignty and the unification of the country under the
direction of the Angolan government, Matos noted.
</P>
<P>
Blondin Beye, the United Nations' special representative in
Angola, said the founding of UNA is a victory of the joint
efforts of the Angolan government and the opposition National
Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
A total of 10,899 men from UNITA joined the newly formed
national forces.
</P>
<P>
The formation of the UNA, one of the most important stage in
Angola's peace process, started in December 1996. According to
the 1994 Lusaka Peace Accord, UNITA should have sent 26,300 men
to join the UNA, but the number was later reduced to 18,000 and
further to 10,899 as UNITA said it had not enough officers and
men for the UNA.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The second ordinary session
of the National Salvation Council (NSC) of Somalia ended here
today, calling for the contribution of all Somalis to peace and
reconstruction in the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the closing ceremony, current Chairman of the NSC,
Ali Mahdi Mohamed urged all Somalis to unite and leave no stones
unturned in order to realize the restoration of peace and
stability in the country.
</P>
<P>
Mahdi said, the Somali people have experienced "the worst
human catastrophe in modern history of Somalia", adding that "it
is time for us to reconcile our difference for the sake of our
children, ourselves and for generations to come".
</P>
<P>
The second session called upon Somali brothers who did not
participate in the Sodere peace process to join in the council's
efforts of peace making and reconstruction of Somalia, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Mahdi requested the international community to continue their
efforts and valuable contributions to bring to an end the
prolonged and protracted conflict in Somalia.
</P>
<P>
He also appealed to the international community to provide
assistance, financial and otherwise to pave the way for the
convening of the Somali national reconciliation conference held
in Bossaso on November 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopian Foreign Minister Seyoum Mesfin said on the same
occasion that the NSC has, from now until the Bossaso national
reconciliation conference, to do whatever is necessary to bring
on board the peace process and all those who might contribute to
peace in Somalia and the national reconciliation in that country.
</P>
<P>
The recent Inter-Governmental Authority for Development (IGAD)
summit convened in Nairobi, Kenya, called upon Somalis "to take
all the necessary care to ensure that no one is excluded from the
peace process", he revealed.
</P>
<P>
The session was opened in Addis Ababa on June 25 and later
moved to Sodere, 130 kms away from Addis Ababa.

The IPSOS polling institute said that the support rate of
Jospin rose by eight points to 52 percent, while that of Chirac
rose by 11 points to 46 percent, according to AFP.

<P>
The Gallup polling group said that the support rate of Chirac
grew by three points to 47 percent in June as was compared with

the first time in the barometer of the polling group, stood at 59

The drop in the number of people who failed to express their

LUANDA, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The Mozambican government today
denied that it had ever been involved in the incident of
transporting weapons to Angola's former rebel UNITA movement.
</P>
<P>
It has been reported recently that a South African
organization was delivering weapons to the National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) via Mozambique's Nampula
Port, so that the UNITA could re-launch civil war in Angola.
</P>
<P>
Responding to the allegation, Mozambican Foreign Minister
Leonardo Simao said here today when speaking to reporters that
the Mozambican government had nothing to do with such activities
providing assistance to the UNITA.
</P>
<P>
But he admitted there were possibilities that some criminals
might have been involved in these activities, adding that the
Mozambican government was looking into this matter. Anyone found
to have been involved in providing weapons to the UNITA will be
punished by law, he stressed.

He was making his stopover in Luanda today during his trip to

general of the League of Arab States, stressed here this evening
his support for Lebanon's resistance against the Israeli
occupation in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after his meeting with Lebanese Foreign
Minister Farez Boueiz, he underlined the necessity for Lebanon to
continue the resistance until the Israeli occupation in the south
is eliminated, affirming the "legitimacy" of the resistance.
</P>
<P>
Abdul-Meguid called on the Lebanese people to uphold their
national unity in the cause of resistance, noting that the unity
will make it impossible for Israel to continue the occupation.
</P>
<P>
"We should not look at the south Lebanon problem as if it is
only of Lebanon, but it is a problem of all of us, and the
Lebanese are adhering to their firmness," the Arab League chief
said.
</P>
<P>
Abdul-Meguid arrived here from Cairo this afternoon to
attend the opening ceremony of the Eighth Pan-Arab Games which is

region.

"We exchanged views on a number of proposals and a number of
initiatives which have been put forward, especially those by
Europe," Boueiz told a press conference held at the end of the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese foreign minister noted that they have "identical
opinions of pessimism" on the present situation of the peace
process due to the intransigence of Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz announced that he and Abdul-Meguid reached an agreement
on steps which should be taken in the future to politically
activate the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Arab League secretary general, on the other hand,
expressed his aspiration for progress in the peace process,
saying that efforts should continuously be made in order to
overcome the difficulties in the process.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Arab countries are committed to their
"well-known" positions and they are continuously sticking to the
basis of the peace process. He urged the United States to exert
efforts to avoid a failure of the process.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Abdul-Meguid stressed the significance for Lebanon
to hold the Eighth Pan-Arab Games "which will proves to the world
that Lebanon has regained its vitality and has consolidated its
position in the region."
</P>
<P>
After his talks with Boueiz, Abdul-Meguid held a meeting with
Lebanese House Speaker Nabih Berri.

MOSCOW, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The decisions made by the NATO
summit in Madrid will make the ratification of the Russian-U.S.
START II strategic arms reduction treaty more complicated, Russian
State Duma Deputy Chairman Sergei Baburin said today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference of Duma, Baburin noted that
NATO's decisions also complicated the relations between Russia,
NATO and its new member-states.
</P>
<P>
During the Madrid summit on July 8-9 NATO invited Poland,
Hungary and the Czech Republic to join the alliance, while NATO
and Ukraine signed a charter on special partnership.
</P>
<P>
"The new clouds in international relations appeared at the
initiative of NATO," he said, "it is not Russia that is erecting
this 'Berlin Wall'," Baburin added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Anti-NATO Chamber Alliance formed by Russia,
Belorussia, Latovia and Ukraine, in a statement said that they
would take every effort to refrain the NATO eastward enlargement.
</P>
<P>
A State Duma delegation, which mainly includes members of the
Anti-NATO informal group in the parliament's lower chamber, will
visit NATO headquarters on July 13, Baburin said. During the visit
the Duma delegation "will notify the bloc of the position of the
part of the Russian society which is against NATO enlargement," he
said.

<P>
ANKARA, July 10 (Xinhua) -- An Ankara court today rejected a
compensation case filed by former Turkish prime minister
Necmettin Erbakan agaisnt a senior prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
The semi-official Anatolia News Agency quoted judges from the
court as saying that the case is outside its competence and has
to be filed with the Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan, who resigned on June 18 under military pressure,
demanded a compensation of 140,000 U.S. dollars from Vural
Savas for insulting the Welfare Party (RP).
</P>
<P>
Savas, chief prosecutor of the Court of Appeals, had filed a
case with the Constitutional Court, Turkey's highest judicial
organ, to have the Erbakan-led RP closed on charges of its
anti-secularist tendency.
</P>
<P>
He said earlier that his move was aimed at "revealing the true
face of RP."
</P>
<P>
Erbakan's lawyer said that Savas belittled Erbakan and his
RP in order to persuade the people not to vote for the party in
future elections.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan and his Islamic RP has been accused by the military
and other secularist force of failing to take tough actions
against the fundamentalists who are growing very quickly.

<HEADLINE> UN Sanctions Against Libya Remains Unchanged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The UN Security Council
president said here today that the sanctions imposed on Libya
would remain unchanged.
</P>
<P>
After the UN Security Council reviewed the sanctions imposed on
Libya today, Council President Peter Osvald (Sweden) said that
there was no agreement that the necessary conditions existed for
modification of the sanctions established in resolution 748.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions against Libya were imposed by the Security
Council resolutions 748 in 1992 and 883 in 1993 after Libya
refused to surrender the two suspects alleged responsible for
bombing of Pan Am 103, which took 270 lives on December 22, 1988.
Libya insisted that the trial of the two suspects should be held
in a third and neutral country determined by the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Agmed Esmat Abdel Meguid, Secretary-General of the League of
Arab States, and Salim Ahmed Salim, Secretary-General of the
Organization of African Unity, jointly sent a letter on June 27 to
the president of Security Council, requesting the council to find
a peaceful and just solution to the dispute between Libya and the
United States and Britain.
</P>
<P>
The Secretaries-General urged the Security Council to undertake
measures to mitigate the severe impact of air embargo, including
exempting flights for humanitarian purposes, special flights to
send material assistance, flights for religious purposes; and
flights related to participation in official missions.
</P>
<P>
The representatives of France, Britain and the United States
sent a letter on July 8 to the president of the Security Council,
insisting that Libya must comply with the council's resolutions
before the sanctions could be lifted.

<HEADLINE> ECOWAS Committee to Meet S. Leone Coup Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The Economic Community of West
African States (ECOWAS) Committee of Four on Sierra Leone, which
is in New York to brief the United Nations on the situation in
that country, is expected to meet the coup leaders next week in
Conakry, Guinea.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, as part of current sub-regional efforts to
resolve the political crisis created by the May 25 coup, will
give another opportunity for the coup plotters to ensure peaceful
settlement of the crisis, the News Agency of Nigeria reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The committee, set up at the ECOWAS ministerial meeting in
Conakry on June 26, is composed of foreign ministers of Nigeria,
Guinea, Cote d'Ivoire and Ghana. It has the responsibility of
monitoring developments in Sierra Leone and working within an
agreed framework to resolve the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The committee left for New York on Wednesday to seek support
from the UN Security Council for ECOWAS's initiative to restore
the legitimate government led by ousted President Ahmed Tejan
Kabbah, after a meeting with ECOWAS chairman, Nigeria's head of
state General Sani Abacha last weekend.
</P>
<P>
The coup leaders in Sierra Leone, although facing
international isolation and domestic opposition, have showed no
sign to step down. Moreover, the military government on Tuesday
appointed a 17-member cabinet, which is seen by observers as a
step to strengthen control of the country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, troops loyal to coup leader Major Johnny Paul
Koromah on Wednesday launched an attack on the ECOWAS
peacekeeping force known as ECOMOG controlling the international
airport of the capital Freetown.
</P>
<P>
The attack was reportedly aimed at silencing a radio station
believed to be based in the airport.
</P>
<P>
It is noted that at the June 26 meeting, ECOWAS gave Sierra
Leone's junta two weeks to step down, or the sub-regional body
will employ embargo or even the use of force. Now two weeks have
passed and no ECOWAS action against the junta has been seen.
</P>
<P>
Under such circumstances, the Committee of Four's visit to UN
and the expected meeting with Sierra Leone's coup leaders next
week become the focus of attention.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Suspends Aid Programs to Cambodia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The United States announced on
Thursday that it is suspending its 25 million US dollar aid
program for Cambodia as Second Prime Minister Hun Sen had
decomposed the 1993 elected government by ousting First Prime
Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came as Ranariddh urged the U.N. Security
Council not to recognize any government formed by Hun Sen and to
order a freeze on aid to Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
"The United States has decided to suspend our aid program to
Cambodia for 30 days while we conduct an intensive review of those
program," State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said at a
regular briefing.
</P>
<P>
The suspension was "a clear signal to Hun Sen and his
associates that the U.S. will not be conducting business as usual
with those individuals," Burns said.
</P>
<P>
After 30 days of review, and depending on the circumstances in
the country, the United States will resume only those programs
that provide humanitarian assistance to the Cambodian people, but
the other part of programs that support directly or indirectly the
Cambodian government will not be resumed, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We hope very much that Hun Sen will reconsider his actions
... of rupturing the Paris peace accords and breaking the
coalition government that had been in place for the last four
years," he said.
</P>
<P>
Burns also said the United States welcomed the decision of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations to postpone consideration
of Cambodia for its membership in the regional organization.
</P>
<P>
"This is a very important act, which is exactly what the United
States had wished would occur," he said.
</P>
<P>
About 400 Americans have left Cambodia since the unrest erupted
in the last few days and there are still 900 to 1,000 Americans
left there.

LONDON, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland's police chief
today urged the leaders of both Catholic and Protestant
communities to use their power to head off the threat of violence
as Saturday's climax of Protestants' parade approaches.
</P>
<P>
"Everyone of any influence whatever should do all that they can
to urge restraint. That is what people of influence should be
doing from now to right through Saturday," Royal Ulster
Constabulary (RUC) police chief Ronnie Flanagan told reporters in
Belfast, the provincial capital of Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Flanagan said he would continue to hold meetings with those
involved in the weekend parades but gave no sign of any early
breakthrough that would ease tension.
</P>
<P>
Protestant Orange Order plans to hold its annual parade on the
final day of "marching season" Saturday in Belfast and
Londonderry, the two largest cities in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
For Protestants, July 12 is the "glorious" day, the climax of
an annual marching season when Orangemen hold parades to mark a
1690 Protestant battle victory over a Catholic king.
</P>
<P>
But heads of Catholic Residents associations in Belfast and
Londonderry have called for mass demonstrations Saturday to
protest against what they say "are exhibitions of sectarian
triumphalism on their doorsteps."
</P>
<P>
A spate of car hijackings, riots and petrol bomb attacks on
police and troops dwindled overnight but police fear the potential
for a fresh flare-up is immense.
</P>
<P>
Five hundred more British troops are on their way to Northern
Ireland to reinforce the 18,000 already in the province and
12,000-strong police in case of renewed violence.
</P>

According to the latest RUC tally, 60 policemen and 64
civilians have been injured, 133 people have been arrested but no
one has been killed so far.

<HEADLINE> Two U.S. Leading Suppliers of Oil Drilling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Two U.S. leading suppliers of oil
drilling equipment are planning to merge with a view to creating a
company large enough to build ships that drill for oil in deep
water, the New York Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Reading &AMP; Bates Corporation and the Falcon Drilling
Company, which are based in Houston in the southern part of the
United States, said that the merger would create a company with
the largest fleet of ships that drill for oil in deep water in the
world.
</P>
<P>
The deal comes as demand surges for such ships. Major companies
have begun to explore for oil in waters from 2,000 feet to 3,000
feet deep in areas like the Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
The proposed new company will have a fleet of 14 ships capable
of drilling in depths greater than 3,000 feet. There are only
about 35 to 40 vessels with such a capability in the world, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
The new company would have a market value of five billion U.S.
dollars. The two companies have a combined workforce of 5,000, and
the sales of both companies have been up sharply in the last two
years.
</P>
<P>
The transaction will have to be approved by shareholders and
Federal regulators. The companies said that it should close by the
fourth quarter of this year.

<HEADLINE> US Producer Prices Drop in Sixth Consecutive Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 11 (Xinhua) -- U.S. wholesale prices fell for
an unprecedented sixth consecutive month in June, the U.S. Labor
Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report said that prices charged by producers, such as
factories and food-processing plants for finished goods, edged a
seasonally adjusted 0.1 percent lower last month following
declines of 0.3 percent in May and 0.6 percent in April.
</P>
<P>
For the year so far, producer prices in the U.S. are declining
at an annual rate of 3.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The decline resulted mainly from the 0.9 percent drop of food
prices last month. Beef and veal declined 1.5 percent as did
poultry. Fish, pork, vegetable and fruit prices all decreased.
</P>
<P>
But gasoline increased by 0.4 percent on a seasonally adjusted
basis. Natural gas was up by 1.8 percent and residential electric
power by 0.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Excluding the often volatile food and energy sectors, prices
inched 0.1 percent higher in June after two monthly declines. For
the first half of the year, they've declined at a 0.3 percent
annual rate after rising at a 0.6 percent rate during the last
half of 1996.
</P>
<P>
Inflation also was absent earlier in the production pipeline.
There was no change in the price of intermediate goods after four
monthly declines. Crude goods fell 3.3 percent, pulled down by a
15.4 percent plunge in crude petroleum.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the report on producer prices in June was
the latest reassurance that U.S. inflation was moderating.
</P>
<P>
The longest prior string of price declines since the government
began tracking producer prices in 1947 was five in a row, from
August through December 1952.

<HEADLINE> Tax Changes Undertaken to Sharpen Singapore's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The Singapore government today
unveiled a series of tax changes designed to lower business cost
and sharpen the country's competitiveness, in the face of
intensified competition in the region.
</P>
<P>
In his 1997 budget address at the Parliament, Finance Minister
Richard Hu announced, among other things, incentives to give an
added boost to the financial market and strengthen Singapore's
position as a major financial hub.
</P>
<P>
There will be a new tax incentive for Asian Currency Units
(ACUs) activities for an initial period of five years with effect
from Year of Assessment 1998. At present ACUs of banks and
merchant banks enjoy a concessionary tax of ten percent on income
earned from ACU activities.
</P>
<P>
They will also enjoy a further reduction in the tax rate to
five percent on the incremental income derived from certain
high-value added activities, he said, adding that in order to give
a further boost to ACU activities, the five percent tax on
incremental income will be extended to income derived from all
taxable ACU activities if the total taxable income from all such
activities exceed 50 million Singapore dollars (about 35 million
US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, fund managers who have substantial operations in
Singapore will be exempted from tax altogether for income earned
from managing non-resident funds. To qualify, they must manage at
least ten billion Singapore dollars (about seven billion US
dollars) of non-resident funds in Singapore and employ at least
seven professional fund managers and analysts.
</P>
<P>
They must also have a track record of three years operating in
Singapore under the Tax Exemption Scheme for Fund Management, the
minister said.
</P>
<P>
Income earned by banks and merchant banks from managing foreign
currency denominated Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) that are to
be listed on the Stock Exchange of Singapore (SES) are also
exempted from tax for the same period, he said.
</P>
<P>
Tax income earned by ACUs and Approved Securities Companies
from trading of foreign currency denominated shares listed on the
SES will also be exempted for five years.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Minister Stresses Fiscal Discipline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Finance Minister Rabindra
Nath Sharma stressed today that it is essential to emphasize
fiscal discipline for sound and sustainable development of the
national economy.
</P>
<P>
To prevent the anomalies and aberrations likely to crop up from
the growing economic anarchy in the country, fiscal discipline is
necessary, Sharma told a press conference here on the 1997-98
fiscal year budget he presented to the parliament Thursday.
</P>
<P>
At the parliament, he said since the government itself could
not adhere to fiscal discipline, overdrafts taken unrestrictedly
in the past years have caused negative impact on the national
economy.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the necessary bill will soon be introduced to limit
the government's authority to issue overdraft not exceeding one
billion rupees (17 million U.S. dollars) from the central bank, he
said.
</P>
<P>
In order to reduce the budget deficit, special measures will be
initiated to increase revenue, control tax leakage and curtail
unproductive expenditure, Sharma told the press conference.
</P>
<P>
And income tax and value added tax will be gradually developed
as major components of revenue mobilization, he added.
</P>
<P>
The finance minister said the budget is based on authentic
statistics, calling for cooperation from all quarters in its
implementation.

<HEADLINE> Situation Calm After SFOR Arrest of Indictees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, July 11 (Xinhua) -- International organizations said
on Friday that the situation in Bosnia has been calm since the
operation to nab war crime indictees by Nato-led Stablization
Force(SFOR).
</P>
<P>
SFOR launched the "Tango" operation in the Serb-controlled town
of Prijedor on Thursday morning -- the first of its kind since
being deployed in Bosnia, killing one former local police chief
and arresting the town's former major.
</P>
<P>
Both men were indicted secretely by the International Criminal
Tribunal for Former Yugoslavia for complicity in genocide against
non-Serbs committed in Prijedor during the 1992 and 1993 period.
</P>
<P>
Following the incident, SFOR has deployed sufficient forces in
the region to monitor the situation carefully and to react
appropriately in any given circumstances, said SFOR spokesman
Major Chris Riley.
</P>
<P>
"There is no indication of problems in any part of the
country," he said, adding that the "situation in the ground
remains calm".
</P>
<P>
Alexander Ivanko, spokesman for the International Police Task
Force said that "it is business as usual" for the UN police
monitors in Bosnia, while local offices here of the UN High
Commission and the Organization of Security and Cooperation in
Europe said that their staff members have been adviced to take
certain precautions.
</P>
<P>
Riley insisted that the "Tango" operation did not mean the
change of the SFOR policy of not hunting down war crime indictees
but that it was done "when the tactic situation permitted, to
detain them in accordance with our original mandate and policy".

<HEADLINE> More Local Judicial Officers Assume Office in Macao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Eight more local judges and
procurators replaced Portuguese legal officers in the territory on
 Thursday, marking a new step in the localization of law.
</P>
<P>
They are the second batch of local judges and procurators to
have assumed office so far, bringing the total number of local
judicial officers to 11.
</P>
<P>
The localization of law is considered a major issue in the
transitional affairs of Macao.
</P>
<P>
Before October 2 last year, all Macao judicial posts were held
by people from Portugal.
</P>
<P>
Macao top judges and procurators called the new move "a major
step" in the localization process, saying more locally-trained
judges and procurators will take office next year.
</P>
<P>
Judicial officials said 14 people currently being trained in
Macao will enter the legal service next year and 13 more will be
recruited for training in a training center in the territory.
</P>
<P>
By the time of handover on December 20, 1999, there will be
about 30 local judges and procurators in office.
</P>
<P>
"I hope the newly-appointed judges and procurators will
scrupulously carry out their duties and rights given by law and
serve Macao faithfully," said Manuel Antonio Maduro, president of
the Macao Supreme Tribunal of Justice, in an address at the
inauguration ceremony on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A commentary in today's Macao Daily News applauds the
inauguration of the new judges and prosecutors and urged them to
be prepared to serve the future Macao Special Administrative
Region.

BONN, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Germany's annual inflation rate edged
up to 1.7 percent in June from 1.6 percent in May, the Federal
Statistics Office said today.
</P>
<P>
In western Germany, consumer prices rose in June, the latest
month that complete statistics were available, by 0.3 percent from
the May level, amounting to an annualized increase of 1.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
In the eastern half of the country, prices climbed by 0.1
percent from May for an annualized increase of 1.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
The statistics office said the increases did not mean the end
of price stability, and it should be mainly attributed to seasonal
factors and the current weakness of the German mark against the
U.S. dollar.

<HEADLINE> Rebels Laud Manila-Declared Ceasefire Extension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The rebel Moro Islamic Liberation
Front (MILF) today praised the Philippine government for extending
the unilateral suspension of military operations against it in the
southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Ghadzali Jaafar, MILF vice chairman for political affairs, said
the MILF believed that the decision by the Sixth Infantry Division
of the Philippine Armed Forces to extend the ceasefire until 6
a.m. of July 15 could have been influenced by President Fidel
Ramos.
</P>
<P>
"We see this as a positive step towards the resumption of the
peace talks," Jaafar said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
He said the MILF has reciprocated the move by ordering its
forces to maintain a defensive position and not to launch attacks
against the military during the period covered by the ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
The military's Sixth Infantry Division Commander Raul Urgello
declared on Wednesday another period of unilateral ceasefire that
will last for four days.
</P>
<P>
Noel Detoyato, Urgello's spokesman, said the general was
encouraged by the positive result of the first ceasefire
declaration which ended at 6 a.m. today.
</P>
<P>
"The condition is favorable so Gen. Urgello extended the
ceasefire to further support the peace mission by Mindanao
Governor Misuari and to complete the process for the return of
evacuees to their respective places," Detoyato said.
</P>
<P>
Misuari met with MILF vice chairman Hadji Murad Wednesday in
Camp Abubakar, Barira, Maguindanao province to mediate on the
impasse between the government and MILF's peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the MILF disclosed it will immediately arrange a
meeting with the government panel once the situation in central
Mindanao, particularly in Cotabato and Maguindanao provinces
normalizes.
</P>
<P>
The front also demanded, among others, the pull-out of military
troops from the captured MILF Camp Raja Muda and the return of
evacuees to their villages as conditions for the resumption of
peace negotiations.

one of the three bidders -- Aerospatiale of France and the
U.S. firms Hughes and Lockheed, said Thuraya Chairman Mohammed

</P>
<P>
Thuraya officials also plan to seek more investors to expand
the satellite's coverage range in Asia.

<P>
SINGAPORE, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The Singapore government will
run a budget surplus of 4.8 billion Singapore dollars, or about

to adopt a prudent policy in government spending, Finance Minister
Richard Hu said today.
</P>
<P>
Presenting the 1997 budget to the parliament, the minister said
prudence would continue to be the cornerstone of the government's

23.9 billion Singapore dollars (about 16.7 billion US dollars).
Hence, a budget surplus of 4.8 billion Singapore dollars (about
3.36 billion US dollars) is expected, the lowest since 1992.
</P>
<P>
Of this surplus, 500 million will be used to top-up the Edusave
Endowment Fund to its target of five billion Singapore dollars.
Meanwhile, 100 million Singapore dollars will be allocated to
Medifund to ensure affordable healthcare remains available.
</P>
<P>
As for pensioners, the monthly Singapore Allowance last revised
in 1993 will be raised by ten dollars to 140 Singapore dollars
from next month. The pension ceiling for those who can qualify for
the Allowance will also go up by 50 to 950 Singapore dollars.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, spending on economic and infrastructure development
will total four billion Singapore dollars (about 2.8 billion US
dollars). It will go to pay for land reclamation projects, grants
and loans to companies and transport improvements, he said.
</P>
<P>
Spending on security will account for about 33 percent of the
total budget and the largest share of 38 percent of the budget
will go to social and community services.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Qiao Shi, Chairman of the National
People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee, said here today that
the members of the Preparatory Committee for the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) have made great contributions to the
smooth transition of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"The Preparatory Committee for the Hong Kong SAR has finished
its historic mission. Since its establishment in January 1996 the
members of the committee have devoted themselves to hard work to
set up the Hong Kong SAR," noted Qiao.
</P>
<P>
His speech was made at the 10th plenary session of the
Preparatory Committee. The meeting announced the end of the
committee's work, according to a decision made by the 26th session
of the Standing Committee of the NPC.
</P>
<P>
"Ten days ago China announced the founding of the Hong Kong
SAR. Its administrative, legislative and judicial departments are
now exercising their respective functions," Qiao said.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the smooth transition of Hong Kong to the overall
implementation of the Basic Law that is based on the fundamental
principles of "one country, two systems" and "Hong Kong people
governing Hong Kong".
</P>
<P>
"The NPC and its standing committee has always paid great
attention to Hong Kong's smooth transition, and prosperity and
stability, and have made their due contributions to Hong Kong's
return," Qiao noted.
</P>
<P>
The NPC passed a series of laws and decisions and set up the
Preliminary Working Committee of the Preparatory Committee and the
Preparatory Committee since the Third Session of the Seventh NPC
adopted the Basic Law of the Hong Kong SAR, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Standing Committee of the NPC also established the Basic
Law Committee of the Hong Kong SAR on July 1 this year, he said.
</P>
<P>
Qiao said that the NPC will continue to support the work of the
Hong Kong SAR and help promote the future development of Hong
Kong.

<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, July 11 (Xinhua) -- A Romanian oil company has
discovered a large gas field some 160 kilometers off the Constanta
port in the Black Sea, Romanian press reports said today.
</P>
<P>
Energy industry sources were quoted as saying that the gas
field, surveyed by the country's offshore petroleum company, known
as Scpetromar Sa, may turn out to be one of the world's largest.
</P>
<P>
Scpetromar has already sunk an 87-meter-deep well into the sea
bed to tap 1 million cubic meters of natural gas a day on trial
basis, and to help reveal the gas field's total economic reserves.
</P>
<P>
With a coastline of 245 kilometers along the Black Sea, where
the continental shelf is believed to boast rich oil reserves,
Romania began to tap the undersea energy resources in 1976.
</P>
<P>
Over the past three years, crude oil generated from offshore
fields has accounted for an average of about 12 percent of the
country's total output.

<HEADLINE> Philippine President Backs Peso Float </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
today justified the Central Bank's decision to allow the peso to
move more freely against the dollar by saying that this will
preserve the gains of the economy in recent years.
</P>
<P>
"Together with sound fiscal policy and monetary discipline,
this exchange rate action reaffirms the government's commitment to
do whatever is necessary to sustain our economic growth, control
inflation and generate employment through, among others, the
protection of our international reserves," Ramos said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
The action taken by the bank was not a "devaluation" of the
peso, he said, it just allowed the peso to "float freely" and the
bank just stopped being a market leader in buying and selling
dollars.
</P>
<P>
"We also think that further intervention of the Central Bank in
the market is no longer necessary," the president explained.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said the action will "protects the well-earned economic
gains of the Filipino people from the effects of the current
difficult circumstances prevailing in regional financial markets."
</P>
<P>
"As the Philippines continues to enjoy the benefits of being an
emerging market economy, the government will respond to the
challenge posed by its integration into global financial markets,"
he said.

<HEADLINE> Order, Regulation Related to Public Service Gazetted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Public Service (Administration)
Order 1997 and Public Service (Disciplinary) Regulation were
gazetted here today, providing for continuity of the civil
service.
</P>
<P>
The order was made Wednesday by Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa
under Clause 48(4) of the Basic Law, which empowers him to issue
executive orders.
</P>
<P>
The order replaces and localizes provisions in the Letters
Patent and Colonial Regulations, which lapsed on July 1, relating
to the administration of the civil service.
</P>
<P>
Tung also made the Public Service (Disciplinary) Regulation in
exercise of his power under the order. The regulation replaces and
localizes sets of disciplinary regulations and directions made
under the Colonial Regulations.
</P>
<P>
Both the order and the regulation are deemed to have come into
force on July 1 to provide for continuity.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the order, Secretary for the Civil Service Lam
Woon-kwong said: "Provisions in the order and regulation are
largely straightforward adaptation of corresponding provisions in
the Letters Patent and Colonial Regulations. They relate to the
authority of the chief executive to appoint, dismiss and
discipline public servants; to act on representations made by
public servants; and to make related disciplinary regulations."
</P>
<P>
"Modifications are made only in a few areas to ensure that the
final authority for the overall administration of the civil
service rests locally in Hong Kong and in the chief executive,"
Lam said.
</P>
<P>
"For instance, references to the secretary of state for foreign
and commonwealth affairs of the United Kingdom have been
replaced, where appropriate, by references to the advice of the
Executive Council," he explained.
</P>
<P>
The appeal channel for civil servants will also end in Hong
Kong.

<HEADLINE> E.A. Central Bankers Seek Common Ground </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR  SALAAM, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Senior officers of the
central banks of Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania have discussed
harmonization of the monetary policies of the three east African
countries within the framework of the EA Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
In their joint position presented on their behalf by Mr. J. F.
Bossa, legal counsel of Bank of Uganda, the representatives who
met here on Wednesday, noted that the role of the central banks
in the three east African countries had significantly changed
during the past few years "from controlled to liberalized
economic framework".
</P>
<P>
Mr. Bossa said the new arrangements had given the central banks
greater autonomy which was focused on the formulation and
implementation of monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
To this extent, the central banks representatives said, their
organizations were well equipped to foster overall price stability,
facilitate orderly monetary and financial developments and thus
sustain high economic growth within the framework of the EAC.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Executive Secretary of the EA Cooperation Ambassador
Francis Muthaura said there was need to harmonize fiscal and
monetary policies in order to create an enabling environment for
the development of trade, industry and investment in the region.
</P>
<P>
Muthaura also told the meeting that the creation of a "uniform
incentive framework" would make it easier for "joint promotion of
the east Africa region as a single trade and investment area".
</P>
<P>
The consultative meeting agreed on measures aimed at further
streamlining and enhancing the effectiveness of the central banks'
role in the regional integration process, among them the need for
the central banks to institutionalize their regular consultations
and to focus their concerns on monetary policy issues.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 11 (Xinhua) -- After ten years of development,
finance companies have expanded into an important force behind
large enterprise groups in China and have become an indispensable
part of the nation's financial regime.
</P>
<P>
There were a total of 68 financial companies in China at the
end of 1996, boasting an annual profit of 2.78 billion yuan from
total assets of 82.5 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Finance companies of large enterprise groups proved to be
useful sources of operational funds, which provide loans,
underwrite corporate bonds for the group companies, and clear up
debts among the constituent companies of the parent group company.
</P>
<P>
The finance companies are characterized by their efficiency,
and conducted a total of 169 billion yuan in settlement last year.
</P>
<P>
By serving as the underwriter of stock floatations, finance
companies also played an important role in the transformation of
the enterprise groups into shareholding companies, as well as the
restructuring, readjustment and trading of the assets.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Central Bank Allows Peso to Float </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Central Bank today
finally gave up its efforts to stabilize the country's currency
peso which has been under continued speculative attacks since the
floatation of Thai baht on July 2.
</P>
<P>
The bank will allow the peso-U.S. dollar rate to "move within a
new wider range consistent with significantly changed market
conditions" as of today, central bank governor Gabriel Singson
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Singson said the move is expected to remove the incentive for
speculation against the peso and allow a gradual reduction in
interest rates more compatible with the economy's requirements for
sustainable economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The decision to allow the peso to fall was made Thursday night
in a meeting of the Monetary Board, the highest policy-making body
of the central bank, in the Presidential Palace.
</P>
<P>
The move to leave the peso-dollar rate to be determined by
market forces will lead to an effective depreciation of the
currency, economists said, although Singson denied at a press
conference that the bank is "not really devaluing the peso."
</P>
<P>
Singson told reporters that the peso has been devalued under
current circumstances but he expected this temporary situation to
stabilize as markets are invariably self-correcting.
</P>
<P>
Singson said a more flexible exchange rate will conserve the
country's international reserves and normalize interest rates to
levels compatible with the needs of the fast growing economy.
</P>
<P>
Since July 2, the central bank had been forced to dip into its
foreign reserves and spiral up its overnight borrowing rates in
order to protect the peso.
</P>
<P>
Just on Thursday, the bank raised its borrowing rate to a
four-year high of 32 percent from 30 percent and vowed to "use all
available means" to stabilize the peso.
</P>
<P>
But economists expected the central bank to soon allow a slow
depreciation of the peso because it could run out of its limited
international reserves and a hefty interest rate will hurt the
country' economic growth.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Vice-Premier Asks Mayors to Care for "Vegetable Baskets" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The system of mayors'
responsibility for "vegetable baskets" must be continued
unswervingly, Vice-Premier Li Lanqing told a national conference
here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The State Council worked out the mayors' responsibility system
for the "vegetable baskets" in 1994, in a bid to ensure the urban
dwellers' basic living standards and social stability.
</P>
<P>
The mainstay role of the state-run enterprises in the markets
must be further improved, and a market system that suits the
socialist market system must be perfected to satisfy the people's
demands for vegetables and meat, Li said.
</P>
<P>
To achieve the goals, Li said, the production scales and the
technological level must be improved, the related reforms
deepened, agricultural by-product wholesale markets perfected, the
management and distribution of vegetables and by-products
developed, and the macro-control system strengthened and perfected.
</P>
<P>
Li stressed that all localities must earnestly carry out the
stipulations in the State Council's latest circular about the
"vegetable basket" programme and continue the mayors'
responsibility system steadfastly.

<HEADLINE> Muslim Rebels Willing to Resume Talks With Manila </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The rebel Moro Islamic Liberation
Front (MILF) is willing to resume peace talks with the Philippine
government once the situation in the south is normalized, a senior
government official said today.
</P>
<P>
This was one of the points agreed upon by Nur Misuari, governor
of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, and MILF vice
chairman Hadji Murad in their talks on July 9, according to
Presidential Management Staff Head Alexander Aguirre.
</P>
<P>
In his report to President Fidel Ramos, Aguirre quoted Misuari,
the rebel-turned-governor, as saying that "returning to the
negotiating table is not a problem to the MILF once the situation
is normalized.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Raul Urgello, commanding general of the 6th Infantry
Division of the Philippine Armed Forces, has declared a four-day
unilateral ceasefire effective today "to follow through the
momentum of the peace efforts."
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Urgello ordered a 48-hour unilateral ceasefire in
support of Misuari's efforts to talk to the MILF leadership.
</P>
<P>
Aguirre, who was in the southern city of Cotabato on July 9-10,
personally talked to Misuari after the latter's meeting with
Murad.
</P>
<P>
Aguirre said the MILF was even willing to help Misuari in the
government's anti-kidnapping campaign if given the go-signal by
higher authorities.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Ramos instructed Misuari to "assume an active and
significant role" in the peace and development efforts in Central
Mindanao and to initiate contacts with the MILF to enhance the
momentum of the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The president also directed Defense Secretary Renato de Villa
and all military commanders to extend their support to Misuari.
</P>
<P>
A series of kidnapping operations in Central Mindanao,
reportedly backed by some renegade MILF elements, prompted the
military to launch offensives against the MILF in the province of
Maguindanao and north Cotabato.
</P>
<P>
To restore peace and order conditions in the affected areas,
the MILF has agreed to vacate roads and highways provided military
operations against them are stopped.

<HEADLINE> Preparatory Committee's Efforts for HKSAR Establishment Praised </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Two of Hong Kong's Chinese
language newspapers published commentaries today, hailing the
great contributions the Preparatory Committee has made to the
establishment of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(HKSAR).
</P>
<P>
The Preparatory Committee is holding its tenth and last plenary
meeting in Beijing today to put an end to its operation after
successfully fulfilling the historic mission of making
preparations for the establishment of the HKSAR, Ta Kung Pao said.
</P>
<P>
Since its formation in January 1996, the committee has carried
out intense but orderly work -- forming the Selection Committee
for the First HKSAR Government, electing the first Chief Executive
and the Provisional Legislative Council, formulating the concrete
method for the formation of the first Legislative Council and
putting forward proposals for handling the then existing Hong Kong
laws.
</P>
<P>
The committee also made suggestions and advice on major
economic issues related to the handover of Hong Kong and its
smooth transition, as well as on arrangements for various
activities to celebrate Hong Kong's return to the motherland, the
Ta Kung Pao commentary said.
</P>
<P>
The commentary noted: "It is no exaggeration to say that the
committee has made great contributions to China's resumption of
the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong, laid solid foundation
for the realization of "one country, two systems," "Hong Kong
people running Hong Kong" and a high degree of autonomy in Hong
Kong, and added a brilliant chapter to the history of the Chinese
nation."
</P>
<P>
Broad and active participation of Hong Kong people in the
preparatory work for establishing the HKSAR has played a decisive
role in the smooth operation of the Preparatory Committee, it also
noted.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong Commercial Daily said in its commentary that Hong
Kong's return was hailed as "perfect" and so can be said of the
related work done by the Preparatory Committee.
</P>
<P>
Authorized by China's National People's Congress to prepare for
the establishment of the HKSAR, the committee has fully embodied
the principle of "facing Hong Kong people and relying on them" in
everything it has done, including its own formation. It also
sincerely implemented the principles of "one country, two
systems," "Hong Kong people running Hong Kong" and a high degree
of autonomy.
</P>
<P>
The commentary said no body can have a deeper appreciation than
the Hong Kong people of the committee's contributions -- Hong
Kong underwent a smooth transition, the HKSAR Government was
inaugurated as scheduled, and the HKSAR got off to a good start
blessed with a stable society, a buoyant market and favorable
public opinions.
</P>
<P>
The committee has made historic contributions to Hong Kong's
long-term prosperity and stability and to the great cause of
reunification of the motherland, it concluded.

<P>
LONDON, July 11 (Xinhua) -- World champion triple jumper
Jonathon Edwards pulled out of this weekend's British athletics
trials because of his niggling heel injury, according to reports
from Birmingham.
</P>
<P>
But Edwards will be fit to defend his title at the world
athletics championships in Athens in three weeks time.
</P>
<P>
Edwards sustained the injury in the European Cup in Munich last
month. He withdrew from the grand prix meets in Lausanne and Oslo
last week, and specialists have advised him to stay out of
competition.
</P>
<P>
British Athletic Federation spokeswoman Jayne Pearce
said: "Jonathan can train, but he is not fit for competitive
activity this weekend."
</P>
<P>
Athletes must compete in the British trials to qualify for
selection, but the selectors can take "exceptional circumstances"
into account.
</P>
<P>
Edwards jumped a world-record 18.29 meters at the World
Athletics Championships in Goteborg two years ago.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 11 (Xinhua) -- More than 140,000 identity duty
warrant cards for employees of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government will be issued by the end
of March next year, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
They will consist 32,000 new Departmental Warrant Cards (DWCs)

<P>
Some 20,000 DWCs and 30,000 GICs had been issued to officers of
five discipline departments -- police, Customs and Excise, Fire

<HEADLINE> Clinton Congratulates Poland's Access to NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, July 11 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton left
here this morning after a 20-hour stay to congratulate Poland's
fresh ties to the West.
</P>
<P>
Clinton chose Warsaw to celebrate the decision by the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) to invite Poland, Hungary and
the Czech Republic as the first group of its new members.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Polish President Aleksander Kwasniewski rolled out
red carpet for the arrival of his U.S. counterpart, who flew in
straight from NATO's Madrid summit, where the decision was made.
</P>
<P>
Polish press said Clinton came to deliver the NATO invitation
in person, and to notify the importance of Poland, the largest
East European country with a 38 million population, for the region.
</P>
<P>
The press also hailed it as a much needed visit for both sides.
</P>
<P>
During his stay here, Clinton talked with Kwasniewski and
Polish Prime Minister Woldzimierz Cimoszewicz, and then made a
speech in front of a flag-waving audience of thousands.
</P>
<P>
The Polish President, calling Clinton "an intimate friend of
Poland" and his visit a "historic" one, vowed to commit his
country to the responsibilities of a NATO membership.
</P>
<P>
But Clinton warned Poland would have to face a heavy burden to
join NATO, including the costs of about three billion U.S. dollars
over 15 years for modernizing its 230,000-strong armed forces.
</P>
<P>
After Warsaw, Clinton was flying to Bucharest, the capital of
Romania, where he was expected to reassure that NATO's door would
stay open for other East European countries willing to join in.

BABGKOK, July 11 (Xinhua) -- At least 70 people were killed as
a big fire blazed a five-star hotel in Thailand's famous seaside
tourism city of Pattaya today, local media reported.

<P>
The victims including foreign tourists were killed when the
disaster took place at the Royal Jomtien Resort Hotel, about 200
kilometers southeast of Bangkok, earlier this morning.
</P>
<P>
The fire reportedly was triggered by gas leaking in the coffee
house at the first floor of the 16-storey hotel, followed by heavy
explosions of gas containers. It soared to the top of the hotel
within one hour.
</P>
<P>
The fire was put under control about six hours later and about
80 percent of the hotel was damaged.
</P>
<P>
Officials said that the number of the people killed in the
disaster was likely to rise later.

BEIJING, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The third batch of Sidney Shapiro
awards has been bestowed on 32 outstanding young Chinese
journalism students, teachers and professional journalists here at
the China School of Journalism.
</P>
<P>
A member of the Communist Party of Great Britain, Shapiro came
to work at Xinhua News Agency in 1950 at the invitation of the
Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. For the rest of
his life Shapiro worked as an editor at Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
His commitment to China's cause won him great respect from
Chinese leaders, including Deng Xiaoping, who praised him as a
sincere friend of the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
After his death in 1986, Shapiro's family and friends
co-sponsored the Shapiro Journalism Education Foundation in London
to give awards to outstanding students and teachers at the China
School of Journalism and outstanding journalists working at Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The Shapiro awards were first awarded in 1993. To date, a total
of 94 students, teachers and professional journalists have won the
awards. Starting next year, the awards will be granted annually,
rather than every other year, as at present.
</P>
<P>
Guo Chaoren, president of Xinhua, Liu Jinghe, Shapiro's widow,
and Solomon Shapiro, their elder son, were among those attending
the awards ceremony.

CAIRO, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Following are business briefs from
the Middle East countries:
</P>
<P>
NICOSIA -- Cypriot House of Representatives approved Thursday
new tax incentives to boost the tourist industry in an effort to
upgrade the island's tourist product.
</P>
<P>
The new law gives a 10-year tax break on profits from any
venture based on an ancillary tourist building or project, which
must be recognized by the Ministries of Finance, and Commerce,
Industry and Tourism and involve a capital investment in excess
of 500,000 Cyprus pounds (about 1 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
NICOSIA -- The Cypriot stock market continued on a dull mood
in the absence of any news on the economy's prospects in the
current year.
</P>
<P>
It drifted to slightly lower levels this week, with activity
shrinking, as the summer period is by now well underway,
according to a report by the Cyprus Investment and Securities
Corporation Limited (CISCO) today.
</P>
<P>
The CISCO All-share Index closed Thursday at 382.3 points,
suffering small weekly losses of 2 points or 0.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Some 72,000 foreign tourists visited Egypt in June
this year against 52,000 in the same month last year, local media
reports said today.
</P>
<P>
the reports said that the number of Arab tourists hit 48,000
last June against 49,000 in June last year.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egypt's medicine industry could face the foreign
competition, local Arabic-language newspaper Al-Gomhuria today
quoted Minister of Health Ismail Sallam as saying.
</P>
<P>
Sallam said that there is no reason beyond fears on enforcing
the intellectual property agreement.
</P>

<HEADLINE> China's Financial Sector Stable: Central Bank (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 11 (Xinhua) -- China's financial sector was
stable in the first half of this year, the People's Bank of China,
the country's central bank, announced here today in a news release.
</P>
<P>
"As the relatively tight monetary policy was conscientiously
followed and efforts were made to strengthen financial
supervision, the money supply grew appropriately in the first six
months of this year," the bulletin said.
</P>
<P>
The latest statistics show that the outstanding amount of broad
money (M2), which is the combination of cash and all kinds of
deposits, was valued at 8,278.9 billion yuan by the end of
June. This amount was up 19.1 percent on last year's figure, a
growth rate 6.2 percentage points lower than at the end of last
year.
</P>
<P>
The outstanding amount of narrow money (M1), i.e, cash plus
demand deposits, stood at 3107.4 billion yuan at the end of last
month, up 20.6 percent over the previous year or 1.7 percentage
points higher than at the end of 1996. Cash in circulation, known
as M0, was up 19 percent year-on-year to 912.2 billion yuan by the
end of June.
</P>
<P>
The bank revealed that both deposits and loans grew steadily in
the January-June period, which effectively helped guarantee the
country's capital need for economic growth.
</P>
<P>
By the end of June there was a total of 7,542.6 billion yuan in
deposits in the banking system, an increase of 597.4 billion yuan
or 19.8 percent more than at the beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
A breakdown shows that outstanding savings deposits totaled
4,275 billion yuan by the end of last month, up 19.6 percent over
the same period of last year, or 400 billion yuan more than at the
beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
As individuals held more cash in hand to capitalize on a rising
stock market in the early months of the year, and the authorities
took measures to prevent public funds being deposited in the name
of individuals to gain more interest, the incremental value of
savings deposits in the first six months of this year was 170
billion yuan less than that during the same period of last
year.

<HEADLINE> China's Financial Sector Stable, Says Central Bank (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Statistics show that the outstanding amount of enterprise
deposits surged 27.6 percent to 2567.4 billion yuan by the end of
last month.
</P>
<P>
The PBC said that the steady growth of enterprise deposits
indicates that the payment viability of enterprises has improved.
</P>
<P>
Between January and June, loans by all financial institutions
rose by 394.4 billion yuan, which brought the June-end outstanding
amount to 6815.5 billion yuan, or 18.1 percent more than a month
ago.
</P>
<P>
The central bank also said that China's foreign exchange
reserves have maintained a rapid growth since the start of this
year, reaching 121.2 billion US dollars by the end of June.
</P>
<P>
Though more yuan funds have been used to purchase increasing
surplus hard currency, the central bank has managed to control the
supply of cash, known as base money, by taking effective measures
to withdraw discount loans to commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the outstanding amount of base money
totaled 2749.8 billion yuan by the end of June, which was 19
percent more than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The PBC said that despite all the improvement in the major
financial indicators, some problems still exist in the financial
sector, such as an unsatisfactory withdrawal of cash and
unauthorized borrowing of overseas debt in some places.
</P>
<P>
To solve the problems, the central bank will continue to
implement a relatively tight monetary policy in the second half of
this year and will take measures to curb cash supply and improve
financial macro control, the news release said.
</P>
<P>
Efforts will also be made to rectify the financial order and
improve loan quality, in order to cut the ratio of non-performing
loans by two to three percentage points a year, the central bank
said.

<P>
NEW DELHI, July 11 (Xinhua) -- At least 10 people were killed
and 34 others injured in police firing and incidents of stone
pelting and arson in the south Indian city of Bombay (Mumbai)
early today, Press Trust of India (PTI) said.
</P>
<P>
The trouble was sparked off following the desecration of a
statue of B.R. Ambedkar, author of the Indian constitution, by
unidentified miscreants in northeast Bombay, according to police.
</P>
<P>
The statue of Ambedkar, who was from the minority community,
was found garlanded with slippers this morning.
</P>
<P>
Traffic on a busy highway in the city came to a grinding halt
as mobs stoned passing vehicles and a police post.
</P>
<P>
Reports said police opened fire on a group of people who tried
to torch a luxury bus and set afire an oil tanker.
</P>
<P>
Many people were injured in the firing and rushed to a local
hospital where 10 of them succumbed to injuries.
</P>
<P>
Trouble also broke out in other areas of the metropolitan, PTI

<HEADLINE> Manila Bourse Rebounds on Peso Devaluation Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine stock market today
reversed its downturn and shot up after the central bank announced
its decision to allow the peso-U.S. dollar rate to move to a new
level consistent with market conditions.
</P>
<P>
The 30-stock Philippine Composite Index (Phisix), which had
nose-dived in the past three consecutive trading days, soared
189.99 points or 7.5 percent to close at 2,701.14.
</P>
<P>
The broader All Shares Index jumped 47.67 points to finish at
871.09. All sub-indices were on the upside, with the
commercial-industrial and mining sectors registering more than
200-point rises after closing at 3,551.18 (+222.65) and 3,968.11
(+349.59) respectively.
</P>
<P>
Total turnover was 4.579 billion shares worth 4.2 billion pesos
(160.3 million U.S. dollars). Advances overwhelmed declines 118 to
13, with 45 issues unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Market analysts attributed the market's reversal to the return
of investors from the market of fixed income equities like
treasury bills after the announcement of the central bank's
decision this morning.
</P>
<P>
They said investors were pleased with the central bank's
decision, which will lead to an effective depreciation of the
currency and a lower overnight borrowing rate of the central bank.
</P>
<P>
Investors had flocked to fixed income equities since July 2
when the central bank began to increase its borrowing rate to
protect the peso after the floatation of the Thai baht. As a
result, the Phisix had fallen almost 11 percent since July 2.
</P>
<P>
The overnight borrowing rate, which was raised to 32 percent, a
four-year high, Thursday by the central bank, is expected to be
lowered in the very near future.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Closes Slightly Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Silence from the Reserve Bank of
Australia on official interest rates drove the Australian dollar
to tight trading today with the local currency lifting only
slightly to the close.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar ended at 74.44 US cents, up from 74.33 at
Thursday's close.
</P>
<P>
One dealer said, today's trading movement was "a reflection of
a very short market."
</P>
<P>
Expectation of a cut to official interest rates was heightened
after Thursday's release of labor force data for June, which
pointed to weaker-than-expected jobs growth.
</P>
<P>
Another dealer said, gold's price increase today had added its
support to the local unit.
</P>
<P>
Gold bullion closed trade in Sydney at 320.75 US dollars an
ounce from 319.60 Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The fall in housing finance by volume of 8.4 percent in May was
larger than economists had expected.
</P>
<P>
However, trend figures showing a slight increase in total
dwellings financed in May were in line with forecasts.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar finished at 84.71 from 83.74 against
Japanese yen and was at 1.3058 from 1.3113 against German marks.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka Stock Exchange Suffers Major Index Slide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The price index of the Dhaka Stock
Exchange (DSE) suffered a major slide in the just-ended trading
week as share prices declined further amid lackluster trading,
said stock market sources.
</P>
<P>
The DSE All Share Price Index went down to 1048.02 on Thursday,
shedding 50.33 points from the previous week's closing records.
Most of the traded issues incurred losses during the period except
on Tuesday when gaining issues dominated the market.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, a total of 180,747 shares and debentures worth
33.89 million taka (about 780,000 U.S. dollars) changed hands
while market capitalization on the day was 87.65 billion taka
(about 2.01 billion dollars). Both showed a downward trend
compared with the previous week's records.
</P>
<P>
The slide in share prices has been continuing since the middle
of June because the budget for the 1997-98 fiscal year was placed
before the parliament ignoring major demands of portfolio
investors.
</P>
<P>
The fall was precipitated last week when the Investment
Corporation of Bangladesh (ICB), the lone merchant bank in the
country, increased its lending rate to above 13 percent from 11
percent for the share investors' scheme.
</P>
<P>
Share brokers said investors had lost interest in buying shares
through the ICB due to the high interest rate. Unless a good
number of merchant banks in the private sector are set up, fall in
the share prices will continue for months, they observed.

<HEADLINE> Australian Small Business Minister Resigns: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister John
Howard announced here tonight the resignation of Small Business
Minister Geoff Prosser.
</P>
<P>
Prosser had been under siege from the opposition over
allegations of conflict of interest involving his substantial
Western Australian business interests.
</P>
<P>
Prosser's resignation became inevitable several weeks ago. As a
landlord of three major retail properties in Bunbury, he became
responsible for the government's response to a parliamentary
inquiry, recommending major reforms to retail tenancy laws.
</P>
<P>
In a minor cabinet reshuffle, the prime minister gave
responsibility for small business to Industrial Relations Minister
Peter Reith.
</P>
<P>
In his resignation letter to Howard, Prosser, who was appointed
as minister for small business last March after the coalition won
the federal election, said he had become concerned over the impact
of opposition attacks on him.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister, who has insisted throughout that Prosser
had not breached his ministerial guidelines by retaining an active
involvement in his business empire, praised his handling of the
attacks.
</P>
<P>
"In submitting your resignation you have placed the interest of
the government and the Liberal Party first and foremost," he
replied to Prosser.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Economy to Grow by 5-7 Percent in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The Singapore economy will grow
by 5 to 7 percent in 1997, Minister for Finance Richard Hu said in
the parliament today, reconfirming earlier forecasts made by the
government.
</P>
<P>
Presenting his 1997/98 budget address to the parliament, the
minister said Singapore's economic fundamentals are solid, with a
robust fiscal position and sound economic framework.
</P>
<P>
With continued focus on staying competitive and responsive to
the external environment, the country can expect good growth over
the medium to long term, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, Singapore faces mounting competition as international
competition is becoming keener in all sectors in the Singapore
economy.
</P>
<P>
Hence, the minister challenged firms like Singapore Telecom and
Singapore Airlines to move into new technologies, services and
markets and find ways to offer better services at lower costs.
</P>
<P>
The same goes for Singapore's manufacturing sector, he said,
pledging to ensure it remains a mainstay of the country's economy.
The future is not guaranteed, but it can be bright, he said.

<HEADLINE> Power Industry Development in Inner Mongolia (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The electric power industry of the
Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is using its abundant coal
resources, something that will help it become a major energy
producer for north China.
</P>
<P>
A modern coal industry has begun to replace the scene of sheep
and cattle roaming the vast pastureland for which the region is
known.
</P>
<P>
"The energy industry, which is focused on coal mining and
generating power will become one of the region's pillar industries
in the next five years," says Wang Suyi, deputy-director of the
region's planning committee.
</P>
<P>
This will provide opportunities for big energy consumers like
the metallurgy, chemical, and building materials industries, he
said, and the region should make full use of its rich mineral
resources for economic development.
</P>
<P>
It has more than 220 billion tons of proven coal deposits,
ranking second in the country, next to Shanxi Province in the
north.
</P>
<P>
Most of the coal mines in the region, with their thick layers,
simple geographic structure, and shallow depth, are suitable for
open mining, Wang noted.
</P>
<P>
With many state key mines like the Jungar, Dongsheng,
Yuanbaoshan, Yiminhe, and Huolinhe, and a large group of mid-sized
and small mines, the region plans to increase the output of raw
coal to 100 million tons by the year 2000, as opposed to the
present 84 million tons. About 45 percent of the coal will be sold
to other parts of the country or exported overseas by then.

<TEXT>
<P>
To ease the transportation strain, reduce environmental
pollution, and improve the economy of coal production areas, the
state has encouraged to replace the transportation of coal by
transmitting electricity.
</P>
<P>
The abundant output of coal and a relatively convenient water
supply has meant good prospects for the region's thermal power
industry, Wang Suyi said.
</P>
<P>
The region has accelerated work on three thermal power bases in
eastern, middle and western areas. Power stations including
Haibowan, Dalad, Togtoh and Jungar have already been built or are
being built around the Yellow River.
</P>
<P>
The power supply network transports 40 percent of the electric
power produced in the region each year to the industrial bases in
northeast China and the capital city of Beijing, where the energy
is in short supply.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that the region will have a power generating capacity
of 54 billion kilowatt-hours, more than 40 percent of which will
be used outside the region.
</P>
<P>
The region has promoted the use of wind to generate electric
power. The available capacity of wind power has reached 15,000 kw,
ranking first in the country, according to Professor Wang Linjiang
of the Inner Mongolia Institute of Electric Power.
</P>
<P>
He says that some 125,000 small wind generators in the region
produce enough electric power for the daily needs of 560,000
farmers and herdsmen.
</P>
<P>
Petroleum exploration has also been done in the Urad and Ordos
in the western part of the region, Wang said.

<HEADLINE> 13 Palestinians Wounded in Resumed Clashes with </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 11 (Xinhua) -- About 13 Palestinian
demonstrators were wounded today in resumed clashes with Israeli
troops in Hebron, according to a report of JMCC, a Palestinian
press service based in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The clashes happened in places between the Jewish settler
enclave and the Palestinian self-rule areas. Palestinian
teenagers tossed stones and dozens of fire bombs at Israeli
soldiers who responded with live ammunition and rubber bullets.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. pro-peace nun stood in between the stone-throwing
demonstrators and the heavily armed Israeli soldiers trying to
calm down the situation.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Head of Israeli Central Command Major General Uzi
Dayan ordered the closure of Palestinian stores opposite Jewish
settlements at Beit Hadassah in downtown Hebron and an army post
was set up at the site, from where shots were fired at Beit
Hadassah Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
A pipe bomb was thrown at an Israeli army patrol near Yaacubia
School Thursday afternoon and five fire-bombs were thrown at
Israeli soldiers and border policemen during the day.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli authorities blamed the Palestinian National
Authority for the daily street battles in Hebron. But Norwegian
observers here said that the cause rests with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Israel's accusations, Chief of the Palestinian
Preventive Security Service Jibril Rajoub said: "My
responsibility is to defend my people and to ensure that they can
live in peace and security, not to defend the racist and
expansionist policies of Mr. Netanyahu."
</P>
<P>
"Half of the Israeli people oppose Netanyahu's settlement
policy. Why should I defend it," he said.

<P>
In a statement issued late Thursday night, the Orange Order
said it was calling off the parades" for the greater good of the
province."
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday's march in Northern Ireland touched off a series
of violence with dozens of police and civilians being injuried.
</P>
<P>
The Protestants planned marches in Belfast, Londonderry, Armagh
and Newry on July 12 to celebrate the 307th anniversary of a
victory by Protestant king over the Catholic monarch. But the
parades were strongly opposed by the Catholic residents who say
the marches were an exhibition of sectarian intimidation.
</P>
<P>
The decision to call off or reroute the scheduled marches ended
a standoff between the Orange Order and Catholic residents
associations who had threatened mass demonstrations to block the
parades.
</P>
<P>
Britain's Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam said the
decision would "be received with a great deal of relief and
appreciation in Northern Ireland and beyond."
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams issued a statement welcoming
the Order's decision to avoid possible further violence in the
province..

million U.S. Dollars, said a document on road sector investment
program 1997-2007.

and medical treatment, it said.

pregnancies are unwanted in Uganda, and 73 percent of Ugandan

</P>
<P>
According to "The New Vision" today, research on adolescents
has put the percentage of unwanted pregnancies of teenagers at 20
to 60.

<HEADLINE> Japan to Recall 50,000 Faulty Bikes in Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Japanese bicycle parts maker
Shimano would recall about 50,000 mountain bikes in Australia
because of faulty cranks that may cause injuries, the company's
Australian importers said today.
</P>
<P>
Saus Pty Ltd. Managing Director John Bazzano said the cranks,
which connect pedals to the frame and chain mechanism, were fitted
on a range of mountain bike brands from mid-1994 to mid-1995 and
sold in Australia during 1995.
</P>
<P>
Shimano was recalling more than 2.5 million mountain bikes
worldwide because of the defective cranks.
</P>
<P>
At least 630 of the cranks had broken while in use in North
America, resulting in injuries, company executives said.
</P>
<P>
Bazzano said no injuries had occurred in Australia.
</P>
<P>
However, his company was organizing a voluntary recall and
owners of affected models should stop riding the bikes immediately
and return them to a bicycle dealer for free replacement of the
crank, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The crank can develop a crack and this can cause a failure
under certain circumstances and we're concerned that if this crank
broke you will lose control of the cycle or at least do some
damage to your body," Bazzano added.
</P>
<P>
The recall would cost Shimano "several million dollars " in
Australia alone, he said.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan to Bring Population Growth Below 1 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistani government plans
to bring the population growth rate to less than 1 percent in five
years from the current annual rate of 2.7 percent, Minister for
Population Welfare Syeda Abida Hussain said today.
</P>
<P>
"The target is difficult but not impossible," said Abida at the
National Population Convention held here to mark the World
Population Day.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's population growth rate has declined from 3.1 percent
in 1991 to 2.7 percent at present, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
She added that political commitment is basic for making any
population program successful.
</P>
<P>
"Though Pakistan has one of the oldest population planning
programs in Asia, but the lack of political will did not allow it
to fully succeed in the past," she said.
</P>
<P>
Abida asked the government to double the present budget of 10
million rupees (250,000 U.S. dollars) so that the population
planning program could be expanded.
</P>
<P>
She also stressed the need for educating women, arguing that
studies have shown that educated women have fewer children.

<HEADLINE> China's Highway Sector To Use More Foreign Funds: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 11 (Xinhua) -- China's newly-enacted Highway Law
has standardized the fund-raising methods used by the country's
road-building sector and could help attract more foreign
investment in the field.
</P>
<P>
The remark was made here today by Vice-Minister of
Communications Li Juchang at a news conference which was attended
by over 70 foreign journalists in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, since 1985, when China accepted the
first World Bank loans for highway projects, the country has
constructed over 10,000 km of roadways, with total foreign
financing of five billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and the Japanese
Government are the main suppliers of funding for road projects in
China, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said China plans to introduce more overseas funds for
highway construction and foreign investment is expected to cover
10 percent of the total demand for funding by the highway sector
during the Ninth Five-Year Plan period (1996-2000).
</P>
<P>
According to official figures, by the end of last year, all the
counties, 97 percent of towns and townships, and 83 percent of the
villages in the country had been connected by highways.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the total mileage of highways in the country
reached 1.19 million km, including 3,400 km of expressways.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Urged to Keep off Kenya's Internal Affairs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Kenya has urged the U.S.
government to refrain from accusing it over the recent
confrontations between Kenyan police and opposition supporters,
according to local press reports today.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Foreign Minister Kalonzo Musyoka said on thursday that
the Kenyan government took exception to a statement by U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright which claimed that the
current political violence in Kenya was caused by Nairobi's
"unacceptable strong-arm tactics."
</P>
<P>
It is becoming pretty obvious, the Kenyan minister said, the
opposition parties in the East African country are committed to
violence by all means.
</P>
<P>
"They are inciting violence to create the impression that
Kenya is in political crisis and shift the blame on the
government," he added.
</P>
<P>
Musyoka said that Kenya is a sovereign country and the U.S.
government could not dictate to Kenya over the internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
There was a definite foreign intervention in the recent
Kenyan confrontation and the opposition has been aided and
abetted by foreigners, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi is
committed to peace and his doors are widely open though the
opposition is not interested in engaging in dialogue.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, President Moi had barely a year ago
offered to meet with the opposition representatives at his
Harambee House in Nairobi but the opposition "refused to turn
up."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, President Moi said yesterday that the Opposition
had chosen violence to press for constitutional reforms in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Opposition is using the same strategy of violence as that
was adopted during the run-up to the General Elections in 1992,
when the Opposition instigated tribal clashes in the Rift Valley
Province in order to have political agenda, the president said.
</P>
<P>
The kenyan president accused some foreign countries of imposing
different types of democracy on African countries, saying that
every country should be left alone to devise its own form of
democracy suitable to the local situation.

<HEADLINE> Israel Assures Egypt of Gas Deal Despite Russian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Israel has tried hard to assure
Egypt that its talks with Russia on purchase of gas do not mean a
drop of regional option, The Jerusalem Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
The issue emerged after a delegation of five senior executives
from the Russian-based RAO Gazprom, the world's largest natural
gas producer, arrived in Israel earlier this week to open talks
for the supply of gas via Turkey and an undersea pipe line.
</P>
<P>
It seems that the talks have cast a shadow upon the
three-year-old negotiations for the supply of gas from Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Originally, the Egyptian plan called for Israel to import an
annual 2.5 billion cubic meters of gas by the year 2000 via a
pipeline across the Sinai Desert. Now experts say a deadline of
2002 looks more realistic.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with Israeli National Infrastructure Minister
Ariel Sharon in the Knesset (parliament) Wednesday, Gazprom
Future Development Director Victor Brianski said gas could be
supplied to Israel by 2001.
</P>
<P>
Talks between the two sides will resume at the end of this
month or early next month. The Israel Electric Corporation will
become a major player in these negotiations as it will be the
major purchaser of the gas.
</P>
<P>
The idea of purchasing Russian gas was first raised by Prime
Minister Binyamin Netanyahu under political considerations. During
his visit to Russia in March, Netanyahu suggested that Israel
spend billions of dollars to buy Russian oil and gas in return for
Russian cancellation of nuclear and missile deals with Iran.
</P>
<P>
In June, Sharon visited Moscow for talks with Gazprom and
senior Russian government officials following the appointment of
new Fuel and Energy Minister Boris Nemtsov.
</P>
<P>
In prompt reaction to the latest development, Egyptian
Ambassador to Israel Mohammed Bassiouny said that "the decision is
up to Israel." He added that Egypt will have no problems selling
its gas elsewhere, with the Palestinian National Authority being a
possible alternative customer.
</P>
<P>
Bassiouny pointed out that Egypt is next door, while Russian
source is thousands of kilometers away. "Of course the supply
would be cheaper from Egypt," he said.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Foreign Ministry sources were quoted as saying that
Israel will possibly buy gas from both Russia and Egypt so as
"not to put all the energy eggs in one basket."
</P>
<P>
Israel has also considered a deal with Qatar. But the option
seems less likely, given the high costs, with the need for a
pipeline through Saudi Arabia or shipments.

SHIJIAZHUANG, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Hebei Province in north China
has made remarkable headway in initiating a modern enterprise
system in state-owned firms, which has already invigorated pilot
companies in the project.
</P>
<P>
So far, 162 enterprises have been transformed into
share-holding companies and 50 more firms are experimenting with
the modern enterprise system.
</P>
<P>
The system, which represents the higher degree of autonomy that
is gaining ground in the internal administration of many
enterprises, is a pivotal step taken by the central authorities
to enliven its loss-making State sector.
</P>
<P>
Pilot reforms are now in full swing across China, especially in
major industrial bases such as Shanghai and Liaoning.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Thailand Wants Better Compliance With Tariff Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Thailand wants the ASEAN
Secretariat to take a closer look at the implementation of tariff
reductions under the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) in order to
guard against violations.
</P>
<P>
Six of the seven ASEAN members have committed to reducing
tariffs on a wide range of goods to between zero and 5 percent by
the year 2003. Vietnam has been given until 2006 to do so.
</P>
<P>
However, the secretariat has not been examining whether some
members were breaching their commitments, the Bangkok Post today
quoted Charin Harnsuebsai, deputy director-general of the Business
Economics Department, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Charin complained that Indonesia and Malaysia have increased
their tariffs on imported petrochemical products from 5 to 40
percent, but did not inform the secretariat.
</P>
<P>
Petrochemical products are on the "fast track" tariff reduction
program, with the year 2000 as the deadline for tariffs to fall
from an average of 20 percent or more to between zero and 5
percent level.
</P>
<P>
Thai economic officials may raise the issue at a meeting later
this month in Kuala Lumpur.
</P>
<P>
The officials may also raise at the meeting the Philippines'
refusal to include rice in its tariff reduction regime. The
Philippine government sought a ruling from its supreme court on
whether it should reduce protection for rice.
</P>
<P>
The secretariat should have a transparent mechanism for
monitoring compliance with tariff reduction commitments, Charin
urged.

<HEADLINE> Pak Leaders on Need to Check Rapid Population Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani leaders said today in
their separate messages on the occasion of World Population Day
that the population issue should be addressed with all
seriousness.
</P>
<P>
President Farooq Leghari said the population growth has a
significant impact on development efforts, poverty alleviation and
quality of life in Pakistan and it is important that the problems
are tackled effectively.
</P>
<P>
The target of bringing down the population growth from 2.9
percent to 2.6 percent during the eighth Five Year Plan (1993-98)
would largely depend on awareness about family planning, he said.
</P>
<P>
"This should be backed up by focusing attention on the needs of
our rural population and providing them quality family planning
services at their door steps," Leghari added.
</P>
<P>
The president also said that if the government has to succeed
in its efforts of providing food, housing, health care services
and education to the masses, it must first control the rapid rate
of population growth.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said in his message that
demographic details for Pakistan are not much different from other
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
"We are the seventh most populous country in the world," said
Sharif.
</P>
<P>
He said the task of population control in the country requires
extraordinary efforts, dedication and involvement of public and
private sector organizations.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the initiatives taken by the Ministry of
Population Welfare to popularize the concept of small family norm
are now steadily taking roots in the society and some positive
results have emerged.
</P>
<P>
As a result, Sharif said, Pakistan's population growth rate has
come down to 2.7 percent per annum and is expected to further be
reduced to 1.7 percent by the end of the Ninth Five Year Plan
(1998-2003).
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said population issues demand urgent
attention as decisions taken today in this direction will shape
Pakistan's future.
</P>
<P>
Sharif said high rate of population growth is casting adverse
affects on key components of social sector, notably health,
education and employment.
</P>
<P>
"If we were to make sustainable development, then this problem
needs to be addressed effectively," he said.
</P>
<P>
He called on the nation to come forward and supplement
government's efforts to make Pakistan a prosperous and stable
country.

NEW DELHI, July 11 (Xinhua) -- India's sugar exports in the
1996-97 (October-September) season dropped to a trickle due to low

<HEADLINE> North Chinese County Benefits From World Food Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The lives of over 100,000 peasants
in Linxian county, the largest poverty-stricken area in North
China's Shanxi province, have improved immensely thanks to an
aid-the-poor project sponsored by the World Food Program (WFP).
</P>
<P>
Linxian county is a mountainous area with a population of over
500,000 and is one of the major targets of poverty relief of
China's State Council.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, the WFP began its project there by fighting
soil-erosion. And by the first half of this year, farmers
benefitted from the project and now have an average per capita
income of 620 yuan a year, nearly double that of five years
ago. This means that they now also have sufficient food and
clothing.
</P>
<P>
The project also helped develop forests, harness rivers,
improve farmland and roads, and spread the use of agro-technology
among the peasants.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Torrential rain for the past three
days has caused flash floods in several districts around
Bangladesh, leaving tens of thousands of people marooned.
</P>
<P>
Road links between Chittagong City and the Cox's Bazar were cut
off from Thursday morning as flood waters submerged several
portions of the highway, according to the local press today.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that about 0.4 million people in three counties
of the Cox's Bazar district were marooned while thousands of
houses were affected by the flood waters. People were using boats
as the only means of transportation.
</P>
<P>
In the hill districts, some 75,000 people were stranded due to
the downpour and a deluge from neighboring India. Road links
within the three hill districts will also snap if the rain
continues.
</P>
<P>
The flood also inundated the low-lying areas of at least three
counties in the northeastern Sylhet district. Standing crops and
seed beds on 6,000 acres (about 2,000 hectares) of land were
washed away by the water from the hills.
</P>
<P>
In the northwestern Durigram district, the water level of all
the rivers have recorded a sharp rise and the devastating erosion
by the three major rivers has already made 12,000 people homeless.
</P>
<P>
According to the Bangladesh Water Development Board, about 10
districts around the country suffered flood because of incessant
rain. The meteorological office also forecast heavy to very heavy
rainfall at places all over the country until tomorrow.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Envoy Condemns Train Blast in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan has condemned people
responsible for a train blast in India's Punjab on Tuesday which
killed 34 people and injured 67 others, the Times of India
reported today.
</P>
<P>
"We condemn whosoever has done it. In fact, being a prime
victim of terrorism, Pakistan will condemn terrorist incidents
everywhere," Pakistan's High Commissioner to India Ashraf Jehangir
Qazi told the paper here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Qazi made the statement in response to Punjab Chief Minister
Prakash Singh Badal's remarks on Wednesday that Pakistan's
Inter-Services Intelligence was behind the blast.
</P>
<P>
The envoy said the allegation was regrettable at a time when
the political leaders of both countries were deeply committed to
improving bilateral ties in the 50th year of independence of the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
The envoy stressed that the two sides should discourage hostile
propaganda against each other, as understood during last month's
foreign secretary-level talks in Islamabad between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
He recalled that the two sides had also agreed to put
terrorism-confronting on the agenda of Indo-Pakistan dialogue.

<HEADLINE> Central China Province Seeking Closer Ties With Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Central China's Henan Province
will try to expand trade and economic cooperation with Hong Kong,
Governor Ma Zhongcheng said recently.
</P>
<P>
The province would like to use investment, technology and
management expertise from Hong Kong to increase the economic
growth of Henan, the country's most populous province, he added.
</P>
<P>
The governor emphasized that economic and trade affairs must
strictly comply with the Basic Law of Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR), but that prospects for cooperation
in developing agriculture, mineral resources, tourism, and
industrial enterprises are good.
</P>
<P>
In agriculture, Henan can use investment and technology from
Hong Kong to improve its farm produce and sideline products at
more efficient agricultural production bases, Ma said.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, by the end of the 1991-95
period, Henan had 1.8 billion U.S. dollars in exports, some 600
million U.S. dollars of which were shipped to Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Investment from Hong Kong has accounted for 66.6 percent of the
1.92 billion U.S. dollars worth of overseas investment in the
province. It has plans for infrastructure construction, in hopes
of becoming a transit center for commodities from interior areas
to Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Henan has been used more frequently as a transit point since
the establishment of the Eurasian Continental Bridge, and is
connected to Hong Kong by the Beijing-Kowloon Railway Line, the
Beijing-Guangzhou Railway Line, and the Beijing-Shenzhen
Expressway.
</P>
<P>
The province will improve management of the tourism sector,
develop tourist resources, and create a better tourist environment
to attract more people from Hong Kong, a local official said,
adding that an association for coordinating economic cooperation
between Hong Kong and Henan, and a regular system of visits and
meetings of officials at various levels is also being suggested.

<HEADLINE> Jewish Settlers Held Protests in PNA-controlled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Some 20 Jewish settlers held
protests overnight at a road junction near the West Bank city of
Nablus, which is under control by the Palestinian National
Authority (PNA).
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio reported that the settlers, who were from Elon
More in northeast of Nablus, staged the protests after shots
were fired at the site on the car driven by the Rabbi of the
settlement.
</P>
<P>
No one was injured in the shooting incident, and it remained
unknown who was responsible for the attack.
</P>
<P>
The settlers demanded Israeli troops increase protection of
their security, saying they would stay at the site and even set
up a post themselves at the junction if the troops refused to
do so.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli undercover agents arrested Thursday night
four Palestinian youths near the Jewish holy site of Rachel's
Tomb on the outskirts of Bethlehem. They were arrested on
suspicion of throwing firebombs at the Israeli soldiers guarding
the tomb.
</P>
<P>
In another development concerning settlers in the Palestinian
territories, Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu met with
settler representatives from Gush Katif settlement in Gaza Strip,
which was the scene of a series of fierce clashes betweeen
Palestinians and settlers and Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu promised not to remove the settlement in the final
settlement between Israel and the PNA. He vowed to increase the
settlers' security, saying he would pay a visit soon to the
settlement to show his support. He added that the talks on
resuming the Israeli-Palestinian security cooperation was in
high gear.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the recent tension in the territories and the
political turmoil in Israel over the cabinet reshuffle, the
Israeli government seemed to return to business as usual to
tackle the deadlock in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday night, Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai held a
meeting with PNA Planning Minister Nabil Shaath at the residence
of Egyptian Ambassador to Israel Mohammed Bassiouny.

NEW DELHI, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The Reserve Bank of India (RBI,
the central bank) has kept off the market even as the rupee
touched a seven-month high of 35.735 per U.S. dollar at the
interbank foreign exchange market in Bombay on Thursday due to
poor demand for the U.S. currency.
</P>
<P>
"They (RBI) made some inquiries, but did not come to the market
to buy dollars," the Times of India published here today quoted a
dealer at a foreign bank as saying.
</P>
<P>
The RBI inaction combined with the poor dollar demand pushed
the rupee up although supply was pretty normal, the dealer said.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said the rupee traded at a high of 35.735 and a low of
35.765 on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Trade was quite thin, with the market consisting of mainly of
sellers," said a dealer.
</P>
<P>
During Thursday's trading, according to dealers, a number of
banks were sitting on long dollar positions looking for the RBI to
come in and buy dollars.
</P>
<P>
As the rupee kept rising through the day and the RBI stayed
away, they were forced to unwind their positions which pushed the
rupee up.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said the outlook for Friday was uncertain.
</P>
<P>
"It is a bit confusing," said a dealer. "Based on its past
actions, everyone expected the RBI to step in once the rupee hit
35.75 but now it is not clear what their intentions are."
</P>
<P>
"We will have to wait and see," he added.

<P>
TAIYUAN, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Farmer Guo Qibao from the village
of Qianmajia in north China's Shanxi Province bought land-use
rights for 800 ha of barren hillside in 1993, and has cultivated
the acreage into productive farmland which last year earned him
200,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Guo and six of his brothers are among the 122,000 families who
have benefited from the local government's practice to auction off
wasteland.
</P>
<P>
Luliang Prefecture, known for its poverty, has 310,000 ha of
wasteland, which accounts for 70 percent of its farmland. Local
farmers eked out a meager existence.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, the prefecture adopted land-use policies, which
defined that the farmers' ownership of wasteland will remain
unchanged for 50 years, and buyers can put the land into market
and circulation.
</P>
<P>
Farmer Li Qiusheng in Linxian County raised 6,000 yuan to buy
some 66 ha of wasteland. After his purchase, his entire family was
kept busy on the land, growing fruit trees, herbal medicines, and
raising pigs and sheep.
</P>
<P>
Now the family earns more than 100,000 yuan annually. "The
State has good land-use policies, we should work to improve the
wasteland," Li said.
</P>
<P>
Farmers, rather than the State, are now the major investors in
developing wasteland, and a growing number of private
entrepreneurs are joining in.
</P>
<P>
By now, the prefecture has auctioned off around 233,000 ha of
wasteland, more than 60 percent of which has been improved, and a
million farmers are living a more prosperous life as a result.

environmentally-friendly buses using compressed natural gas as
fuel are operating on the streets of Chengdu, the capital of
southwest China's Sichuan Province.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the traditional buses that use gasoline or diesel
fuel, these emit far fewer harmful gasses into the air, and have
gotten a good reception by the public since being put to use.
</P>
<P>
Officials say that this kind of bus will account for about half
the city's buses by the end of the century.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Plans to Boost Forest Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar needs to turn out more
value-added forest products to meet domestic demand and promote
export, the official newspaper the New Light of Myanmar reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Forestry Minister Chit Swe made the proposal here Thursday at a
seminar on the Development of Wood-Based and Non-Wood Forest
Product Industries.
</P>
<P>
The minister said industries of value-added forest products
lack private investment, while entrepreneurs pay more attention to
export of logs and sawn timber as a short-term business.
</P>
<P>
He called for upgrading trading to manufacturing for the
long-term interest.
</P>
<P>
He also proposed establishing all-round wood-based industrial
zones as well as non-wood forest product industries with the aim
to scale down and cease export of logs.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar's hardwood export in the 1996-97 fiscal year ending
March was estimated at 142,000 cubic meters, while that of teak at
184,000 cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar's export of forest products amounted to 218 million
U.S. dollars in the 1996-97 fiscal year, accounting for 24.4
percent of the total export, second only to agricultural export,
according to the latest official statistics.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar restricts export of logs by banning the private sector
from exporting teak logs after the enactment of the country's
Forest Law in 1992. However, export of value-added wood products
is encouraged.

<HEADLINE> Listed Railway Company Achieving Good Economic Efficiency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Guangzhou-Shenzhen Railway
Co. Ltd. of south China's Guangdong Province has netted an
after-tax profit of 1.178 billion yuan since it began operating on
a share-holding system more than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The company, which is also China's first firm ever listed on
the bourses both in Hong Kong and New York, has also topped other
Chinese railway companies in the areas of average per km
operational railway earnings, per capita pre-tax earnings and per
capita after-tax profit.
</P>
<P>
The company switched to its share-holding plan in March of
1966, when the country's railway sector was defeated by the
airlines in a fight for passengers.
</P>
<P>
An executive of the company said it had made a good use of its
greater autonomy in decision-making and practiced a wide range of
measures in daily operations that cater to market changes after
March, 1996.
</P>
<P>
The measures include optimizing time schedules for train
departures and arrivals, banning the collecting of miscellaneous
fees from passengers, which both have proved effective and helped
win over some of the company's lost market shares.
</P>
<P>
The company will strive to improve its internal operation
mechanisms, said the executive, added that it would use IC
(identity card) automatic ticket-selling machines in Guangzhou,
capital of Guangdong Province, and the city of Shenzhen to
increase speed of ticket sales.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the company will also finish the
electrification of the existing Guangzhou-Shenzhen Railway Line
and use imported Sweden-made trains to shorten the present rail
travel time from Guangzhou to Shenzhen to 48 minutes in the first
half of next year, according to the executive.

<HEADLINE> China To Combine Onshore With Offshore Oil Exploration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The Suizhong 36-1 oilfield in
China's Bohai Sea has prepared an unprecedented move to combine
onshore with offshore oil exploration.
</P>
<P>
According to a Bohai Oilfield official, the purpose of the move
is to decrease production costs and shorten the time of
development.
</P>
<P>
Six offshore oil platforms and an oil and gas treatment plant
with an annual handling capacity of 5.5 million tons will be
built. Crude oil extracted from offshore oil wells will be
transported onshore for initial treatment and processing through a
70-km pipeline.
</P>
<P>
The Suizhong field is the country's largest offshore
oilfield. It is located at Liaodong Bay and covers a
48-sq.km. area with more than 300 million tons of proven oil
reserves.
</P>
<P>
To ensure the success of the program, the Bohai Oil Company
began a trial exploration project in 1988 at a cost of 1.8 billion
yuan, on a 6.55-sq. km. area.
</P>
<P>
So far, more than 50 million tons of proven reserves have been
discovered in the trial area, with an annual crude production
capacity of 1.5 million tons.

<HEADLINE> Floating Baht to Set Large Thai Conglomerate into Red </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's industrial conglomerate
Siam Cement Group has said it could lose as much as 9.9 billion
baht (about 340 million U.S. dollars) if the baht weakens to 30
against the dollar.
</P>
<P>
With 4 billion dollars in outstanding foreign loans, 25 percent
of them short-term, the group faces massive foreign exchange
losses if the baht continues its slide against the dollar,
according to Siam president Chumpol Nalamlieng.
</P>
<P>
The central bank's reference rate on Thursday was 29.075 baht
to the dollar, as against the 25.75 before the floating, down 12.9
percent.
</P>
<P>
The 84-year-old group relied on a basket hedge to guard against
foreign exchange fluctuations for its foreign debts, a common
method where firms borrow funds in different currencies matching
the weighting used by the Bank of Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Under the basket hedge, appreciation of the dollar against the
baht would be balanced by a depreciation in the yen, thus
canceling much of the financial impact of minor currency
fluctuations.
</P>
<P>
However, since the float of the baht on July 2, the currency
has weakened by 10-15 percent against nearly all currencies,
wreaking havoc on Siam Cement's basket hedge strategy.

<HEADLINE> Educated Chinese Farmers Getting Away From Poverty Faster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Liu Fujin, a farmer in Xinxian
county in China's Henan Province, who used to be illiterate, has
become a major dispenser of advice for his fellow villagers.
</P>
<P>
Liu is one of a million illiterate farmers who have benefited
from an illiteracy-eradication project that began in the early
1980s to help the poor people of the Dabie Mountains, in the
southern part of the province.
</P>
<P>
The percentage of illiterate or semi-literate young and
middle-aged farmers there dropped from 37 to 4.9. A literate
farmer is expected to learn 1,500 Chinese characters, be able to
keep an account book, write simple articles, and read simple
technical materials.
</P>
<P>
More importantly, educated farmers have learned how to get away
from poverty and have become more aware of the market economy. The
mountainous Xinyang prefecture has seen the number of poor people
drop from 2.57 million in 1983 to 473,000 last year.
</P>
<P>
"Among the remainder of the poor farmers, 37 percent still
suffer from illiteracy, so education is the key to poverty
relief," said Zhang Yuxin, the director of the prefecture's
poverty relief office.
</P>
<P>
Every village in the prefecture has training classes, and the
heirs of the illiteracy-eradication program can attend the classes
for further study. About two million farmers have learned one or
two practical skills that have helped them further.
</P>
<P>
Farmers, who in the past relied primarily on the weather's
mood, now turn to science and technology for relief. In 1990, the
prefecture introduced the use of hybrid rice on 200,000 ha to
increase per-ha output. As a result, it ended the history of
bringing in grain from elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
Science and technology have contributed greatly to its
eight-fold increase in GDP, seven-fold in revenues, and tripled
incomes for farmers.

<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The Serb rotating President of
the Bosnian Presidency, Momcilo Krajisnik, Thursday condemned the
killing of a Serb former police officer by the Multinational
Stablization Force (SFOR).
</P>
<P>
Krajisnik also criticized the arrest of a Serb hospital head by
the SFOR, the Yugoslav news agency Tanjug reported from Pale.
</P>
<P>
He asked for an immediate investigation into the affair, and
punishment for the responsible person. Measures should be taken
to guarantee that the similar affairs did not happen again, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Only by this means, could the regional peace be saved and the
Dayton peace accord, signed in December, 1995, be comprehensively
implemented, Krajisnik said.
</P>
<P>
Krajisnik, who had agreed to send Serb citizens, shown to be
guilty, for trial before the international community, also
called on the guarantors of the Dayton accord, especially the
United States, to prevent the SFOR from arresting people in the
Bosnian Serb Republic of Srpska.
</P>
<P>
He asked the Bosnian Serbs to keep calm and not to take
retaliatory actions.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN to Send Delegation to Meet Sihanouk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) has agreed to send an Indonesian delegation to
meet Cambodia's Prince Norodom Sihanouk as part of an effort to
seek a peaceful resolution to the armed conflict in Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
They consider Sihanouk to be a key Cambodian figure, having a
charisma respected by the common people and the two warring
parties.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said ASEAN foreign
ministers also expected the delegation to meet with Hun Sen and
Norodom Ranariddh, leaders of the two conflicting parties.
</P>
<P>
"We will ask them to give us an opportunity to meet them as
soon as possible before the ASEAN ministerial-level meeting is
held in Malaysia." he said.
</P>
<P>
As for plans for Cambodia's membership in the association,
Alatas said: "Although ASEAN has decided to delay Cambodia's
membership in the association, that country's status as an
observer at ASEAN forums remains."
</P>
<P>
"We do not mean to eliminate Cambodia's opportunity to join
ASEAN but will only suspend it," he added.
</P>
<P>
Troops loyal to Cambodia's First Prime Minister Norodom
Ranariddh, and Second Prime Minister Hun Sen, exchanged gunfire
near the capital Phnom Penh when Hun Sen's troops demanded to
search military barracks under Ranariddh's control for illegal
weapons.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia's unwieldy coalition government collapsed in violence
on Saturday when Hun Sen's forces moved against Ranariddh's men in
the capital. Ranariddh had left the country the previous day.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen declared Ranariddh's ousting on Sunday as his forces
consolidated their grip on the city and its outskirts, pushing
Ranariddh's men from their bases in and around the city.
</P>
<P>
Ranariddh accused Hun Sen of a coup d'etat and urged the United
Nations Security Council on Thursday not to recognize any
government resulting from the weekend's coup, and to freeze aid to
Cambodia.

<P>
MEXICO CITY, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-five items of
Mesoamerican origin dated between 1100 and 1200 A.D. have been
found in eastern Mexico.
</P>
<P>
Anthropologist Mirna Ruiz of the National Institute of
Anthropology and History said the items were found in the Ecatepec
municipality 20 days ago when stonemasons were building a fountain
on the Mexico-Pachuca highway.
</P>
<P>
She said among them was a sculpture of the wine god Tezca
Tzoncaltl, and an anthropomorphic figure with a vase in his hands
to deposit the hearts of sacrificed persons.
</P>
<P>
The wine god, who would transform anyone getting close, was
considered to be evil in the legends.
</P>
<P>
The anthropologist said Ecatepec, site of the Tecolines cavern
where a painting of Quetzalcoatl -- the major god in Mexican
Indian culture -- was found, was the birthplace of Mexican
culture.

<HEADLINE> Committee Asks for Grant to Fight Juvenile Crime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 10 (Xinhua) -- A committee of the United
States House of Representatives increased the allocation for
fighting juvenile crime, on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The bill, approved by the Appropriations Committee's Commerce,
Justice, State and Judiciary panel, focuses on the problem of
juvenile crime.
</P>
<P>
It proposes spending 300 million U.S. dollars for new block
grants for arresting and incarcerating juveniles, and another 238
million dollars for programs to prevent juvenile crime. A pending
Senate bill calls for spending 500 million dollars in block grants
each year, of which 40 percent could be used for prevention
programs.
</P>
<P>
The House earlier also called for 500 million dollars in
juvenile crime block grants, but said none of it could be used for
prevention.
</P>

SHANGHAI, July 11 (Xinhua) -- More people in China's largest
commercial center are making a contribution to public well-being
by giving a hand to people in need.

big or medium, to adapt their production processes to the needs of
the newcomers.
</P>
<P>
Other elements would be to promote a change in the country's
education system to reinforce the technical aspect.
</P>
<P>
"The country must prepare 10,000 Costa Ricans in 24 months in
the technical field" to supply the demand of specialized labor,
said Figueres.
</P>
<P>
The project demands the modernization of the country's
infrastructure, specially ports, communications, and a road
network. The president said he would favor a legislation that
would permit the transference of those installations to private
initiative.
</P>
<P>
Figueres said that Costa Rica per capita income is three or
four times above that of its Central American neighbors, so the
country cannot compete with low salaries.

<HEADLINE> Technological Exchanges Boom in Henan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The mushrooming
technology-trading organizations in central China's Henan province
have given a great impetus to a local drive for the application of
technological achievements.
</P>
<P>
The province had more than 7,000 undertakings involved in this
sector in 1996, with the number of employees reaching
110,000. Over the past ten years the "go-betweens" have helped
the province deal with as many as 130,000 technological contracts,
involving nearly seven billion yuan in business value.
</P>
<P>
Frequent trade fairs, auctions and announcements of new
technologies in Henan have provided a basis for the province to
exchange information, skills and techniques. The past ten-year
period also witnessed the local state enterprises introduce more
than 1.6 billion yuan-worth of technological advances while
transfering nearly 1.9 billion yuan-worth of its achievements. The
business volume accounted for two-fifths of the local total for
technological contracts during the same period.
</P>
<P>
In addition, there are also more than 3,000 organizations in
the sector in the rural areas, handling 150 million yuan in
turnover a year. They are expected to give a boost to the local
rural economic development by taking practical skills and
techniques to the countryside.

<P>
BONN, July 10 (Xinhua) -- A German boxing manager is hoping to
help Mike Tyson to revive his career by setting up bouts in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Klaus-Peter Kohl, manager of Germany's light-heavyweight world
champion Dariusz Michalczewski, made his decision a day after
Wednesday's revoking of Tyson's licence and a three-million-dollar
fine imposed by the Nevada State Athletic Commission.
</P>
<P>
"Tyson represents a lot of money," said Kohl on Thursday. "He
is also very famous in Europe and all the television stations
would relish a fight with him. We could fill a whole stadium."
</P>
<P>
Tyson had his licence taken away following his disqualification
for biting Evander Holyfield's ears on June 28 in a WBA
heavyweight bout.

<HEADLINE> State Plans Land Check </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The central government will soon
investigate whether farmland near cities and in rural areas has
been used in the last seven years to build golf courses,
factories or other development not stipulated in land-use
regulations, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the central government put a one-year
freeze on non-agricultural land-use, and announced the move on
April 15, according to State Land Administration (SLA), China's
top land-use and control authority.
</P>
<P>
Between 1986 and 1995, about 75 million mu (about five million
hectares) of cultivated land was lost to non-agricultural purposes.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, developers have left large tracts of land idle or
used them inefficiently. Some construction has also been
duplicated.
</P>
<P>
SLA will soon send seven groups of investigators to various
areas to urge local government agencies to begin the checks. In
August, the administration, along with the Ministry of Supervision
and other relevant departments, will handle the remaining land
cases.
</P>
<P>
The investigation will be the largest since the
mid-1980s. Investigators will look into non-agricultural land use
between 1991 and April 14.
</P>
<P>
In urban areas, investigators will examine land used by a
variety of development zones, industrial and commercial projects,
and real estate projects, including golf courses.
</P>
<P>
In rural areas, the investigation will include land used for
construction and expansion of townships and villages.
</P>
<P>
In the following weeks, the investigation will focus
on: Whether the land used for such projects is in line with local
land utilization plans; whether the land was used with official
approval and has completed legal formalities; illegal transfers,
leases or mortgages.
</P>
<P>
SLA officials said they hoped the investigation could help the
government know the exact amount of non-agricultural land-use.
</P>
<P>
This, they said, would be vital for the government to curb the
chronic problem of randomly-occupying land, further intensify land
administration and gain good experience in perfecting land-use
regulations, laws and policies.
</P>
<P>
The officials also made it clear that all land rashly approved
for non-agricultural projects by local officials exceeding their
authority between January 1 and April 14 will be invalid and those
who were responsible for such approval will by punished.
</P>
<P>
The SLA is studying possible problems that might arise in the
investigation and ways to deal with them, so officials who
illegally approve land or dispense with land wastefully, as well
sa other lawbreakers, will be held responsible for their
wrongdoings.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Snack Food JV Opens In Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The biggest joint venture between
China and Israel, the Eisem Food Co Ltd, opened yesterday in
Beijing, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The joint venture, if successful, could pave the way for more
Israeli companies to invest in China: many are looking for Chinese
business partners, said Israeli Ambassador Ora Namir at the
ribbon-cutting ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The two parties to the joint venture are the Beijing Nanjiao
Milk Co and the Osem Co, the largest grocery food manufacturer in
Israel.
</P>
<P>
Investment in the project is 5.6 million US dollars, 60 percent
of which came from the Israeli firm.
</P>
<P>
Osem is associated with Nestle, which bought 40 percent of Osem
in 1996. Nestle is providing marketing, materials and quality
control support, Osem sources said.
</P>
<P>
The joint venture produces Bamibaba, a corn-based snack which
is successful in Israel. The company has adjusted the product to
appeal to Chinese tastes.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine Lauds Special Partnership with NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine stepped into a new era of
development on Wednesday after it signed a special partnership
agreement with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO),
Ukraine's First Foreign Minister, Anton Buteiko, said today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint meeting here of the Ukrainian Social and
Political Center, the NATO Information Center and the Journalists'
Association, Buteiko said: "The agreement is an achievement of
Ukraine's foreign policy which is dedicated to promoting
integration with Europe."
</P>
<P>
Buteiko believed that the agreement, signed during NATO's
summit in Madrid, would provide Ukraine with chances to enhance
communication with the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
"Most NATO members are also EU countries," he said. "The EU is
an important factor in Ukraine's economic development."
</P>
<P>
However, some participants of the meeting challenged Buteiko,
noting the special partnership agreement was not in line with
Ukraine's status as a nonaligned nation.
</P>
<P>
"Nonalignment requires Ukraine to actively strengthen
cooperation with Europe," Buteiko answered. "When NATO expands
into Eastern Europe, Ukraine has to cooperate with NATO for the
sake of its security."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that NATO was a pan-European security
structure. "NATO will function best when all European countries
become its members," he claimed.

GENEVA, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Second seed Alex Corretja defeated
Wimbledon's finalist Cedric Pioline of France while fourth seed
Marcelo Rios was knocked out by an unknown Spaniard at the Swiss
Open tennis tournament in Gstaad, Switzerland on Thursday.

"Sometimes, you just know you are going to have a bad day,"
said Rios after losing 6-3, 7-6 (7/3) to world No. 67 Juan
Viloca, a 24-year-old Spaniard.
</P>

World No. 6 Corretja took advantage of Pioline's aching right
arm, "over-used" during his run to last weekend's final at the
All England Club and a loss to Pete Sampras.
</P>
<P>
Spaniard Corretja, who leads the ATP Tour in claycourt
victories with 27 this year, reached the quarter-finals easily as
Pioline finally gave up after less than an hour of play.
</P>
<P>
The Frenchman, ranked 23 in the world after his Grand Slam
performance, took treatment several times on court and had the
arm strapped early in the second set.

Unseeded German Nicolas Kiefer, a protege of Boris Becker and a

stability standards for the single European currency, the head of
Germany's central bank said today that a purely statistical
interpretation of the single currency standards would be wrong.
</P>
<P>
Hans Tietmeyer, president of the German central bank, known as
the Bundesbank, said today that the 3 percent of the gross
domestic product (GDP) budgetary target was "a very important
indicator," but what was more important was the durability of
government consolidation policies, a reference to cost-cutting to
eliminate budget deficits.
</P>
<P>
He added that the overall economic health of a country should
be the prime consideration of its qualification for the common
currency, called the Euro.
</P>
<P>
The European Union (EU) is targeting to launch the Euro on
January 1, 1999. In order to qualify for its membership, a country
is mainly required to bring its budget deficit to less than 3
percent of GDP and its overall national debt to less than 60
percent of GDP.
</P>
<P>
Luxemburg was the only EU country who met all the conditions
for the Euro last year. Germany and France, the two driving forces
behind the Euro project, are struggling to meet the deficit
target, largely because of the huge cost of financing the benefits
for their double-digit unemployment.
</P>
<P>
The difficulties to meet the Euro stardards have created an
open rift between Germany and France, with Paris favoring a
softening of the stardards and Bonn so far still insisting on
strict adherence.

<HEADLINE> New York Mercantile Exchange Moves Into New Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The New York Mercantile Exchange
began its operation earlier this week in its brand-new building in
Lower Manhattan here, as a major event to celebrate its 125th
birthday.
</P>
<P>
The 16-story building is located on the picturesque eastern
bank of the Hudson River, which is just a stone's throw from the
exchange's previous home in the World Trade Center.
</P>
<P>
The spacious upper and lower trading floors are column-free and
equipped with high-tech facilities for buying and selling future
contracts of basically two types of commodities -- the precious
metals and energy, briefly referred to as NYMEX and COMEX. They
were previously traded under the same roof of the trading of
cotton, coffee and sugar.
</P>
<P>
Overlooking from the glass shielded gallery, each of the
trading floors is equal to the size of at least two basket ball
courts. The layout of the floors, covered with torn pieces of
paper, is almost the same as the old days, with several circular
pits being built with computer terminal and phone desks installed
around.
</P>
<P>
Each of the pits deals with the trading of one individual
commodity. Hundreds of traders gather around the pits, yelling at
each other with hand signals, almost in frenzied manner. "It's
just an open-cry trading system," Miss Maria Gonzalez, a press
officer, told the reporter.
</P>
<P>
The traders, in different colored jackets, scrawled prices on
scratch pads and threw them into the center of the pit where a
market employee would pick them up and punch time on them. Prices
are inputed into hand-held terminals and reflected to big display
boards on surrounding walls and transmitted to other cities of the
world through satellite circuits.
</P>
<P>
The merger of NYMEX and COMEX in the spring of 1994 made the
New York Mercantile Exchange the largest of its kind in the world.
Some market analysts have shortened the market history to the
phrase of "from egg to energy," simply because the market was
launched 125 years ago with the trading of butter and cheese.
</P>
<P>
With hundreds of products being traded in history, the
mercantile exchange has truly reflected different stages of the
U.S. economy. In addition to crude oil, heating oil, unleaded
gas and natural gas, COMEX was added a completely new product --
electricity -- on March 29, 1996.
</P>
<P>
The market continues to offer about 8,100 jobs for New York.
The seemingly chaotic trading action is under strict rules and
regulations, according to market officials. Each telephone has
access to as many as 64 voice lines with the punch of a button.
And each phone is continuously recorded, to provide a kind of
backup for future reference if disputes arise with customers.
</P>
<P>
The New York Stock Exchange has long expected for a removal or
an expansion for the lack of trading space after its 100 years of
operation. Traders and market administrators obviously expect to
revitalize the New York Mercantile Exchange with the launching of
the new building.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Drops on Call for Strong Mark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar ended mostly
weaker today after top German central bank officials surprised the
market by calling for a strong mark and Britain's central bank
increased interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The mark had been hitting a series of three-year lows against
the dollar and six-year lows against the pound for the past few
weeks, with no obvious signs of discontent from the Bundesbank.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of England's decision to raise its base lending rate
by a quarter percentage point to 6.75 percent had been widely
expected and initially caused a flurry of pound selling by traders
who wanted to secure profits from the currency's strength.
</P>
<P>
The dollar traded as low as 1.7461 marks in intraday dealings
before settling at 1.7515 marks in New York, down from 1.7599
marks Wednesday. The pound cost 1.6886 U.S. dollars, up from
1.6880 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
But the dollar cost 113.18 yen, up from 112.77 yen Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Other dollar rates in New York, compared with Wednesday: 1.4493
Swiss francs, down from 1.4580; 5.9220 French francs, down from
5.9430; 1,712.00 Italian lire, down from 1,717.25; 1.3739 Canadian
dollars, up from 1.3732.

<HEADLINE> Greece Plans to Set Up Agency to Boost Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Greece plans to set up an agency to
coordinate activities by the Greek enterprises in efforts to boost
the country's exports and investments in southeastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
The proposal by the Federation of Greek Industry (SEB) was
endorsed today at a meeting attended by Greek government ministers
and representatives of major Greek enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Iason Stratos, president of the SEB, said that the agency
should survey market needs and process the data to pave the way
for Greek companies's accession to the markets in the region.
</P>
<P>
The agency also could encourage Greek diplomats in southeastern
European countries to adopt a more aggressive policy of promoting
Greek enterprises, he said.

<HEADLINE> German Scientists Prove Neanderthal Man Not Ancestor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Two German scientists have found
genetic evidence supporting many scientists' long belief that
modern man does not directly descend from Neanderthal man, said
German press reports today.
</P>
<P>
One of the two scientists, Bonn paleontologist Ralf W. Schmitz,
told the German news agency DPA that the proof was obtained in a
genetic analysis of a piece of the Neanderthal skeleton found in
the Rhineland in 1856 and believed to be 100,000 years old.
</P>
<P>
He said that the genetic test showed no similarities between
the DNA structures of modern man known as Homo sapiens and those
of Neanderthal man -- cave-dwelling hunter with heavy protruding
jaw and massive brow ridges.
</P>
<P>
The research results of Schmitz and Professor Svante Paeaebo of
the Ludwig-Maximilian University in Munich are to be published
Friday in the United States journal Cell.
