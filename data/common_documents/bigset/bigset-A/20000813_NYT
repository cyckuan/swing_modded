   CONVENTION - A decade ago it was unthinkable that thousands of
Black journalists would ever visit Arizona. But the fact that more
than 2,000 members of the National Association of Black Journalists
will be downtown this week for the group's 25th anniversary
convention is evidence that the state is overcoming the damage done
in 1987, when then-Gov. Evan Mecham rescinded a paid state holiday
honoring the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. By DANIEL GONZALEZ and
PETER CORBETT. Story will move in the ``A'' category.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH (Prescott, Ariz.) {ndash} He may have been away from his
central Texas ranch, but George W. Bush had a real Lone Star
weekend planned. Go eat barbecue at Sen. John McCain's place. Hang
out by the creek. And talk politics in front of the same courthouse
36 years before where Sen. Barry Goldwater had extolled the rights
of sovereign citizens and the evils of communism. By MARK SHAFFER.
Story will move in the ``A'' category.
</P>
<P>
   DEMOCRATS - Democrats gather Monday for their national
convention as a party eagerly embracing the political center. As
they prepare to anoint Al Gore as their presidential candidate, the
Democrats hope for a convention that is exciting but not raucous,
innovative but not threatening, progressive but not radical. In
other words, middle of the road. By JEFF BARKER. Story will move in
the ``A'' category.
</P>
<P>
   HOMELESS - After nights in shelters, run-down motels and even
old cars, kids come to Thomas J. Pappas School, an Arizona success
story for more than a decade and the sweetheart charity of the
state's largest donors. But now a powerful national advocacy group,
one with the ear of federal lawmakers, wants to shut it down,
saying the children are unfairly segregated. By KARINA BLAND. Story
will move in the ``A'' category.
</P>
<P>
   MONTINI-COLUMN (Phoenix) -This week the Democrats officially
scratch Babe Ruth from their starting line-up, leaving the team
without a heavy-hitter and establishing themselves as the Red Sox
of the 21st Century. Without Bill Clinton, the Backwoods Bambino,
politics is a dull game and the Democrats have no chance of winning
the pennant. By E.J. Montini. Story will move in the ``A'' and
``K'' categories.
</P>
<P>
   TV-GOODY13 (Undated) {ndash} Showtime's (beginitalic)The Thin
Blue Lie (enditalic)isn't a great movie, but it is convincing
enough to make any self-respecting reporter feel like a slug for
not finding corruption under every rock. By BILL GOODYKOONTZ. Story
will move in the ``E'' category.

MILLIONS SPENT TO IMPRESS THOUSANDS AT CONVENTION

<P>
   &UR;  &LR; LOS ANGELES _ In anticipation of the crush of national media
in town for the Democratic National Convention, Los Angeles has
received a multimillion-dollar face lift.
</P>
<P>
   Downtown streets have been resurfaced, sidewalks fixed and local
city attractions spruced up for the expected influx of more than
20,000 visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Though the improvements might benefit the city in the long run,
they've been a hassle for businesses in the meantime.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had every public working project known to mankind here
in the last year,'' said Steve Auth, owner of Kaiser Brothers
Oldsmobile and Honda on Figueroa Street. ``I hope they're finally
finished. After it's all done, it should be nice, though.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that the pieces are all in place, it should be smoother
sailing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The city is looking beautiful and prepared for the DNC,''
Deputy Mayor Jennifer Roth said.
</P>
<P>
   One landmark benefiting from an extensive reworking is El Pueblo
National Historic Monument, home of Mexican-style marketplace
Olvera Street and several historic sites from L.A.'s 18th-century
beginnings. After a $20 million restoration, the city preserve's
old Plaza and Pico House are in top form for visitors, said
Director of Public Relations Pauline Cazares.
</P>
<P>
   ``It rivals anything Old Town Pasadena has right now,'' she
joked. ``We double-dare them to top this.''
</P>
<P>
   While the DNC has served as a catalyst for the improvements,
most would have been carried out anyway, said Greg Scott, director
of the city's Bureau of Street Services.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of this work has been planned for quite a while,'' he
said. ``We took a look at all the major streets downtown that have
been in need of work for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Since late April, the Bureau of Street Services has resurfaced
8.21 miles of streets in the downtown area, in addition to making
improvements to sidewalks and trimming the city's trees. The bureau
has also installed more than a hundred flowerpots near Staples
Center on Figueroa and Flower streets.
</P>
<P>
   According to Scott, the price tag for those improvements is
$4.75 million, with $4.1 million reimbursed by Proposition C funds.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty sets of crosswalks downtown were targeted for
modifications to make them resemble old-fashioned brick walkways.
To achieve this effect, crews reheated the asphalt, imprinted a
brick design and colorized the surface.
</P>
<P>
   To ensure that the streets maintain their nice new look, the
city has planned ahead, said Peter Hidalgo, spokesman for Mayor
Richard Riordan. Cleanup crews will be on hand around the clock to
keep trash off the streets, especially after parades and
demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   According to Drew Sones, assistant director of sanitation, the
focus isn't limited to above ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made sure all the sewers and the catch basins in the areas
are clean,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While the city Sanitation Department was working to clean the
sewers, it also worked to keep things from getting in. In
coordination with the Secret Service, engineers have made sure to
keep below-ground waterways off-limits to any unauthorized
visitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've secured any access to the storm drains so only water can
go in, and nothing else.'' Sones said.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone found a need to make any changes. For both the
Public Library and Los Angeles Zoo, it's business as usual. Neither
organization has altered its maintenance or programming schedules
for the convention, but they said they are prepared for an increase
in attendance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're ready for thousands of visitors, like always,'' said
Judy Shay, spokeswoman for the zoo.
</P>
<P>
   The city's agencies and organizations timed their architectural
improvements for visitors to Los Angeles during the convention, but
officials say the changes are meant to last far longer than through
the week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The intention of the beautification efforts is that they'll
last long after the convention has wrapped up,'' Hidalgo said.
</P>
<P>
   The flowers might fade, but the rest of the renovations should
benefit the community for years, city officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the things that we've done will be relatively permanent,''
Scott said. ``They should last a long time.''

SPARKS PUT ZONE TO GOOD USE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAMELA LEWIS  
 c.2000 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Defense is the Sparks' staple _ specifically man-to-man. But
coach Michael Cooper has been going to the zone defense more often
recently, with great results.
</P>
<P>
   But it was met with some resistance at first.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really pride ourselves on being a great man-on-man
defensive team, so when he first brought up the subject of zone
defense we were mad, we were like `No, we don't want to play
zone,''' DeLisha Milton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel like that's a cop-out. But it's good to have
different-type weaponry in your arsenal. We've learned to like it,
but I think we fell in love with it because we have about three or
four zone offenses that we can go to. We like being able to keep
them on their toes.''
</P>
<P>
   Their 2-3 zone is hard to crack, especially when you're looking
at 6-foot-1 Milton and 6-5 Lisa Leslie on the wings and 6-5
Clarisse Machanguana guarding the paint. Machanguana normally comes
off the bench to give Leslie a rest, but she's been used more often
of late in this formation. The first time the Sparks used it was
against Minnesota on July 31. Cooper used it again Friday against
Phoenix, which has only one true post in Jennifer Gillom.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just eased it in and now those are the little tricks that
we're trying to pull out to let people see us in a different
light,'' Cooper said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives us two good athletes that are big and mobile _ Lisa
and D on the wing, whereas Mach is like our enforcer in the middle.
We're able to get out and cover, yet it gives us good rebounding
advantage. When we work out of that and the team misses, most of
the time we're getting the rebound, we're getting out and going.
That's the key about that is that even though we're big, we're not
slow. D runs just as fast as any of our guards and Smooth (Leslie)
can run just as fast as any 4 or 5 in this league.''
</P>
<P>
   HOME SWEET HOME: The Sparks are returning home for the first
time since July 27. They played seven consecutive road games,
bringing back a 6-1 record that ended with the win at Phoenix on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   They are 15-1 at the Forum. Their only loss was to the Portland
Fire, which broke a 12-game winning streak July 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, we can just come and do what we have all season at
home and give our fans a lot to cheer about,'' Ukari Figgs said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Sparks don't take playing at home against Phoenix
lightly, especially against a team that needs a win today more than
they do.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this time of the season, playoffs, it doesn't matter that
you have home-court advantage,'' Machanguana said. ``This is the
playoffs _ just give everything or nothing. ... Just because we're
home it doesn't guarantee a win. You know that we kind of
embarrassed them, so I'm sure they're going to come in with an
attitude and just come in here ready to play. We just have to be
focused.'' &QL;

LOTS OF SPOTS TO CHECK OUT WHEN CONVENTION DULLS DOWN

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; LOS ANGELES _ Snapshots of Los Angeles: The famous schnozz of
Jimmy Durante imprinted in cement at Mann's Chinese Theater in
Hollywood. In the background are outlines of Betty Grable's legs.
</P>
<P>
   Snapshot: Rippling hunks at the Muscle Beach body-building pit
in Venice Beach. Background bikini thongs are worn by Babewatch
wannabes.
</P>
<P>
   Snapshot: An embrace of Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston at Spago
in Beverly Hills. Background is you - out of focus in your $300
Gucci shades.
</P>
<P>
   Forget the Liberty Bell, the Statue of Liberty and other
nationally recognized historic sights. For out-of-towners jumping
into - and out of - the Democratic National Convention this week,
L.A.'s glitz and celebrity are the got-to-get scrapbook savers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like movies - I like movie stars,'' said Voula Tsiboukas,
23, visiting from Greece, where 2,500 years of marble ruins are the
main draw for tourists. Here, Tsiboukas just had to see Universal
Studios Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to see something you don't have in my country,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably one of the most famous attractions in L.A.,''
chimed in Agatha Paxos, 26, of Cypress, Calif. ``This is
(ital)the(off) big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   For visitors from the Cold Coast and elsewhere, trips to
Tinseltown and other star hot spots are de rigeur.
</P>
<P>
   For most, the the closest brush with celebrity will be on
Hollywood's Walk of Fame. There, tourists can traipse over more
than 2,000 marble-and-bronze commemorative stars inlaid near the
curbs of Hollywood Boulevard and Vine Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our landmarks aren't that old compared to back East,'' said
Leron Gubler, head of the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're certainly not where the Declaration of Independence
was signed. But they are certainly fascinating to tourists.''
</P>
<P>
   Walk and gawk over the plaque of Joanne Woodward, given the
first star in 1960, in addition to big-screen icons such as Bob
Hope, Marilyn Monroe and Big Bird.
</P>
<P>
   Or stroll over to the Hollywood Entertainment Museum, where Star
Trekkies can ponder sets from the USS Enterprise and ``Cheers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a temporary exhibit of film posters with political
themes especially put up for the Democratic convention,'' said
Sativa Maureen Reid, a museum administrator.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit includes posters for ``All the President's Men,''
``The Candidate'' and ``The Phenix City Story.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearby is the spectacular Mann's Chinese Theatre, circa 1927,
where 150 screen legends have left their mark in cement; the El
Capitan Theater, circa 1926; the Egyptian Theater, circa 1922,
which each day shows a documentary about the history of Hollywood;
and the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel, circa 1927, where ghosts of the
late Marilyn Monroe and Montgomery Clift are rumored to stalk the
halls.
</P>
<P>
   ``People associate L.A. with the entertainment industry,'' said
John Duel of the Los Angeles Convention and Visitors Bureau. ``They
won't be satisfied without seeing Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to see the stars.''
</P>
<P>
   Visitors with a darker vision of star-sightings should visit
Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, where Errol Flynn, Spencer
Tracy, Clark Gable and Humphrey Bogart rest in peace. Or they can
visit the Hollywood Forever cemetery on Santa Monica Boulevard,
which guards the remains of Rudolph Valentino, Douglas Fairbanks,
Tyrone Power and Cecil B. DeMille.
</P>
<P>
   There's also the newly opened Museum of Death, and the notorious
Los Angeles County coroner's gift shop.
</P>
<P>
   And for those with randier tastes, there's the Frederick's of
Hollywood Lingerie Museum and store, in addition to other sex
boutiques on Hollywood Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's some wonderful shopping to be had, `cause it's not all
about politics,'' Frederick's museum curator Amanda Diaz said.
``There's always time for romance.''
</P>
<P>
   At Frederick's, compare the loft of Natalie Wood's bra worn in
``Bob &AMP; Carol &AMP; Ted &AMP; Alice,'' with bustiers worn on the set by
Greta Garbo, Judy Garland and the cast of ``Beverly Hills 90210.''
There are also boxers worn by Robert Redford, and a Tom Hanks pair
from ``Forrest Gump.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether it's a day trip to Venice Beach, the Santa Monica Pier,
a drive down Sunset Boulevard to the Pacific, or a tour of the
Getty Museum or Huntington Library, there's plenty to see and do in
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   But for a peek at real stars, insiders suggest Hollywood's Les
Deux Cafe, Cafe des Artistes and Pinot Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Or anywhere in Beverly Hills.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you aren't looking, you may see them,'' Gubler cautioned.
``But stars usually don't walk along the boulevard.''
</P>
<P>
   The chamber is sending greeters to Hollywood Boulevard and the
subway stations to welcome DNC visitors. Self-guided tour maps are
available.
</P>
<P>
   Self-guided tours are also possible in Beverly Hills, where the
former estates of George Burns, Lucille Ball, Jimmy Stewart, Elvis
Presley and other stars can sometimes be glimpsed from the street.
</P>
<P>
   There's the ``pink palace'' where Jayne Mansfield painted
everything pink and heart-shape. Or the 123-room chateau of TV
producer Aaron Spelling, of ``Beverly Hills 90210'' fame.
</P>
<P>
   One can also linger at the intersection where Errol Flynn
allegedly raped a 17-year-old wearing nothing but his shoes and
socks.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the site of the estate where Satanist Charles
Manson and his followers murdered actress Sharon Tate, pregnant
with a child from husband/director Roman Polanski. Or the house
where ``Superman'' George Reeves died in an apparent suicide in
1959. Or where two brothers, Lyle and Erik Menendez, blew away
their parents 30 years later, then went on a shopping spree.
</P>
<P>
   The Bundy Street Brentwood condo where Ron Goldman and Nicole
Brown Simpson were knifed to death six years ago is a definite
draw. Seven blocks away lies the ghost of O.J. Simpson's torn-down
mansion.
</P>
<P>
   A tour of the stars would not be complete without some drop-in
screening at the Museum of Television and Radio in Beverly Hills,
or a visit to the Gene Autry Western Heritage Museum at the edge of
Griffith Park.
</P>
<P>
   Many, however, prefer to visit the studios themselves: including
Paramount Studios in Hollywood; Warner Bros., NBC and Walt Disney
studios in Burbank; and Universal Studios Hollywood and DreamWorks
SKG in Universal City.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why the studios?'' asked Kristi Bothelio of Manteca, north of
Modesto, on a trip to Universal Studios with her husband and
2-year-old son. ``I want to be where famous people have been
before.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be where I've seen on TV.''

   See the reporter's won-over colleagues help him celebrate his
Pulitzer Prize.
</P>
<P>
   See the TV critic cringe at his relative sloth and ineptitude.
</P>
<P>
   You can see all that if you see The Thin Blue Lie, a Showtime
original movie. (Except for the TV critic part, which is a matter
best kept private.) The movie follows Jonathan Neumann's efforts to
write a 1976 series for the Philadelphia Inquirer that exposed
police corruption reaching all the way to the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   The Thin Blue Lie isn't great, by any means, not in the same
league with such journalism films as All the President's Men (it in
fact often comes off as a sort of Some of the Mayor's Men). But
Paul Sorvino turns in a great, if too short, performance as
Hizzoner, Mayor Frank Rizzo. And it is a serviceable thriller based
on a true story.
</P>
<P>
   But it's also another example of a movie or television show
portraying an often routine job as a constantly thrilling,
life-or-death adventure. Certainly, the grunt work of reporting -
conducting interviews, checking records, that kind of thing - is
kept to a minimum; mostly Rob Morrow, who plays Neumann, runs
around yelling, eating like a pig, fleeing from sadistic cops,
scoring the big source that makes the whole incredible story fall
into place and puking when his editor doesn't want to run his
story.
</P>
<P>
   This is somewhat different from, say, my job, which consists
mostly of sitting in a chair watching hours of television while
taking notes; sitting in a chair in front of a computer screen
writing about it; and, OK, eating like a pig.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why you don't see a lot of movies about TV critics.
</P>
<P>
   Big Brother notwithstanding, television isn't overflowing with
shows about people simply going about their business (yet, anyway).
No matter how popular ``reality'' TV becomes, we'll still crave
entertainment. And what's that, if not a heightened version of real
life? (All you Star Trek freaks, feel free not to answer that.) TV
has to ratchet things up a notch or two to get our attention.
</P>
<P>
   Most lawyers toil quietly while they prepare for cases, for
instance, instead of talking to dead ex-boyfriends. Hardly any FBI
agents get abducted by aliens (so far as we know).
</P>
<P>
   And regular friendships are usually based on conversations about
things people have in common, instead of contests to see who can go
the longest without {hellip} well, you remember Seinfeld.
</P>
<P>
   So how real is The Thin Blue Lie? Neumann told critics last
month that all of the police-brutality aspects - and some are
shocking - are absolute truth, no garnish anywhere. The character
based on him, on the other hand, isn't quite so literal.
</P>
<P>
   ``But most of it is pretty realistic, and based on the way that
I was at that time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wow. That seems almost hard to believe.
</P>
<P>
   Which is, after all, why they made a movie about it.

LOTS OF SPOTS TO CHECK OUT WHEN CONVENTION DULLS DOWN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; LOS ANGELES _ Snapshots of Los Angeles: The famous schnozz of
Jimmy Durante imprinted in cement at Mann's Chinese Theater in
Hollywood. In the background are outlines of Betty Grable's legs.
</P>
<P>
   Snapshot: Rippling hunks at the Muscle Beach body-building pit
in Venice Beach. Background bikini thongs are worn by Babewatch
wannabes.
</P>
<P>
   Snapshot: An embrace of Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston at Spago
in Beverly Hills. Background is you - out of focus in your $300
Gucci shades.
</P>
<P>
   Forget the Liberty Bell, the Statue of Liberty and other
nationally recognized historic sights. For out-of-towners jumping
into - and out of - the Democratic National Convention this week,
L.A.'s glitz and celebrity are the got-to-get scrapbook savers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like movies - I like movie stars,'' said Voula Tsiboukas,
23, visiting from Greece, where 2,500 years of marble ruins are the
main draw for tourists. Here, Tsiboukas just had to see Universal
Studios Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to see something you don't have in my country,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably one of the most famous attractions in L.A.,''
chimed in Agatha Paxos, 26, of Cypress, Calif. ``This is
(ital)the(off) big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   For visitors from the Cold Coast and elsewhere, trips to
Tinseltown and other star hot spots are de rigeur.
</P>
<P>
   For most, the the closest brush with celebrity will be on
Hollywood's Walk of Fame. There, tourists can traipse over more
than 2,000 marble-and-bronze commemorative stars inlaid near the
curbs of Hollywood Boulevard and Vine Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our landmarks aren't that old compared to back East,'' said
Leron Gubler, head of the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're certainly not where the Declaration of Independence
was signed. But they are certainly fascinating to tourists.''
</P>
<P>
   Walk and gawk over the plaque of Joanne Woodward, given the
first star in 1960, in addition to big-screen icons such as Bob
Hope, Marilyn Monroe and Big Bird.
</P>
<P>
   Or stroll over to the Hollywood Entertainment Museum, where Star
Trekkies can ponder sets from the USS Enterprise and ``Cheers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a temporary exhibit of film posters with political
themes especially put up for the Democratic convention,'' said
Sativa Maureen Reid, a museum administrator.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit includes posters for ``All the President's Men,''
``The Candidate'' and ``The Phenix City Story.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearby is the spectacular Mann's Chinese Theatre, circa 1927,
where 150 screen legends have left their mark in cement; the El
Capitan Theater, circa 1926; the Egyptian Theater, circa 1922,
which each day shows a documentary about the history of Hollywood;
and the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel, circa 1927, where ghosts of the
late Marilyn Monroe and Montgomery Clift are rumored to stalk the
halls.
</P>
<P>
   ``People associate L.A. with the entertainment industry,'' said
John Duel of the Los Angeles Convention and Visitors Bureau. ``They
won't be satisfied without seeing Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to see the stars.''
</P>
<P>
   Visitors with a darker vision of star-sightings should visit
Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, where Errol Flynn, Spencer
Tracy, Clark Gable and Humphrey Bogart rest in peace. Or they can
visit the Hollywood Forever cemetery on Santa Monica Boulevard,
which guards the remains of Rudolph Valentino, Douglas Fairbanks,
Tyrone Power and Cecil B. DeMille.
</P>
<P>
   There's also the newly opened Museum of Death, and the notorious
Los Angeles County coroner's gift shop.
</P>
<P>
   And for those with randier tastes, there's the Frederick's of
Hollywood Lingerie Museum and store, in addition to other sex
boutiques on Hollywood Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's some wonderful shopping to be had, `cause it's not all
about politics,'' Frederick's museum curator Amanda Diaz said.
``There's always time for romance.''
</P>
<P>
   At Frederick's, compare the loft of Natalie Wood's bra worn in
``Bob &AMP; Carol &AMP; Ted &AMP; Alice,'' with bustiers worn on the set by
Greta Garbo, Judy Garland and the cast of ``Beverly Hills 90210.''
There are also boxers worn by Robert Redford, and a Tom Hanks pair
from ``Forrest Gump.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether it's a day trip to Venice Beach, the Santa Monica Pier,
a drive down Sunset Boulevard to the Pacific, or a tour of the
Getty Museum or Huntington Library, there's plenty to see and do in
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   But for a peek at real stars, insiders suggest Hollywood's Les
Deux Cafe, Cafe des Artistes and Pinot Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Or anywhere in Beverly Hills.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you aren't looking, you may see them,'' Gubler cautioned.
``But stars usually don't walk along the boulevard.''
</P>
<P>
   The chamber is sending greeters to Hollywood Boulevard and the
subway stations to welcome DNC visitors. Self-guided tour maps are
available.
</P>
<P>
   Self-guided tours are also possible in Beverly Hills, where the
former estates of George Burns, Lucille Ball, Jimmy Stewart, Elvis
Presley and other stars can sometimes be glimpsed from the street.
</P>
<P>
   There's the ``pink palace'' where Jayne Mansfield painted
everything pink and heart-shape. Or the 123-room chateau of TV
producer Aaron Spelling, of ``Beverly Hills 90210'' fame.
</P>
<P>
   One can also linger at the intersection where Errol Flynn
allegedly raped a 17-year-old wearing nothing but his shoes and
socks.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the site of the estate where Satanist Charles
Manson and his followers murdered actress Sharon Tate, pregnant
with a child from husband/director Roman Polanski. Or the house
where ``Superman'' George Reeves died in an apparent suicide in
1959. Or where two brothers, Lyle and Erik Menendez, blew away
their parents 30 years later, then went on a shopping spree.
</P>
<P>
   The Bundy Street Brentwood condo where Ron Goldman and Nicole
Brown Simpson were knifed to death six years ago is a definite
draw. Seven blocks away lies the ghost of O.J. Simpson's torn-down
mansion.
</P>
<P>
   A tour of the stars would not be complete without some drop-in
screening at the Museum of Television and Radio in Beverly Hills,
or a visit to the Gene Autry Western Heritage Museum at the edge of
Griffith Park.
</P>
<P>
   Many, however, prefer to visit the studios themselves: including
Paramount Studios in Hollywood; Warner Bros., NBC and Walt Disney
studios in Burbank; and Universal Studios Hollywood and DreamWorks
SKG in Universal City.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why the studios?'' asked Kristi Bothelio of Manteca, north of
Modesto, on a trip to Universal Studios with her husband and
2-year-old son. ``I want to be where famous people have been
before.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be where I've seen on TV.''

PLAYERS LOOKING AHEAD TO U.S. OPEN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICH HAMMOND  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANHATTAN BEACH, Calif. _ Most of the top women's tennis players
will be in Toronto next week for the du Maurier Open, but their
thoughts are already two weeks down the road, to the start of the
U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   Tournaments such as the estyle.com Classic are considered
tune-ups, chances for players to work on their hard-court games
before the final Grand Slam event of the year, and most stars seem
to feel good about their chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going in the right direction,'' said the world's
top-ranked player, Martina Hingis, who lost to Serena Williams in
the semifinals in three sets Saturday. ``I just have to win matches
like this one, and not lose them. Maybe that's the next step.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can only learn from this match and do better next week, and
definitely do better at the U.S. Open.''
</P>
<P>
   Hingis said she is confident about her U.S. Open chances, but
realizes that no player can be considered a clear favorite. Hingis
maintains a big lead in the points standings, but her level of play
is much less dominating.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if she felt as though she had just beaten the best
player in the world with her victory over Hingis, Williams said,
``I don't know how to answer that. She's ranked No.1, and she's
been doing well, but at the same time, Venus is playing wonderful
tennis, and so is Lindsay (Davenport.)''
</P>
<P>
   HANDLING THE HEAT: Hingis and Williams played in the midday sun,
with little breeze and the temperature in the mid-80s, but both
players said the conditions were not a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I excel in the heat,'' Williams said. ``I train in Florida,
and one day, at 11:30 in the morning, it was 110 degrees, and I was
still out there practicing. I love the heat.''
</P>
<P>
   Hingis admitted to tiring in the second set, but said her
fatigue was caused more by her two previous matches in the
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a tough match with Chanda (Rubin), and then another
tough match with Amy (Frazier),'' Hingis said. ``I was just out
there for too long.'' &QL;

BENKO ANSWERS CALL IN 200 FREESTYLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Lindsay Benko knew she could make the U.S.
Olympic team. But after an unsettling summer, she was searching for
some kind of confirmation.
</P>
<P>
   It came while she was in her hotel room. The phone rang, she
answered it and to her astonishment John Wooden was on the other
end.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out Wooden had coached Benko's grandfather on the
basketball team at Indiana State, where he worked before moving to
UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got good genes,'' Wooden told her.
</P>
<P>
   Wooden has good timing. Benko, buoyed by the phone call, went
out and won the 200-meter freestyle Saturday at the U.S. Olympic
Swimming Trials to secure the berth to Sydney that swimming
insiders had openly reserved for her after she won five medals at
the Pan Pacific Championships in Sydney last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Two other favorites _ Tom Malchow and Cristina Teuscher _ made
good on expectations with victories in the 200 butterfly and 200
individual medley, respectively. And 15-year-old Michael Phelps
finished second to Malchow to become the youngest U.S. male Olympic
swimmer since 1932.
</P>
<P>
   Benko's teammate, Lenny Krayzelburg, watched her race from the
IUPUI Natatorium stands. If he looked happier when she touched
first than he had the previous day in the 100 backstroke when he
did, there was a reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's a single person I want to make the
Olympic team more than Lindsay,'' Krayzelburg said before the
Trials began. ``Because I see day in and day out how hard she
works.''
</P>
<P>
   It's true: Krayzelburg and Benko are charter members of
Overtrainers Anonymous. They can't help it; they're addicted to
work. They spend almost as much time in the water as chlorine.
</P>
<P>
   The Odessa native and the Indiana native didn't get paid
time-and-a-half or anything, but obviously they both ended up with
something priceless for their trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such an overwhelming feeling,'' to look up on the
scoreboard and see an Olympic dream fulfilled,'' Benko said.
``There's so many things that go through your mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the images that came to mind was the one of her sitting by
the same pool four years ago, inconsolable after finishing 10th in
the heats of the 200 freestyle and failing to advance to the final.
``It was the first time I ever cried after a race,'' Benko said.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, the event brought more tears to her eyes. She
didn't try to stop them. Why contain joy?
</P>
<P>
   ``This year has been an emotional ride for me,'' said Benko,
whose times this summer were slower than usual. ``I was struggling
a little bit. There was a lot of pressure on me when I wasn't
swimming the way I wanted to. It was nerve-wracking.''
</P>
<P>
   Benko, who grew up three hours away in Elkhart, Ind., had more
than three dozen supporters in the stands that she knew of and
another 4,000 who got behind her simply because she was a
home-grown gal.
</P>
<P>
   She passed the fading frontrunner, Samantha Arsenault, and held
off a fast-finishing Rada Owen. Her winning time of 2:00.45 was
almost two seconds slower than her personal best. But on this
night, plenty fast enough. &QL;

WILLIAMS OUTMUSCLES NO. 1 HINGIS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICH HAMMOND  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANHATTAN BEACH, Calif. _ All week long, Serena Williams
expressed disappointment in herself and harped on the seemingly
endless number of improvements she feels must be made to her game.
</P>
<P>
   But Saturday afternoon, even the perfectionist Williams couldn't
hide her joy after a victory over the world's top-ranked player.
Williams survived a dreadful start and defeated Martina Hingis 4-6,
6-2, 6-3 in the semifinals of the estyle.com Classic at Manhattan
Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``Except for the Grand Slams, this is probably my favorite
event,'' said Williams, the fifth seed and defending champion, who
advanced to face second-seeded Lindsay Davenport, a 6-4, 6-4
semifinal winner over Elena Dementieva, in today's final at 11 a.m.
PDT.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' victory denied the tournament a coveted match between
the two top-ranked players in the world, but set up an equally
compelling matchup of two women with similar styles. Williams has
won their past four meetings, all on hard courts, with her only
loss to Davenport coming in 1997, when she was 16 years old.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to play Lindsay,'' Williams said. ``I know her game
pretty well. She plays that California game, most girls from
California play the same way.
</P>
<P>
   ``She hits the ball hard and very flat, and she hits big
serves.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who grew up in Los Angeles, might as well have been
describing her performance against Hingis. She bombed three
consecutive aces and won the first game of the first set, then
quickly fell behind two service breaks at 4-1 as Hingis took
advantage of Williams' frequent unforced errors.
</P>
<P>
   Williams followed with two service breaks to tie the set at 4-4,
but Hingis broke back and held serve at love to win the set.
</P>
<P>
   From there, it was pretty much all Williams. The unforced errors
dropped in frequency, and Williams was able to power her way out of
any trouble she encountered. Williams started the second set with a
service break and was never seriously challenged after that.
</P>
<P>
   The players held serve in the third set until Williams broke to
go up 5-3 and then won on her third match point. Williams finished
with 37 winners _ the same number as her unforced errors _ and had
seven aces. Williams still found plenty to fault with her effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't serve that well at all,'' said Williams, who had six
double faults. ``Usually if my serve is down, I don't play well,
but I like that I wasn't serving well, and I was still able to do
well against a good player.''
</P>
<P>
   The same could be said of Dementieva, an 18-year-old Russian who
is ranked No.32 in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport easily defeated Dementieva in their three previous
meetings, but struggled to control her groundstrokes early.
Dementieva won three consecutive games to take a 3-2 lead, but
struggled with her serve.
</P>
<P>
   Dementieva was successful when she got her first serve in, but
Davenport consistently blistered her second serve and won the first
set largely because of her three service breaks.
</P>
<P>
   Dementieva held strong in the second set and trailed 4-3, but
Davenport held serve at love and won the match on her next service.
As a reward, she gets a shot at Williams, no easy task.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though I'm ranked higher, I'm probably the underdog,''
Davenport said. ``It's important for me to get a break, hopefully
early in the match. I have to be aggressive when I return, even if
I miss a few.'' &QL;

<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Gabe Kapler has wiped Mickey Rivers from the
Rangers' record book, sort of like how some of his teammates would
like to erase this season from their memory.
</P>
<P>
   Not Rick Helling. Unlike the Rangers in general, Helling shows
no sign of wearing down as this tedious season heads down the final
stretch, even if he does continue to carry a heavy burden.
</P>
<P>
   Helling held the Boston Red Sox to one run on four hits over
seven innings and Ricky Ledee smashed a fourth-inning grand slam
off of pitcher Tim Wakefield to give the Rangers a 6-3 victory at
The Ballpark in Arlington last night.
</P>
<P>
   Helling threw 129 pitches as he raised his record to 14-8 and
lowered his earned-run average to 4.61] despite pitching on a night
when the game-time temperature was 96 degrees. He has thrown 2,929
pitches this season, the most in the American League, but said he
still feels as strong as ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pretty much,'' Helling said. ``That's one of the things I take
pride in, how hard I work in the off-season and how hard I work in
the season, so I can pitch as well in the second half as I do in
the first, if not better. The last thing I want to worry about is
if I worked hard enough to be in shape so I can be successful on
the mound.''
</P>
<P>
   Kapler went 3-for-3, including a second-inning double off the
left-field wall that extended his hitting streak to 25 games. That
breaks the club record of 24 set by Mickey Rivers in 1980 and is
the longest hitting streak in the majors this season.
</P>
<P>
   More important to him, though, was a run-scoring single in the
fifth against reliever Bryce Florie after the Red Sox intentionally
walked Rafael Palmeiro with a runner at second and two outs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The streak is nice,'' Kapler said. ``It's definitely something
to remember. But the thing I feel good about is the RBI single. I
want to feel that if Raffy is being pitched around or walked
intentionally, I can go up there and do the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Red Sox manager Jimy Williams: ``I thought we would try to
keep the ball down and get a ground ball. Palmeiro has hurt us a
lot. Not that Kapler can't, because he showed he could, and he did
hurt us.''
</P>
<P>
   Ledee had the biggest hit of the night. Helling and Wakefield
battled to a scoreless tie through three innings before the Red Sox
knuckleballer lost total control in the fourth. He started that
inning by walking Rusty Greer, Palmeiro and Kapler, then fell
behind 2-0 to Ledee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he might throw me a fastball,'' Ledee said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Wakefield threw him one more knuckler, but it stayed up
and Ledee crushed it into the right-field seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to be aggressive,'' Ledee said. ``I knew I had
the advantage, and he threw me a good one to hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Helling got into immediate trouble in the fifth when he hit
Jason Varitek, gave up a double to Rico Brogna that put runners on
second and third and a run-scoring single to Manny Alexander that
put runners at first and third.
</P>
<P>
   That brought up the top of the Red Sox order, but Helling got
Trot Nixon and Mike Lansing to pop out and struck out Carl Everett
to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``When your team scores like that, you want to be able to put up
a zero and get back in the dugout,'' Helling said. ``I didn't do
that, but the good thing was a potentially big inning was minimized
to just one run.''
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise it could have been more disaster for a team that has
seen more than it's share lately. Helling hasn't been immune to
that, but, with 10 more starts to go, he still has a chance to put
together one of the best seasons ever by a Rangers pitcher. He
isn't ready to slow down.
</P>
<P>
   ``The easiest thing in the world is to say the last 10 starts
don't mean anything, just get the year over with,'' Helling said.
``But my competitive nature is still my best asset. I still have a
job to do, and that's to give my team everything I've got every
fifth day.''

SWIMMING HUNK SEES TRUE BEAUTY IN HIS PARENTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Up here in Speedo-land, sure, they know Lenny
Krayzelburg. His name is on the wall.
</P>
<P>
   He's a hunk. A god. ``People'' magazine found him in the pool at
Southern California and named him one of its ``50 most beautiful
people'' of the year.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a story behind that ``beautiful'' face. Today at
the U.S. Olympic Swimming Trials, Krayzelburg will again try to
validate his golden perch as the best backstroke swimmer in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   The free world. The only world, thanks to the sacrifice of Oleg
and Yelena Krayzelburg, that their son now knows.
</P>
<P>
   Lenny was already a promising age-group swimmer when his parents
moved him, at the age of 13, from the former Soviet Union to
America. As a Soviet Jew, Oleg Krayzelburg wanted his son to have
the opportunities that he and Yelena had only dreamed about.
</P>
<P>
   They settled in California, home of the gold rush. There may or
may not, Lenny smiled, be some significance in that.
</P>
<P>
   ``To move to this country, with no guarantees, without knowing
what was going to happen, to do it for the sake of their children
was a very courageous thing,'' Krayzelburg, now 24, said.
</P>
<P>
   The pool at the Indiana University Natatorium this past week has
echoed with emotion. In keeping with tradition, as each Olympian is
named to the team, his or her name is painted onto the broad, white
wall behind the diving platform _ sometimes within minutes of the
end of their race.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing his name go up after his 100-meter backstroke victory on
Friday, Krayzelburg would only describe it as ``very emotional.''
None of the trials' more than 1,300 Olympic hopefuls have traveled
as far.
</P>
<P>
   Back in Odessa, in what is now Ukraine, young Lenny had
distinguished himself while swimming for the local version of the
YMCA, the town's Sports Army Club. The family left for Los Angeles
in 1989, settling in West Hollywood, and Oleg became a cook. There
was no extra money for any fancy swimming lessons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It definitely was tough those first few years financially,''
Lenny said. ``That's why I had to work. Sure, I was 19, and I
wanted to go out sometimes. I just didn't feel comfortable asking
my parents for money, because they were struggling.''
</P>
<P>
   He found a place to swim _ and to work _ at the local community
center, which made him a lifeguard.
</P>
<P>
   His swim career had been flagging, but Lenny's father reminded
him of how the Soviet coaches had raved about his potential. His
father's persistence, Krayzelburg said, kept him returning to the
pool.
</P>
<P>
   He ended up after high school at Santa Monica City College, and
set a national junior college record in the backstroke. His coach
at Santa Monica contacted Southern Cal coach Mark Schubert (now the
Olympic men's coach), and painfully admitted that Krayzelburg had
outgrown his program.
</P>
<P>
   Krayzelburg officially became a U.S. citizen in 1995. A year
later at the U.S. Olympic Swimming Trials, held at this same IU
Natatorium, Krayzelburg finished fifth in the 200-meter backstroke
and failed to see his name go up on the wall of Olympians.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve months later, he was the best backstroker in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Funny, but the voice doesn't sound like a god's. Krayzelburg
speaks in soft, shy, disarming tones that still, if you listen
close enough, carry a whisper of his Ukrainian heritage. When he
says that he was ``kind of embarrassed'' about being named to
``People'''s most-beautiful list, Krayzelburg leaves no doubt that
he means it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a copy of the magazine,'' he said, almost blushing,
``but I was probably the last person to buy it.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, after he qualifies for the 200-meter backstroke tomorrow _
he also will swim in the medley relay in Sydney _ Krayzelburg is
probably only three gold medals away from truly becoming one of
LA's beautiful people. Lakers games. Jay Leno's couch. The whole
thing.
</P>
<P>
   When he looked into the stands after the race Friday night,
Lenny saw his father crying.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means a lot to them,'' he said. ``When I see how much joy
it brings to them, it makes me want to thank them for what they've
done. And, hopefully, that will come by winning three gold medals _
one for mom, one for dad, one for myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Krayzelburg got to return to Odessa. When he saw
the pool that he had spent so many hours in as a youngster, it
brought tears to his eyes. No longer filled with water, it was
being used to collect garbage.
</P>
<P>
   This is home now, as Lenny Krayzelburg knows.
</P>
<P>
   You're going to be seeing a lot of his face.

UCLA WILL GIVE OPPONENTS DIFFERENT LOOKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILLY WITZ  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ UCLA's football team may return 17 starters, but
the Bruins won't always look the same when they line up.
</P>
<P>
   They've added a couple of important wrinkles this season: they
won't move defensive end Kenyon Coleman inside on passing
situations and they'll use a two-tight end lineup more frequently
on offense.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, when the Bruins defense was in its nickel package,
Coleman was shifted to tackle and an outside linebacker _ either
Ali-Abdul Azziz or Santi Hall _ was brought in as a pass-rushing
end.
</P>
<P>
   The move constitutes much more than a few feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a different world,'' said Coleman, who figures to improve
on last season's sack total of 3{. ``You've got double teams and
there's no space to work. It's lot more crowded in there.''
</P>
<P>
   The offensive adjustments are in order to accommodate an
abundance of talent at tight end. Senior Gabe Crecion, junior Bryan
Fletcher and sophomore Mike Seidman (considered the top prep tight
end in the nation two years ago) are each listed as No.1 on the
depth chart.
</P>
<P>
   The extra tight end will often come at the expense of a
fullback, a position shallow in talent and experience. Junior Matt
Stanley, the projected starter, is a former walk-on and backups
Chris Jackson and Ed Ieremia-Stansbury were switched from
linebacker after last season.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins plan to use a fullback probably only a third of the
time, according to head coach Bob Toledo.
</P>
<P>
   Of the tight ends, Crecion is the most experienced and
fundamentally sound, tight ends coach Gary Bernardi said. Fletcher,
at 231 pounds, is the lightest and quickest; Seidman, at 251
pounds, is the most physical.
</P>
<P>
   The second tight end may line up in the backfield as a slot
receiver, an H-back or as another bookend on the line. But putting
a second tight end on the field won't change what the Bruins do as
much as how they look doing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still do the same things,'' Toledo said. ``We're primarily
an I-formation team that'll run the football.''
</P>
<P>
   HALL QUITS: Hall, a reserve strong-side linebacker, quit the
team Saturday, a day after he was suspended for violating team
policy.
</P>
<P>
   Hall, who started 10 games at outside linebacker as a redshirt
freshman in 1998, told Toledo after the morning practice that he
needed to attend to personal problems.
</P>
<P>
   Tony White will now be backed up by Asi Faoa, suspended for the
season opener, and freshman Brandon Chillar.
</P>
<P>
   It was a better day for another Hall. Senior John Hall, a
walk-on reserve safety, was awarded a scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT I DID ON MY SUMMER VACATION: Outside linebacker Ryan Nece
went to Canton, Ohio, three weeks ago to watch his father, Ronnie
Lott, be enshrined at the NFL Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``To see your father get inducted is an amazing experience,''
said Nece, who was particularly thrilled to meet players like Joe
Namath, Willie Lanier and Joe Greene. ``I study the history of
football, so with all the all-time greats there, I was like a
little kid in a candy store.''
</P>
<P>
   INJURY REPORT: Jerry Lane, a UCLA assistant in the 1960s, was
treated by paramedics for dehydration after he felt faint during
the morning practice. He was resting at home by the end of the day,
said UCLA spokesman Marc Dellins. &QL;

<P>
   &UR;  &LR; LOS ANGELES _ A few hundred protesters took to the streets of
downtown Los Angeles Saturday as thousands of Democratic National
Convention delegates and the journalists covering them jammed
airports and hotel lobbies.
</P>
<P>
   Abortion rights, immigration rights and the wrongs of both
Democrats and Republicans were on the minds of the small groups of
protesters who were closely watched at a distance by cadres of Los
Angeles police officers.
</P>
<P>
   The only arrest reported was of a man who dumped a pickup
truckload of horse manure in front of the Wilshire Grand Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters did little to dampen the festive mood of
convention delegates who had survived long lines at Los Angeles
International Airport and Burbank Airport and even long lines at
hotel check-in desks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels fabulous,'' said delegate Kathleen McConnell, a
letter carrier from San Francisco checking in at the Westin
Bonaventure Hotel. ``It's a dream of mine, my first convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have so many invitations to parties I don't even know how to
begin to pick what I'm going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   McConnell and dozens of others checked in and picked up goody
bags filled with sunscreen, binoculars, water bottles, postcards
and candy then pored through the week's schedule of events.
</P>
<P>
   Print journalists finished their preconvention stories and
broadcast media members performed their umpteenth sound check, all
in time to get to a handful of evening parties thrown just for the
visiting media.
</P>
<P>
   And demonstrators protested at a handful of events around the
city, from government buildings to swank hotels downtown; a small
precursor to what should be massive demonstrations through
Thursday's nomination night.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the largest demonstrations Saturday, about 100 Latinos
gathered two blocks from Staples Center at The Original Pantry
Restaurant - owned by L.A. Mayor Richard Riordan - to demand more
Latino representation in the national parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Democratic Party is the same two-headed monster as the
Republican Party,'' said Tezozo Moc Sandoval, 31, of Montebello,
who was among the demonstrators. ``They don't do anything for the
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Representing about five organizations, the demonstrators blamed
Democrats and Republicans for the ongoing blockade against Cuba,
wars in Colombia and Mexico and efforts to install a military base
in El Salvador.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're here to protest against the Democrats' and the
Republicans' involvement in internal affairs of our nations,'' said
Francisco Martinez, who was born in El Salvador but now lives in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Following the initial rally, the group marched through downtown,
past Staples Center where the convention will start Monday and then
returned to the rally spot for a second rally in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   Leading the march were dancers dressed in colorful costumes
complete with feathered headdress. Marchers danced, drummed and
chanted while others held up several banners and signs.
</P>
<P>
   As the group filled the streets, the demonstrators were escorted
by about three dozen LAPD officers on bicycle, who along with
California Highway Patrol officers could be seen throughout the
downtown area.
</P>
<P>
   At Pershing Square, where many protesters are expected to gather
over the coming days, the action was low-key except for the arrival
at the Regal Biltmore Hotel of delegates from Vice President Al
Gore's home state, Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Saltkill, a United Steelworkers of America lobbyist from
Nashville, wore a red heart-shaped pin that said, ``Kiss me, I'm a
Democrat,'' and bragged about Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're proud of him,'' he said. ``And we feel pretty fortunate
to be able to be here with him.''
</P>
<P>
   David Johnson, an electrician from Jackson, Tenn., said this was
his first visit to Los Angeles. He was supposed to come here once
before for a trade convention eight years ago but something
happened: the Northridge Earthquake of 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just glad to get here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile inside Staples Center, thousands of reporters,
technicians and camera crews tested equipment, while volunteers and
private security guards lined up for credentials and marching
orders.
</P>
<P>
   Security was the tightest it has been, with police, Secret
Service and bomb-sniffing dogs at each entrance. Officers searched
through the bags and purses of reporters and volunteers who had to
walk through metal detectors and flash credentials to enter the
building.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of groups held small events across the city to draw
attention to their cause. Among them:
</P>
<P>
   -- An activist dressed in a pink pig costume dumped four tons of
horse manure in front of the Wilshire Grand Hotel, police said, as
10 people from People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals watched
and cheered.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-by-10-foot spill was quickly cleaned up by hotel
employees. The unidentified protester was arrested and his truck
was impounded.
</P>
<P>
   -- Making their message as graphic as possible, anti-abortion
activists carried five-foot-tall posters of dead fetuses during a
protest Saturday outside a downtown health clinic that performs
abortions. They later drove around downtown L.A. with similar
posters placed on top of their cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore says that he's for family values but killing children
does not promote a family,'' said Jesse Slovenec, 19, of Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, abortion-rights activists carried signs and said they
came out to make sure that the clinic stays open.
</P>
<P>
   ``We anticipated that these other people were going to be out
here,'' said Mary Hood, 26, of Los Angeles. ``We wanted to be out
here to show our support. ... People have this right. Abortion is
supported.''
</P>
<P>
   -- At the First United Methodist Church at 1010 S. Flower St.,
activists erected 553 white crosses to commemorate those who have
died crossing the U.S.-Mexico border since the 1994 inception of
Operation Gatekeeper, a crackdown on illegal immigration that
pushed illegal traffic to more remote and treacherous areas.
</P>
<P>
   -- At Patriotic Hall - just down the street from the Staples
Center - about 250 people attended the Mothers' Convention on
Welfare.
</P>
<P>
   -- At St. James Episcopal Church, Women Against Gun
Violence/Silent March displayed scores of shoes that had belonged
to young gunshot victims. Among those present was LAPD Chief
Bernard C. Parks, whose granddaughter was recently shot to death.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's activities are just a warm-up for the massive
protests expected to begin with today's rally and march by the
Coalition to Stop the Execution of Mumia Abu-Jamal.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands are expected for the noontime event at Pershing Square
meant to draw attention to Abu-Jamal, an African-American
journalist on Death Row for the killing of a police officer.

over the coming days, the action was low-key except for the arrival
at the Regal Biltmore Hotel of delegates from Vice President Al
Gore's home state, Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Saltkill, a United Steelworkers of America lobbyist from
Nashville, wore a red heart-shaped pin that said, ``Kiss me, I'm a
Democrat,'' and bragged about Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're proud of him,'' he said. ``And we feel pretty fortunate
to be able to be here with him.''
</P>
<P>
   David Johnson, an electrician from Jackson, Tenn., said this was
his first visit to Los Angeles. He was supposed to come here once
before for a trade convention eight years ago but something
happened: the Northridge Earthquake of 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just glad to get here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile inside Staples Center, thousands of reporters,
technicians and camera crews tested equipment, while volunteers and
private security guards lined up for credentials and marching
orders.
</P>
<P>
   Security was the tightest it has been, with police, Secret
Service and bomb-sniffing dogs at each entrance. Officers searched
through the bags and purses of reporters and volunteers who had to
walk through metal detectors and flash credentials to enter the
building.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of groups held small events across the city to draw
attention to their cause. Among them:
</P>
<P>
   -- An activist dressed in a pink pig costume dumped four tons of
horse manure in front of the Wilshire Grand Hotel, police said, as
10 people from People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals watched
and cheered.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-by-10-foot spill was quickly cleaned up by hotel
employees. The unidentified protester was arrested and his truck
was impounded.
</P>
<P>
   -- Making their message as graphic as possible, anti-abortion
activists carried five-foot-tall posters of dead fetuses during a
protest Saturday outside a downtown health clinic that performs
abortions. They later drove around downtown L.A. with similar
posters placed on top of their cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore says that he's for family values but killing children
does not promote a family,'' said Jesse Slovenec, 19, of Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, abortion-rights activists carried signs and said they
came out to make sure that the clinic stays open.
</P>
<P>
   ``We anticipated that these other people were going to be out
here,'' said Mary Hood, 26, of Los Angeles. ``We wanted to be out
here to show our support. ... People have this right. Abortion is
supported.''
</P>
<P>
   -- At the First United Methodist Church at 1010 S. Flower St.,
activists erected 553 white crosses to commemorate those who have
died crossing the U.S.-Mexico border since the 1994 inception of
Operation Gatekeeper, a crackdown on illegal immigration that
pushed illegal traffic to more remote and treacherous areas.
</P>
<P>
   -- At Patriotic Hall - just down the street from the Staples
Center - about 250 people attended the Mothers' Convention on
Welfare.
</P>
<P>
   -- At St. James Episcopal Church, Women Against Gun
Violence/Silent March displayed scores of shoes that had belonged
to young gunshot victims. Among those present was LAPD Chief
Bernard C. Parks, whose granddaughter was recently shot to death.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's activities are just a warm-up for the massive
protests expected to begin with today's rally and march by the
Coalition to Stop the Execution of Mumia Abu-Jamal.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands are expected for the noontime event at Pershing Square
meant to draw attention to Abu-Jamal, an African-American
journalist on Death Row for the killing of a police officer.

SCHMID SEETHING AFTER 1-1 DRAW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Upset with his team, the officials and
everything that went wrong Saturday night, Galaxy coach Sigi Schmid
finally lowered his pulse to a reasonable level shortly after his
team's 1-1 draw with Kansas City in front of 33,112 at the Rose
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   With a man advantage for the final 59 minutes and a chance to
move within a point of the Wizards in the Western Division
standings and stay in the race for the league's best record and
home-field advantage throughout the playoffs, all the Galaxy could
do was leave the way it had entered _ four points behind K.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you play a man up you need to play better and smarter,''
said Schmid. ``A tie for us is the same as losing. A tie doesn't do
us any good because we didn't make up any ground.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wizards (13-6-6, 45 points) _ more than happy to walk away
with a tie, especially after midfielder Matt Mckeon was ejected in
the 41st minute for taking a dangerous stab at Mauricio Cienfuegos'
knee _ maintains its comfortable lead over the Galaxy (11-7-8, 41
points) with a game in hand. K.C. has seven games remaining, the
Galaxy six.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was extremely disappointing, it felt like we were a little
off,'' Galaxy defender Greg Vanney said. ``We have to regroup, we
still have a final run to make and we have to play much better than
this to have a shot at the division.''
</P>
<P>
   Referee Tim Weyland, whom Schmid has had problems with before,
failed to call what appeared to be a penalty kick for the Galaxy in
the first half. In the second half, two Galaxy goals were called
back after a questionable offsides and a penalty were whistled
against L.A.
</P>
<P>
   ``Weyland's good for my heart, he gets my heart rate going,''
said Schmid, carefully choosing his words to avoid a fine. ``My
heart specialist says he's good for me because he gets my blood
flowing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy's lone goal of the night came in the opening moments.
Starting in place of Luis Hernandez, Haitian striker Sebastian
Vorbe notched his third goal of the season after some crafty work
by Cobi Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Along the right touchline, Jones juked K.C. defender Brandon
Prideaux and raced toward the endline. He sent a long cross before
Prideaux could catch up. Vorbe had an easy finish at the back of
the goal area, gently heading the ball to the near post for a 1-0
lead in the third minute.
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy gave up a silly goal in the 29th minute, allowing
K.C. to even the match.
</P>
<P>
   Galaxy defender Paul Caligiuri was dribbling toward goalkeeper
Matt Reis. Caligiuri turned to clear the ball away, but the ball
rolled in front of K.C. midfielder Chris Klein with Reis in a bad
spot near the top of the penalty area. All Klein had left was an
easy chip to an empty net for his sixth goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no need for Reis to come out (of his goal),'' said
Schmid. ``Then when he's there, either he (Reis) or Caligiuri need
to kick the freakin' ball into the stands. It's as simple as that.
You can't be indecisive on a play like that.'' &QL;

AFRICAN-AMERICAN LEADERS HOLD PRE-CONVENTION SYMPOSIUM
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; LOS ANGELES _ Magic Johnson and Danny Glover may be used to
being upstaged by a teammate or a co-star.
</P>
<P>
   But by a congresswoman?
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Los Angeles, brought the house down
Saturday at a preconvention symposium of prominent African-American
leaders held at the University of Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   The standing-room-only crowd roared its approval when Waters
exhorted them to help her close the digital divide.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to stop buying the $250 tennis shoes and buy a
computer instead,'' she said, as the 5,000 audience members jumped
to their feet.
</P>
<P>
   While Glover and Johnson certainly got their fair share of
attention at Saturday's event, which centered on the problems
facing African-Americans in the 21st Century, the day clearly
belonged to the intellectuals and politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Waters' fellow panelists included Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr.,
D-Illinois, and Harvard professors Cornel West and Lani Guinier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Magic and Danny Glover could have stayed home for all I
care,'' said Sheryl Hudson, 30, of Diamond Bar, who brought her
1-month-old son to the symposium. ``I came to hear (the panelists)
talk about the issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Organizers said the event was designed to let the Democratic
Party know it can't take African-American voters for granted on the
eve of the party's presidential nominating convention.
</P>
<P>
   Glover said he attended the symposium in the hope that his
celebrity would attract the attention of news media and
African-Americans who don't usually follow politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a responsibility,'' Glover said as he was mobbed by
reporters after the panel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actors should be eclipsed by politicians,'' he said, shouting
to be heard. ``We don't do anything that really matters.''

DATE SET FOR U.S. OPEN CUP SEMIFINAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ The Galaxy learned Saturday that it will host
the Chicago Fire at Cal State Fullerton on Aug. 23 in the
semifinals of the Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles, which will take on the Fire twice in a span of five
days, will travel to Chicago on Aug. 19 for a regular season MLS
game.
</P>
<P>
   This is only the second time the Galaxy has participated in the
Open Cup, a tournament that started in 1914 and is open to all
affiliated amateur and professional teams in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy lost last season in the quarterfinals to the Columbus
Crew.
</P>
<P>
   The winner of the Chicago-L.A. game faces the winner of the New
York/New Jersey-Miami match Oct. 22 at a site to be determined. The
winner of the Open Cup earns $100,000 in prize money while the
runner-up picks up $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   A week earlier, the MLS championship takes place, meaning
there's a good chance two of the four teams left in the Open Cup
could have to play championship games in back-to-back weeks.
</P>
<P>
   HERNANDEZ OUT: Luis Hernandez will miss Wednesday's game against
Colorado because of Mexico's World Cup qualifying match against
Canada on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   He's not the only one missing. Ezra Hendrickson (St. Vincent and
the Grenadines), Mauricio Cienfuegos (El Salvador) and Cobi Jones
(U.S.) will also miss the match because of qualifying games.
</P>
<P>
   After a slow start, Hernandez has come on strong, scoring a goal
and setting up two others in last week's 5-1 victory over Kansas
City at Arrowhead Stadium. Since going without a point in his first
seven games, Hernandez has built a five-game scoring streak. He has
three goals and five assists for 11 points during that span.
</P>
<P>
   HOT STREAK II: Cienfuegos has also hit his stride. After going
13 straight games without a point, he has recorded three goals and
three assists in his last five games. &QL;

VISITING DEMOCRATS PARTY AT $1.5 MILLION BASH
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   &UR;  &LR; LOS ANGELES _ In the biggest party kicking off Democratic
National Convention week, about 15,000 journalists, delegates and
VIPs thronged to the heart of downtown Saturday night to feast on
California cuisine and political gossip.
</P>
<P>
   The drinks and food flowed freely at the $1.5 million bash at
the downtown Department of Water and Power plaza and the nearby
Dorothy Chandler Pavilion as images of planets, stars, babies'
faces and the seal of the city of Los Angeles bounced off the sides
of building.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is here to show everybody else that they were sent
here, that they deserve to be here,'' said political satirist Mark
Russell.
</P>
<P>
   So why was he there?
</P>
<P>
   ``She dragged me,'' he said, pointing to his wife, Alison. ``I
wanted to stay in the room and watch C-SPAN.''
</P>
<P>
   Russell even had a backup plan in case the party was a bust.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this gets dull, I'll go down to Long Beach and cover that
(Reform) convention.''
</P>
<P>
   With the convention starting Monday, the festivities surrounding
it were in high gear.
</P>
<P>
   President Bill Clinton and first lady Hillary Clinton were
rounding up millions of dollars in contributions at private parties
with L.A.'s elite, hotels all around town were jammed with newly
arrived delegates and protests were in place around the downtown
area.
</P>
<P>
   The bash downtown was the launch pad to the festivities and as
parties go, journalists called this one a success.
</P>
<P>
   The menu included bowtie pasta salad with pesto, shrimp and
foccia, as well as Southwestern favorites such as tamales, taquitos
and salsa, and for those uncomfortable with Western fare, there was
fried chicken and cole slaw.
</P>
<P>
   The host of the event was LA Convention 2000, the local host
committee for the convention.
</P>
<P>
   The news media relished a night on the town before getting down
to covering the convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm amazed at the short line for drinks,'' marveled Aaron
Harber, a Denver television host, as he munched on shrimp and took
in the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reporters are not drinking as much as I expected, but the
night is young.''
</P>
<P>
   Harber wasn't the only one with commentary on the evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice when we have one night when we can act like the
delegates,'' said Peter Aseltine, a reporter from the Times of
Trenton, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   But Aseltine is reserving final judgment until the end of the
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm told the Democrats party better than the Republicans, so
I'm waiting to see,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Richard Riordan, a Republican already feeling comfortable
in the sea of Democrats converging on Los Angeles, addressed the
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look forward to working with you. We are going to keep our
heads high. We are going to have a great time, and we are going to
make everybody leave loving Los Angeles.''
</P>
<P>
   Also in attendance were delegates and politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Revelers were treated to drummers playing African music, Chinese
dragon dances and live performances by singer Patti LaBelle and the
band Big Bad Voodoo Daddy.
</P>
<P>
   The party's theme was ``A Kaleidoscope,'' with the variety of
entertainment intended to suggest the diversity of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Goodman, of the Times of Trenton, N.J., ranked the party
among the best he'd seen at political conventions he's covered as a
veteran reporter.
</P>
<P>
   ``(But) New Orleans was the best party ever,'' he said,
referring to the 1988 convention.
</P>
<P>
   Rutger C. Mazel of Dutch national public radio and television,
said he liked what he saw as he partied in the open air with
thousands of colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really looks like L.A. to me,'' he said. ``Open air, nice
weather, music and people.''
</P>
<P>
   David Jackson, a political reporter for the Dallas Morning News
who also appears on C-SPAN, called the party ``something to do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always fun to relax because the week itself is so
hectic,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But lots of journalist also were working, with stories scrawled
in their notebooks as they talked on cellular telephones, dictating
their stories to their offices.

   &UR;  &LR; LOS ANGELES _ At the Playboy Mansion, where the silicone
outweighed the barbecued shrimp, the talk was on - what else - the
Playboy Mansion.
</P>
<P>
   It certainly seemed like a suitable environment for a
fund-raiser - or most any other event, for that matter. The elegant
manor in Holmby Hills was softly lighted Saturday for an
invitation-only ``Welcome to L.A.'' bash for several hundred
Playboy writers, models and associates of the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   If there were any delegates or stray members of the Democratic
Party, they were keeping an extremely low profile.
</P>
<P>
   However, some media figures in the crowd were happy to talk
about the flap that led to U.S. Rep. Loretta Sanchez moving her
Tuesday fund-raiser from the mansion to B.B. King's Blues Club at
Universal City's CityWalk under pressure from the party.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Democrats wanted to give me something to rip on night
after night, they gave me an issue that moved to the top of the
list,'' said Bill Maher, host of ABC-TV's ``Politically
Incorrect.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course there's nothing to be ashamed about being here. It's
just hypocrisy.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the bunnies were out in force Saturday, none were
expected to show up for Sanchez's event in the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Playboy Mansion is not Sodom and Gomorrah,'' said
Playboy's director of communications, Bill Farley. ``It has been
used by charities, for fund-raiser events, for all sorts of events.
The DNC's action really amounts to a bunch of rich white guys
picking on a Latina.''
</P>
<P>
   Farley added that few politicians were on the guest list
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Political commentator Arianna Huffington blasted the DNC for
pressuring Sanchez.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here we are having the convention in the capital of poverty in
America and the DNC is getting upset over the Playboy Mansion,''
she said. ``What goes against family values is their fund raising.
That's immoral, far more immoral than having a party in this
beautiful place.''
</P>
<P>
   Local talk radio personality Michael Jackson called the DNC's
stand ``stupidity and bungling. It's almost as if they have a death
wish. Loretta Sanchez wasn't here for the Democratic Party. She was
here for a Hispanic voters' event. This is a gorgeous setting for
any sort of party.''
</P>
<P>
   As the band played Dixieland jazz and guests began moving toward
the desert buffet, Bunnyhutch chief Hugh Hefner found a table with
five of his models.
</P>
<P>
   ``The `D' in Democrat is supposed to represent diversity,''
Hefner said. ``The fact that higher-ups in the party would attack
her in this way is just ridiculous. It really has to do with
(presumptive presidential nominee Al) Gore trying to separate
himself from the Clinton scandal. Nobody in America (likes)
bullies. One expects more from them.''

MERCKER RETURNS, ANGELS WIN 9-6
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GORDON VERRELL  
 c.2000 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Kent Mercker made his emotional return to the
Angels on Saturday night against the New York Yankees at Edison
Field, his first appearance in a big-league game since suffering a
life-threatening cerebral hemorrhage pitching on the same mound
three months and one day earlier.
</P>
<P>
   His return was warmly welcomed by the sellout crowd of 43,394,
when he walked in from the left-field bullpen before the start of
the game and again when he went out to pitch the first inning ...
and, once more, when he walked off after being removed in the
fourth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very excited and happy I was able to pitch,'' he said
afterward, ``but I didn't pitch well. ... I had too much energy. I
let my emotions get to me. There was no excuse to be as wild as I
was.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to do well, I wanted to be perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, so he wasn't perfect. But he was certainly better than the
Yankees' starter, Denny Neagle, who didn't even make it past the
second inning. He was knocked out in the midst of a six-run
uprising by the Angels, who emerged with a 9-6 win, their third
victory in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Credit much of it to a deft maneuver by the Angels' manager,
Mike Scioscia.
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia, looking for more punch against left-handed starters,
gave his lineup a good working over. The key move: shifting
power-hitting third baseman Troy Glaus from the sixth spot to No.2.
</P>
<P>
   A little unusual, perhaps, having a 30-plus home run hitter
batting second. But, as Scioscia explained afterward _ after Glaus
had driven in a career high five runs with two homers, his 33rd and
34th of the year, one of them the first grand slam of his career,
and a double _ ``he's really more like a No.3 hitter, because we've
got Benji Gil hitting ninth.''
</P>
<P>
   Glaus' slam highlighted the six-run second inning. Mo Vaughn
also homered in the second. And Glaus homered again in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Garret Anderson had doubles in his first three at-bats,
giving him five so far in the series with the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   The win kept the Angels within two games of first place in the
American League's ever-so-wild wild-card race.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, for all of it, it was Mercker's return that stood out.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're talking about a guy ... what he went through, to pitch
into the fourth inning ... it gave us a big lift,'' Scioscia said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a little fatigued, he didn't quite get to the range we
expected (which was about 90 pitches; he left after 74), but his
velocity was good, he threw some good change-ups, some good
sliders. Obviously, his command wasn't there, but he kept
battling.''
</P>
<P>
   Mercker admitted he did some thinking, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had that long inning (the second), and I had a lot of time
to think,'' he said, smiling. ``I kind of pinched myself, asking,
`Am I really here?'
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel great physically, even if it didn't look so great. Now
... I'm looking forward to my next start.''
</P>
<P>
   Mercker, who was eventually charged with three runs on five hits
over 32/3 innings, pitched a 1-2-3 first inning and allowed
bases-empty homers to Glenallen Hill in the second and Scott
Brosius in the third. In the fourth, he turned a 6-2 lead over to
reliever Lou Pote. There were two outs, but the bases were loaded.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Jeter shot a single to right that scored one run. But
right fielder Tim Salmon cut down Hill at the plate for the third
out, Salmon's 11th assist of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was big,'' Scioscia said. ``It stopped them right
there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels ballooned the lead to 9-3 with three runs in the
fourth, then had to hang on.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees got to Pote (1-0) for two runs in the seventh, then
one off of Mike Holtz in the eighth. Shigetoshi Hasegawa put out
the fire, allowing one hit the final 11/3 innings for his fifth
save, extending his scoreless streak to 181/3 innings over 11
appearances. He hasn't given up an earned run his last 251/3
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Mercker reflected on the moment, saying, ``I sat
around for three months. I was out a long time ... and it felt
great to be back.'' &QL;

 &HT;    TEXAS-SIZE HOWDY TO BUSH(a)

<P>
   (Prescott, ARIZ.) - He may have been away from his central Texas
ranch, but George W. Bush had a real Lone Star weekend planned.
</P>
<P>
   Eat barbecue at Sen. John McCain's place. Hang out by the creek.
Talk politics.
</P>
<P>
   About the only thing missing was Willie Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and his once bitter foe for the Republican presidential
nomination jetted in Saturday afternoon 30 minutes ahead of
schedule for a weekend retreat at McCain's home on Oak Creek, about
halfway between Cottonwood and Sedona.
</P>
<P>
   But first, there was a campaign stop in front of the same
courthouse where, 36 years before, Sen. Barry Goldwater had
extolled the rights of sovereign citizens, the evils of communism
and the lack of law and order as he kicked off his losing
presidential campaign to Lyndon B. Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Bush talked about what a great patriot McCain is. McCain talked
about how cool it is that the next first lady won't be running for
the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and McCain had spent Saturday morning in photo
opportunities in front of aircraft carriers in Everett, Wash., and
had spent the past three days campaigning together in California,
Oregon and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   McCain enthusiastically predicted that Bush will carry all three
states in November, along with Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Bush didn't deviate from his normal spiel as about 5,000
supporters jockeyed for a good view on the courtyard grass,
dominated by a statue of Arizona frontier hero Bucky O'Neill.
</P>
<P>
   We won't have to worry about interns in the Oval Office or what
``is'' means, Bush said. Honor and dignity are in. So is Social
Security, Medicare and the military. And, as has become his habit
on the stump, Bush threw in a sentence in Spanish to the decidedly
non-Latin American crowd.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd started gathering more than three hours before as
venders hawked Bush/Cheney buttons for $4 and Prescott High School
cheerleaders led the crowd in Republican cheers.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone was happy to see Bush come to town.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the campaign rally was held right in the middle of
the Mountain Artist Guild crafts festival, which had booked the
site a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Debora Geiger of Santa Fe, who makes crosses of spruce inlaid
with tiles, said business had been slow. And she blamed politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did really well over here on Mother's Day when all these
politicos weren't around,'' Geiger said.

 &HT;    IT'S THE DEMS' TURN(a) 
 &HT;    By JEFF BARKER(a) 
 &HT;    c.2000 The Arizona Republic(a) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Los Angeles - Democrats gather Monday for their national
convention as a party eagerly embracing the political center.
</P>
<P>
   As they prepare to anoint Al Gore as their presidential
candidate, the Democrats hope for a convention that is exciting but
not raucous, innovative but not threatening, progressive but not
radical.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, middle of the road.
</P>
<P>
   It may not sound sexy, but that's OK with the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   When they convened four years ago, many of the party's liberals
still were simmering over a welfare-reform bill signed by President
Clinton. The left-leaning wing said that the bill abandoned the
poor and that Clinton was too intent on appealing to voters at the
center of the spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   With the four-day 2000 convention about to open, the Democrats'
march toward the middle is nearly complete. This year, there is
less controversy, at least so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Clinton has moved our party to the center,'' said Mark
Fleisher, Arizona Democratic Party chairman.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still want to protect opportunity for everybody, but we
also expect responsibility from everybody, and that's the
difference. A lot of the old (welfare) programs created in the '70s
and '80s were taken advantage of by some people to line their
pockets instead of using the programs as a steppingstone, the way
they were designed.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's selection of Connecticut Sen. Joe Lieberman as his
running mate offered a clear signal about the party's direction. In
1995, Lieberman became chairman of the Democratic Leadership
Council, a think tank that has worked to give the party a moderate
identity. Among other programs, the DLC pushed for the work-based
welfare reform that was attacked from the left in 1996 for ending
the federal guarantee of welfare for all eligible mothers and
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the parties this year have chosen two people who
understand the need for appeal to the political center,'' said Doug
Wilson, the DLC's former national political director who led the
Clinton-Gore Arizona campaign in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Lieberman) epitomizes this appeal to the center without
abandoning traditional Democratic values, and that's the key,''
Wilson said. ``You can't have one without the other, otherwise it's
Republicanism.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, with both parties quieting their extremists, it's
sometimes hard to tell the difference between the two. Republicans
and Democrats alike have sought to claim credit for welfare reform,
and both parties stress ``compassion'' and ``responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, GOP nominee George W. Bush led a convention that
touted tolerance and inclusion. His speech was a radical departure
from Pat Buchanan's 1992 GOP convention address that suggested a
war for the ``soul'' of America.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess imitation is the sincerest form of flattery,'' said
Arizona Attorney General Janet Napolitano, who thinks Bush has been
borrowing this year from the Democratic playbook.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona state Rep. Ken Cheuvront agrees that Bush is co-opting
Democratic themes.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is ``DLC-lite,'' Cheuvront said. ``I think he was using lot
of the rhetoric, but his record in Texas is still Old Guard
Republican right.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheuvront says the DLC's moderate themes fit well in Arizona, a
state in which the Legislature and congressional delegation are
dominated by Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The average Arizona voter is socially progressive but fiscally
conservative, which is very much in line with the DLC message,''
Cheuvront said.
</P>
<P>
   Cheuvront will join Napolitano as a delegate. Napolitano will
lead the state contingent, along with U.S. Rep. Ed Pastor, D-Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   Cheuvront, who is openly gay, says many of the divisions of the
1996 Democratic convention have faded as the party has been
transformed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably the biggest struggle between some of the Old Guard
and the DLC is on free-trade issues,'' he said. Some in the party
have opposed Clinton administration-backed free-trade pacts, which
organized labor contends are sending American jobs overseas.
</P>
<P>
   But the Democratic convention won't be about highlighting
disagreement within the party. Rather, it will be about its
differences from the GOP, on everything from gun control to taxes.
Gore supports much broader gun control measures than does Bush, and
has said the GOP tax relief plan would threaten the future
viability of Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the last couple of months, it's the Democrats who have to
recapture ground that has been lost to the Republicans,'' Wilson
said.
</P>
<P>
   To do that, he said the party must define itself anew to the
American people.

 &HT;    BAMBINO'S STEPPING UP FOR LAST TIME(a) 
 &HT;    (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)(a) 
 &HT;    By E.J. MONTINI(a) 
 &HT;    c.2000 The Arizona Republic(a) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Phoenix) - This week, the Democrats officially scratch Babe
Ruth from their starting lineup, leaving the team without a heavy
hitter and establishing themselves as the Red Sox of the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
   For eight years, Bill Clinton, the Backwoods Bambino, has batted
cleanup for the Democrats, swatting tape-measure home runs and
taking to the pitcher's mound whenever the team needed someone to
toss a shutout.
</P>
<P>
   For eight years, Clinton has astonished the opposition with his
playing skills, particularly his ability to keep from being thrown
out. At the same time, he drew thousands of new fans to the
political ballgame through his off-the-field antics. He was a bad
boy, like Ruth. Flawed, vain, occasionally stupid, unexplainably
reckless but - (beginitalic)man (enditalic)- could he play.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night, the Democrats will let Clinton step up to the
plate one last time at their convention in Los Angeles. For him,
it'll be like batting practice, a chance to hit a few long balls
for the home crowd.
</P>
<P>
   After that, the Sultan of Political Swat gets shuffled off the
stage and replaced in the batting order by a couple of
minor-leaguers named Al Gore and Joe Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   For the Democratic Party, it'll be like Boston in 1920, when Red
Sox owner Harry Frazee sold Babe Ruth to the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth was already the best hitter and one of the best pitchers in
baseball, as well as being what the (beginitalic)Boston Globe's
(enditalic)John J. Hallahan called ``the most colorful star in the
game today.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox let Ruth go and haven't won a World Series since, a
record the Democrats will equal or exceed by offering up candidates
like Gore and Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   This must be why the Republicans figured they didn't need a
cleanup hitter like John McCain, the Reggie Jackson of their team.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is the Republicans' best slugger and provides the most
entertaining locker room interviews. Still, they shipped him back
to their Triple-A farm team in Phoenix, figuring they can beat the
Democrats with a couple of Bush-leaguers of their own. And why not?
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Lieberman have yet to turn a double play on the
opposition, even with George W. Bush and Dick Cheney lugging tons
of baggage around the bases.
</P>
<P>
   At their convention earlier this month, the Republicans tried to
resurrect the memory of their own Lou Gehrig - Ronald Reagan - and
instead only reminded people how interesting their team used to be.
The Democrats, not wanting to make the same mistake, are hoping to
get Clinton out of town before Gore even arrives.
</P>
<P>
   Together, the political parties seem determined to take all the
color out of the election game, leaving fans to watch a dragged
out, dry-as-dust contest in which we can't tell (and don't care)
who's winning because all the players are wearing gray.
</P>
<P>
   That didn't happen with Clinton. His crazy eight years in office
will be remembered in a way the great Jimmy Cannon once wrote of
Ruth: ``He was a parade all by himself, a burst of dazzle and
jingle, Santa Claus drinking his whiskey straight and groaning with
a bellyache. {hellip} Babe Ruth made the music that his joyous
years danced to in a continuous party. ``
</P>
<P>
   For Democrats, for all of us, the party's over.

   (PHOENIX) - After nights in shelters, run-down motels and even
old cars, kids come to Thomas J. Pappas School not only to learn
but for a good breakfast, a clean pair of underwear and a chance to
cool off.
</P>
<P>
   The school for homeless children has been an Arizona success
story for more than a decade and the sweetheart charity of the
state's largest donors.
</P>
<P>
   But now a powerful national advocacy group, one with the ear of
federal lawmakers, wants to shut it down, saying the children are
unfairly segregated.
</P>
<P>
   The fervor in Washington is so great that congressional hearings
will be held at the school on Sept. 5, so politicians can see the
place for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The debate began with a report by the National Law Center on
Homelessness and Poverty released in February. It charges that
segregating children because they are homeless deprives them of a
quality education and the chance to develop friendships with
children who aren't homeless.
</P>
<P>
   The report notes that Pappas is far different from the 40 other
schools for homeless children scattered across the country.
Typically, they are little more than a room in a shelter or church
basement, often without certified teachers or a real curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   Pappas is a $3.8million school with computers and a library.
Still, says Bret Boyce, the center's staff attorney, the concern is
the same: The separate schools are unequal, in much the same way
that schools that segregated children by color were.
</P>
<P>
   The homeless schools don't have the resources to offer advanced
math, science and computer classes, or theater, music and sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even absent all that,'' Boyce said, ``we are concerned about
the practice of segregating homeless students, simply based on
their status. That, in and of itself, isolates and stigmatizes
them.''
</P>
<P>
   And it's against the law.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Maricopa County Regional School District, which
runs the homeless school, are unapologetic: If it weren't for
Pappas, they contend, their students wouldn't even go to school.
</P>
<P>
   And while Washington considers Pappas' fate, Maricopa County
Schools Superintendent Sandra Dowling, who started the school 11
years ago, will open a second campus in the East Valley sometime in
the next year.
</P>
<P>
   She'll hear no talk of shutting down.
</P>
<P>
   MODEST BEGINNINGS
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 1.2 million children nationwide are homeless. Local
officials figure as many as 24,000 homeless children are in Arizona
public schools, a number that has doubled since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Pappas started with eight children in a church 11 years ago. At
the end of last school year, it had 780 students, up from 450 the
year before.
</P>
<P>
   Boyce, of the National Law Center, says he doesn't question
whether Pappas is doing well by students academically and in
meeting their other needs. It's the principle he's concerned about.
Segregation of students, for any reason, can't be OK in one case
but not another, he says.
</P>
<P>
   The Stuart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act of 1987 backs him
up. Providing $30million nationwide for housing, health care and
education of the homeless, it also prohibits putting homeless kids
in separate schools.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona receives several million annually in McKinney funds,
with $444,000 of last year's allocation going to the state
Department of Education for homeless students. Pappas received
$50,000.
</P>
<P>
   Boyce wants Congress to prohibit the separate schools or at
least deny them, and the states that support them, McKinney
funding.
</P>
<P>
   He suggests sending homeless students to regular public schools
and turning Pappas into a resource center for all homeless
children.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence for and against segregating homeless students is
mostly anecdotal. The Law Center report is the first to look
closely at such schools, which operate quietly out of the public
eye.
</P>
<P>
   Many homeless students do just fine in regular public schools,
says Jennifer Henderson, the state Department of Education's
homeless education coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Pappas has only a fraction of the estimated 24,000
homeless kids in public schools.
</P>
<P>
   The rest blend in to regular classrooms, wearing discreetly
donated clothes and showering in the school nurse's office. The bus
picks them up down the street from the shelter, so the other kids
won't see where they live.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson likes Pappas, but says that because of its high
profile, ``people think we're taking care of all of our homeless
students, and we're not.''
</P>
<P>
   So while Pappas gets the donations and Christmas parties,
regular public schools limp by on what money they did get from the
McKinney Act, paying for tutoring, after-school programs and bus
transportation for their homeless students.
</P>
<P>
   But the federal funds Arizona gets doesn't go far. Only 10 of
Arizona's 400 school districts, including charters, got the federal
grants last year. So, school secretaries and teachers often use
their own money for new backpacks and shoes.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is, not all kids, especially those in the toughest
circumstances, fare as well. And if you force them to go to regular
schools, they might not go at all, explained Ernalee Phelps, the
Pappas School's resource development director.
</P>
<P>
   Pappas students eat breakfast and lunch at school, the only
meals some of them get.
</P>
<P>
   Children with lice are soaped with medicated shampoo.
Counselors, doctors and dentists visit regularly.
</P>
<P>
   Dirty, torn or worn-out clothes warrant a stop at the school's
clothing room for a clean outfit, right down to new underwear and
socks.
</P>
<P>
   Little of this is available in regular public schools. And at
Pappas, no one makes fun of matted hair and dirty clothes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst thing you can do to a child is break their spirit,''
Phelps said. ``And a single comment - `Ew, you wore that
yesterday,' or, `Why are you so dirty?' - can break a homeless
child's spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   Margaret Mangini, director of Arizona State University's Bureau
of Educational Research, says that despite the lack of sweeping
studies backing it up, Pappas' mission is ``the right thing to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If it is against the law to do this,'' she said, ``change the
law.''
</P>
<P>
   In an October visit to the school, George W. Bush says no way
should the school be closed. Arizona Gov. Jane Hull agrees with the
Republican presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona Rep. Matt Salmon, R-Phoenix, has introduced legislation
to exempt existing homeless schools from attempts to ban such
segregation and allow them to continue receiving McKinney funding.
It passed the House but stalled in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one forces these kids to be in this school. It's the
family's decision,'' said Salmon, a regular Pappas visitor and
longtime homeless advocate. ``They know what is best for their
children, not these federal stooges.''
</P>
<P>
   FEARS OF DUMPING
</P>
<P>
   Because of the hassles that come with homeless students, some
schools push them to Pappas, says Mary Michaelis, the school's
registrar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, the public schools would rather not deal with these
kids,'' she said. ``They tire of kids not showing up or moving all
of the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Lisa Graham Keegan, state superintendent of public
instruction and a Pappas fan, is concerned that regular public
schools are dumping their homeless students at Pappas.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I have an issue with is the creation of a belief system
that these kids are Pappas' problem,'' Keegan said.
</P>
<P>
   State law requires students to show proof of a permanent
address, immunization and transcripts to enroll in public schools.
Homeless children are exempt.
</P>
<P>
   Crockett Elementary near the large United Methodist Outreach
Ministry shelter at 32nd and Van Buren streets would get the bulk
of Pappas' students if Pappas were to close.
</P>
<P>
   Already, a number of students from the ministry shelter attend,
says Principal Jeanne Sorci, although she is not sure just how
many.
</P>
<P>
   One child even enrolled using an address that turned out to be
an empty lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't care if they are homeless or not,'' Sorci said. ``Our
responsibility is to educate any child who comes through the
door.''
</P>
<P>
   But she says homeless families in crisis can get more help at
Pappas.
</P>
<P>
   At Crockett, homeless children get free meals and uniforms, as
any kid in need would. But, unlike at Pappas, school officials can
only refer them to other agencies for social services, not provide
them at the school.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are attempting to do as much as we can for these
families,'' Sorci said. ``But schools can't be everything to
everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES
</P>
<P>
   The students at Pappas score dismally on standardized tests,
ranking among the lowest in the state.
</P>
<P>
   But these children, Phelps explains, miss months, even years of
school as they are dragged from one place to another.
</P>
<P>
   For some, this is their sixth school in as many months.
</P>
<P>
   What's important, Phelps says, is that children who stay at
Pappas from year to year routinely improve their scores. And
they're in school, which is an accomplishment in itself,
considering that the buses from Pappas travel almost 400 miles a
day across Maricopa County to pick up students.
</P>
<P>
   In Lisa Hestand's first-grade summer-school class, Caroline
Rader cuts paper fish with blunted scissors after reading Dr.
Seuss' (beginitalic)Red Fish, Blue Fish.
</P>
<P>
   (enditalic) She lives in an apartment with her mother. Before
that, she says, they lived in a hotel and, before that, in
someone's garage. The 7-year-old has attended six schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love it here,'' Caroline says, coloring one fish red and the
other blue. ``The lunch here is good. I really love the lunch.''
</P>
<P>
   The school, which opened in 1997, is getting cramped, though
many other Valley schools have the same problem. Some classes seat
up to 40 students.
</P>
<P>
   Superintendent Dowling is shopping for a second school site,
somewhere in the East Valley. Already, the county schools 100
children living at a shelter on what was Williams Air Force Base.
</P>
<P>
   Michaelis, the school's registrar, decides when students are
ready to leave Pappas for neighborhood schools, typically four
months after a family finds a place to live.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Morgan, who sits on the board of the Pappas Foundation,
complains Michaelis doesn't move children out soon enough and
admits students who technically aren't homeless to boost
enrollment. That way, he says, the school gets more state funding
and more money from donors and grants.
</P>
<P>
   Michaelis says that isn't true, pointing out that the school
already is cramped.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that whatever causes most families to become
homeless - poverty, domestic violence, substance abuse, health
problems - rarely disappears with a new address.
</P>
<P>
   Michaelis has a family now that has been in the same place for
more than four months. But, she says, looking at the kids' records,
it is their eighth move since December.
</P>
<P>
   If they transfer to a neighborhood school now, they'll be back
at Pappas with the next move, Michaelis says. Best just to keep the
children here.
</P>
<P>
   Michaelis estimates it takes 18 months before a family is stable
enough to pay the rent, buy groceries and keep everyone in shoes
and clothes. She says only one of every 100 of her families ever
makes it on its own.
</P>
<P>
   When Corrine Frank, a special-education teacher, started at
Pappas eight years ago, she delighted when a student left for a
regular public school. Now, she watches for their return.
</P>
<P>
   In the mornings before class, Frank's students come to her with
their problems:
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom got drunk last night, and she busted all the windows,
and now we have nowhere to go.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting kicked out of the shelter.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone stole my clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   And she still has to teach them about the U.S. Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing that is going to help them break the cycle is
education,'' Frank said. ``While we try to help them with
everything else, their education has to be our primary focus.''
</P>
<P>
   SUCCESS STORY
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Bacon had been to nine schools before he went to Pappas in
fifth grade. At the time, he was sleeping in an abandoned house
with his little brother, Ryan.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck's been on the street most of his life, begging on corners
and fending off lice.
</P>
<P>
   Now 19, he just graduated from Carl Hayden High with a ``B''
average and plans to start college this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck is one of seven Pappas alumni going to college, all on
scholarship through the school.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck talks of being a teacher, maybe at Pappas.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it weren't for Pappas, I don't think I would have made
it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So, Chuck is dismayed anyone would even think of shutting down
the school. His brother, 16, still goes there.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't see what's here,'' Chuck said, shaking his head.
``I wonder if any of them have ever been homeless, if they've ever
had to lay their head on a piece of cardboard and sleep in a field,
never knowing who's coming around the corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wonder if they've ever been locked out of a hotel room with
all of their belongings inside because they couldn't pay the rent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wonder if any of them ever wanted to go to school but knew
if they did the other kids would make fun of them because they were
dirty and had holes in their shoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't know what's here at Pappas.''
</P>
<P>
   When politicians are here in September, he'll tell them:
``There's hope here.''

 &HT;    REAL ARIZONA TO GREET BLACK JOURNALIST(a) 
 &HT;    (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)(a) 
 &HT;    By DANIEL GONZALEZ AND PETER CORBETT(a) 
 &HT;    c.2000 The Arizona Republic(a) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (PHOENIX) - A decade ago it was unthinkable that thousands of
Black journalists would ever visit Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   But the fact that more than 2,000 members of the National
Association of Black Journalists will be downtown this week for the
group's 25th anniversary convention is evidence that the state is
overcoming the damage done in 1987, when then-Gov. Evan Mecham
rescinded a paid state holiday honoring the Rev. Martin Luther King
Jr.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a chance to make over the image of Arizona through the
eyes of African-American journalists,'' said Venita James,
president of the Arizona Association of Black Journalists and
senior editor/bureaus for (beginitalic)The Arizona Republic.
</P>
<P>
   (enditalic)''Instead of lingering pictures of racism, we'll be
able to show that African-Americans can survive and thrive in
Arizona.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been an uphill climb to remove the stigma of Mecham's
decision to rescind the King holiday. Arizona lost the 1993 Super
Bowl and other groups, including the NABJ board of directors,
refused to book their conventions in the state or pulled out.
</P>
<P>
   Community leaders have worked for nearly five years to lure the
African-American journalists and other minority groups to town.
</P>
<P>
   NABJ is the largest African-American group to hit Phoenix since
the National Baptist Convention in 1995, which drew 30,000
delegates.
</P>
<P>
   The collaboration of more than 35 public and private entities on
the NABJ convention, far beyond what the average 2,000-delegate
group could expect, shows the growing importance of diversity
issues in competing for conventions, new businesses and even
workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have a large group of media coming in from all over
the country, it's important to put your best foot forward,'' said
Brian Kearney, executive director of the Downtown Phoenix
Partnership.
</P>
<P>
   SEEKING SIMILAR GROUPS
</P>
<P>
   This is one of the first major conferences involving an
influential minority group since the King holiday was approved, and
Arizona hopes to attract similar groups, according to James Jessie,
Greater Phoenix Convention &AMP; Visitors Bureau national convention
sales manager.
</P>
<P>
   The Native American Journalists of America came to Phoenix last
June, and the National Association of Hispanic Journalists will
meet in the Valley next summer.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona has celebrated King's birthday since 1992, after voters
finally approved a state holiday for the slain civil rights leader.
Arizona has the distinction of being the first and only state where
voters have approved a King holiday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key is that they will hopefully write stories about the
changes (in Arizona),'' said Karen Mulzac-Frye, founder of the
Arizona Association of Black Journalists and co-chairwoman of the
committee organizing the convention.
</P>
<P>
   The event is a chance to reshape Arizona's image as a
progressive state where African-Americans enjoy a high quality of
life despite their relatively low numbers, said Denise Meridith,
Arizona director of the U.S. Bureau of Land Management and a
co-chairwoman of the organizing committee. Blacks make up just 5
percent of Phoenix's population of 1.28 million.
</P>
<P>
   Meridith, who is widely regarded as the highest ranking
African-American public official in the state, said organizers
promoted the Multi-Cultural Affairs Council, which was formed in
the early 1990s with support from the hospitality and tourism
industry, business and government, to show that the city was
welcoming to minorities.
</P>
<P>
   The convention will showcase the state's many assets, from its
rich diversity of people and cultures, to its natural wonders like
the Grand Canyon and the red rocks of Sedona, Meridith said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have to sell here is culture,'' she said. ``We really
stressed what would be different here: the outdoors, experiencing
an outdoor fantasy. A lot of African-Americans, they've seen that
on TV, but they haven't had a chance to see it for themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   They will have a chance to play golf, saddle up at a dude ranch
and tour the state from Kartchner Caverns to the Grand Canyon.
</P>
<P>
   The convention, held at the Phoenix Civic Plaza, runs Wednesday
through Friday.
</P>
<P>
   A WARM WELCOME
</P>
<P>
   Skycaps at the airport will wear buttons welcoming the
journalists, banners will adorn downtown streetlights, merchants
will offer special discounts and the Arizona Center will host
entertainment and a film festival for the delegates.
</P>
<P>
   Both major party presidential candidates could make an
appearance during the convention
</P>
<P>
   Symphony Hall will feature a Boyz II Men performance for the
NABJ attendees.
</P>
<P>
   NABJ is expected to generate 5,200 room-nights for downtown
hotels and have a direct economic impact of $5million, according to
the convention bureau.
</P>
<P>
   To win the convention, Phoenix beat out two attractive
convention cities, Orlando and New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   A long list of corporate and government agencies lined up to
support the cause, including the convention bureau, Arizona Office
of Tourism and the Downtown Phoenix Partnership. The local sports
teams, Bank One, Wells Fargo, Bank of America, American Express and
Salt River Project also joined the effort. (beginitalic)The Arizona
Republic (enditalic)is a major sponsor, and other local radio and
television stations are involved.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did local leaders have to overcome the racial storm
clouds hanging over the state, but also the fact that NABJ
typically holds its conventions east of the Mississippi. It heads
for cities with large African-American populations like Chicago;
Washington, D.C.; and Philadelphia, not perceived backwaters like
Phoenix. Plus, it's very hot in August. But hoteliers, eager to
fill up their empty rooms, cut room rates for August
conventioneers.
</P>
<P>
   The credit for luring the group goes primarily to the Arizona
Association of Black Journalists. With the help of high-level
community leaders, such as City Councilman Cody Williams, the local
chapter managed to convince NABJ's board of directors in 1997 that
Arizona wasn't the Third World country many within the organization
perceived it to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``We generally don't like to go to places where there is
political divisiveness, where there is a sense that a community
doesn't want us,'' said William W. Sutton Jr., president of NABJ
and deputy managing editor at the (beginitalic)Raleigh News and
Observer (enditalic)in North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   The NABJ board viewed coming to Arizona as a chance to support
the local chapter's goal of improving newsroom diversity and news
coverage in the state, Sutton said.
</P>
<P>
   SOME NOT HAPPY
</P>
<P>
   Still, the decision to celebrate NABJ's silver anniversary in
Arizona hasn't sat well with some NABJ members. The board of
directors twice considered pulling the convention from Phoenix
after some members raised objections. A few, like Sidmel
Estes-Sumpter, viewed Phoenix as too remote for such a high-profile
event.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, I felt having a convention in the middle of the
desert wouldn't be that attractive to a lot of members,'' the
majority of whom live in the East, said Estes-Sumpter, an executive
producer at WAGA-TV in Atlanta and a former president of NABJ.
</P>
<P>
   Others had lingering concerns about the city's racial climate.
</P>
<P>
   ``After we won the business, there were a lot of journalists who
said, `How can we go to a state that doesn't celebrate the Martin
Luther King holiday,''' Mulzac-Frye said.
</P>
<P>
   Mecham, the man blamed for the King holiday controversy, was
unaware the Black journalists were coming to town.
</P>
<P>
   Retired and living in Glendale, Mecham said Arizona is as
colorblind a state as there is. He insists Arizona never had a
stigma as a racist state. Political enemies within the state used
the issue against him, he said, adding that his administration
``treated the Blacks very well.''
</P>
<P>
   Host committee co-chairwoman Mulzac-Frye said she focuses on
where Arizona is today, not where it was when the King holiday
issue was red hot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has gone much deeper than Ev Mecham,'' she said. ``The
issue awakened the consciousness of all these ethnic groups in
Arizona, including Anglos.''

 &HT;    IT'S THE DEMS' TURN(a) 
 &HT;    By JEFF BARKER(a) 
 &HT;    c.2000 The Arizona Republic(a) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Los Angeles - Democrats gather Monday for their national
convention as a party eagerly embracing the political center.
</P>
<P>
   As they prepare to anoint Al Gore as their presidential
candidate, the Democrats hope for a convention that is exciting but
not raucous, innovative but not threatening, progressive but not
radical.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, middle of the road.
</P>
<P>
   It may not sound sexy, but that's OK with the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   When they convened four years ago, many of the party's liberals
still were simmering over a welfare-reform bill signed by President
Clinton. The left-leaning wing said that the bill abandoned the
poor and that Clinton was too intent on appealing to voters at the
center of the spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   With the four-day 2000 convention about to open, the Democrats'
march toward the middle is nearly complete. This year, there is
less controversy, at least so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Clinton has moved our party to the center,'' said Mark
Fleisher, Arizona Democratic Party chairman.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still want to protect opportunity for everybody, but we
also expect responsibility from everybody, and that's the
difference. A lot of the old (welfare) programs created in the '70s
and '80s were taken advantage of by some people to line their
pockets instead of using the programs as a steppingstone, the way
they were designed.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's selection of Connecticut Sen. Joe Lieberman as his
running mate offered a clear signal about the party's direction. In
1995, Lieberman became chairman of the Democratic Leadership
Council, a think tank that has worked to give the party a moderate
identity. Among other programs, the DLC pushed for the work-based
welfare reform that was attacked from the left in 1996 for ending
the federal guarantee of welfare for all eligible mothers and
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the parties this year have chosen two people who
understand the need for appeal to the political center,'' said Doug
Wilson, the DLC's former national political director who led the
Clinton-Gore Arizona campaign in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Lieberman) epitomizes this appeal to the center without
abandoning traditional Democratic values, and that's the key,''
Wilson said. ``You can't have one without the other, otherwise it's
Republicanism.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, with both parties quieting their extremists, it's
sometimes hard to tell the difference between the two. Republicans
and Democrats alike have sought to claim credit for welfare reform,
and both parties stress ``compassion'' and ``responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, GOP nominee George W. Bush led a convention that
touted tolerance and inclusion. His speech was a radical departure
from Pat Buchanan's 1992 GOP convention address that suggested a
war for the ``soul'' of America.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess imitation is the sincerest form of flattery,'' said
Arizona Attorney General Janet Napolitano, who thinks Bush has been
borrowing this year from the Democratic playbook.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona state Rep. Ken Cheuvront agrees that Bush is co-opting
Democratic themes.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is ``DLC-lite,'' Cheuvront said. ``I think he was using lot
of the rhetoric, but his record in Texas is still Old Guard
Republican right.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheuvront says the DLC's moderate themes fit well in Arizona, a
state in which the Legislature and congressional delegation are
dominated by Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The average Arizona voter is socially progressive but fiscally
conservative, which is very much in line with the DLC message,''
Cheuvront said.
</P>
<P>
   Cheuvront will join Napolitano as a delegate. Napolitano will
lead the state contingent, along with U.S. Rep. Ed Pastor, D-Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   Cheuvront, who is openly gay, says many of the divisions of the
1996 Democratic convention have faded as the party has been
transformed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably the biggest struggle between some of the Old Guard
and the DLC is on free-trade issues,'' he said. Some in the party
have opposed Clinton administration-backed free-trade pacts, which
organized labor contends are sending American jobs overseas.
</P>
<P>
   But the Democratic convention won't be about highlighting
disagreement within the party. Rather, it will be about its
differences from the GOP, on everything from gun control to taxes.
Gore supports much broader gun control measures than does Bush, and
has said the GOP tax relief plan would threaten the future
viability of Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the last couple of months, it's the Democrats who have to
recapture ground that has been lost to the Republicans,'' Wilson
said.
</P>
<P>
   To do that, he said the party must define itself anew to the
American people.

<P>
   (Phoenix) - This week, the Democrats officially scratch Babe
Ruth from their starting lineup, leaving the team without a heavy
hitter and establishing themselves as the Red Sox of the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
   For eight years, Bill Clinton, the Backwoods Bambino, has batted
cleanup for the Democrats, swatting tape-measure home runs and
taking to the pitcher's mound whenever the team needed someone to
toss a shutout.
</P>
<P>
   For eight years, Clinton has astonished the opposition with his
playing skills, particularly his ability to keep from being thrown
out. At the same time, he drew thousands of new fans to the
political ballgame through his off-the-field antics. He was a bad
boy, like Ruth. Flawed, vain, occasionally stupid, unexplainably
reckless but - (beginitalic)man (enditalic)- could he play.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night, the Democrats will let Clinton step up to the
plate one last time at their convention in Los Angeles. For him,
it'll be like batting practice, a chance to hit a few long balls
for the home crowd.
</P>
<P>
   After that, the Sultan of Political Swat gets shuffled off the
stage and replaced in the batting order by a couple of
minor-leaguers named Al Gore and Joe Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   For the Democratic Party, it'll be like Boston in 1920, when Red
Sox owner Harry Frazee sold Babe Ruth to the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth was already the best hitter and one of the best pitchers in
baseball, as well as being what the (beginitalic)Boston Globe's
(enditalic)John J. Hallahan called ``the most colorful star in the
game today.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox let Ruth go and haven't won a World Series since, a
record the Democrats will equal or exceed by offering up candidates
like Gore and Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   This must be why the Republicans figured they didn't need a
cleanup hitter like John McCain, the Reggie Jackson of their team.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is the Republicans' best slugger and provides the most
entertaining locker room interviews. Still, they shipped him back
to their Triple-A farm team in Phoenix, figuring they can beat the
Democrats with a couple of Bush-leaguers of their own. And why not?
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Lieberman have yet to turn a double play on the
opposition, even with George W. Bush and Dick Cheney lugging tons
of baggage around the bases.
</P>
<P>
   At their convention earlier this month, the Republicans tried to
resurrect the memory of their own Lou Gehrig - Ronald Reagan - and
instead only reminded people how interesting their team used to be.
The Democrats, not wanting to make the same mistake, are hoping to
get Clinton out of town before Gore even arrives.
</P>
<P>
   Together, the political parties seem determined to take all the
color out of the election game, leaving fans to watch a dragged
out, dry-as-dust contest in which we can't tell (and don't care)
who's winning because all the players are wearing gray.
</P>
<P>
   That didn't happen with Clinton. His crazy eight years in office
will be remembered in a way the great Jimmy Cannon once wrote of
Ruth: ``He was a parade all by himself, a burst of dazzle and
jingle, Santa Claus drinking his whiskey straight and groaning with
a bellyache. {hellip} Babe Ruth made the music that his joyous
years danced to in a continuous party. ``
</P>
<P>
   For Democrats, for all of us, the party's over.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Surely it doesn't mean much politically, but, boy,
was Philadelphia a lot happier to see the Republicans than Los
Angeles appears to be to host the Democratic National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   Still, when Al Gore arrives here mid-week to accept his party's
presidential nomination, his problem won't lie with the reception
he can expect from La La Land.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest hurdle he faces is the reception he will receive not
only in the convention hall here but with the Democratic base vote
all over the country.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, he'll get lots of whoops and hollers when he comes before
the convention delegates here and he'll get many more along the
political road as he heads toward the November general election.
</P>
<P>
   But, there's your basically standard political whooping and
hollering and there's the truly passionate whooping and hollering.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, the vice president has inspired a lot more of the
basically standard kind than the truly passionate kind that's been
such sweet music to the political ears of Republican nominee George
W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   One super-obvious reason for this difference, of course, is the
horrendous longing most GOPers have to take over the White House _
an emotion and drive quite similar to that felt by the Democrats
when they rallied to elect Bill Clinton and his running mate Al
Gore eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, whose selection of Gore to be his vice-presidential
candidate, now is giving the Dem who would succeed him political
grief coming and going.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, eliminate the going. Clinton may be technically a lame
duck, but he's giving every appearance he'll have to be dragged
kicking and screaming from office _ no matter who follows him into
the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   And when you figure he and his wife, Hillary, are going to
dominate the opening day of the convention with their speeches
Monday and they each are having massive fund-raisers here _ he for
his presidential library, she for her New York Senate campaign _
Gore has every political right to be angry enough with Clinton to
denounce him.
</P>
<P>
   The veep, however, has designed his campaign in such a way he's
trying to make a political razor cut while walking a finer line
than any Clinton ever has.
</P>
<P>
   One slip, Gore obviously is convinced, and he'll cut his own
political throat, without scratching Clinton and never coming close
to nicking his GOP opponent Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Though not in very exact words, Gore essentially is telling
reporters in a series of pre-convention exclusive interviews that
he wants to campaign as part of a Clinton-Gore team that has
presided during eight years of a pretty swell economy while
severing any association with the president who admits an
inappropriate relationship with an 18-year-old White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of his own choice for a running mate, Connecticut Sen.
Joe Lieberman, Gore previewed his Thursday-night acceptance speech
for one newspaper by saying:
</P>
<P>
   ``The basic theme will be that we represent the new guard, in
sharp contrast to the efforts by the other side to take us back to
the old guard, whose approach did not allow the nation to flourish
and prosper when it was the guiding blueprint in the '80s and early
'90s.
</P>
<P>
   `` ... Our approach at our convention and in our platform and in
our plans for America's future is based not on the illusion of
inclusion, but the reality of diversity and harmony and the
commitment to one another.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Gore is not going to attack Clinton and has promised he
will avoid any personal attacks in his campaign against Bush, he
has honed himself an incredibly narrow political road to follow to
November.
</P>
<P>
   In this vein, he is going to have two opportunities to test his
balance this week.
</P>
<P>
   He is to appear with Clinton at an alleged passing of the
proverbial torch _ far from here, but still very much in the glare
of television lights and reporters' eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Then, of course, comes his Thursday-night acceptance speech.
This will not be a good crowd to slip before. By and large,
delegates to this Democratic convention have been in the position
of defending Clinton for so long, they'll not welcome any hint of
disdain for and discomfort with the president.
</P>
<P>
   As for personal attacks on Bush, it's always tough to scorn an
opponent's positions without offering at least some derision of
him.
</P>
<P>
   There are indications Los Angeles, current home of heat and
smog, may get more enthusiastic about welcoming the Democrats as
the time for the arrival of droves of delegates nears.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter how receptive La La Land winds up being to Gore,
he's still got two really tough crowds to crack if he wants to
smooth his road for the next couple of months. &QL;

 &HT;    WHY TEXAS' TOP DEMOCRAT, PETE LANEY, WON'T BE SEEN IN L.A.
 &HT;

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Texas House Speaker Pete Laney is hardly a virgin
in the wiles of partisan politics.
</P>
<P>
   Before he was first elected to the Legislature 28 years ago, he
was Hale County Democratic chairman. He runs for office every two
years on a partisan ballot.
</P>
<P>
   And last year, when state Rep. Tom Craddick, R-Midland, seemed
too enthusiastic about hastening the day when Laney would be
replaced by a Republican speaker, Laney bumped him from his
longtime tenure as chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee _
and replaced him with a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Laney also is Texas' highest-ranking Democratic officeholder and
the only member of his party left in a statewide leadership role.
</P>
<P>
   So, why isn't he attending the Democratic National Convention?
</P>
<P>
   To some people, that may sound like a pretty good question, but
there is a better one.
</P>
<P>
   Why should he?
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, Laney is being consistent. Aides say he has never
attended a Democratic National Convention because he doesn't like
to get involved in presidential politics.
</P>
<P>
   And this year the presidential race _ or at least being seen as
endorsing either major party candidate _ is near the top of Laney's
list of things to avoid, right under rabies and the bubonic plague.
</P>
<P>
   Laney is too much of a Democrat to openly endorse Gov. George W.
Bush for the White House, but not partisan enough to join the
Bush-bashing fest in Los Angeles. Laney and Bush have worked too
well together
</P>
<P>
   Laney is doubtlessly more conservative than many of Texas'
Democratic convention delegates. But as a lawmaker who has seen the
steady rise of Republican influence in Texas, he is probably more
pragmatic than anything else.
</P>
<P>
   Republican legislators helped elect him speaker over another
Democratic contender in 1993, and he has consistently rewarded
Republicans with House leadership positions.
</P>
<P>
   Although Laney gave Craddick the boot last year, he appointed
other Republicans to chair 11 of the House's 35 standing
committees.
</P>
<P>
   Right-wing Republican leaders, mostly outside the Legislature,
have attacked Laney for being partisan. But Laney has drawn nothing
but praise from Bush, and with good reason. Laney and the late Lt.
Gov. Bob Bullock were instrumental in helping Bush win the
legislative victories that Bush has been bragging about all over
the country.
</P>
<P>
   Civil justice changes, juvenile justice reform, education
improvements and changes in the welfare system _ all Bush
priorities _ were made possible by a bipartisan effort in the Texas
Legislature, the type of lawmaking that Bush says he wants to
export to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   If the truth be known, Laney probably dislikes the attacks that
Vice President Al Gore and other Democrats have waged on Texas'
record, which Laney and other Democratic legislators have had major
roles in compiling.
</P>
<P>
   Laney skated on the edge of the presidential race last month in
Chicago, where he gave Bush a strong, favorable introduction to the
National Conference of State Legislatures. Laney praised Bush for
his ability to work with legislators from both parties but stopped
short of endorsing him for president.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democratic legislators in Texas probably will vote for
Bush. State Rep. Rob Junell, D-San Angelo, Laney's hand-picked
chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, has endorsed and
campaigned for the governor.
</P>
<P>
   Laney's priority for this election year is protecting a thin,
78-72 Democratic majority in the Texas House, which is significant
for a couple of reasons.
</P>
<P>
   One, a Republican takeover could cost him his speakership. And,
two, partisan control of the House will be crucial in next year's
session, when legislators will reapportion legislative and
congressional districts to reflect population changes recorded in
the 2000 Census.
</P>
<P>
   Redistricting will affect elections and the partisan lineup in
the Texas Legislature and the U.S. Congress for the next 10 years.
It is the most partisan business that the Legislature conducts, and
if he is still speaker next year, Laney may need some of that
partisanship he is saving up this summer.

   LONG BEACH, Calif. _ We interrupt the rush to the Democratic
National Convention to bring you a report from the netherworld of
American politics.
</P>
<P>
   In this funky oceanside metropolis due south of Los Angeles, Pat
Buchanan has been busy performing two praiseworthy tasks. He is
further marginalizing his own relevance to the current presidential
campaign (as well, one can only hope, to future ones), and he is
completing the drive of the Reform Party, that devil spawn of Ross
Perot, into the ditch.
</P>
<P>
   It's been the best day's work for a destructive force in these
parts since the Long Beach earthquake of 1933. And unlike that
event, no one has died _ although there has been pushing, shoving
and a hammerlock or two.
</P>
<P>
   To the delight of absurdists everywhere, the Reform mavens have
been assembled here for a national nominating convention amid other
quirky historic relics such as the immobilized liner Queen Mary.
It's been a co-production of P.T. Barnum and the Marquis de Sade.
</P>
<P>
   Actually make that sessions, plural, as the divide between the
Buchanan cadres and the anyone-but-Buchanan folks has riven the
party, sending the Perot (you should pardon the expression)
``regulars'' into rump session.
</P>
<P>
   High principles _ fairness, honesty, loyalty _ have been
invoked. But, not to be too cynical, it looks mostly like a fight
over the $12.6 million in federal funds (from the income tax
check-offs) that can be claimed by the ``real'' Reform nominee.
That person is in line for the cash because of Perot's 8 percent
showing in the 1996 presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   With any luck, the Federal Election Commission will flip a coin,
it will land on its edge and the money will go back into the kitty.
More likely the two sides eventually are headed, where else, to
court. Unrecoverable, it seems, is the $2.5 the feds have already
forked over for the convention.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan is now at about 1 percent in national polling, and 5
percent is needed in the November election to trigger any federal
money in 2004. So our long national nightmare may soon be over.
</P>
<P>
   Arrayed against Buchanan is an unlikely confederation _ faithful
Perotistas who in their bid to thwart Pat have lined up with (you
better be sitting down) John Hagelin of the Natural Law Party
(whose motto could be: Levitators R Us). Hagelin is a physics
professor at the Maharishi University of Management (if you get my
drift).
</P>
<P>
   This all started last year when Perot made welcoming noises to
Buchanan who bolted the Republican Party as his third bid for its
presidential nomination was sinking quick. All who have watched
Perot toy with the desires of anyone seeking to take up his Reform
Party mantel (especially former Colorado Gov. Dick Lamm, a one-time
Democrat, in 1996) knew it wouldn't work.
</P>
<P>
   But Buchanan wasn't taking no for an answer. With the Perot
party moribund in many states, Buchanan roused just a handful of
folks from his old supporters lists and began to take over a number
of local Reform organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-Buchanan side accuses the erstwhile
columnist-commentator of what amounts to political necrophilia.
</P>
<P>
   ``You bunch of zombies, go follow Pat Buchanan,'' Florida Reform
Party activist Tony Hernandez hollered at one moment of hallway
drama. ``We built it, you stole it. We will not go quietly.''
</P>
<P>
   Whereupon, of course, they left, if not exactly quietly, to hold
their separate session.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The best thing that can be said of the meetings - and it was
argued to me seriously by partisans from both sides - is that these
sessions were not the scripted, sanitized offerings of the
Republicans in Philadelphia two weeks ago or what's on tap from the
Democrats in La-La-Land beginning Monday.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Under Perot, the Reform Party had a straightforward (if
misguided) message of economic nationalism: anti-NAFTA, anti-WTO,
anti-immigration. On those points, Buchanan was a decent fit. But
the Reform Party had said zilch about the social issues
(anti-abortion, anti-gay rights) that have always played a big role
in fueling whatever limited appeal Buchanan achieved.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan said he did not insist on making those views part of
the Reform Party platform, but then again, he didn't have to. He
put out a statement of his ``personal beliefs'' just in case anyone
had forgotten them.
</P>
<P>
   I'll give you one of the key lines (``Social and moral decline
and cultural decadence go hand in hand with the death of republics
and the end of empires.``) and you can probably fill in the rest.
Be sure to include, as Pat did, Rome and Weimar.
</P>
<P>
   It's so easy to make fun of these people, but just because it's
easy doesn't mean it's wrong. A national reporter following the
Reform Party saga, shook his head and said: ``I cover mutants,
misfits and the maladjusted.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Russell Verney, a Perot lieutenant in founding the party
eight years ago, could see the gallows humor in watching Buchanan
and the Reformers march off into the sunset together.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm only manning the Kool-Aid stand,'' Verney said.

AS THEY STRUGGLE TO SPEAK HIS NAME &HT;    BY JOHN DIAZ

<TEXT>
LOS ANGELES _Which is most perilous to a politician: to embrace
President Clinton too enthusiastically or to attack him too
harshly?
<P>
   To judge from Campaign 2000, either option is, to borrow a
phrase, an unduly risky scheme.
</P>
<P>
   How else to explain the almost painstaking avoidance of the
words ``Bill Clinton'' by both Republicans and Democrats in the
spotlight these days.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, sure, Republicans on the podium in Philadelphia made plenty
of references to the need for ``character'' and ``dignity'' in the
White House. The Democrats gathering at Staples Center this week
will not let Americans forget that the ``policies of the last eight
years'' have produced peace and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   Still, George W. Bush delivered an hourlong acceptance speech
without
once mentioning the president by name. Al Gore and his Democratic
running mate Joseph Lieberman spoke for a combined 50 minutes at
their Nashville, Tenn., announcement event last Tuesday. Their
C-word count: Zero.
</P>
<P>
   It's almost surreal, considering the passions generated during
the impeachment process just a year and a half ago. No one seems to
want to really run with or against the legacy of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Except, of course, Clinton himself. Clinton can always be
counted on to do what is best for Clinton. Compromise, apologize,
triangulate, lie under oath, retreat, apologize even harder _
whatever it takes. Follow him or try to block him at your peril.
Who is more frustrated today: Mike McCurry,
George Stephanopoulos, Gore and all the other Clinton insiders who
put their reputations and careers on the line to defend him? Or
Newt Gingrich, Bob Livingston, Tom DeLay, Henry Hyde and all the
Republicans who thought for sure they were about to finish him off
politically?
</P>
<P>
   No wonder both sides are keeping their distance.
</P>
<P>
   This week's convention is a perfect example of Clinton's self
absorption. One would think he might feel the pain of Gore and all
those Democratic members of Congress who trouped out to the White
House lawn on that dark December day to stand behind him after he
was impeached. The Democrats are now in serious danger of losing
control of the White House and both houses of Congress for the
first time since 1952. So what is the biggest fund-raising event of
all in Los Angeles, the one with the big
stars and big money?
</P>
<P>
   Why, it's a brunch at Barbara Streisand's Malibu compound to
raise $10 million for the Clinton Library, of course.
</P>
<P>
   It will be interesting to see how Clinton will interpret history
in that Little Rock library. Will there be a replica of the Lincoln
Bedroom, with a kiosk explaining how the Clinton presidency
perfected the art of the soft-money deal? Will visitors in headsets
hear tapes of his evasive depositions as they view models of the
Oval Office?
</P>
<P>
   There will be plenty of positives to highlight in that library,
as Clinton himself surely will remind us in his prime-time speech
tonight. His timing was perfect, his instincts impressive, in
myriad ways. He came into office as the end of the Cold War
lightened the demand on defense spending, and created the climate
for a commitment to balanced budgets. He broke from party orthodoxy
to agree to welfare reform just as the economy was booming enough
to cushion its effects. He had a knack for knowing when to turn on
his interpersonal skills, and when to use the bully pulpit to
summon the pressure of public opinion.
</P>
<P>
   He continues to dominate the political scene, even when his name
is not spoken. Yet there is remarkably little afterglow for
Democrats, no percentage in hatred for Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't like it, don't plan a vacation in Little Rock,
where the library will someday soon be the No. 1 destination. He
will be unrepentant and unindicted, but oddly unrevered, despite
his shopping list of accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our current president embodied the potential of a
generation,'' Bush said in his Philadelphia acceptance speech. ``So
many talents. So much charm. Such great skill. But, in the end, to
what end?
</P>
<P>
   ``So much promise, to no great purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush is right about a president he cannot bring himself to
criticize without adding a concession of admiration.
</P>
<P>
   And many Democrats here must agree with those words _ albeit for
very different reasons _ about a president they cannot bring
themselves to praise without an obligatory expression of
condemnation about his personal failings.
</P>
<P>
   Even if they will not admit to their uneasiness.
</P>
<P>
   As they struggle to speak his name.

 &HT;    Madam President?
 &HT;    By Jill Vejnoska
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ That's next, ``Vice President Ken''?
</P>
<P>
   The joking perhaps was inevitable when the nonprofit group the
White House Project teamed up recently with Mattel and Girls' Inc.
to launch a President Barbie doll. With a politically correct
helmet of hair seemingly able to withstand nuclear war and an
unintentionally funny advisory on the back of her box _ ``Podium
not included. Doll cannot stand alone'' _ this Leader of the Free
(Doll) World could be viewed in a humorous light.
</P>
<P>
   But only if that's what you're looking for.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew you have to start with what exists,'' explained Marie
Wilson, president of The White House Project, which aims to
``change the political climate'' so women can mount successful
campaigns for U.S. president and other high offices. ``What exists
is eight Barbies in every little girl's bedroom. She's not a
throwback to them, she's serious.''
</P>
<P>
   So are a lot of people these days when the subject turns to a
woman's chance of becoming president. Women were heavily
represented among delegates and speakers at the Republican
convention in Philadelphia two weeks ago, as they will be at the
Democratic gathering beginning Monday in Los Angeles; and both
George W. Bush and Al Gore reportedly included a woman on their
``short list'' of potential running mates.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it's been 16 years since Democratic presidential nominee
Walter Mondale made New York Congresswoman Geraldine Ferraro the
first _ and only _ female candidate for vice president. Since then,
the only woman to contend for the top spot on either major party's
ticket, former Republican Cabinet member Elizabeth Dole, couldn't
muster enough money or support to stay in the race through the
first primary.
</P>
<P>
   Ferraro is surprised no other woman has joined her in the
history books as a major party's nominee for president or vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think it would be this long,'' Ferraro said last week
from the Virginia offices of her employment consulting firm, where
she was also preparing to be a Fox News commentator on the
Democratic convention. ``I don't find it disheartening. But I do
feel we need more women than we have in the Senate and the
governors' mansions, and that's disheartening.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happened to the idea of Madam President? That's the
question being pondered by political observers everywhere who, like
Ferraro, are somewhat bewildered by the fact that one ultimately
unsuccessful run at No. 2 is all American women have to show in the
year 2000. It's even the focus of a new book _ ``Madam President:
Shattering the Last Glass Ceiling'' _ in which co-authors Eleanor
Clift and Tom Brazaitis come to this conclusion:
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be a woman president of the United States. When?
Soon.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, nearly anyone asked predicts a woman president will
happen _ eventually _ but that's pretty much the only point of
agreement among them.
</P>
<P>
   There are those who express cautious optimism _ ``I think a
woman is going to pop up at the right time and be a really viable
candidate,'' said Georgia insurance consumer's advocate Cathey
Steinberg, who represented DeKalb County as a Democrat in the state
Legislature for 14 years and lost a close congressional race to
U.S. Rep. John Linder in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   'GLASS CEILING IS STILL THERE'
</P>
<P>
   Others contain a certain amount of pessimism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone always talks about the glass ceiling,'' said Matt
Towery, the author of ``Powerchicks: How Women Will Dominate
America'' and a former Republican lieutenant governor candidate and
Georgia state representative. ``The glass ceiling is still there.
There just needs to be a bubbling up that will cause it to shatter.
What I didn't realize was how long it was going to take.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there are those who sound downright ticked off by the
whole thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's something very sad about us still having this
deep-seated ambivalence about power in the hands of women,'' said
(presidential historian) Carl Anthony, pointing out that Turkey,
Pakistan, Ireland and other nations where women have far fewer
rights than their American counterparts all have elected female
presidents or prime ministers. ``This is sort of mind-boggling. It
throws all the statistics out the window and puts it on an
emotional and irrational basis.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially since, when it comes to presidential elections these
days, women seem to do everything except actually take the oath of
office. Bush's campaign press secretary and Gore's campaign manager
both are female, and the two men rely heavily on their wives for
everything from making convention speeches (Laura Bush, notably,
told the GOP delegates she hoped there'd be a female president
someday) to helping them pick a running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there are some who say that the country has squandered
valuable time by focusing more on first ladies instead of potential
female presidents. Yet there's nothing new about first ladies
playing an active role in their husbands' campaigns or
administrations, nor about intense media and public scrutiny of
them, according to Anthony, author of ``First Ladies: The Saga of
the Presidents' Wives and Their Power, 1789 to 1990.''
</P>
<P>
   What is a more recent development is the first lady who's been
highly educated and a career woman _ and who isn't afraid to talk
about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going through a sea change,'' said Anthony. ``That's not
to say that, like, in 24 years we might not have a stay-at-home
presidential spouse. But generally speaking, we will be seeing more
and more women who have had careers in the White House. That could
get us more used to the idea'' of a woman president.
</P>
<P>
   BATTLING COMPETING MYTHS
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, from ``Gender Gap'' voters in 1992 to ``Soccer Moms''
in 1996, women are credited with providing the margin of decision
in the last two presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, say people like Towery, that means a woman
should have been running for vice president this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expected both parties to pay more attention to potential
female candidates this year,'' said Towery, who thinks neither Bush
nor Gore was ever really that serious about plucking Dole or New
Hampshire Gov. Jeanne Shaheen off their respective short lists. ``I
don't think either party made the effort.''
</P>
<P>
   But getting serious consideration for vice president _ still one
of the most direct paths to the Oval Office _ isn't all women
would-be presidents have to contend with.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a myth to say that there are no qualified women,'' said
Stacy Cordery, a Monmouth (Ill.) College associate history
professor who's writing separate biographies of President Theodore
Roosevelt and his daughter, the legendary Washington political and
social figure Alice Roosevelt Longworth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women run up against circular logic and competing arguments,''
continued Cordery, such as that they're ``too weak'' to make tough
decisions like sending troops to war. ``But women who are strong
enough to be president are `too strong,' `strident,' `manly.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Numbers also work against them, said the White House Project's
Wilson. Fewer women contending for president or other high offices
means more likelihood the press and public will focus on something
other than the issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``One woman becomes about gender,'' said Wilson, recalling news
stories about Dole's short-lived presidential campaign that focused
heavily on the color of her outfit. ``Two becomes a catfight. With
three, four or five, you can finally get to discussing agendas.''
</P>
<P>
   RAISE WOMEN'S POLITICAL PROFILE
</P>
<P>
   Wilson says the solution lies in everything from increasing the
numbers of and awareness about women candidates at every level to
saturating the popular culture with images such as Glenn Close as
the highly competent vice president in the film ``Air Force One.''
Or, yes, bombarding little girls' bedrooms with ``President
Barbie,'' available in a multicultural array.
</P>
<P>
   Others say it's a matter of putting more women in positions that
are considered traditional presidential springboards. In a country
that's 52 percent female, only three governors and nine U.S.
senators are women. As those numbers increase, Ferraro said, so
will the chance that more women will plunge into presidential
politics and be taken seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to look for them in the statehouse and the Senate,''
said Ferraro, who twice lost tough New York Democratic Senate
primaries. ``Remember the universe from which credible presidential
candidates come. If you look at the Republican side this year, the
only credible candidates who emerged were in governor's offices or
Senate seats.''
</P>
<P>
   Except for Dole. She had the background and the guts to get into
the race, Ferraro said. Unfortunately, she also had the Texas
juggernaut to contend with.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really do think if Elizabeth Dole hadn't run into George W.
Bush's political swallowing of the entire Republican part of the
government and his formidable fund-raising abilities, she was a
very credible candidate,'' Ferraro said. ``I don't think you need
anything more than that if you're a woman candidate. If you have
the opportunity to run, run!''

   It's a lot for taxpayers to think about. Or it will be if our
elected leaders ever get together enough to finally approve
something.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a lot of Americans not only want to understand any
new provisions but to begin updating their family's financial
plans.
</P>
<P>
   What can a conscientious taxpayer do now?
</P>
<P>
   The answer from experts is: Stay cool. ``I'm telling clients to
sit tight, to wait and see what becomes law,'' said Jeff Scroggin,
a Roswell attorney with experience in estate planning. ``If
something does, we'll deal with it.''
</P>
<P>
   The election could change the game considerably next year. If a
Republican is in the White House and Republicans dominate both
House and Senate, passage of extensive tax breaks would be more
likely.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans say they will try to override President Clinton's
veto of the marriage tax bill this fall.
</P>
<P>
   If Democrats get a win in the House, Senate or White House, then
political compromises may be more likely.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing we don't want is for people to get complacent and
not do any estate planning because of all the talk,'' said James
Brennan, a manager in KPMG's personal financial planning group in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a quick look at the current legislation:
</P>
<P>
   _ Marriage penalty. The vetoed bill would give tax breaks to
married couples, with the stated aim of ending the ``marriage
penalty'' in current law.
</P>
<P>
   _ Estate tax. The bill would phase out taxes on large
inheritances over the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   _ Retirement accounts. Approved by the House of Representatives,
the bill would gradually increase the annual limit on IRA
contributions from $2,000 to $5,000. The limit on employee
contributions to 401(k) accounts would go up from $10,500 now to
$15,000 in 2005.
</P>
<P>
   _ Social Security. The House also has approved a bill that would
give tax relief to middle- and upper-income Social Security
recipients.

 &HT;    Modifications in tax law still in talking stage
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There's been much ado about tax reform this year. The
marriage tax bill has been vetoed. Estate tax repeal hasn't gotten
its veto yet.
</P>
<P>
   This election year has also produced legislation, still in
Congress, that would allow bigger retirement plan contributions and
cut taxes on Social Security benefits.
</P>
<P>
   It's a lot for taxpayers to think about. Or it will be if our

 &HT;    Classical community tuning up for turn on Web's world stage
 &HT;    By Pierre Ruhe
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Almost everything you read about Napster, the
embattled software program that allows users to trade music over
the Internet, concerns the vibrant, commerce-driven world of pop
music. Napster has grown into a national fad by offering free tunes
and a sense of community for a youthful, computer-savvy crowd _
underscored by the rebellious thrill of ripping off major
corporations.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the profile of the typical classical music fan.
While a smattering of pieces by Bach and Brahms, Stravinsky and
Steve Reich are available on Napster, downloaded music has thus far
had a negligible effect on classical recordings.
</P>
<P>
   Frustratingly, it takes far longer to download a piece than it
takes to hear it. With a standard 56K modem, it takes about four
minutes to download one minute of music. Thus, the system is better
equipped to grab Eminem's ``Kill You'' (4 1/2 minutes) than
Mahler's Symphony No. 2 (80 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, the Internet is woefully inconvenient for listening
to classical music,'' says Bill Rosenblatt, president of
GiantSteps, a media consulting firm in New York. ``It can take more
than four hours to get Beethoven's Ninth Symphony off the Web. In
that time you could drive to a record store, buy it, come home and
listen to the whole thing. Plus, you'd have the CD on your shelf,
with pictures and liner notes.''
</P>
<P>
   So the industry is awaiting broad access to the utopia called
broadband, which promises to fly at least an order of magnitude
faster. High-speed transmission is available now, although it's
expensive and still relatively uncommon. Yet when most houses in
America are broadband connected, the experts speculate, it'll
change how all recorded music is heard.
</P>
<P>
   The impact of free music and fear of the imminent demise of the
CD has been a staggering blow to the major record companies,
including Sony, EMI, Universal and BMG _ all of which have a
classical division loaded with rich back catalogs.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, these companies' e-commerce plans seemingly
consisted of suing Napster and another dot-com, MP3, which runs a
compression program that turns music from compact discs into small,
manageable computer files that can then be virtually swapped, one
song at a time.
</P>
<P>
   An appeals court is to rule in September on whether Napster has
violated copyright law and should be shut down. Yet, even if
Napster goes under, similar services _ many of which exist in the
unregulated ether of the Web _ will keep music piracy afloat.
</P>
<P>
   Now the major labels have launched plans to collect for
downloading their product. Last week, EMI announced plans to charge
full CD prices ($16.99) per album; Universal, the world's largest
record label, will soon charge $2 per song to download. A lot of
customers might wonder why bother with an expensive toll road if
it's no quicker, no more scenic, than the service lane.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet has created a mind-set that content is free,''
says Rosenblatt, ``and the longer this goes on, the more reluctant
people will be to pay. Only when the technology for paying becomes
transparently easy, then perhaps, maybe, people won't mind paying.
It should be as easy as making a long-distance phone call _ you
don't have to worry about the cost till later.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people are happy to be moral, so long as it's not
inconvenient.''
</P>
<P>
   Major players in the classical music community have been slower
to react, although administrators from orchestras around the
country have gotten together to calm their collective anxieties and
consider their options.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta Symphony Orchestra is among the ensembles to have
signed on to what's touted as the Electronic Media Forum, which is
effectively a set of guidelines for each orchestra to develop a
unique path onto the Internet. The agreement was ratified in June
by the American Federation of Musicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``A subscriber said to me, `Wouldn't it be nice to hear a
concert one night and order a recording of it from the Web the next
day?' '' says ASO President Allison Vulgamore. ``Yeah, that would
be great, and that's one possibility. But right now the quality
hasn't caught up with the novelty.''
</P>
<P>
   The Philadelphia Orchestra sees the Internet, in effect, as a
marketing tool, not an end in itself. Joseph Kluger, the
orchestra's president, notes that, ``Our primary goal with
technology is to ensure the success of the live concert experience.
Hearing what we do live in the concert hall gives you goose bumps
and a level of excitement that you just can't get from
technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to services like Napster, the Internet has been described
as an equal-opportunity jukebox, where garage bands and
chart-topping stars share the same access to the public. Yet would
an esteemed ensemble like the Philadelphia Orchestra, one of the
oldest and most artistically refined in the world, dilute its
cachet if listed next to some Poughkeepsie Philharmonic on an
alphabetical list? These are very real issues an orchestra would
like to resolve before it's left to the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   So Philadelphia is taking the lead, with help from Online
Entertainment Network, a site partially owned by EMI.
</P>
<P>
   The orchestra will broadcast a live concert Thursday, touted as
the first pay-per-listen classical music event on the Internet. The
live netcast will cost $2. The star of the show will be violinist
Itzhak Perlman, who's one of EMI's best-selling artists.
</P>
<P>
   It's clear that orchestral administrators are forced to navigate
an unfamiliar field. The creative solutions they find might well
steer us into exciting and perhaps reinvigorating times for
orchestras.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most popular sites to download music without charge
are www.napster.com and www.gnutella.wego.com. To read the Internet
agreement between orchestras and musicians, go to www.icsom.org.
The Philadelphia Orchestra's Web site is www .philorch.org.

DUTCHMAN'S PIPE A ROOT-HARDY VINE 
(WITH PHOTO)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY HUBER 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: Have you ever heard of a plant called giant Dutchman's pipe?
It is a vine from Brazil with huge, dinner-plate-size flowers that
have a sweet smell that attracts flies, which the plant eats, much
as a pitcher plant catches its prey. The flowers are speckled red.
On TV, where I saw the plant, they said its scientific name was
something like Aristolochia gigantica, but I am unsure if I got it
down correctly. Do you know how I could get one? I am considering
planting the vine on a trellis all over my back fence at the new
house. _ T.L., Houston
</P>
<P>
   A: The extraordinary flower of the Dutchman's pipe vine
(Aristolochia giganea) begins as an odd, curled, C-shaped green
bud. As the bud enlarges, it begins to resemble a Dutchman's pipe.
A maroon/liver-brown saclike growth emerges and enlarges like a
balloon being gently filled with air. This soft pillow opens to
reveal a startling bloom, several inches deep and wide, with a
mottled face and a yellow mouth.
</P>
<P>
   The Dutchman's pipe is a root-hardy vine here, preferring life
on a fence or trellis with its heart-shaped foliage receiving sun
or part sun. A fertile, well-draining soil should help ensure
cycles of blooms spring to fall.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone would say the flowers' fragrance is sweet. The odor
does attract flies needed to pollinate the blooms. When a fly comes
to a flower, it is trapped in the oddly shaped bloom until
pollination occurs. Then the anthers and stigmas wither, and the
fly is released.
</P>
<P>
   The Dutchman's pipe is occasionally found in local nurseries.
Ask your nurseryman about supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am interested in starting new esperanza (Tecoma stans `Gold
Star') plants. I tried seeds, but nothing developed. _ D.C.,
Channelview, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: Gardeners who want to encourage more flowering cycles are
encouraged to snip the long, narrow green pods that follow the
yellow esperanza blooms. However, you can leave a few pods on the
plant until they lose their green color, then harvest and separate
seeds from the pods. Sow the fresh seeds in containers of moist but
well-draining, light, loose soil. Press the seeds into the medium,
barely covering. Germination can occur in a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Or take semi-hardwood cuttings now through fall. Take 4-inch
cuttings that are woody toward the base and about pencil-size in
diameter. Dip the cut end into rooting hormone and insert into the
growing medium. Protect from cold weather.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When we bought our home, we inherited several rain lilies in
our small garden. We have no idea how to care for them. They have
been blooming and appear to be healthy. Do we remove the tips from
the plants after they have bloomed? Do we cut the stem back or just
leave them alone? How much fertilizer do they require, and how long
will they bloom under normal conditions? _ F.G., Pearland, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: Rain lilies are small members of the amaryllis family that
naturalize easily in upper Gulf Coast area gardens. The crocuslike
blooms appear several times in mid- to late summer and fall,
especially after a rain. Some gardeners plant the bulbs, which will
grow 6- to 8-inch grasslike foliage, in liriope or monkey grass
borders or in sedum. Others mass them to create a small-scale
ground cover or plant them at the base of shrubs. Rain lilies come
in pink, white or yellow and are ideal in containers.
</P>
<P>
   Rain lilies prefer sun to part sun and a light, fertile soil.
They take little care. I just give ours a good drink every now and
then in an effort to jump-start a bloom or two. But nothing works,
of course, like the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   We grow rain lilies from the genera Zephyranthes and Habranthus.
Z. candida, a six-petaled white flower, is a roadside wildflower
that accepts most any kind of garden _ from sand to gumbo. Fall
rain makes this bulb shine. The foliage is upright and tapered. Z.
grandiflora has 3-inch rose-colored blooms and is at its best in
organically enriched soil. The smaller Z. rosea is a deep rose. Z.
citrina, a yellow rain lily, is often sold as Z. sulfurea.
</P>
<P>
   H. robustus is a lavender-pink rain lily on the same scale as Z.
grandiflora, but the flowers face outward like its relative, the
amaryllis.
</P>
<P>
   Cooperia rain lilies open their flowers as day fades to attract
pollinating night-flying moths. The familiar, small white Cooperia
drummondii (also known as Z. chlorosolen) is found throughout
Texas. The similar but more striking Z. drummondii (sometimes known
as C. pedunculata) is a white rain lily that ages to pink and is
commonly called the Hill Country rain lily.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a seeding species, you can remove spent blooms
before they go to seed; or you can allow seed pods to form, let
these ripen on the plant, then harvest and sow elsewhere. Water
rain lilies during long, dry spells. Occasionally improve the soil
with a little compost. Otherwise, I'd just let the little plants
be.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I was given an ``alligator plant'' and was assured I would
not be able to kill it with my brown thumb and that it would
proliferate. It is an interesting plant with serrated leaves that
have tiny pups on the tips of the leaves. The pups drop off and
easily root wherever they fall.
</P>
<P>
   I read somewhere that a plant called ``alligatorweed'' has been
choking some waterways and am concerned that this may be what I
have. I don't want to spread an invasive plant. Do you have any
idea what this plant is? _ S.D., Houston
</P>
<P>
   A: I believe you have Kalanchoe daigremontiana (syn. Bryophyllum
daigremontianum), a succulent with elongated triangular leaves that
are a shiny green on top and have purple splotches on the
undersides. The serrated leaves curl inward, and tiny plantlets
develop along the edges of the leaves. These, as you say, drop and
easily root. Another common name for this kalanchoe is devil's
backbone.
</P>
<P>
   Your plant is not the invasive alligatorweed (Alternanthera
philoxeroides) that is clogging waterways with dense mats with
long, branched and hollow stems. The stems have two leaves opposite
each other, and white flowers grow from the axils of the leaves.
Although alligatorweed grows in water, it also can grow on land. I
understand a biological control, the alligatorweed flea beetle, is
the primary source of control in Texas. This beetle apparently has
been effective across the country, because ``invaded'' acreage has
declined.

   The next best thing
</P>
<P>
   On land, Shannon Lucid is a national space icon.
</P>
<P>
   Underwater, she's just another astronaut trying to pass her
final exam.
</P>
<P>
   While Lucid has earned high marks in space for setting a world's
record for continuous space flight as a woman, she has never walked
in space.
</P>
<P>
   At age 57, she still hopes for a space walk. So on this day, she
is about to go underwater for six hours to prove she can master
generic EVA skills.
</P>
<P>
   Her partner for the day, astronaut Dan Tani, 39, hasn't made it
into space. But he has been underwater at the NBL close to 20
times, which only increases his anticipation for a space mission.
</P>
<P>
   He and Lucid will undergo a grueling test _ replacing broken
parts on a full-size model of a 300-foot-long section of the space
station's truss.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to stay out of trouble and fix more than we break,''
Tani jokes.
</P>
<P>
   ``A six-hour run is tough,'' he admits. ``You're usually hungry
when you get out. But the best part for me is the people who help
you. It's like being king for a day.''
</P>
<P>
   Like royalty, the astronauts have dressers. The oversized
spacesuits weigh 250 pounds and are so bulky that it takes a team
of people to suit up the astronauts.
</P>
<P>
   All the pieces of the suit _ boots, lower torso assembly, hard
upper torso, arm assemblies, gloves, helmet _ are laid out near the
pool. With a lot of help and a little pulling and tugging, the
astronauts are outfitted piece by piece in the pressurized
spacesuits. At the end, each looks a bit like the Michelin man.
</P>
<P>
   The suits are similar to those worn in space, except they don't
last as long on Earth, says Louis Carfagno, spacesuit engineer for
United Space Alliance, a private contractor that makes and
maintains the spacesuits.
</P>
<P>
   He explains that suits are rebuilt for every 40 hours spent in
the water; the same suits last for 56 hours in space before needing
an overhaul.
</P>
<P>
   Before sending them under, workers strap a tool belt and a
tether onto each astronaut. The tether is used to latch onto the
mock-up. Without something to latch onto, it's virtually impossible
to work in a weightless environment.
</P>
<P>
   Divers also take two big tool boxes into the water. In all, more
than 300 tools will go down for the four astronauts. Lucid and Tana
will use 130; Wisoff and Lopez-Alegria will use more than 200.
</P>
<P>
   Although some of the tools are made out of different materials
than those used in space, they are all very ``flight-like, '' tool
technician Ron Buckley says.
</P>
<P>
   Once underwater, spacesuits are adjusted to achieve ``neutral
buoyancy,'' the delicate balance between sinking and floating.
During the ``weigh out,'' which takes about five to 10 minutes,
music is piped in through the sound system.
</P>
<P>
   Lucid and Tani are ``weighed out'' to the sounds of steel drum
music. Wisoff and Lopez-Algeria _ who will go on a spacee mission
in October _ listen to the theme from the television show, ``Lost
in Space.''
</P>
<P>
   Once in the water, the work begins for both astronaut teams.
Maneuvering in such a weightless environment can be tricky. Even
tiny movements can be exhausting.
</P>
<P>
   During repairs, everything must be clamped in place _ including
the body _ before the job can start. All the while, the view
through the space helmet is distorted, like looking through a
fish-eye lens.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, there's a sense of wonder and enchantment about being there
that's difficult to explain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to describe if you've never done it before,''
Lopez-Alegria says. ``The first time I did it, it was really a
magical feeling. It's like driving a car for the first time or
doing anything for the first time. It's like floating. It is
floating. It's pretty special.''
</P>
<P>
   There IS a difference
</P>
<P>
   Even though the underwater training mimics outer space, it's not
the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   Water offers resistance, and its viscosity creates drag. That
doesn't happen in space.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the difference between running through mud with
boots on versus ice skating,'' explains Michael Gernhardt, a
veteran of three missions who has logged nearly seven hours of
space walks.
</P>
<P>
   ``In space, you have to go lightly with the touch because
between you and the suit, there's 500 pounds. You get that mass
moving and it can be hard to stop it.''
</P>
<P>
   The suit also feels a little different. In space, the primary
life-support system is contained in a pack on the back of the
spacesuit. In the water, a long umbilical cord supplies cooling
water and specially blended oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   While being ``neutrally buoyant'' approximates zero gravity, it
doesn't achieve it. When an astronaut is upside down in the pool _
a lot of the training takes place that way because of the
configuration of the mock-up _ blood still rushes to the head.
</P>
<P>
   To get a better feel for what it is like in space, astronauts
fly in the KC-135 Weightless Flight Simulator, more commonly known
as the ``vomit comet.'' But they can experience weightlessness for
only about 20 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   They also train at the Virtual Reality Simulation Facility in
another NASA building.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing beats the hours spent in the NBL, Gernhardt says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here, you can get all the geometry and choreography worked
out,'' he says. ``Quite frankly, we couldn't do the EVAs without
this kind of facility.''
</P>
<P>
   Uttley says the feeling is mutual among the divers, test
directors and other people who work there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody here is excited to be part of the program. Here, you
know you're having a direct impact or what takes place in space,''
he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our own little mission every day.''

<P>
   HOUSTON _ In less than two months, Jeff Wisoff and Michael
Lopez-Alegria will walk in space.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, they're doing the next best thing on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Outfitted in spacesuits and strapped onto a metal platform, the
astronauts are lowered into what seems like the largest swimming
pool ever constructed.
</P>
<P>
   Once submerged, they are released and ``weighed out'' by a team
of divers, who add and remove small weights from the suits until
the astronauts become ``neutrally buoyant'' or almost weightless.
</P>
<P>
   For the next six hours, they will remain underwater, where they
will remove a docking adapter and attach it to another part of a
mock-up of the international space station, near the bottom of a
pool more than two-thirds the size of a football field.
</P>
<P>
   Communicating with NASA's mission control throughout the
project, the astronauts follow the same timeline they will pursue
on their sixth day in space.
</P>
<P>
   Call it a dress rehearsal for the launch, which is scheduled for
early October.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're ready to go do it,'' Wisoff says. ``This is telling us
the clock is getting close.''
</P>
<P>
   It's just another day at the office for astronauts at the
Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   The mammoth pool, located in a converted aircraft building, is
ground zero for approximating zero gravity on earth.
</P>
<P>
   Known as the NBL, it's a prime training ground for every
astronaut who walks in space. It's also become a magnet for movie
makers.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Sutherland and Tommy Lee Jones are featured around the
pool in the new movie ``Space Cowboys.'' Ben Affleck and Bruce
Willis were among the first ``civilians'' allowed into the water
for a key scene in the hit movie ``Armageddon.``
</P>
<P>
   Willis and Affleck played offshore oil drillers whose expertise
is needed when NASA detects a Texas-sized asteroid on a collision
course with Earth. In interviews, the actors kidded each other
about the filming.
</P>
<P>
   Willis told reporters that Affleck had a nervous breakdown and
cried while filming scenes at the NBL. Affleck laughingly denied
Willis' allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Neither actor was in danger during the filming. They were
surrounded by safety divers and never left the metal platform,
known as the donning stand, that lowered them into the water.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you know what you're looking for in the movie, you can spot
that they're actually still seat-belted and strapped onto the
donning stand,'' says NBL facility operations manager Tony Uttley.
</P>
<P>
   Every time astronauts go underwater for training, they are
surrounded by a team of divers who provide safety backup, keep the
cords that provide air and cooling out of the way, and film the
procedure from every angle imaginable.
</P>
<P>
   The footage is relayed to a bank of video screens in rooms above
the pool, where officials closely monitor the mission.
</P>
<P>
   The pool, which holds enough water to fill 60 Olympic-size
pools, is so enormous that underwater tests are conducted on either
end at the same time. During the ``Armageddon'' shoot in 1997,
while Willis and Affleck performed their scenes on one end,
astronauts underwent training involving large pieces of the space
station on the other end.
</P>
<P>
   Now, simultaneous tests take place all the time. With eight
space launches planned for next year, the NBL is a busy place. An
astronaut spends eight to 10 hours in the pool for every hour spent
in an EVA (``extravehicular activity'' _ that's NASA-speak for
spacewalking).
</P>
<P>
   A growing need
</P>
<P>
   Almost from the beginning of the space program, astronauts have
trained in water. In the early days, it was part of their
instruction because their tiny capsule landed in the ocean upon
re-entering the Earth's atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   As spacewalks became incorporated into missions, astronauts went
underwater to get familiar with the weightless feeling of being in
space.
</P>
<P>
   The demand for underwater training skyrocketed in recent years
with the construction of the international space station.
</P>
<P>
   Astronauts are expected to spend about 1,100 hours in space to
assemble and maintain the sprawling orbital laboratory _ more than
twice the total EVA hours of all U.S. space missions to date.
</P>
<P>
   The old pool at the Johnson Space Center could barely hold a
portion of the space shuttle. Once the mock-up was in the pool,
there wasn't even enough room to open its bay doors.
</P>
<P>
   NASA proposed building a new underwater training facility from
scratch. But U.S. Rep. Tom DeLay, R-Sugar Land, pushed for
conversion of a building owned by McDonnell Douglas near NASA's
headquarters southeast of Houston as a cost-saving measure.
</P>
<P>
   NASA officials agreed, and the $34 million facility opened in
late 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the huge building, workers constructed a pool which holds
6.2 million gallons of water. It is so big _ 202 feet long, 102
feet wide and 40 feet deep _ that nearly every cement truck in
Houston was commissioned for a 48-hour continuous pour, observers
recall.
</P>
<P>
   Even with all that concrete, so much metal rebar was used in the
construction that it is considered to be a metal pool, Uttley says.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson Engineering, the subsidiary of a company called Spacehab
that runs the facility under a contract with NASA, developed its
own underwater wireless communication system so astronauts could
talk with test control offices above the pool.
</P>
<P>
   The facility also makes its own oxygen-enriched breathing gas,
Nitrox, to allow for longer underwater training. A medical team is
on hand to monitor all divers, and a hyperbaric chamber is nearby
for emergency decompression treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Two overhead bridge cranes help a small army of workers move
full-scale working models of the shuttle station, robotic arms, and
the Hubble telescope into and out of the water.
</P>
<P>
   On the walls of the facility hang the flags of 17 nations
participating in the construction of the space station.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call it the biggest underwater space park in the world,''
senior test director Sherwin Wade says. ``It's one of a kind.''
</P>
<P>
   Wade has seen a lot of changes in underwater training since he
was hired as a diver apprentice in 1983. Back then, he was one of a
handful of divers.
</P>
<P>
   Now, around 80 divers rotate in teams every two hours. While
underwater, each astronaut is assigned two safety divers, one
utility diver (to help with tools), and a diver with a video camera
to photograph the scene.
</P>
<P>
   When Wade was hired, he couldn't even swim well. He learned by
``harassment training'' when others held him down in the water and
made him fight to get out. Now, all divers are certified before
they are hired.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good to reminisce every once in a while, but I like where
we're headed now,'' Wade says.

   Here are today's top news stories from The New York Times News
Service for AMs of Monday, Aug. 14:
</P>
<P>
   INTERNATIONAL
</P>
<P>
   (Coded i)
</P>
<P>
   MIDEAST-TALKS (Washington) _ U.S. officials are talking about
the possibility of reviving the Palestinian-Israeli talks, saying
the time is short, that Egypt appears ready to be helpful and that
they see some signs of willingness on both sides. By Jane Perlez.
</P>
<P>
   MEXICO-FOX (Mexico City) _ An interview with Mexico's
president-elect. By Ginger Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-PUTIN (Moscow) _ Since becoming president of Russia,
Vladimir Putin has capitalized on a voter mandate and high poll
ratings to begin putting Russia back in order after a decade of
wild economic and political swings. But along the way, he is
breaking a lot of china, indulging some of the anti-democratic
instincts, his critics say, that came with his KGB training. By
Patrick E. Tyler.
</P>
<P>
   INDONESIA-POLITICS (Jakarta, Indonesia) _ The streets of Jakarta
were mostly quiet as parliament met this past week _ an indication,
perhaps, that despite its daunting problems and continuing disarray
there is hope in Indonesia for a more ordered and cohesive future.
``It's not over yet,'' cautioned a local journalist. But with
another week to go, this has been the first major political event
since former President Suharto was driven from office two and a
half years ago that has not been riven by chaos and bloodshed. By
Seth Mydans.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-POLICE (Shanghai) _ Police activity has increased in
several parts of China as the country undergoes a tightening of
social controls ahead of the October 1st National Day holiday.
While the summer sweep of discos and karaoke bars and detentions of
people voicing political dissent is an annual event, the crackdown
appears unusually harsh this year. By Craig S. Smith.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-CONCUBINES (Dongguan, China) _ Of all the ties that bind
Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland, few may be more pervasive than
sex. But it is not fueled by quick thrills and anonymous
encounters. It is based on a remarkably durable web of
relationships that have flowered between relatively poor Chinese
women and more affluent Hong Kong men, whose jobs require them to
spend days or weeks at a time in the mainland. Many of these
commuters support mistresses or de facto second wives, and
concubine villages have sprouted up across Guangdong Province. But
now the Chinese government is starting to view wholesale adultery
as a social menace, and it is cracking down. By Mark Landler.
</P>
<P>
   NATIONAL
</P>
<P>
   (Coded a)
</P>
<P>
   WELFARELESS-COUNTY (Rushville, Ill.) _ Welfare has completely
disappeared from Schuyler County, Ill. For more than a year, there
have been no new cases, no old cases, no one on the rolls. This
results not just from a strong economy, but also from hard work by
local welfare officials, who give lots of personal attention to
each case _ and have many lessons to teach the rest of the country.
By Robert Pear.
</P>
<P>
   FLA-BEACH (Destin, Fla.) _ Destin, the Florida Panhandle village
that had long been regarded as one of the last, little jewels of
coastal old Florida, has been transformed into a coastal city of
condominiums. By Rick Bragg.

Convention. By Adam Clymer and Michael R. Kagay.
</P>
<P>
   DEM-SCRIPT (Los Angeles) _ The way the Democrats plan to control
the message. By Peter Marks.
</P>
<P>
   DEM-PLATFORM (Los Angeles) _ Far from stamping a distinctive
Gore imprint on the Democratic Party, the platform the delegates
will approve on Tuesday warmly embraces the centrist policies of
the Clinton administration and lavishly credits them for the
prosperity of the last seven years. By James Dao.
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    'LOOK' MATTERS AS DEMOCRATS TRY TO UPSTAGE GOP
 &HT;    By TOM BAXTER
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Reflecting the party's desire to soften its image,
the polished wood stage of the Republican National Convention
looked like a set for one of the classier television talk shows.
</P>
<P>
   What viewers see when the Democratic National Convention wheels
into prime time Monday night may remind many of ``Who Wants to Be
Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   To be broadcast-precise, the futuristic set is colored in the
tones of Red 199, TV White (Cool Gray 3), Blue 300 and Metal
Effects platinum ME222. Designed by Rene Lagler, who has been doing
this for the Democrats since the 1988 convention in Atlanta, the
podium features an onstage chat room where speakers will go to
converse online, as well as the standard moving lectern and walls.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, the set is supposed to remind voters of the
Democrats' ``promise to look forward into the 21st century,''
according to a press release. But if a subliminal association with
the popular get-rich show reminds viewers how well they've done
over the past few years, that will fit with the party's message
also.
</P>
<P>
   Don't be surprised to hear Democrats proclaim theirs to be a
real and authentic political gathering, in contrast to the
carefully staged GOP convention. That's another way of saying the
Democrats have no hope of keeping their delegates under the tight
discipline the Republicans were able to maintain in Philadelphia,
where rock-ribbed conservatives listened politely to doo-wop groups
and a gay congressman.
</P>
<P>
   And while the Democrats may hold up their disorganization as a
virtue _ as they have since at least the 1930s _ their convention
has been crafted with just as much attention to drawing the widest
possible voting audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looking out from this stage, you will see a diverse audience
that truly represents all Americans,'' said Democratic official and
fund-raiser Terry McAuliffe. But the objectives of each night's
sessions will differ considerably from the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   _ Monday is Peace and Prosperity night, a time to showcase the
booming economy with a panel on the economy moderated by Labor
Secretary Alexis Herman.
</P>
<P>
   But it will also be Clinton and Clinton night, with the first
ladyspeaking among a group of female candidates and the
presidentbidding the party farewell. Because a major story line of
the week is whether Vice President Al Gore can step out from Bill
Clinton's shadow, expect pundits to drain every ounce of inference
from the president's speech.
</P>
<P>
   _ Republicans might want to skip the Clinton post-game and set
their VCRs for Tuesday. It's a night filled with speakers who often
raise the hackles of conservatives, including Sen. Edward Kennedy,
D-Mass., the Rev. Jesse Jackson and Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y.,
moderating a panel on education.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Tuesday's program will be a liberal who may be more
worrisome to GOP strategists: former Sen. Bill Bradley, who appeals
to independent voters.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday is also the day Rep. Loretta Sanchez of California had
scheduled her fund-raiser at the Playboy Mansion, before Democratic
National Committee Chairman Joe Andrew took her off the convention
speakers list for holding it there. She was put back on after she
agreed to hold the fund-raiser elsewhere. _ Wednesday is a night
Democrats hope a broad audience _ from independents of two minds
about the Clinton legacy, to Jewish voters, to Democratic centrists
_ tunes in to see Gore's running mate, Sen. Joseph Lieberman of
Connecticut. Lieberman has helped Gore in polls since he was
announced, and a successful prime-time speech could add to the
bounce.
</P>
<P>
   Viewers will also see a speech by Karenna Gore Schiff, who is
playing a big role in her father's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   _ Gore's acceptance speech will cap the convention Thursday
night. The vice president has to hope that Clinton's farewell, the
Sanchez flap and whatever protesters may do on the streets don't
divert too much attention from this, his best chance to make up
ground against George W. Bush.

   MURDOCH-MEDIA (Undated) _ Media analysts and network executives
said over the weekend that the sale of TV stations owned by
Chris-Craft Industries to the owner of the Fox television network,
News Corp., is likely to create a host of opportunities for News
Corp. _ and raise almost as many questions. The questions will
affect both News Corp. and Viacom, which until last Friday had been
bidding to acquire the Chris-Craft stations itself. By Bill Carter

CALL IT WHAT YOU LIKE, BUT SNACKS ADD FLAVOR TO ANY OCCASION,
ANYWHERE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN OWEN  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If there is still smoke coming out of my ears, it is probably
not a medical crisis. Call it ``a little whim.''
</P>
<P>
   The word for ``little whim'' in Guadalajara is antojito. That's
what the Mexicans call a pre-meal snack. The Hawaiians call them
pupus. In Greece the word is mezas, in Italy it's stuzzichino.
Visitors to Madrid with a weak grasp on the Spanish language might
be lured into a ``topless bar'' only to learn the actual word is
``tapas,'' another little whim.
</P>
<P>
   In India the word for snack food is chatt. That's what I thought
I was biting into during a visit to a vindaloo parlor in England
several years ago. It wasn't a snack; it was a chili pepper about
the size and voltage of a cherry bomb. It required two quick pints
of beer to reduce the fire to a smoldering ruin.
</P>
<P>
   In a city like Delhi, snack food is served up by a
khomcha-wallah. Indian food authority Madhur Jaffrey says she, and
most of her friends, learned to relish incendiary foods as
children. Her favorite chatt was fried, split-pea patties topped
with chilies, yogurt and tamarind chutney.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we ate them, the hot spices would bring tears to our eyes,
the yogurt would cool us down and the tamarind would perk up our
taste buds as nothing else could. This, to us, was heaven,'' she
reminisced
</P>
<P>
   That's not a little whim. That's a humongous hankering.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican cooking authority Diana Kennedy nominates the natives of
her adopted country as the most persistent noshers in the world.
</P>
<P>
   She points out that in Mexico the term ``little whim'' might
describe fresh roasted acorns or pumpkin seeds, quesadillas with
squash flowers, small tacos with shredded meat doused in green
tomato sauce or mango chunks skewered on a stick.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Ensenada it is the pismo clam that is the favorite of the
sidewalk carts,'' she wrote. ``In the La Paz market the tacos are
made of shredded fish and in Morelia they are made of brains
sprinkled with chopped coriander. At the back of the Oaxaca market
you can snack on toasted grasshoppers.''
</P>
<P>
   And of course the Mexicans brought us guacamole, chili con queso
and corn chips _ the staples of snack sessions on America's beach
blankets, picnic tables, patio platters and on saucers at ersatz
tapas (not topless) feasts.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent hot afternoon, Alice the Artist decided the only
appetizers served to guests should be cold ones. She also vetoed
the Scandinavian concept of creamed, pickled and smoked herring
with the merlot and dry martinis.
</P>
<P>
   So we served dishes like these.
</P>
<P>
   CURRY LAYERS
</P>
<P>
   SERVES SEVERAL
</P>
<P>
   8 ounces cream cheese, softened
</P>
<P>
   1 cup cottage cheese
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup sour cream
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons curry powder
</P>
<P>
   1 cup Indian-style chutney
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup raisins
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup shredded coconut
</P>
<P>
   1 cup cooked chicken, diced
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup salted peanuts, chopped
</P>
<P>
   Dump the cream cheese, cottage cheese and sour cream into a
mixing bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Add the curry powder and mix this mess until smooth. Spread the
glunk over bottom of an appetizer plate.
</P>
<P>
   Add layers of chutney, raisins, coconut, chicken and peanuts.
Cover, chill and serve with crackers.
</P>
<P>
   This is a variation on a recipe in the Honolulu cookbook
``Another Taste of Aloha.''
</P>
<P>
   SURIMI DIP
</P>
<P>
   SERVES SEVERAL
</P>
<P>
   1/2 pound imitation crab sticks
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup medium-heat salsa
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup minced onion
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoon chopped cilantro
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon fresh lime juice
</P>
<P>
   You could use a half-pound of bulk surimi, chopped. But the
imitation crab sticks are better.
</P>
<P>
   Thaw if necessary and slice the imitation crab sticks (surimi)
lengthwise, then cut each strip in half again. Line up the strips
and use a sharp knife to create quarter-inch cubes.
</P>
<P>
   Dump the cubes into a bowl. Mix in the other ingredients. If you
bought the chunky version, puree the salsa first.
</P>
<P>
   Serve chilled with crackers or crispy corn rounds.
</P>
<P>
   This is based on a recipe in Jane Brody's ``Good Seafood Book.''
</P>
<P>
   CHICKEN BITES
</P>
<P>
   SERVES SEVERAL
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons cooking oil
</P>
<P>
   2 whole chicken breasts, skinned and boned
</P>
<P>
   3 cloves garlic, minced
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons brown sugar
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons soy sauce
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon powdered ginger
</P>
<P>
   toasted sesame seeds
</P>
<P>
   Cut the chicken into three-quarter-inch hunks. Brown in oil,
along with the garlic.
</P>
<P>
   Moosh together the brown sugar, soy sauce and ginger. Mix this
into the pan, tossing the chicken pieces to coat, just until the
chicken is no longer pink in the middle. This means you have to cut
one of the pieces in half to test. It also means you get to eat
that piece, if it's cooked.
</P>
<P>
   Chill the chicken pieces, then coat with the sesame seeds and
serve with toothpicks.
</P>
<P>
   This simple but delicious recipe is from ``MONA Cooks,''
published by friends of the Museum of Northwest Art in La Conner,
Wash. If you buy a copy, you also get the recipe for the Mystic
Sons of Morris Graves' Famous Fishtown Zen Dip.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, the French call snack food hors d'oeuvre. And, no,
that does not translate as ``horse eggs.'' It means ``outside the
meal.''
</P>
<P>
   Pass the grasshoppers. And the zen dip.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On August 3, Robert Gottlieb, one of the most powerful agents in
the book business and the head of the William Morris agency's New
York literary group, received a letter from Tom Clancy, his old
friend and biggest client. His message: He was ending their 15
years of business together. From now on, his book deals would be
handled by Michael Ovitz.
</P>
<P>
   Gottlieb was livid. Just a few years before, his relationship
with Clancy had been so close that Clancy occasionally referred to
``the two G's'' _ Gottlieb and God _ said Diana Patin, Clancy's
former longtime secretary. When both men had been divorced, Clancy
even established a pied-a-terre in Gottlieb's building on the Upper
West Side.
</P>
<P>
   Before the day was out, Gottlieb was on the phone to a New York
Times reporter, fuming that Ovitz had ``raided'' his client and
declaring ``open season'' on Ovitz. Clancy, Gottlieb insisted, had
been ``bamboozled.''
</P>
<P>
   The episode has turned Clancy's jump into a highly visible test
case for Ovitz's new business plan: representing writers and stars
as an adviser while simultaneously negotiating deals with them to
produce movies and television. And it has exacerbated already
strained relations between Gottlieb and William Morris' top
executives in Los Angeles, who prefer cordial relations with Ovitz.
William Morris is currently negotiating with Gottlieb to renew his
soon-to-expire contract, raising questions about his future at the
agency.
</P>
<P>
   But Clancy's defection is also an awkward chapter in a deep
friendship between two sharply drawn characters _ Gottlieb, the
streetwise dealmaker with a penchant for hardball, and Clancy, the
mercurial author who seals deals with handshakes and still harbors
fantasies about commanding a tank.
</P>
<P>
   Their relationship began in May 1984, when Gottlieb stumbled
across galleys of Clancy's first book, ``The Hunt for Red
October,'' at a booksellers' convention. Gottlieb cold-called him
at his home in Maryland near Chesapeake Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do I need an agent?'' Clancy replied at the time. Later,
he recalled, ``Rob came after me like a gigolo after an heiress.''.
</P>
<P>
   His military ambitions thwarted by vision problems, Clancy was
selling insurance while plotting thrillers at his dining room table
at night. He sold his debut novel on his own to the Naval Institute
Press for an advance of just $5,000, inadvertently signing away the
rights to use the story or its hero, Jack Ryan, in films.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1984, Clancy finally agreed to meet Gottlieb in New
York, over corned beef sandwiches at a midtown deli, and soon
signed on as client. Together they turned Clancy's name into one of
the most lucrative franchises in the book business. In all,
Gottlieb negotiated deals with Clancy's publisher, Penguin Putnam,
for 47 books, roughly 10 still to be published. Clancy has 10
best-selling hardcover novels to his credit, with another on the
way this fall. His career has spawned a cottage industry of other
projects _ military nonfiction, mass market paperbacks written with
a collaborator, and even his own video game company. Three of his
novels have become movies.
</P>
<P>
   According to executives at William Morris, Clancy earned more
than $300 million from its deals, although Clancy insists that he
made far less. A recent book contract fetched an advance of about
$19 million for each hardcover title. William Morris received a 10
percent commission on each deal. Gottlieb came to represent many
other best-selling clients, including Dean Koontz and Janet
Evanovich. But Clancy remained the foundation of his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rob is a good guy,'' Clancy, 53, said in an interview last
week. ``He made me a lot of money and I made him a lot of money. We
were pals, for crying out loud.'' Gottlieb, who is 46, attended not
only Clancy's wedding but the weddings of both of his daughters,
and Clancy attended Gottlieb's second wedding, too.
</P>
<P>
   But as time went on, Clancy said, he grew impatient that only
three of his highly cinematic thrillers had been turned into films,
the last one in 1994. ``Eight are out there hanging and flapping in
the wind, and I think they are damn good enough to be made into
movies,'' he said. ``I just wasn't terribly impressed with how the
movies and TV things had worked out.'' He also denied comparing
Gottlieb with God.
</P>
<P>
   People at the William Morris agency, however, point out that
Clancy's exacting standards did not help. He frequently sparred
with producers at Paramount Pictures &UR; ,  &LR; which had acquired the film
rights to his Jack Ryan character from his first publisher. ``I
just thought it was a bit of an exaggeration to say the movies were
based on the books by Tom Clancy _ they should have followed the
books a little more closely,'' he acknowledged last week. He has
also publicly deprecated the casting of Harrison Ford, who played
Jack Ryan in two films.
</P>
<P>
   Although already a millionaire, Clancy also complained about his
earnings from the films. ``The money matters, if you can make money
from it,'' he said. The Naval Institute's deal for ``The Hunt for
Red October'' earned Clancy a total of just over $251,000, he said.
He wasn't content with the two deals Gottlieb negotiated either.
After a multimillion-dollar signing fee, he said, he still hasn't
seen any royalties from ``Patriot Games.''
</P>
<P>
   Clancy met Ovitz about five years ago. Ovitz had resigned his
position as the head of Creative Artists Agency to become president
of the Walt Disney Co. He proposed a ``vertically integrated
partnership'' with Disney in books, television and movies, Clancy
recalled. The deal was never consummated. Ovitz's tenure at Disney
lasted just 14 months.
</P>
<P>
   But Clancy liked the way Ovitz was thinking, and they stayed in
touch. ``Friendship is important,'' Clancy said. ``He explains
Hollywood to me, and I explain the national security stuff to
him.'' When Clancy remarried, Ovitz, too, attended the wedding, and
chatted politely with Gottlieb.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz began informally offering Clancy advice, and about three
years ago signed on as his manager. Unlike agents, managers cannot
negotiate deals for clients, only advise. They usually collect 10
percent of their clients' revenue as a commission. As a result,
over the last few years, Clancy has been paying two commissions on
some deals, according to people at William Morris and associates of
Ovitz.
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz began wooing Clancy more aggressively about 18 months ago,
when he founded his new firm, Artists Management Group. The new
firm is a talent management business that also seeks to produce its
own films and television programs on the side. The arrangement has
raised eyebrows in Hollywood because it puts Ovitz's firm in a
potential conflict of interest, advising clients as manager while
negotiating with them as producer. Agents are legally prohibited
from playing such dual roles with clients they represent. Mike
Burns, a spokesman for Artists Management, said that on its own
productions, the company does not take a commission and its clients
are represented by lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Clancy, however, disputes that he ever paid two commissions, nor
does he know the difference between Ovitz's role as his manager and
Gottlieb's role as his agent.
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz told Clancy that Artists Management could start generating
at least one movie or television program based on his novels each
year, partly by taking a role as a producer or co-producer. That
sounded good to Clancy. ``Ovitz knows Hollywood pretty well, or he
certainly seems to,'' he said, ``I decided to give him a chance to
show me if he is as good as he says he is.'' Artists Management's
television and movie units are now co-producing with Paramount at
several projects based on Clancy's books. In the next film, Ben
Affleck will replace Harrison Ford.
</P>
<P>
   About 18 months ago, Ovitz officially took over negotiations
from William Morris for all of Clancy's Hollywood dealings, and he
soon grew involved in Clancy's dealings with his publisher, too,
calling with suggestions about publicity.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, opting for the formality of a letter, Clancy last week
cut Gottlieb out completely, explaining that from now on Ovitz
would manage his book deals, too. ``It was time to move on,''
Clancy said.
</P>
<P>
   To Gottlieb, the news was not unexpected, but it came at a
sensitive time within William Morris. The venerable agency last
year named a new co-chief executive, James A. Wiatt, a Hollywood
agent and former vice-chairman of International Creative
Management. His relations with Gottlieb quickly soured, according
to others at the firm.
</P>
<P>
   Wiatt rapidly consolidated his power, beginning with a shake-up
of the agency's East Coast film group that led to the departure of
10 agents last year. Wiatt told friends he intended to turn his
attention to the New York book group this summer. Then, over
strenuous objections from Gottlieb and others in New York, he
removed Dan Strone, a friend and ally of Gottlieb's, from his
position in charge of turning the New York literary group's books
into Hollywood films.
</P>
<P>
   Clancy's departure sparked a new confrontation. William Morris
executives in Los Angeles immediately called Ovitz, who was about
to leave for a two-week vacation in Italy and tried to mollify the
situation, saying that on his return he would try to keep William
Morris involved. Meanwhile, Gottlieb went public with his bitter
feelings _ accusing Ovitz of blurring the line between manager and
agent and poaching his client. (A spokesman for Artists Management
said many of its clients also have agents, noting their commissions
don't interfere with its own.)
</P>
<P>
   Gottlieb's diatribe only underscored the tensions within the
firm: Don DeMesquita, an agency spokesman, took the extraordinary
step of disavowing Gottlieb's comments, explaining that Gottlieb
spoke only for himself and not for William Morris. The incident
quickly became the talk of the industry, fueling speculation about
Gottlieb's place at the firm.
</P>
<P>
   Through DeMesquita, Gottlieb declined to comment further. Asked
about Gottlieb's future at the firm, Wiatt issued a one-sentence
statement: ``William Morris is not cutting back its East Coast book
operations, and Robert Gottlieb remains in place as head of our New
York literary department.'' People at the firm say Gottlieb's
contract renewal remains under negotiation. Although he is one of
William Morris' biggest earners, the firm could retain the revenue
from his previous deals if he left.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Clancy expressed a mixture of sympathy and chagrin
toward his old friend. ``I'm not a partridge; nobody poached me.
But sometimes people let their anger get in the way of their
brains, and that's what happened to Rob in this case. I just hope
Rob didn't shoot himself in the foot.''

APOLOGY HIGHLIGHTS ABC REPORTER'S CONTRARIAN IMAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  By JIM RUTENBERG and FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last Friday evening on the TV news magazine ``20/20,'' John
Stossel, the square-jawed consumer and environmental correspondent,
was forced to do something relatively rare for ABC News or any
other network news operation: deliver an apology on the air for
inaccuracies in a news feature.
</P>
<P>
   What was not so rare, though, was Stossel's being in the thick
of a controversy at ABC. He is a man of strong opinions, even about
the work of his colleagues _ a trait that does not always go over
well within the network's news division.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, for instance, Stossel took aim at the
environmentalist icon Erin Brockovich, the feisty legal secretary
portrayed by Julia Roberts in a recent movie. On the program
``20/20,'' he cast doubt on the lawsuit she helped bring charging
Pacific Gas and Electric with contaminating the groundwater in
Hinkley, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Stossel believed that his ``20/20'' co-anchor, Cynthia McFadden,
among other reporters, had too blindly accepted Brockovich's case
in an earlier ABC News report. So he discussed fighting it out with
McFadden in a broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   This made McFadden angry, people familiar with the situation
said, and she complained loudly to her supervisors. She told
colleagues she would refuse to appear on the program. When it was
shown, Elizabeth Vargas was the anchor. The segment did not refer
to McFadden's report.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Brockovich demanded that Stossel apologize for his
``dangerous and misleading broadcast.'' He did not.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, just another day for Stossel. Reviled in some
quarters as an ideologue and crusader, admired in others for his
fresh, contrarian approach, Stossel is an anomaly in television
journalism. Reporters are generally forced to keep their ideologies
to themselves. Stossel is allowed to make his views known.
</P>
<P>
   And that he does. An unabashed libertarian, he has argued that
greed is good for the economy; that environmentalists are
``scaremongers'' with vastly overblown fears of global warming and
pollution; and, even, that seat belts in school buses are a waste
of money.
</P>
<P>
   His views have put him under intense scrutiny in the hothouse
world of environmental and consumer politics. And now an error made
in a recent ``20/20'' segment _ in which he cited pesticide tests
that were never done to debunk the assumed benefits of organic
foods _ has put him under scrutiny by a wider audience while
creating a public relations mess for ABC News. From now on, Stossel
is likely to draw even more attention.
</P>
<P>
   As coverage and criticism of Stossel spread last week, ABC, a
unit of Walt Disney, took the rare step of publicly reprimanding
him, and suspending the producer of the report, David W.
Fitzpatrick, for one month, without pay. On ``20/20'' Friday night,
Stossel apologized.
</P>
<P>
   ``I apologize for the error,'' he said, saying he mistakenly
thought the tests referred to in the report had been conducted. ``I
am deeply sorry I misled you.'' But he said the gist of his report
was accurate.
</P>
<P>
   The whole episode sent jitters throughout ABC News, which
recently took heat for allowing the actor Leonardo DiCaprio to
interview President Clinton about environmental issues on a
prime-time special, a move that split the division internally.
Executives tried to figure out how the pesticide error made it
through what they describe as an elaborate vetting process.
</P>
<P>
   Shelley Ross, the executive producer of ``Good Morning
America,'' sent an e-mail to her staff members, warning them to
take all complaints about their reports seriously. Stossel and his
producer, the message said, were punished not so much for their
mistake, ``but for the arrogance of ignoring complaint letters that
followed.''
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists still insist that Stossel should be fired. But
ABC executives said they would do no such thing.
</P>
<P>
   By all appearances, they are fond of Stossel. His edgy,
distinctive approach tests well in audience research. And, in fact,
he is allowed to operate within the news division as a sort of
island unto himself. He is given the sort of freedom no other ABC
reporter has: Though not labeled a commentator, he is allowed to
take a point of view and report stories based on that point of
view. He has his own unit of eight to 10 staff members who help him
with his weekly segments on ``20/20,'' and with his various
prime-time specials.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Stossel said he wanted to answer his critics
directly, but ABC would not allow it, making Phyllis McGrady, an
ABC News senior vice president, available instead.
</P>
<P>
   McGrady said executives like Stossel's work because his
reporting goes against the grain of the established media and
offers the network something fresh and different. Though he avoids
the traditional pose of objectivity, he bases his conclusions on
hard reporting, she said. This hard-edged approach, she said, makes
him a target of the powerful groups he offends.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an original thinker, and he is not afraid to tackle
complicated issues,'' she said. ``He takes on issues that are
thought-provoking and what he is wanting and hoping for and, yes,
advocating for, is for you to become a freer thinker, to basically
stand back and look at it from every perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   Stossel's point of view is welcomed by various conservative and
industry groups. Though ABC has a general policy against paid
public speaking engagements, Stossel, as are some of his
colleagues, is allowed to accept such offers. He was quoted in the
March 2000 issue of Brill's Content magazine as saying he had
spoken to 27 groups in the last two years, collecting hundreds of
thousands of dollars in fees. An ABC executive said those
engagements were approved because all of the money he collects went
to charity.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Stossel is advertised, along with Charlton Heston, as one of the
most sought-after speakers of the Young America's Foundation, a
conservative group. This year, a spokesman for the YAF said,
Stossel had given speeches at three schools, including Washington &AMP;
Lee University, the Stetson School of Law in Florida and Florida
State University.
</P>
<P>
   His strong views, combined with speaking engagements before
conservative groups, opens Stossel up to criticism. So heated is
his opposition that FAIR, a liberal-minded media watchdog group,
has an entire Web site devoted to what it sees as distortions.
</P>
<P>
   As serious as the pesticide mistake was, there is a general
belief within ABC News that the situation was worsened because of
the lobbying prowess of the groups Stossel tends to provoke.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Still, the organic food mistake certainly played directly into
Stossel's critics' accusations that he is biased and tailors his
reporting and statistics to fit his fervent belief system _ in this
case, that organic farmers are preying on fear of chemicals to sell
overpriced food with its own problems.
</P>
<P>
   During his initial report, shown on Feb. 4, to an audience of 12
million, Stossel said that tests commissioned by ABC showed
conventional produce did not necessarily have more pesticide
residue than did organic produce, debunking a main selling point
for organic food.
</P>
<P>
   But the two researchers who were commissioned by ABC _ Dr.
Michael Doyle, a scientist at the University of Georgia, and Dr.
Lester Crawford, director of the Center for Food and Nutrition
Policy at Georgetown University _ said they had never tested
produce for pesticide residue.
</P>
<P>
   Crawford said that he had tested samples of organic and
conventional chicken and that those tests had found traces of
pesticides in the regular poultry, not in the organic. Those
findings were not mentioned in the ``20/20'' segment.
</P>
<P>
   After the report was first broadcast, advocates with the
Environmental Working Group wrote a letter that alerted Stossel
that the researchers said they had not conducted the tests. The
report, however, ran again on July 7 with the same information.
</P>
<P>
   It was not until The New York Times raised the issue in a Media
Talk column on July 31 that ABC News began to investigate in
earnest and found that the test results in question did not exist.
</P>
<P>
   ABC executives said on Friday that they believed that the
erroneous reference to pesticide tests was the result of honest
mistake, though a serious one. There are valid explanations for all
of the critics' charges, they said.
</P>
<P>
   They said Fitzpatrick was receiving a spate of different test
results on organic and conventional foods, had become confused and
somehow had developed the solid notion that produce was tested for
pesticide residue.
</P>
<P>
   Even when he was contacted by the environmentalists, executives
said, Fitzpatrick continued to believe that he had the results in
question. In a subsequent conversation with Crawford, when
Fitzpatrick asked if pesticide tests had been performed, Crawford
answered in the affirmative. Crawford said in a recent interview
that he did so because he was referring to the pesticide tests
performed on chicken.
</P>
<P>
   Why were the chicken tests, which would go against the grain of
Stossel's argument, not included in the report? In his apology,
Stossel said he did not refer to them because he was focusing on
produce.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jacobsen, executive director of the Center for Science
in the Public Interest _ whose group is supported by subscribers to
its publications and by the Rockefeller Family Fund and the Park
Foundation _ said though he found Stossel's erroneous organic food
report egregious, he was not surprised by it. He said he believed
it to be in keeping with what he sees as Stossel's bias in favor of
industry.
</P>
<P>
   That such an accusation could be attached to Stossel would have
been unimaginable 10 years ago. His point of view has evolved
drastically in the course of his career. Once a dogged consumer
reporter for WCBS-TV, the local New York City CBS station, and then
for ABC, he won his early reputation railing against corporate
America. But in the early 1990s, his views changed. He evolved into
a true believer in the free market and came to believe that
advocates and the media were unnecessarily scaring consumers.
</P>
<P>
   His transformation took place in an ideologically charged arena.
Evidence about the impact of toxic substances on humans is hotly
disputed.
</P>
<P>
   But while Stossel's transformation has angered liberal groups,
it has delighted conservative ones.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Olsen, of the libertarian-oriented Manhattan Institute,
said Stossel was now ``filling in what we don't get from the rest
of'' the media. Other reporters, Olsen said, ``have broadcast
grossly misleading stuff over the years.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he apologized for the error, the gist of his statement
was that his segment was still correct. The clear message from
Stossel: Despite this setback, he intends to continue his brand of
journalism. But, he said in his apology: ``All we have in this
business is our credibility _ your trust that we get it right. I
will make every effort to see that it never happens again.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Like many senior-level Internet executives, Christine Harmel,
chief executive of Interactive Resource, a firm in Manhattan that
matches Web site developers with clients, was present at the birth
of e-commerce. Working on the Net since 1995, Harmel, 32, has
experienced years of 80-hour workweeks and has watched the industry
transform itself from a stomping ground for young workaholics who
wanted to change the world, into a stomping ground for young
workaholics who want to change their tax brackets.
</P>
<P>
   Now she is looking to move on. Like a growing number of industry
veterans, Harmel has begun searching for a house away from the
nation's technology hotbeds _ South Carolina is her choice _ and is
planning to eventually sell her business and leave the industry.
``We're burned out,'' Harmel said, speaking of Net entrepreneurs of
a certain level of experience and fatigue. ``Some of us are tired
and rich. Some of us are tired and not rich. But we're all tired.''
</P>
<P>
   Data on this topic are scarce, but anecdotal evidence suggests
that a changing of the guard is under way in the Internet industry,
as the early proponents of the Web are stepping aside for the
mainstream business people who have migrated to the new medium.
Such a cultural shift was to be expected, given how the Web itself
has become a mainstream phenomenon. But analysts say the executive
shift could have broad implications for e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``Call this Web 2.0,'' said Clay Shirky, a partner at
Accelerator Group, a consulting firm that works with Web start-ups,
who has worked in the Internet industry since 1993. ``This has been
going on slowly, and now people are realizing the landscape has
changed without us having caught onto it.''
</P>
<P>
   The changing culture within Internet businesses _ from a work
force of ``young, revolutionary zealots'' to one with a more
mainstream corporate ethic _ ``is a necessary thing,'' Shirky said.
``For the Net to be genuinely revolutionary, it has to be genuinely
ordinary,'' he said. ``So it has to be normal within the business
world, too.''
</P>
<P>
   But losing the revolutionary zeal and the wisdom of the Web's
early leaders could also change the pace of innovation, Harmel and
others said, as the more managerial types replace the tinkering
pioneers. But then, in many cases, there may not be many insanely
great ideas left in the brains of the old guard, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough to contribute good, new ideas and keep stuff going
if everybody's sitting at home eating Fritos, comatose from four
years of working this hard,'' Harmel said. ``Lately, when you ask
people how it's going, you constantly hear them say, `I'm tired. I
want my life back,''' Harmel continued. ``For me, it's time to
focus on what's important in life: family, food, sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   Internet veterans who are considering a hiatus or a new career
say the hours have been brutal. But they also say the
relentlessness of their jobs was easier to accept when the focus
was on exploring the creative possibilities of technology, not
constructing a blueprint for a public company.
</P>
<P>
   ``The clash of the cultures is there,'' said Mark Hurst,
president of Creative Good, a Web site consulting company in New
York. Hurst, who is 27 and started working on the Internet
immediately upon leaving MIT with a master's degree in computer
science in 1995, said he was planning a sabbatical to write a book
about what he called ``bit literacy,'' which would explore how
people can avoid being overwhelmed by Internet technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three years ago, things were still fresh, a little more
hopeful, less cynical than they are now,'' Hurst said. ``People who
were part of that original culture see what the game is about now,
and they're saying, `This isn't what I came here for. If you want
it so bad, you can have it. I'm going to go scuba diving.'''
</P>
<P>
   Or sailing, in the case of Catrina Gregory, who recently quit
her job as vice president for business development at UPOC.com,
which provides services to wireless Net users. After two years of
working ``insane hours'' for Web companies, Gregory, 29, is taking
several months off to learn sailing, get her pilot's license and
plan her next career move.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory's first dot-com employer, Sabela Media, was purchased by
another Web advertising firm, 24/7 Media , in January. ``So I went
from this small start-up environment to being part of a behemoth,''
she said. ``It was tough for me to get up and say, `I'm going to
make 24/7 stronger, faster, better.'''
</P>
<P>
   Saying that Sabela's sale to 24/7 Media did not make her rich,
Gregory added: ``For those of us who haven't ended up
gazillionaires, the question is, `How much longer am I willing to
put off personal happiness?' So many people have stock options that
are worthless, and without that bait, why stay with something you
don't really like doing?''
</P>
<P>
   The chances of her returning to a dot-com after the hiatus, she
said, are ``less than 50 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Heiferman, who founded i-Traffic, an online marketing
company, in 1995, and sold it to Agency.com in November, said there
was ``definitely a bit of burnout in this industry.'' Heiferman,
28, who earlier this year founded RocketBoard, a company that makes
keyboards designed for Internet use, added that he was ``concerned
about the implications of this, because an intensity and strong
sense of purpose can make miracles happen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But in another sense, this is textbook stuff,'' he said. ``The
bigger any company gets, the tougher it is for dissenting voices to
come through or for innovation to happen. I think there will still
be passionate people in the industry. Maybe there will just be
fewer of them on a percentage basis.''
</P>
<P>
   Heiferman said he agreed that working conditions had been
difficult for dot-com employees over the last several years. ``But
for better or worse, there was a revolution going on, so it was no
time for people to pace themselves,'' he said. ``It was a time to
go full steam.''
</P>
<P>
   Shirky, of Accelerator Group, said some executives still wanted
to go full steam, but because of the changing nature of e-commerce,
they wanted to do it in a different industry. ``I've had a number
of conversations with people who've said, `Oh, maybe I'll go into
biotech,' as if that industry needs the same energy and input as
they put into the Internet,'' Shirky said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They figure that if the Internet isn't where the revolution
and action is anymore, then the action must have just gone
somewhere else,'' he added. ``What they don't realize is that it's
just gone, period. The Internet is a once in a lifetime thing.''

HIGH-TECH DESIGN PATENT AIMS TO LIVEN UP DRAB BANKS; ATMS THAT KNOW

</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Remember the last time you stopped in your tracks at the sight
of the display in a bank branch window, lingering to window-shop or
even drawn irresistibly through the door and into the bank to
browse?
</P>
<P>
   Right.
</P>
<P>
   The 21st-century bank branch doesn't inspire impulse shopping,
and it certainly doesn't attract people the way it did when banking
required a face-to-face transaction with a teller. Most people now
write checks, use credit cards, withdraw and deposit money through
automated teller machines, or bank online. When they do go into a
bank, they know what to expect _ a cluster of desks on one side, a
long enclosed counter on the other and dead space in between for
standing in line.
</P>
<P>
   The institutional setting has not changed much the last couple
of decades, but now a group of designers at the Citicorp
Development Center in Los Angeles has won a patent they hope will
turn the bank branch into a shopping destination.
</P>
<P>
   Banks sell products and services, after all, and need to reach
potential customers. The Citicorp inventors believe that if they
can change the layout and function of bank branches, more people
will be inspired to visit them.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine window-shopping among images flashing across a video
wall and being lured into a bank branch by computer terminals
offering Internet access, e-mail, home banking, television
broadcasts, sports scores and local news. The wall is connected
with the terminals, so you and other customers can take over
separate parts of the video exhibit. You can search for information
to display on a section of the wall or on the individual terminal
screen, or interact with an electronic mortgage seminar, or browse
a calendar of banking classes and events.
</P>
<P>
   You can even send a message to someone at another terminal and
``grab and share'' information by moving images back and forth
between the video wall and the computer screens.
</P>
<P>
   The point, still, is to help ``the banking institution sell
services, by virtue of attracting customers and other users and
initiating a dialogue,'' the inventors wrote in their patent
application.
</P>
<P>
   ``A sample event that occurs at the interactive center could
include a tutorial on how to plan a trust,'' the application said.
``In addition, the interactive center could connect the customer
with a legal firm that is partnered with the banking institution,
or provide either a prerecorded video or display other information,
such as relevant legal forms.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the terminals are ``public,'' for use in connection with
the video wall, while others are ``private,'' for use in personal
banking. The computers feature access to a limited number of
preselected Web sites relevant to banking and financial
institutions. The sites are organized into categories like ``money
management.''
</P>
<P>
   An archive of videotaped seminars is available for broadcast on
the computer screen or the video wall. Each computer keyboard has a
toolbar with navigation buttons leading to the bank home page,
financial tools, promotions, a calendar for the interactive center,
site links, and entertainment and community news. The topics can be
changed to suit particular institutions or promotions.
</P>
<P>
   Bank customers can use the computer system by swiping an
automated teller machine card or smart-card through an electronic
card reader: potential customers can use a guest card. Once
activated, most sessions are limited to five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Sylvia Bornemisza-Wahr, Frank McCallick, Roy Sinai, Peter
Paradiso, Howard Schechtman, Kenneth Randall, Peter Tompkins and
Teresa Petach, who all live in the Los Angeles area, along with
Kevin Lam, who lives in Singapore, won patent 6,073,119.
</P>
<P>
   Bank machine cards have always required a secret code known only
to the card holder. At least, that is supposed to be the case. But
people who are careless with their cards or their personal
identification numbers, or PIN's, can compromise the security of
their bank accounts. Now three Texas inventors have patented an ATM
system that doesn't use cards or codes at all.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Stinson, John Templer and Dyron Clower, who are all from
Fort Worth, own a patent for a bank machine that compares what they
call ``biometric information'' from a user with similar data on
account holders.
</P>
<P>
   A video camera at a bank machine terminal would capture a
picture of a user's face, iris or fingerprint for comparison with
the same images stored in a customer database. A processor
evaluates the two images, and when a match is confirmed, notifies
the bank computer that the user has been identified as the owner of
the bank account or credit card. The three inventors won patent
6,045,039.

<TEXT>
<P>
   If there were any established companies ready-made for the
Internet, they should have been the big television networks. Or at
least that was how it seemed two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have what is needed to compete because of the great depth
in our brands and the great consumer loyalty to them,'' Michael D.
Eisner, chairman of Walt Disney, said in 1998 on the eve of the
debut of Disney's Go Network.
</P>
<P>
   The broadcast networks, after all, are still the most powerful
media forces in America, accounting for the two-thirds of the seven
hours of television the average household watches each day. And
they have an arsenal of advantages: lots of money, libraries of
programming and decades of experience in attracting and keeping big
audiences. And most important, the networks have the ability to
promote their Web sites with unlimited amounts of advertising on
television, which is still the most persuasive medium.
</P>
<P>
   But after great effort and hundreds of millions of dollars of
promotion, the networks are still also-rans on the Web. Traffic to
their various sites badly lags behind the big portals like Yahoo,
America Online and Microsoft's MSN, which are the closest thing the
Web has to major networks.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly Wall Street has all but written off the broadcast
companies as Internet players. The publicly traded shares of NBC
Internet and ABC's online cousin, the Walt Disney Internet Group,
are down more than two-thirds this year _ a steeper decline than
those that the stocks of their larger competitors have suffered.
</P>
<P>
   And last week, NBC Internet, citing slowing ad sales, said it
would lay off 20 percent of its work force.
</P>
<P>
   CBS, meanwhile, has delayed plans to spin off its Internet
operations into a separate company. And CBS' new parent, Viacom,
has postponed the offering of shares in its online music business,
the MTVi Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now investors are not rewarding the Internet activities
of Disney, NBC and Viacom,'' said Tom Wolzien, an analyst with
Sanford C. Bernstein. ``They are small, and the market prefers the
big players like Yahoo and America Online.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been a humbling comedown for the networks and their
owners, who are more accustomed to being mighty media monoliths
than niche players scrounging for audiences.
</P>
<P>
   Eisner now says he was given bad advice about how much the
Internet differed from Disney's other businesses. The company
developed the first version of its portal, Go.com, in six months,
he noted, to keep pace with the notion of hyperfast Internet time.
</P>
<P>
   ``People told me we had to be like Microsoft and put out version
one and two and three, and eventually we would get it right,''
Eisner said. ``We did that with Go, then people told us it wasn't
as good as Yahoo or America Online. I've never been involved with
anything where I didn't believe what we did wasn't the best. But
here we were, experimenting in front of the public.''
</P>
<P>
   What went wrong?
</P>
<P>
   To begin with, the networks overestimated their own strengths.
Their vaunted promotional abilities, for example, were helpful in
persuading people to try their Web sites. But lacking the depth and
sophistication of features that the successful portals had, many of
the network sites could not turn the merely curious into steady
customers.
</P>
<P>
   And for all their early confidence, the network companies have
been uncertain whether to make their Internet operations
independent, to emulate the fast-moving style of other Web
companies, or to keep them part of their broadcast operations, to
take best advantage of their popular media content and packaging
skill.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mistake made over and over again by traditional media
companies is that they dabble in new media rather than doing
something strategic to integrate with their core assets,'' said Tom
Rogers, chief executive of Primedia and former head of NBC's cable
operation and much of its Internet activities.
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, the networks' biggest Web successes have been
the efforts most closely aligned with broadcast programming _ as
when ABC and its cable cousin ESPN promote the sports content of
ESPN.com, or when CBS newscasts cite the financial reports on CBS
MarketWatch.com. But those successes in specialized areas of
coverage stand in stark contrast to the typically more
disappointing results whenever the network companies have tried to
reach broader audiences.
</P>
<P>
   And even one unqualified hit is giving little glory to an outfit
that could use some. MSNBC.com, backed by the combined promotion of
NBC's cable network and Microsoft's MSN Internet site, has grown
rapidly to become the No. 1 news site on the Internet. MSNBC even
was profitable for NBC last year, executives say. But according to
the terms of the deal, MSNBC's audience counts toward MSN's
ratings, and the site sends little traffic to NBCi.
</P>
<P>
   The networks' experience is not simply a tale of hubris, of
media moguls glibly assuming they would show those goateed and
pierced Web kids a thing or two.
</P>
<P>
   In large measure, it was Wall Street that pushed the networks
into the game, by demanding two years ago that the network
companies mount a credible Internet strategy. So, all too gamely,
the networks plunged ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Disney, the owner of ABC, and NBC, with the blessing of its
corporate parent, General Electric, each made a series of
acquisitions, combined with internal operations, to build Internet
portals that were meant to challenge Yahoo and America Online. For
ABC-Disney it was the Go Network, built from the Infoseek search
engine. For NBC, it was Snap, bought from Cnet.
</P>
<P>
   But the best days of both Go and Snap seem to be behind them. It
is true that Go was the Web's sixth-most-popular site in June,
according to the research firm Media Metrix. And Snap, counted
along with the other sites run by the NBC Internet unit, ranked
ninth. But on the Internet, both audience and revenue appear to be
concentrating in a handful of leaders at the very top. Indeed, over
the last year, Go and NBCi have actually lost audience share, even
as the leaders _ America Online, Yahoo and MSN _ have all increased
their shares by more than 10 points.
</P>
<P>
   CBS, meanwhile, has taken a different tack. Rather than trying
to create a network-scale portal, the company backed a dozen
independent, specialized Web services, like MarketWatch, Sportsline
and Iwon.
</P>
<P>
   Among CBS.com and sites in which Viacom-CBS have investments,
none was among the top 50 _ except Iwon.com, a site that gives cash
prizes to users, which ranked 21st.
</P>
<P>
   (CBS.Com had been losing audience share earlier this year, but
has bounced back somewhat on Web traffic related to the network's
hit show, ``Survivor.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``The networks looked at the Internet and had to do something,
if for no other reason than defensively,'' said Dean Daniels, a
former CBS executive who is now president of Theglobe.com, a
youth-oriented online community site. ``There are huge audiences
online that are spending less time watching television. The problem
is that none of the networks are getting it right.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner, which runs the CNN, Turner and WB networks along
with myriad other media properties, felt so flummoxed by the rise
of new media that it agreed to sell itself to America Online in
January.
</P>
<P>
   And the News Corp., which owns the Fox network and endured an
expensive Internet flop in 1997, has kept a lower profile since
then. Fox now hopes to capitalize on the rollout of high-speed, or
broadband, Internet connections that are much better suited to
disseminating video signals than are conventional telephone lines.
One example of this strategy, already available, is
toohotforfox.com, a site that offers video outtakes from the Fox
network's so-called reality programming.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game is over, and the major media companies didn't win
it,'' said Peter Chernin, News Corp.'s president. ``We didn't win.
Disney didn't win. AOL and Yahoo did. So we're going to the next
game, which is broadband, and that's wide open.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the three big broadcast networks are reassessing
their strategies. NBCi, which recently said ad sales would fall
short of Wall Street's expectations, now plans to scrap the the
heavily promoted Snap name and more than a dozen other brands and
focus on a redesigned site under the name NBCi.com. And Disney,
recognizing the futility of going portal-to-portal with either
Yahoo or AOL and learning from the success of its own ESPN.com,
plans to focus its Web effort on entertainment and leisure
activities.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ESPN.com is the top sports site, followed by CBS Sportsline,
both of which are incessantly promoted on their networks'
sportscasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are focused on the marriage of the Internet and on-air,''
said Fred Reynolds, Viacom's chief financial officer, who held the
same position at CBS, where he looked after the Internet
activities.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, CBS' Web strategy may be the one that is likely to
change the least. All along, the company tended to buy partial
stakes in specialized Internet sites like Sportsline in return for
broadcast advertising time rather than cash. And much of that
advertising comes not from the network's inventory of 30-second
commercials, but within the programming itself. ``Every time Dan
Rather introduces the business news from MarketWatch, we get
credit,'' Reynolds said.
</P>
<P>
   There are also early signs that the networks are figuring out
how to create Web sites tied to their broadcast entertainment
programming. Traffic is brisk at the sites for CBS' hit shows
``Survivor''
(www.cbs.com/network/tvshows/mini/survivor/index.shtml) and ``Big
Brother''
(http://webcenter.bigbrother2000.aol.com/entertainment/NON/), the
latter featuring video feeds of contestants 24 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   And ABC has developed Web programming meant for viewers to
browse while watching certain programs. Some 150,000 people compete
during each ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' broadcast, for
example, to see if they can answer the questions before the
contestant does. Not only does that site earn a profit from the
Internet ads it sells, but ABC believes it also helps build a loyal
TV audience.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, it appears that the networks are concluding that
their best bets for the Web may spring from individual programs,
rather than their entire programming portfolio. Ah, the virtues of
hindsight.
</P>
<P>
   What has been much harder has been to figure out the digital
incarnation of the networks themselves. CBS, NBC and ABC are some
of the most powerful brands in the country, but what exactly do
they stand for with ``.com'' affixed to the end?
</P>
<P>
   A major television network is, after all, an aggregation of many
types of programming _ news sports, comedy, drama and, these days,
voyeurism. So it seemed natural that the corollary of the network
in the Digital Age was the Internet portal _ a one-stop shop full
of entertainment and information, bundled with a search engine and
lots of other useful features like news and e-mail. Portals were
doubly appealing because, then as now, they get the lion's share of
the traffic and advertising revenue on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But once they waded in, the networks soon found themselves up to
their knees in a swamp of tedious portal necessities like building
business directories and creating retail transaction services that
have little to do with the media companies' expertise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned I don't want to sell insurance or create a yellow
pages,'' Eisner said. After a year of struggling to beat Yahoo at
its own game, Eisner decided earlier this year to pull back from
the portal business. ``It's not us. Our company stands for travel
and entertainment and having a good time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   NBC, by contrast, is still focused on building a broad portal.
But the emphasis will be on shopping.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't be all things to all people, and that was NBCi's
problem,'' said Marty Yudkovitz, president of NBC Interactive
Media.
</P>
<P>
   Notably, the only network-affiliated portal that is growing
rapidly is Viacom-CBS' Iwon.com, which has no explicit links to the
CBS network. In less than a year that site, which promises users
the chance to win as much as $10 million, has grown to a monthly
audience of 8.4 million people, according to Media Metrix.
</P>
<P>
   Now CBS is considering buying or building a broader portal to
present a unified view of its 200 local stations and its affiliated
Internet sites. But Reynolds said the company would not give up its
strict financial discipline that kept it from entering the sort of
deals its rivals did.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not be a second citizen online,'' he said. ``We are
willing to invest a lot of money, but at the end of the day you
have to have a business that produces more cash than you spend.''

INTERNET IN JAPAN IS RIDING A WIRELESS WAVE
</HEADLINE>
 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ To understand how different the development of the
Internet has been in Japan than in the United States, consider the
plight of Hiroaki Kobayashi.
</P>
<P>
   A veteran telecommunications entrepreneur who started one of the
first modem companies in Japan and then sold it to AT&AMP;T, Kobayashi
is now the president and founder of Tokyo Metallic, a struggling
Japanese provider of high-speed, or broadband, Internet access
lines.
</P>
<P>
   His company is trying to jump start the development of a type of
broadband telephone-line technology known as digital subscriber
loop, or DSL. But while Internet access through DSL is booming in
the United States, Kobayashi's business is barely sputtering. There
are fewer than 1,000 DSL customers in Japan, split between his
company and one lone competitor.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the incumbent Bell phone companies and
their start-up competitors, known as CLEC's, are now closing in on
a million DSL subscribers nationally, according to the Cahners
Instat market research group. And Internet access by high-speed
cable television lines is quickly reaching even higher numbers in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But in Japan, Tokyo Metallic's tiny band of entrepreneurs is
facing many obstacles, not the least of which is the giant Japanese
telephone company Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, which currently
has a competing strategy for wiring Japan with high-speed fiber
optic cables.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the Japanese telephone industry invested heavily in an
early version of a digital technology known as ISDN _ a type of
phone service much slower than DSL and only slightly faster than
modem data sent over a standard, analog phone line that many people
in the United States still use for Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   Although NTT has recently made overtures to the American DSL
companies, industry executives said that the telecom giant was in
no rush to invest in DSL _ in part because it is still anxious to
retrieve its investment in ISDN.
</P>
<P>
   For all the landline forces working against him, though, the
biggest challenge to Kobayashi's vision of wiring Japan has nothing
to do with wires at all. Just the opposite, in fact. The Japanese
are heading onto the Internet in droves _ by wireless means.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, according to InfoCom Research, there are between 20
million and 27 million Internet users in Japan, or approximately
one of every five people in the nation. Of that number, nearly half
_ some 10 million _ are connecting to the Internet wirelessly. Of
these wireless customers, 7.5 million are using a service called
i-mode, offered by NTT DoCoMo, NTT's wireless division. For nearly
two of three i-mode users, this wireless link is their only method
of access to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   InfoCom forecasts that the percent of Japanese population
connected wirelessly to the Internet will increase to more than 85
percent by 2003, compared with only about 60 percent connected by
fixed-line networks.
</P>
<P>
   That trend suggests that people here are likely to use and
experience the Internet much differently than they do in the United
States, where so far only a fraction of Internet users have
wireless access.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's wireless Internet explosion was set off last year by the
introduction of NTT DoCoMo's i-mode cellular phones, which are
capable of sending and receiving data. And now competing with the
i-modes are an increasingly popular type of cellular phone known as
PHS that supports data speeds of 64,000 bits a second _ as fast as
the wired, ISDN digital phone lines here.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, Japan is now moving quickly to a second generation
of wireless Internet technology, which promises higher data speeds
and a variety of location-sensing commercial services that are
likely to be embraced by business customers.
</P>
<P>
   But this is far more than a business revolution. One has only to
sit in a Japanese subway car watching teen-agers communicating via
the Internet cell phones, or wander the stores of the Akihabara,
Tokyo's electronics district, where there are literally hundreds of
different voice, data and data-voice handset models on display, to
grasp the momentum of the wireless Net in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   In advertisements and in interviews, Keiji Tachikawa, chief
executive and president of NTT DoCoMo, has been sketching out his
vision of a next-generation digital cellular network to be
initiated early next year, when DoCoMo plans to offer five types of
wireless Internet access devices that will further blur the line
between cell phones and computers.
</P>
<P>
   It is a prophecy that has led many observers of the Internet in
Japan to conclude that the wired world may increasingly become an
afterthought for most Internet users here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Japan is more mobile and less people are home,'' said Joichi
Ito, an Internet pioneer in Japan who now heads Neoteny, a
Tokyo-based Internet business incubator. ``Most people don't have
living rooms here, and wiring is very high-cost.''
</P>
<P>
   There are also other cultural factors that explain the wireless
versus wired split. Andrew Seybold, an American wireless expert who
visited here this summer to study the Japanese wireless market,
points to a variety of reasons that the wireless Internet has taken
faster, firmer root in Japan than in the United States: better
wireless coverage, pricing on a par with prices for wired service
and the fact that for many people, particularly teen-agers, the
wireless phone is their only phone.
</P>
<P>
   Seybold also noted the strong cultural factors that have driven
the success of the i-mode phone in Japan, particularly popular
``killer applications,'' like train schedules, wireless banking and
games.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese designers seem to have understood the user interface
issues in a way that American designers have not, Seybold said.
``In Japan you can get to the train schedule with two clicks,'' he
said. ``When I try to find a plane flight on a U.S. cell phone, I
have to go through seven menu levels before I can even enter the
flight number.''
</P>
<P>
   One likely consequence of the diverging approaches to the Web is
that Japan, and by extension Asia, may be reaching the next
generation of the Internet far sooner than the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Whether that means that the next generation of technology
innovation and competitive advantage will follow the Web westward
across the Pacific Ocean remains to be seen. Meanwhile, Hiroaki
Kobayashi can only hope that Tokyo Metallic does not become
completely swamped by the wireless wave. &QL;

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Listening to NetRadio.com's Woodstock 69 music channel or
KBAC-FM, Santa Fe's jazz and eclectic radio station, or some other
music program over the Internet is gaining popularity among people
who spend lots of time online. But delivering simultaneous streams
of music to thousands or even millions of listeners over an
ever-more-clogged Internet has become increasingly frustrating. If
the audio stream hits too many traffic jams, the listener may find
his Internet radio program stuttering or stopping midway through a
song.
</P>
<P>
   One promising remedy involves sending the stream up to a
satellite, hopping over most of the jam ups on the ground and
landing the music stream at a network hub closer to the listener.
</P>
<P>
   That is how Viacom's MTV Networks is helping move the feed from
SonicNet.com _ one of 18 MTV Web sites _ to the ears of its
Internet audience. SonicNet beams its audio stream to the Loral
Skynet Telstar 7 satellite from a station in Tulsa, Okla.
</P>
<P>
   The satellite feeds SonicNet's programming to antennas around
the country, converting it back to an Internet signal that is
distributed to 135 network hubs operated by America Online,
Excite(AT)Home and other Internet service providers. Those
providers then pass it along through conventional cables or
telephone lines to people at their PC's.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't care if it's delivered by satellite, fiber or carrier
pigeon; we care about cost,'' said Nicholas Butterworth, president
and chief executive of the MTVi Group, MTV's Internet unit. He made
clear, though, that he was still monitoring the results. ``So far
the satellite service has proven valuable,'' Butterworth said,
``but over the long term, who knows?''
</P>
<P>
   MTVi is using competing ground-based distribution services from
companies like Akamai Technologies and Digital Island to improve
the reception of its Internet music and video programs.
</P>
<P>
   The iBeam Broadcasting Corp., which provides the satellite
service to MTVi, said it had signed up 250 Internet content
providers the last nine months, since it started operating its
network of satellites and fiber to bypass traffic jams on the
terrestrial Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Entertainment and news providers like MSNBC Cable News, another
iBeam customer, want to see their Web content delivered to users in
the fastest, most efficient way possible and are willing to pay for
such service. IBeam charges the companies monthly fees of $4,600 or
more.
</P>
<P>
   IBeam, which had a public stock offering in May, reported a loss
of $33.1 million for the second quarter on revenue of $3.4 million.
The company has several competitors that offer _ or plan to offer _
satellite service as a way for Internet content companies to rise
above the network fray.
</P>
<P>
   For several years, some overseas Internet service providers have
used satellite links as a way to connect to the United States'
Internet backbone. But the use of satellite distribution by
American Web content companies as a way to gain speed and
efficiency is still a new business, though it is an approach
similar to the way cable and broadcast TV networks have distributed
programming to cable operators and local stations for more than two
decades.
</P>
<P>
   IBeam and its rivals, including Cidera, InterPacket and NetSat
Express, contend that the Internet is a hostile network environment
for streaming media, the Internet term for video and audio that is
viewed or heard as it is transmitted, rather than being received
and stored on the user's PC before being played.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet was not designed to do what we're asking it to do
_ to distribute something that looks like TV or sounds like a CD,''
said Peter B. Desnoes, iBeam's chief executive. He notes that a
three-minute video stream requires a total data transfer of nearly
10 million bytes _ roughly 800 times more than a typical Web page.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way to solve it is to go around the Internet itself,''
Desnoes said. ``We have built a very complex private network that
includes satellite elements that sends content out to the edge.''
</P>
<P>
   The public Internet architecture is simply not designed to
handle large audiences of simultaneous users who, for example,
might tune into Internet Webcasts. Nor are the built-in backup
systems. If a few packets of data are lost in the transmission of
an e-mail message or a Web page, the Internet's software
automatically finds them and replaces them. But in the case of a
video transmission, resending packets to replace lost data can make
for a choppy picture.
</P>
<P>
   For video traveling from a single point to many, ``nothing beats
satellite,'' said Robert Fagin, Internet, infrastructure and
services analyst at Bear, Stearns.
</P>
<P>
   Bear, Stearns forecasts a $48 billion market for streaming media
by 2010, up from $1.3 billion today, with perhaps 30 percent of the
flow being delivered by third-party service providers _ whether
satellite players or companies that offer land-based route-around
solutions.
</P>
<P>
   Cidera, a satellite-delivery company based in Laurel, Md.,
predicts that audience demand for streaming media will be so strong
that content providers and Internet service companies alike will be
willing to pay companies like Cidera to ensure a smooth and steady
flow of streaming media.
</P>
<P>
   Ramachandran Viswanathan, Cidera's vice president for marketing,
said Internet service providers recognized that ``streaming media
is like a tsunami wave about to break on them.''
</P>
<P>
   Even when people have high-speed Internet connections like the
DSL service available through telephone companies, they can find
that streaming media can be slowed or disrupted by bottlenecks on
the Internet, said Bill Collatos, a venture capitalist.
</P>
<P>
   Collatos is a founding managing general partner of Spectrum
Equity, a $3 billion firm in Boston that has invested in Orblynx
Inc. of Fairfax, Va., a company that, with the help of Intelsat,
has developed technology for distributing Internet content by
satellite.
</P>
<P>
   For the public, investment opportunities are still limited.
IBeam shares were offered at $10 in May, and reached nearly $28 in
early June, before falling back. They closed at $10.1875 on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Cidera, InterPacket and NetSat Express have all registered for
public offerings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, but
have not set dates for proceeding. Meanwhile, competition is on the
way from several big, established satellite companies, including
Intelsat and PanAmSat, which are putting their own Internet-content
delivery networks into service.
</P>
<P>
   IBeam appears to be ahead of the others in its service concept,
which goes beyond delivery and includes flourishes like adding
other material to the information stream. For MTVi, for example,
iBeam can insert advertising into the live streams, tailored to
individual subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are a cat owner, you will get a cat commercial,''
Desnoes said. ``We provide those services.''
</P>
<P>
   The economics of the business models are still to be proved by
iBeam and the other start-ups, which lease satellite capacity
rather than operate their own spacecraft.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Stanyard, the principal consultant at the British firm DTT
Consulting, has studied the use of satellites with the Internet for
more than three years. He said that the most that a company like
Cidera could expect to charge an Internet service provider was $250
a month _ a figure that he said in some cases might not cover the
cost of providing the service. ``It becomes difficult to get your
money back,'' Stanyard said.
</P>
<P>
   But Collatos, the venture capitalist, remains guardedly
optimistic about the Internet satellite companies. ``All are early
stage and they will miss their plans; it's inevitable,'' he
acknowledged. ``But fundamentally, the concept they have is
sound.''

 &HT;    CLINTON MUST EMBRACE GORE _ BUT NOT TOO CLOSELY
 &HT;    Eds: Reworks story filed Thursday to add later Clinton events;
shifts dateline, trims some material.
 &HT;    700&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS and SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Two years after enmeshing his fellow Democrats in
a scandal that shook the nation, President Clinton is poised to
deliver a triumphant valedictory address Monday night to a party
reborn.
</P>
<P>
   When he speaks to the Democratic National Convention in Los
Angeles, however, Clinton must do more than burnish an imperfect
legacy by touting his role presiding over eight years of peace and
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   He must somehow make Americans believe it couldn't have happened
without Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has to tell them that the last eight years have been the
greatest achievement since sliced bread, and that Al Gore was an
integral part of that success,'' said political scientist Gary
Segura of Claremont Graduate University, Claremont, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   For months now, at political fund-raisers, campaign speeches and
press conferences, Clinton has labored to give Gore his due,
portraying the vice president as a man of integrity and a full
partner in the policies behind the administration's successes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has made an absolutely incalculable contribution to
whatever good we've accomplished in the White House,'' Clinton said
at a Democratic fund-raiser in Washington in June.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond lip service, helping Gore has always been a complicated
trick for Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The closer Gore stands to the charismatic Clinton, for one
thing, the more vice-presidential he looks.
</P>
<P>
   That's one reason Gore won't be seen at all with Clinton in Los
Angeles. The two will meet instead at a rally Tuesday in Michigan,
where Clinton will charge his No. 2 with the mission of keeping the
keys to the White House in Democratic hands.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard also for Gore to cozy up to Clinton's coattails
without smudging his own attire.
</P>
<P>
   It was two years ago this week that Clinton went before the
nation to confess that he had an ``inappropriate'' relationship
with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky, after publicly
denying it for eight tumultuous months.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton survived a bid to remove him from office. But
Republicans want Gore to pay the price for standing by his boss and
calling Clinton ``a man I believe will be regarded in the history
books as one of our greatest presidents'' on the night the House
voted impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our generation has a chance to reclaim some essential values,
to show we have grown up before we grow old,'' presidential nominee
George W. Bush told the GOP convention. ``But when the moment for
leadership came, this administration did not teach our children, it
disillusioned them.''
</P>
<P>
   Some pundits have suggested that Clinton owes it to Gore to make
clear in his speech that his personal conduct had nothing to do
with his vice president.
</P>
<P>
   But there's nothing in Clinton's past to suggest that he would
turn a celebration of the life and times of the man from Hope into
yet another public confessional, and White House spokesman Joe
Lockhart dismissed such speculation as ``hot air.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is his valedictory speech, his swan song,'' said
government professor Phil Klinkner of Hamilton College in Clinton,
N.Y. ``For him to bring up something that is clearly the low point
of his political career, the low point of his personal life, it's
probably not something he would want to dwell on.''
</P>
<P>
   The odds that Clinton will raise the topic Monday were
diminished by the president's extraordinary confessional last week
before a ministers conference in suburban Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm now in the second year of a process of trying to totally
rebuild my life from a terrible mistake I made,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   And in a bid to distance Gore from the scandal, Clinton said
that his vice president ``doesn't get enough credit for what we did
together that is good, and surely, no fair-minded person would
blame him for any mistake that I made.''
</P>
<P>
   Since arriving in Los Angeles on Friday, Clinton has taken
further steps to accommodate Gore. Amid concerns that his packed
pre-convention schedule would overshadow Gore's campaign message,
the president canceled a round of televised interviews Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Many of his events, including high-dollar fund-raisers with some
of Hollywood's biggest stars, have been closed to the press.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   What Clinton has been stressing in recent speeches is his role
in turning the country around and the importance of avoiding a
U-turn toward the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1992, the country was in trouble,'' Clinton told supporters
at a fund-raising dinner for the U.S. Senate campaign of First Lady
Hillary Rodham Clinton in McLean, Va., last Wednesday night. ``I
mean, our backs were against the wall.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton gets much public credit for the longest and largest
economic expansion in the country's history, even though it began
in March 1991, nearly two years before he took office.
</P>
<P>
   On his watch, though, the economy has generated 22 million new
jobs. Over the past year alone the economy has grown a blistering 6
percent, after adjusting for moderate inflation of just above 2
percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton gets some credit, as well, for the dramatic turnaround
in the federal budget, which was $290 billion in the red in 1992
and is on track to be $211 billion in the black this year. Surely
Clinton will make the case Monday that he has led the charge on
policies that have helped take the budget from record deficit to a
record surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, though, has no plans to step into the shadows. He has
set aside the entire month of September for high-profile battles
with the Republican-led Congress over next year's budget, as well
as banner Democratic issues such as the quest for a so-called
patient's bill of rights, a minimum wage hike and increased gun
controls.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to have a very healthy debate in the month of
September, where the president tries to get these things
accomplished,'' said Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   In his convention speech, he's sure to attack GOP tax cut
proposals _ which the White House projects would amount to nearly
$2 trillion over the coming decade _ saying the changes would risk
throwing the nation back into a cycle of deficits. Under ``the Gore
plan,'' Clinton will likely point out, the country could pay off
its $3.2 trillion worth of publicly held debt by the year 2012.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton isn't likely to leave Los Angeles, though, without
employing his considerable rhetorical gifts to cast his own legacy
in the most favorable light possible. Nor is he likely to resist
taking a jab at those who scoffed at his prospects eight years ago,
when as the governor of Arkansas he appeared at the Democratic
National Convention to embark on his own campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other side kind of referred to me as a governor of a small
Southern state, and I was so naive I thought it was a compliment,''
Clinton told the NAACP last month. ``You know what,'' he asked, ``I
still do.''

 &HT;    TNT original `Bull' looking marketable
 &HT;    By Drew Jubera
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Money is the root of all TV, so it's a wonder TV and
Wall Street took so long to get together.
</P>
<P>
   But they're together now: ``Bull,'' the first original series
from Atlanta-based TNT (not counting wrestling), debuts Tuesday
night, and Fox counters in November with ``The $treet,'' an almost
note-for-note lifting of this year's market mayhem feature movie
``Boiler Room.''
</P>
<P>
   There's always been something congenitally chilly about Wall
Street's place in the popular culture: its DNA has had more in
common with bill changers than flesh and blood. But CNBC turned the
Street into a spectator sport, and now TNT turns it into a
melodrama, with worthy, if not quite bullish, results.
</P>
<P>
   Created with veteran know-how by Michael Chernuchin (``Law &AMP;
Order,'' ``Brooklyn South''), ``Bull'' begins as a Goliath v. Li'l
Goliath tale. Ditto (baby-faced George Newbern), grandson of the
firm's founder, is disillusioned with the creepy, calcified ways
Grandpa runs things, and so sets out with a band of young turks to
start his own company. It's risky: By striking out on his own,
Ditto might not be impossibly wealthy for the rest of his life.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, well, life is risk. These young, cocky traders ditch the
shark's nest they know for the one they don't, and it doesn't take
long for seasoned shark eater Hunter Lasky (Stanley Tucci) to smell
their blood. But all ethics on the Street are situational, and
before you know it, the new firm wants to hire Lasky. Why? He can
show them the money.
</P>
<P>
   Ditto's grandfather, known as the Kaiser (Donald Moffat), is
this drama's most obvious immoral center. As with John Houseman in
that famous Merrill Lynch commercial, when the Kaiser speaks,
people listen. In fact, he's much like Houseman in every way but
one. He has the same jowly, scrubbed-pink face; the same flaring,
Pegasus-wing eyebrows; the same calibrated speech that commands as
it condescends.
</P>
<P>
   But where Houseman was inscrutable, the Kaiser is pure,
blue-blooded evil _ Gordon Gekko without the mousse. ``The one
reason God put us on this planet,'' he rallies the troops, ``is to
make money.'' Sort of makes Gekko's ``greed is good'' battle cry
sound like one of the Ten Commandments.
</P>
<P>
   It is in relation to the Kaiser _ and his
villainous-with-a-capital-V son-in-law (Larry Miller) _ that
everyone else's scruples are judged. They're illegal insider
trading tip isn't as bad as his insider trading tip; they're
sleeping with the enemy isn't as bad as his sleeping _ in the
back-stabbing sense _ with the enemy. Good and bad here can be a
messy distinction we hope the series is smart enough to explore.
</P>
<P>
   The troupe of renegades is more compelling than either the
Kaiser's too-blunt bad-guy role or Ditto's blandly indistinct
guerrilla leadership. There's a likeably smirky boyishness to the
boys _ cinched up in their suits with their hair slightly mussed,
they look the way we imagine they did when their mothers dressed
them up for their eighth-grade class photos.
</P>
<P>
   Carson (Christopher Wiehl) is a farm-boy newcomer; Corey (Malik
Yoba) the cool up-and-comer; Marty (Ian Kahn) not nearly as smart
as he thinks.
</P>
<P>
   The women are necessarily harder; this is a boy's club, after
all. Marissa (Alicia Coppola) is the up-from-nothing single mom;
Allison (Elisabeth Rohm) is Ditto's tough right hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bull'' is part of TNT's continuing strategy to reach a
broader, younger viewership, and it often seems so narrowly focused
on a wide audience that it fails to make the leap into something
memorable.
</P>
<P>
   But pretty good here is often good enough, and maybe, with time,
the network will trust enough in its audience to take it someplace
special.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Republicans on MSNBC's ``Equal Time'' were
having a hard time depicting the smiling, smooth-faced guy in
glasses and a brown suit _ the one trying in vain to offer an
opinion _ as being in league with Al Gore's ``slaughterhouse
killers.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, that nice Joe Andrew, the chairman of the Democratic
National Committee, who will bring the gavel down to start his
party's convention in Los Angeles on Monday, did manage to break
into the conversation a couple of times.
</P>
<P>
   When Oliver North asked, ``Is Joe Lieberman going to the Playboy
bunny club on the Feast of the Blessed Virgin,'' referring to a
convention-week fund-raiser unsanctioned by the party, Andrew
sighed and said no. ``I'd love to stop it but I can't,'' he said .
</P>
<P>
   Then he exchanged ideas on the issues with Jim Nicholson,
chairman of the Republican National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholson: ``Is Joe Lieberman going to work in the
slaughterhouse?'' _ as Gore's wild-talking campaign manager, Donna
Brazile, recently called their headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew: ``It's called the kitchen'' _ the Gore campaign's name
for its ``war room.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicholson: ``No, it's killers in the kitchen.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrew: ``The only killers in this process are Dick Cheney.''
</P>
<P>
   Not quite as tame as he looks, but not entirely comfortable with
the zingers, either. After the show, Andrew tried a little friendly
chitchat on Nicholson: ``Hey, they didn't even need us in there,
did they?''
</P>
<P>
   What he got back, though, was the tight smile of an airline
passenger engrossed in a really good book and hoping to discourage
instant intimacy without being totally rude.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew whispered, ``I'm always the one who asks about his kids''
_ not the other way around. He often sounds surprised by the
brusqueness of life in the capital, having arrived here with his
wife and two children just last year, ``plucked from the obscurity
of the cornfields of Indiana,'' as he puts it.
</P>
<P>
   But then Andrew did not get his job because he is an old
smoothie, or particularly good at acting bad. He got it in part
because the party's heaviest hitters were not begging to take over
at a time when the national committee was going broke, but also
because he had turned around the state operation in Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   He loves to tell the story of how, on his first day in the
Washington job, he took some union officials to lunch and handed
the waiter his brand-new corporate credit card: ``They came back to
the table and said, `I'm sorry, Andrew, but your card has been
rejected.' I didn't know we hadn't been able to pay Visa for six
months.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then he seems to have excelled at the unsexy business of
cutting costs, upgrading the party's online efforts and taking care
of Democrats around the country _ while the better-known general
party chairman, Ed Rendell, handles fund raising.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew's ``boring, difficult, unpopular'' cuts helped get the
operation back in the black last year, as one party operative put
it. And Andrew has emerged as a favorite of unions and state
parties, which like his regular-guyness and do not care if he fails
to dazzle on cable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe Andrew has been a shot of adrenaline,'' said Judith Hope,
chairwoman of the New York State Democratic Party. ``It means a lot
to those of us in the trenches that he's been there himself.''
</P>
<P>
   The humble-Hoosier routine is no put-on. After an initial
meeting with a reporter, in which his behavior was correct in the
extreme, he asked an associate, ``Do you think I came on too
strong?'' But he is also better connected than his frequent
references to cornfields would suggest.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, one of those six-degrees-of-separation diagrams that
showed all Hollywood linked to Winona Ryder might work for Joe
Andrew in Washington. Gore's new running mate, Sen. Joseph
Lieberman, had Andrew in class as a Yale undergraduate and
recommended him for his current job.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew once worked on a legal case with William M. Daley of
Chicago, who is running Gore's campaign. He is close to Jesse
Jackson, whom he got to know because Jackson regularly attended
Black Expo, an annual cultural festival in Indianapolis. He has
worked for Sen. Evan Bayh of Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   That is how he got to know a bunch of people with ties to Gore _
including Bob Squier, Gore's longtime media consultant, who died
earlier this year, and Carter Eskew, Gore's top consultant. Ron
Klain, Gore's former chief of staff, is a fellow Hoosier whom
Andrew knows from Indianapolis _ a networking hot spot, it would
seem. And Klain also had a hand in bringing him into Goreworld.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In a long interview over dinner, Andrew, 40, said it was
politics that had gotten him interested in the wider world in his
hometown of Poe, Ind., population 87, where he was one of nine
children in a Republican family
</P>
<P>
   His father, a barber who went back to school and became a
doctor, moved the family to ``an actual corn-and-soybean farm,'' as
Andrew called it. ``His idea was to be a gentleman farmer,'' he
said of his father, ``but when they divorced, it became a real
farm.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of a Newt Gingrich story,'' Andrew said, with a
partisan spin even on the story of how his father left the family.
</P>
<P>
   After that, his mother, a former teacher whom he described as
``a woman who likes a good glass of wine and a Shakespeare
festival'' had to learn how to farm. ``My entire adolescence was
spent mowing weeds,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His escape, his passion, his entertainment and probably his
rebellion were Democratic politics _ as inspired by Robert F.
Kennedy. At age 12, his idea of fun was to go to the mall and slap
bumper stickers for local Democratic candidates on the cars of
unsuspecting shoppers. The Allen County party headquarters became
his hangout.
</P>
<P>
   About that time, a ``very liberal'' teacher began encouraging
him to shoot for Yale University, mostly because a local man had
set up a scholarship to that school, Andrew said, and that is how
he went to college. He later graduated from Yale Law School.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, he met Lieberman. ``But for Lieberman,'' he
said, modestly, ``I would never had gotten involved in any of it.''

 c.2000 New York Times    
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Much has now been written about how the selection of Joseph
Lieberman as a vice presidential candidate breaks the last taboo
and shows how we Jews are now full members of the American
mainstream. To me, it has proved something quite different: just
how vulnerable and insecure we remain. And, depending on how things
play out in November, it may show how insecure and vigilant we
still should be.
</P>
<P>
   Take the initial reaction to the news. Jews everywhere were
instantly on their telephones, friends calling friends, parents
calling children, children calling parents, all prompted by the
same reactions: joy, yes, but also disbelief. We had been assuming
that Lieberman was, like another member of Gore's ``short list,''
Gov. Jean Shaheen of New Hampshire, mere window dressing to humor a
key Democratic constituency.
</P>
<P>
   Even younger Jews had accepted that a Jew on a national
political ticket was something they would never see. Our amazement
at finding we had been wrong was a reminder _ a surprising, telling
reminder _ that for all of our successes, we still felt like
outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   The first incredulity was quickly followed by two equally
revealing phenomena: an almost servile gratitude and a kind of
tribal, uncritical chauvinism. Many American Jews find Lieberman
vaguely discomfiting. We squirm at his conspicuous religiosity, his
constant references to God, which sound so, well, Christian to less
observant Jews. Besides, any friend of William Bennett and Jerry
Falwell is not a friend of ours (though of course the very public
piety we find so distasteful in them we are suddenly willing to
accept from Lieberman).
</P>
<P>
   But given our own deep-seated, atavistic insecurity, we are
willing to overlook these differences. Long ago, a much more
politically primitive and powerless Jewish community loudly
applauded when both the famously progressive Louis D. Brandeis and
the more conservative Felix Frankfurter joined the Supreme Court;
philosophy mattered less than raw ethnic identity and pride. The
reaction to Lieberman suggests that things have not really changed
that much.
</P>
<P>
   Along with what Jews think of themselves, there is the matter of
what others think of us.
</P>
<P>
   When Lieberman's wife, Hadassah, spoke of her mother's time in
Auschwitz and Dachau and her father's experiences in a Nazi labor
camp, a large part of me choked up with pride. In one generation,
we have emerged from unspeakable degradation and approached the
threshold of the White House. But the old fears die hard; at the
same time, I couldn't help but wonder whether other Americans
really wanted to hear what she was saying. How many were thinking,
``Enough already with the Holocaust,'' or even something worse?
</P>
<P>
   Tolerance is in; both parties talk endlessly of ``inclusion.''
But American tolerance is about to be put to a momentous political
test. I'm worried less about the white supremacists whose
anti-Semitic rhetoric now fills the chat rooms. They probably don't
vote in any case, or don't vote Democratic, or don't vote in the
crucial swing states. I'm thinking of the apparently reasonable,
upstanding, ostensibly open-minded and tolerant men and women who,
in the privacy of the voting booth might suddenly realize they
can't abide a Jew just a heartbeat away from the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   America has been good to the Jews. But more than ever before,
Jews are about to learn just how high America's beautiful and
spacious skies really reach, and we may not like what we learn. The
selection of Lieberman is not only a moment of triumph for American
Jews. It is also a moment of truth.

 By THEODORE C. SORENSEN    
 c.2000 New York Times    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The last Democratic Convention in Los Angeles nominated John F.
Kennedy in 1960. Some in George W. Bush's camp say this race is
Kennedy-Nixon all over again, but with Bush as the fresh face
challenging the two-term vice president. Bush even included footage
of Kennedy in the video that preceded his nomination speech.
</P>
<P>
   But another Jack Kennedy? Governor, let me say this ...
</P>
<P>
   Despite superficial similarities, JFK and George W. could hardly
be more different _ in preparation for global leadership, concern
for the least fortunate and devotion to public service.
</P>
<P>
   Both men came from influential, affluent political dynasties,
with ambitious fathers full of advice, and earned Ivy League
degrees. But Kennedy adopted neither his father's policies nor his
advisers, nor was he less than proud of own his intellectual
training.
</P>
<P>
   Both men delivered vigorous acceptance addresses in mostly
moderate tones, at ease on both television and the hustings. But
Kennedy, having never veered from the center during the primaries,
had no need to backpedal at the convention or to conceal his
party's record in Congress. He waged a campaign of ideas, not vague
applause lines, proposing a Peace Corps and an Alliance for
Progress with Latin America and calling for an end to racism and
the nuclear arms race. The New Frontier, Kennedy said, was ``not a
set of promises'' but ``a set of challenges ... not what I intend
to offer the American people, but what I intend to ask of them ...
appeal(ing) to their pride, not their pocketbooks.''
</P>
<P>
   Respectful of the presidency, Kennedy criticized the incumbent
administration only on policy grounds, never personal ones.
</P>
<P>
   Like Bush, Kennedy invoked compassion. But to Kennedy,
articulating what he called ``a choice between ... the public
interest and private comfort,'' compassion could never have
included a $1.3 trillion tax cut disproportionately favoring
wealthy families like his own, or a Supreme Court making decisions
unfriendly to the interests of women and minorities, or leaving
health coverage for seniors, children and the poor to the private
market.
</P>
<P>
   Both men had a religious upbringing. But Kennedy preferred not
to wear his religion on his sleeve, and he believed no clergyman
should instruct voters or public officials in their civic duties.
He believed taxpayer money should support only public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Both men emphasized strengthening our military. But Kennedy also
emphasized our alliances, our multilateral treaty obligations and
our participation in international organizations. Having
experienced the horrors of war, he sought a comprehensive nuclear
test ban.
</P>
<P>
   He, too, might have failed a surprise quiz on the names of four
relatively obscure foreign leaders. But he would have been able to
discuss in depth the political and economic situation in all four
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy in 1960, like Bush in 2000, represented the party then
in control of Congress, which had blocked the incumbent president's
initiatives and hurled invective at the vice president. But
Kennedy's years of experience in Washington matched those of his
opponent, and his views were already clear to most voters. He was
challenging an administration plunging into recession, not one
basking in prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy selected a running mate, Lyndon Johnson, residing
outside his own home state and with a congressional voting record
close to the center. Far from being anointed by the leaders in his
party, Kennedy came from behind, beholden to no one.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's handlers should reconsider inviting comparisons with
Kennedy. These differences make a difference.
</P>

Kennedy, practices law in New York City.)

`AN OBEDIENT FATHER': AN INDIAN STEW OF CORRUPTION, HUMAN AND
SOCIAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes are at end of review.) 
 By RICHARD EDER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Don't cry even though you cry such handsome tears.''
</P>
<P>
   The bitter words belong to Radha, the wife of Ram Karan. On a
holiday Ram had ignored her frantic telegrams about their first
baby's illness, finally returning to Delhi only to dissolve in
remorse when he finds that the child had died.
</P>
<P>
   Weeper of handsome tears: It perfectly sums up Akhil Sharma's
cunning, dismaying and beautifully conceived portrait of a corrupt
man in a corrupt society. For both, the corruption is double. On
the surface it is a matter of arrangements, reprehensible but with
a dose of comedy and forbearance.
</P>
<P>
   Ram is the uncomfortable but diligent bagman for a department
head in India's education ministry. He makes the rounds of school
principals, enjoying a good lunch with each and coming away with an
oblong packet wrapped in newspaper. Bribes nourish him and his
boss; they nourish the Congress Party that gave them their jobs and
whose long rule, in the telling of ``An Obedient Father,'' is
tightly woven into its intricate network of payoffs.
</P>
<P>
   So far, so bad; but perhaps so human as well. After all, India
has avoided the extremes of dictatorship; and Ram is in many ways a
nice man.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in the course of the 1947 partition, India and Pakistan saw
hundreds of thousands of Hindus and Muslims slaughtered in a mutual
massacre whose wounds _ Kashmir, extremist parties, two confronted
sets of nuclear weapons _ may prove lethal once more. As for Ram,
fat, tender and self-indulgent, he has committed the family
equivalent of civil war genocide: the repeated nightly rape of his
12-year-old daughter, Anita. This was also in the past (she is now
grown and keeps house for him) but, by the time the book ends, it
has proved lethal once more.
</P>
<P>
   Sharma's novel weaves the national into the personal without a
trace of the didactic. What is more astonishing is his success in
joining the amiably picaresque aspects of the corruption _ India's
and Ram's _ with the ghastly evil of its underside.
</P>
<P>
   There are the comically desultory dickerings and schemings among
the ministry officials, the ill-fated attempt of Ram's boss to
switch loyalty and bribes to the Congress Party's rivals, the
mournful intimacy that develops between a police spy and the man
whose telephone he is tapping. These are set among brief but
haunting glimpses of a larger India: street scenes, lovely circular
conversations, a bus ride from village to village. (The old men
squatting by the roadside stand up at the bus' approach, but turn
their backs to avoid humiliation in case it doesn't stop.)
</P>
<P>
   They are set, as well, among exhalations of charnel horror. A
politician casually mentions his partition role in loading a train
with thousands of dead Muslims and sending it north. A gang of
Hindu toughs prepares to massacre the Sikh owners of a store after
the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi. The wife emerges with two
children, washed and dressed for school. A rickshaw driver ignores
her terrified signal. It is a scene of sparse, tense anguish.
</P>
<P>
   Along comes Ram. He commandeers the rickshaw and sends off the
woman and her children. A brave and decent act. But why is he out
so early on streets all but deserted in the fear of rioting? To
fetch a holy man on the anniversary of the death of his wife,
Radha. Why the last-minute haste? To try to pacify Anita, whose
long-repressed rage ignites in a slow, multistaged explosion that
will destroy him.
</P>
<P>
   Years before, Radha had caught him with Anita. Screaming, she
beat him all night, then sent their daughter to live with
relatives, cautioning her to keep silent. Anita did, choking down
her hatred and returning silently home with Asha, her little
daughter, after her own husband's death. Then one night she finds
Ram, tipsy after a party at the house of his boss, Gupta, holding
Asha in an incipiently sexual embrace.
</P>
<P>
   Sharma's rendition of the confrontation is stunning
dramatically, psychologically and in terms of the social
constraints on Indian women. Anita is entirely dependent on Ram:
the reversal that will turn him into the obedient (destroyed, more
nearly) father of the title is like watching a building dynamited
in slow motion from within. Here is Anita's first piteous stammer:
``Mr. Gupta's party . . . You were drunk . . . I don't want . . . I
would kill Asha . . . I'm not joking . . . I would kill you . . . I
can't go anywhere . . . I have no other home.''
</P>
<P>
   Ram's first response is to apologize and console, as if he still
held that power. Over the days, as Anita grows into her fury, he
shrinks. There is rationalization: ``The crime against Anita was
decades old. Since then I had not repeated the crime with any other
child. Asha did not count because I was drunk and had been caught
before anything occurred.'' There is shame at what he did, but much
more at being found out. ``I did not actually believe that I would
ever be discovered, for I could not imagine the world after I had
been caught.''
</P>
<P>
   The world changes unimaginably. Ram curses himself in the
abasing words Anita requires; he pays her money and deeds her the
apartment. An oddly logical truce breaks down in new shame,
dramatized in a series of ghastly scenes that never lose their hold
on the novel's disorienting blend of irony, compassion and cold
moral gravity.
</P>
<P>
   ``An Obedient Father'' is hard, as well as rich and enthralling.
The initial rape scene is all but unbearable. (I think it was a
mistake to excerpt it in a recent issue of The New Yorker, lifted
from the novel's larger context.) Part of the hardness is a fix on
moral issues somewhat divergent from that in much of Western
literature (though the Greeks had it).
</P>
<P>
   Our tradition says, more or less: A person is evil and is or is
not punished, at some point internalizing the evil in the person.
Sharma's message is subtly different. Speaking with Andre Malraux
once, Nehru let drop the phrase ``An evil act has evil
consequences.'' It seems a tautology, but it is not. It steps back;
it is unsentimental and oddly liberating; it doesn't need to
forgive or condemn the person in order to lay the evil pitilessly
bare, and to punish it.

WRITERS ON WRITING: IMAGINATION GIVES RELIEF FROM REALITY 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALICE HOFFMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I was told I had cancer on a beautiful blue day in July. I was
out on Cape Cod, finishing the first draft of a novel, when the
telephone rang. I had thought it was about time for me to have a
bit of good luck, and when I heard my surgeon's voice I assumed I
was safe. In novels people were called into offices for bad news,
and anyway, it was far too gorgeous a day for tragedy. Roses were
in full bloom. Bees rumbled by the windowpanes, lazy with pollen
and heat.
</P>
<P>
   I was certain my doctor was phoning to tell me the biopsy had
come back negative, I was absolutely sure of it, but then she said,
``Alice, I'm sorry.'' I could hear the concern and sadness in her
voice, and I understood that some things are true no matter how and
when you're told. In a single moment, the world as I knew it
dropped away from me, leaving me on a far and distant planet, one
where there was no gravity and no oxygen and nothing made sense
anymore.
</P>
<P>
   It had been a bad few years for my family. My beloved
sister-in-law Jo Ann had lost a courageous battle with brain
cancer; my mother had suffered a severe stroke and then had been
diagnosed with breast cancer. I had spent two years completely
involved in the health care of several people I loved, finishing up
my novel ``Here on Earth'' during hours stolen so early in the
morning that the birds were still asleep.
</P>
<P>
   By the time ``Here on Earth'' was chosen as an Oprah Book Club
book, I myself was not feeling well. Two days after I returned from
Chicago, I reached down and felt a lump in my breast.
</P>
<P>
   All through my sister-in-law Jo Ann's illness I had been writing
short stories. I needed a fictional place to which I could escape
and had neither the time nor the psychic energy for a larger
project. But these were a novelist's stories, and they quickly
became interwoven, the tale of a family deep in the trenches of the
same sort of struggle my family now faced.
</P>
<P>
   I was at the hospital every day for months, and the world
outside, those people with plans _ the lovers, the new parents, the
students _ seemed far less real than the fictional world I was
creating.
</P>
<P>
   When Jo Ann asked me to find her a grave site, a heartbreaking
mission if ever there was one, my characters from ``Local Girls''
made a similar trek on the very same day, although they were far
wiser than I, and far more optimistic. Frankly, I don't know if I
could have made it through that particular afternoon without the
assistance of the women from ``Local Girls.''
</P>
<P>
   In my experience, ill people become more themselves, as if once
the excess was stripped away only the truest core of themselves
remained. In my sister-in-law Jo Ann's case, she became sweeter
with each day, a kinder and more compassionate person despite her
agony.
</P>
<P>
   My mother, always one to embrace life, was set to see ``Eyes
Wide Shut'' with her 18-year-old grandson on the day she died. My
other sister-in-law, Maryellen, diagnosed with breast cancer a few
weeks after I was, used her own medical background to become an
amazing researcher, as knowledgeable as any expert.
</P>
<P>
   And who was I at the very bottom of my soul, beneath skin and
blood and bones? I was not as kindhearted and gracious as Jo Ann,
not as fearless as my mother, not as capable and independent as
Maryellen.
</P>
<P>
   I knew who I was when I put my surgery off, a foolish thing to
do, and yet I felt compelled to finish the first draft of my new
novel. In a time when everything around me seemed completely out of
control, when lives were being cut short and fate seemed especially
cruel, I had the need to get to an ending of something. I was
desperate to know how things turned out, in fiction if not in life.
More than ever, more than anything, I was a writer.
</P>
<P>
   I removed myself from everyone but my closest friends and
family. I told almost no one about my illness, and instead turned
to what I had always found most healing.
</P>
<P>
   Writers don't choose their craft; they need to write in order to
face the world, and this was still true for me. Even now, writing
was a transcendent experience. When I became too ill to sit up for
long, I moved a futon into my office and went from desk to bed,
back and forth until the line between dreaming and writing was
nothing more than a thin, translucent thread.
</P>
<P>
   What was real and what was imagined became braided together. I
lived in my own world and the world of my book simultaneously. I
could lie on a table during a bone scan and yet slip into the river
where waterlilies floated downstream, feet sinking into the soft
mud. I could be walking through snowstorms, moonlight, fields of
roses, while receiving radiation.
</P>
<P>
   An insightful, experienced oncologist told me that cancer need
not be a person's whole book, only a chapter.
</P>
<P>
   Still, novelists know that some chapters inform all others.
These are the chapters of your life that wallop you and teach you
and bring you to tears, that invite you to step to the other side
of the curtain, the one that divides those of us who must face our
destiny sooner rather than later. What I was looking for during 10
months of chemotherapy and radiation was a way to make sense of
sorrow and loss.
</P>
<P>
   I wrote to find beauty and purpose, to know that love is
possible and lasting and real, to see day lilies and swimming
pools, loyalty and devotion, even though my eyes were closed and
all that surrounded me was a darkened room.
</P>
<P>
   I wrote because that was who I was at the core, and if I was too
damaged to walk around the block, I was lucky all the same. Once I
got to my desk, once I started writing, I still believed anything
was possible.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A broken area of showers will surround a slow-moving low
pressure area off the Middle Atlantic Coast. A few areas of locally
heavy rain will occur, especially in southern and central New
England, where Atlantic moisture is drawn inland. Meanwhile, a
mixture of clouds and sunshine will prevail over most of the
interior Northeast and Middle Atlantic States.
</P>
<P>
   Hot weather will cover most areas from the Plains to the
Southeastern States. Plentiful sunshine will boost afternoon
temperatures above 100 degrees in much of the central and southern
Plains. A few strong thunderstorms will develop at the periphery of
the hot air mass in the Dakotas and northern Mississippi Valley.
</P>
<P>
   In the West, northern sections will be a bit cooler than in
recent days in the wake of a cool front. The Southwest will
continue to be hot with a few afternoon thunderstorms in the
mountains.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: ANOTHER FLOOD
</P>
<P>
   Repeated heavy showers and thunderstorms brought as much as 14
inches of rain on Saturday, causing serious flooding in parts of
northwestern New Jersey. Throughout the nation, flooding rains are
more common than they used to be. A study done at the National
Climatic Data Center shows a steady upward trend in extreme
precipitation events since the beginning of the 20th century. The
cause of the long-term trend toward heavier rain storms is unclear,
but some climatologists believe it is related to the general
warming trend of the last 100 years. &QL;

ALLIANCE TO SEND VIDEO-ON-DEMAND ON WEB
</HEADLINE>
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Intertainer and Akamai Technologies plan to announce an alliance
Monday to deliver video-on-demand to the computers of consumers
with high-speed Internet connections. The service is now available
in two markets and will be broadly available by the end of the
year, the companies said.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance will involve Intertainer's library, which includes
the licensing rights to entertainment programming from more than 60
media companies, including DreamWorks SKG, Sony Music, Warner Bros.
and Columbia TriStar Television. The material _ including first-run
films, archived films, music videos and television specials _ is
not stored on the user's computer, but is viewed or heard as it
streams in from the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Using the distribution technology and services of Akamai, of
Cambridge, Mass., Intertainer, which is based in Culver City,
Calif., will be able to move rapidly into markets across the
country.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance of Intertainer and Akamai follows last month's
announcement from Enron, the Houston-based utility and energy
giant, that it had entered a 20-year agreement with Blockbuster to
deliver movies on demand into homes as a digitized video stream.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say that while Blockbuster's strong brand holds certain
advantages, Intertainer is, so far, the only player to have
introduced a working service. It has been in test markets for
nearly two years, and is commercially available in Cincinnati,
through the ZoomTown.com service of Broadwing, and in Denver,
through Qwest.
</P>
<P>
   And although Intertainer is a small, privately held company, it
has powerful owners: Microsoft, Intel, NBC, Sony, Qwest and
Comcast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blockbuster has all the distribution, sales and brand you
could want, but no service,'' said Julani Zeribi, an analyst with
Current Analysis. ``At the end of the day, their announcement was,
`We intend to do this, provided everything comes together.'
Intertainer already has a service, and Akamai can do this, right
here, right now.''
</P>
<P>
   John Taplin, Intertainer's president and chief executive, said
the service could make first-run movies available for $2.95 for
viewing any time within a 24-hour period, with archive films
available for $1.95, television shows for 25 cents, and music
videos and other material free. The content is encrypted using
Microsoft's digital rights management technology, which prevents
copying or redistribution by the user.
</P>
<P>
   The quality of the sounds and images, which must be viewed on a
computer, is comparable to VHS tape, but not DVD, but test-market
results have shown this is acceptable, he said.
</P>
<P>
   While the Internet is a global medium, the so-called streaming
technology employed by Intertainer and other online distributors of
video information tends to work better the fewer network leaps it
must make across the Internet. Akamai specializes in distributing
Internet material in a way that makes it appear to the recipient's
computer that it is originating locally.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the Akamai deal does for us is to quickly offer the
service in hundreds of metropolitan areas instead of a few,''
Taplin said. Intertainer has agreements with Internet service
providers covering about 75 percent of the United States, and is
negotiating with others for the balance. Initially, the service
would be available only to computer users with DSL lines, although
Intertainer is also talking with cable companies.
</P>
<P>
   Akamai's service speeds delivery of World Wide Web pages and
streaming media by moving such digital content to servers spread
around the globe, thus bypassing bottlenecks in the broad Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``If your last-mile connection is good, we should have a server
close enough to capitalize on that,'' said Jonathan Seelig,
Akamai's vice president, strategy and corporate development. ``It
will be broadly available across the country by the end of the
year.''

 By JERRY NACHMAN    
 c.2000 New York Times    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ My phone is pulsating like a blender. The calls
are from my press buddies. They're all coming, you know, to cover
the Democrats. Years ago we'd be talking pegs, angles. Who's gonna
defect in some platform fight? What caucus will Reagan try to charm
to steal the nomination from Ford? Will Jesse apologize tomorrow
night for the Hymietown thing? Dukakis definitely won't pick
Bentsen; I got it nailed.
</P>
<P>
   This week the calls are about whether I can get them into the
Playboy Mansion soiree and, hey, you're in TV, what about that
Streisand thing? Are you, like, going?
</P>
<P>
   I'm relieved. Better they're talking parties than politics. When
they talk politics I get irritated. Because most of the media
coming to L.A. should wear delegate badges rather than press
passes. What's not new is that most newspeople are Democrats, even
liberals. One accepted study reported that 91 percent of
journalists polled voted for Bill Clinton in 1992; 43 percent of
their fellow Americans did so that year.
</P>
<P>
   What is new is that newsies no longer try to keep their politics
personal. There was a time when journalists held their political
cards very close to the vest. But now they share.
</P>
<P>
   I remember returning to WCBS-TV in New York in the fall of 1994
to run the news department. Election Day arrived, and a Republican
was elected governor. The next day the newsroom was in emotional
shambles. Remember, most of them are kids. New York governors had
been Cuomo or Carey for all the memory they had. Rockefeller was
the name of a skating rink.
</P>
<P>
   The kids were keening. I thought I had walked into some large,
collective shiva call. The staff was bereft. Those Republican guys,
they explained with bewilderment and fear, had, like, taken over
the Senate and the House, too. I think I heard a chorus of
``Kumbaya'' somewhere near the water cooler; I'm all but certain
someone shouted ``Oh, the humanity!'' over by the assignment desk.
</P>
<P>
   The staff shuffled into my office to be consoled. Many of them
believed me to be avuncular, another misperception I would have to
work on. ``Children,'' I began, ``it is true that a Republican is
the governor-elect of New York.'' Someone sniffled. I flipped a box
of tissues in his direction. ``But you must remember that so are
the governors of Massachusetts and Connecticut and New Jersey and
California.'' I pointed out that Republicans had occupied the White
House for 28 of the prior 42 years.
</P>
<P>
   There was a collective gasp: they had no idea aliens had landed
in so many places. ``Now you, as journalists, must understand this
pattern,'' I continued. ``This is not some putsch launched by
skinheads running out of the mountains of Idaho. These are your
neighbors and relatives who are voting for Republicans. Talk to
them. Learn why. Find out that there may be more than one opinion
about stuff like taxes and affirmative action.'' They shuffled out,
vowing to soldier on.
</P>
<P>
   I considered and discarded the idea of sending out for pizza to
cheer them up. I ordered some Chinese for myself and I wondered why
most journos are liberals. It actually makes no sense because
probably three-quarters of the stories we cover could be labeled
under an omnibus umbrella: The government doesn't work.
</P>
<P>
   This all-purpose slug never changes. The reading scores are down
in public schools; the West Side Highway still isn't fixed. The
state police did do racial profiling _ and lied about it. Nuclear
secrets are missing, and Illinois' death row is emptying out
because the state screwed up. We traded arms for hostages and
illegally gave the money to the Contras. The park rangers started a
forest fire and then couldn't put it out. Pick a paper, any paper.
Watch a newscast, any newscast. Guaranteed: The top stories are
some version of ``the government doesn't work.''
</P>
<P>
   So why would journalists, the same ones who uncover these
stories and win all the big awards for doing so, believe that a
bigger government, collecting more tax money and accumulating yet
more power, would be more effective in educating people, housing
them, providing their medical care, than it isn't now?
</P>
<P>
   I'll have this discussion again with my news friends over the
next couple of days. They're all gonna be here. I think I'll hit
the town meeting being thrown by The Nation and the barbecue Time
is having for its new bureau chief. And maybe I'll mosey over to
that ``Jam with Jon Corzine'' party at Luna Park. But I've gotta go
to at least one of Arianna Huffington's salons. Wouldn't be right
if I didn't.

Bitterroot Valley to discuss the role of fire in the natural
ecosystem. A rash of fires in the valley has turned the Big Sky
into the Red Sky, a bloodshot whirl of smoke and fancy colors. The
main highway, U.S. 93, has become a runway for fire vehicles _
dilapidated school buses transporting 20-person crews, brush
buggies rigged with small fire hoses, heavy fire engines with
thousands of gallons of water, water tankers, and on and on.
</P>
<P>
   The audience at the symposium had come from near and far. There
were enough Forest Service personnel from the region for a reunion
of sorts. But we had a smattering of people from out of state as
well, both new residents of the Bitterroot Valley, the
fastest-growing region in Montana, and visitors to the Teller
refuge, a private sanctuary along the Bitterroot River.
</P>
<P>
   In the past decade, the Bitterroot Valley has become a magnet
for retirees, stock market millionaires and computer techies with
dreams of a ``cabin in the woods,'' even if the cabins cost upward
of $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   The conference became something of a forum for new-old
conflicts. Three of us _ Jack Ward Thomas, retired chief of the
Forest Service, Stephen J. Pyne, author of a dozen books on fire
history, and I _ tried to explain the basic fire problems of the
West, in particular the challenge of protecting the rising number
of homes and cabins built in once-unpopulated forests and
grasslands, the so-called urban-wildland interface.
</P>
<P>
   The dream home, a log structure with a shake roof nestled among
trees, is a firefighter's nightmare. A fire crew may well walk away
from such a place and let it burn _ a revelation to newly arrived
urbanites, used to city services.
</P>
<P>
   A federal crew chasing a fire beyond the public lands will
defend private homes. But these people should not be asked to risk
their lives if a homeowner has done nothing for wildfire
protection, we told the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Forest Service vets nodded happily. Some homeowners looked glum.
One visitor piped up: ``Why can't you solve the problem with
zoning? In New York City we'd solve this problem in a minute. We'd
pass zoning so the houses would be built properly.'' Pretty tough
talk from a city that couldn't pick up its own garbage a few years
ago. But the problem is broader than regional resentments.
</P>
<P>
   As fire rages across the 11 Western states this summer, there is
no quick fix in sight. With the current fire season only half over,
more than 4 million acres have burned, already making this the
worst fire season in almost half a century. The previous record was
14 million acres in 1952.
</P>
<P>
   Today, huge amounts of dead wood are ready to burn.
</P>
<P>
   For the past century, the natural cycle of fires has been
interrupted. After fires destroyed early communities in the West _
the famed 1910 fire burned more than 3 million acres in Montana and
Idaho and killed more than 85 people _ the federal government
adopted the ``10 a.m. policy,'' meaning every fire was to be
controlled by 10 o'clock the morning after it was spotted. In
recent years, forest managers have allowed some fires to burn, if
they pose no threat to life and property.
</P>
<P>
   Logging and prescribed burning can help, but both have checkered
histories. Rapacious logging practices created a backlash that has
reduced the timber cut on federal lands to a quarter of what it
was.
</P>
<P>
   Prescribed burning, a godsend to land managers because it
creates breaks in the vegetation, lost some of its allure this
spring. A prescribed burn got out of hand and tore through Los
Alamos, N.M., and wiped out more than 200 homes. The General
Accounting Office estimates it would cost $12 billion to conduct
prescribed burning operations on the 40 million acres of land
needing treatment _ and that assumes no more expensive mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   The federal fire effort also suffers from government downsizing
and aging of the workforce. There are so few experienced
supervisors left that Australian fire managers have been called to
help out.
</P>
<P>
   Federal spending on fire runs close to $1 billion a year, but
budget numbers amount to a gamble, a yearly bet that nothing like
this summer will happen. Federal fire budgets are based on a
percentage of a 10-year average season, with emergency funds
available for heavy seasons. But this ensures inadequate funds for
staples like training and staffing.
</P>
<P>
   The threat fire poses to homes is a bigger problem than a local
zoning board can handle, we told the questioner from New York. For
one thing, home builders can hop from one jurisdiction to another,
avoiding restrictions. But those who buy the homes will expect
protection.
</P>
<P>
   The West has a split personality on government interference. A
Montana newspaper poll taken this summer as fires raged showed
almost even numbers favoring tighter restrictions and favoring
none.
</P>
<P>
   Attitudes may change with more bad fire seasons. At this stage,
no one has had the temerity to propose mandatory national
standards. The occasional insurance company provides a wake-up
call, denying coverage for a home that cannot be defended. Many
homeowners have installed metal roofs, moved woodpiles and taken
other steps.
</P>
<P>
   This season's fires will die out with the snows this fall. But
controversy and confusion over how to handle the fire crisis will
be with us for years to come.
</P>

story of the 1994 fire on Storm King Mountain in Colorado that
killed 14 firefighters. He divides his time between Washington and
Montana.)

 &HT;    GORE, ROB REINER PROMOTE HEALTH CARE PLAN
 &HT;    By KEN FOSKETT
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND, Ohio _ As Vice President Gore continued his way
toward Hollywood for the Democratic National Convention, some of
Hollywood made its way to him here in the Buckeye state.
</P>
<P>
   Producer Rob Reiner, who says he now works full-time on
children's health issues in California, joined Gore on Sunday at a
children's hospital here to promote Gore's prescription for
extending health coverage to the uninsured, which Gore introduced
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Gore told local Ohio media outlets that this week's
convention would be ``full of surprises'' and provide an
opportunity to showcase him as a leader ``fighting for working
families.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to concentrate on substance instead of balloons
and confetti,'' Gore said. ``The convention will be an opportunity
to introduce myself for who I am, not as a vice president who
stands on stage without saying much.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said his acceptance speech Thursday would focus on specific
policy initiatives such as middle class tax cuts and protecting
social security.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to take the risk of going into specifics,'' Gore
said.
</P>
<P>
   Surrounded by doctors and sick children at the Rainbow Babies
and Children's Hospital, Gore made no additional pledges regarding
his children's health insurance program.
</P>
<P>
   That plan would pay for children living at or below 250 percent
of the poverty level to enroll in a special Medicaid program for
uninsured children.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also made no mention of Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, in
keeping with his pre-convention strategy of striking a positive
chord. Afterwards, Reiner and other Gore aides were left to
criticize Bush's record of insuring children, noting that Texas
ranks second to last in the number of uninsured children enrolled
in the Medicaid program, also known as the Children's Health
Insurance Program (CHIP).
</P>
<P>
   In an unscripted moment, Reiner tried to goad Gore into singling
out Texas as an example of a state where Medicaid eligibility
requirements discourage people from enrolling in the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would one of those states be Texas?'' Reiner asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the straight man,'' Gore responded, smiling uncomfortably.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it wasn't, you don't have to say,'' Reiner continued.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it is, can I still not say?'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore pledged, if elected, to cut down on the red tape associated
with enrolling children in the CHIP program, saying he would
require states to enroll children first, and then determine if they
are ineligible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to have a very aggressive outreach strategy that goes
into day care centers, child care facilities, all of the schools,
all the after-school programs, the pre-school programs,'' Gore
said. ``There are millions of children today who are eligible for
the health care coverage under the current program, but they are
not getting it because the barriers are so hard to get over.''

 By JENNIFER DUNNING   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Katherine Dunham is getting ready for a photo shoot.
The radiant star of countless international dance tours and
Broadway and Hollywood musicals from the 1940s on, scrutinizes the
face staring back at her in the mirror. She combs her hair, now
short and gray, and expertly applies her makeup. A friend helps her
into a long blue-black velvet dress studded with small dark stars,
created for her by a young Haitian designer named Cyril. Books are
everywhere. The television is tuned permanently to CNN.
</P>
<P>
   Dunham talks about real estate and the royal succession in
Ghana, sipping what she refers to teasingly as ``that Old Devil
Coca-Cola,'' undiluted, sadly, by rum. The conversation is
punctuated by asides to her scampering 2-year-old goddaughter, Rose
Michele, who perplexes Dunham by calling her Madam.
</P>
<P>
   At 91 Dunham brims with more ideas and serene enthusiasm for
life than anyone around her in the bustling Manhattan apartment
where she is staying, on a sabbatical from her home in East St.
Louis, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   This week she will teach classes and participate in a public
``conversation'' Tuesday afternoon in a studio at City Center,
whose education department is holding an ambitious weeklong Dunham
Institute for dance educators, with daily public panel discussions
on Dunham dance Monday afternoon through Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Dunham leads a busy life. Using a wheelchair, she participates
frequently in seminars and is at work on the next installment of
her autobiography, to be called ``The Minefield.'' She will soon be
involved in the renovation of her theater museum in East St. Louis,
where she also maintains a school.
</P>
<P>
   On June 22, her birthday, Dunham was presented with a check for
$1 million by state Rep. Wyvetter Younge, who had lobbied Illinois
legislators for the funds. The money will be used to match a $1
million capital improvement grant from the Doris Duke Foundation.
``We still don't know about operating costs for the next year,''
said Jeanelle Stovall, a longtime colleague and friend of Dunham's.
</P>
<P>
   But Dunham is pleased at this renewed attention to her work.
``It's almost for the accomplishment and furtherance of my
dreams,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Not bad for a woman old enough to chide an admiring middle-aged
visitor gently about accepting age and embracing wisdom. ``I don't
like that `accept,' '' she said firmly. ``I would just let the
whole thing go. Just be there for it, centimeter by centimeter.''
</P>
<P>
   But then Dunham has confounded expectations all her life. A
black child raised in Joliet, Ill., in the 1920s, she went on to
earn a doctorate in anthropology at the University of Chicago,
become the dance director for the Negro Unit of the Federal Theater
Project in Chicago in 1938 and soon after achieve international
fame as a dancer, choreographer and stage and film performer.
</P>
<P>
   She created a technique, a rich amalgam of Afro-Caribbean dance,
ballet and modern dance, passed along at her influential school in
the New York theater district in the mid-1940s and '50s. Then she
seemed to disappear, settling in East St. Louis in 1967 to teach
dance at Southern Illinois University and establish her school and
museum in the bitterly impoverished town.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything was needed,'' Dunham said. ``Factories were
closing. But it still had a family life. All of a sudden I found
myself closing out my theater career and using my background in
anthropology to bring together a community, not only to be
preserved but developed.'' Her pupils have included the athletes
Florence Griffith Joyner and Jackie Joyner Kersee and the
filmmakers Reginald and Warrington Hudlin.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time went by when I took up my serious living in East St.
Louis,'' Dunham said. ``It's a section of my life that I will
someday maybe put on paper. People tend to take things for granted
sometimes, which they did with us. But finally that pays off.
Without knowing it, you find yourself a part of the fabric of the
place. I don't know when or how it happened. But the idea of
leaving there now is very foreign to me. I couldn't. That's home.''
</P>
<P>
   She is in New York at the suggestion of Harry Belafonte and his
wife, Julie, a former Dunham dancer. Dunham had come to lecture.
She recalled that the Belafontes said: ``Why not stay in New York
for a time? You haven't even started your life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And all of a sudden, I said, `Maybe you're right,' '' Dunham
continued.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wasn't it wonderful? I didn't feel like a dancer anymore. I
began looking at my life and seeing that I had been living it in
stages. And I sat down and figured where I was now. Well, there are
nine stages in yoga. I've gone through all those. I don't want to
have to prove it, but I know it's true. Ten was terrible, just
awful. And now I'm moving into 11. And it's a challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you live your life that way, you don't really have much
relationship to the levels before. If I stand here and look
backwards, nostalgia sets in. And nostalgia is the deadly killer of
our dreams. Memory, good, if it serves a purpose. But stay away
from nostalgia.''
</P>
<P>
   When Dunham worried about the expense of living in New York, the
Belafontes helped find money for her year away. ``Not only that,''
Dunham said, ``but it was done in such a way that I did not have a
feeling at all that I was derelict and they were saving me.''
</P>
<P>
   Conversations with Dunham tend to range widely, scattered with
allusions to everything from genomes and Haitian political history
to witches and the plight of American children. ``Without knowing
it, we've left children out of the whole picture, and it's
beginning to give us trouble now,'' she said. She would like, she
said laughing, to set the record straight on another matter.
``Someone told me a few days ago that I was still looked upon as a
witch here,'' she said. ``Maybe by people who don't understand if
it's going to rain, you say it's going to rain.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking back on her life, unnostalgically, she talks of
discovering Haiti in the mid-1930s, when she went there to conduct
research on Haitian dance for her master's degree. She recalls her
delight, after experiencing racism as a high school student, in
seeing black senators in tail coats governing Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   She bought property in Haiti, intending that the estate, now in
disarray, would one day be a school and a retirement home for her
dancers. ``There could be a relationship between people who had
gained their freedom,'' she said of the Haitians, ``and people who
had been given their freedom, as we were in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   It was time for the photo session. She gazed warmly into the
camera, those famously lustrous eyes seeming to grow wider by the
second. ``Did you ever see photographs of elderly divas trying to
look sexy?'' she asked wryly.
</P>
<P>
   To what does she attribute her long life? Dunham was silent for
a moment. Could it be yogurt? ``Actually, I don't like yogurt very
much,'' Dunham said seriously. ``Well, you have to do two things.
One is to try really to know yourself, and that takes time and
patience. And you have to give so much, and know what people need,
to know yourself.''

HYUNDAI GROUP FOUNDER TO CUT HIS STAKE IN AUTO COMPANY 
</HEADLINE>
   By SAMUEL LEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea _ Hyundai Group, South Korea's largest
business group, said Sunday that its founder, Chung Ju-yung, would
sell a 6.1 percent stake in Hyundai Motor Co. by the end of the
year, ending months of defiance of government demands for
reorganization.
</P>
<P>
   The 85-year-old founder will cut his stake in Hyundai Motor to 3
percent from 9.1 percent, which is expected to raise about 216
billion won ($193.8 million), according to Kim Jae-soo, head of
Hyundai Group's corporate reorganization committee. Hyundai plans
to use the money to buy three-year corporate bonds issued by the
ailing Hyundai Engineering and Construction Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sincerely apologize for causing concerns to the people and
shareholders,'' Kim said at a news conference. ``We will faithfully
continue restructuring efforts to regain market trust.''
</P>
<P>
   The sale of the founder's stake sets the stage for Hyundai Motor
to be spun off from Hyundai Group, a crucial step in efforts to
reorganize the huge business group while easing cash shortages at
Hyundai Engineering and Construction, Kim said.
</P>
<P>
   The construction affiliate, South Korea's largest builder, owes
creditors 5.4 trillion won ($4.8 billion) and has had severe
difficulty in repaying its debts since May, setting off alarms that
both the group and the nation's economy were in danger of another
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   One of the characteristics of South Korean conglomerates has
been the complex network of financing and loan arrangements among
affiliates, which forced healthy companies to prop up the
struggling units of the same business group.
</P>
<P>
   The government has been trying to untangle this complicated web.
One of the most effective methods has been to sever the control
wielded by the founders of the conglomerates and allow individual
units to be run by professional managers.
</P>
<P>
   Kim added that Chung Mong-koo, the chairman of Hyundai Motor,
would be forced to step down as part of the agreement. With the
acceptance of a $167 million emergency loan from creditor banks in
May, Chung Ju-yung ordered his sons, Mong-koo and Mong-hun, to give
up their positions as the heads of several affiliates. While
Mong-hun relinquished his control of the electronics affiliates,
Mong-koo has refused to obey the order.
</P>
<P>
   Hyundai Motor officials could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Kim said Hyundai would not allow Chung Mong-koo to acquire his
father's 6.1 percent stake.
</P>
<P>
   Korea Exchange Bank, one of Hyundai's main creditors, welcomed
the announcement. ``The plan announced today will fundamentally
resolve the liquidity problem at Hyundai Engineering and
Construction,'' said Kim Kyong-rim, head of Korea Exchange Bank.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Hyundai said it would also sell stock and real estate worth $4.9
billion, sell all or part of Hyundai Elevator Co. and focus on core
businesses, including carmaking, shipbuilding and electronics.
</P>
<P>
   However, contrary to demands by creditor banks, the conglomerate
decided to keep several high-level executives, who have
demonstrated their loyalty to the founding family over decades,
even at the cost of incurring losses to investors. Only Hyundai's
board has the authority to oust them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem will be whether these loyal executives would be
able to discard old habits,'' said Yon Kang-heum, professor of
international finance at Yonsei University. ``With major
shareholders wielding the most power, it may take a consolidated
effort by minority shareholders to oust these executives.''

WACKY, FAKE WEB SITES GRAB ATTENTION 
</HEADLINE>
  By ALLISON FASS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Visitors to www.goblertoys.com can find cartoon versions of the
toy inventions of Ira Gobler like Gobler's Wobblers, Rodeo Rover
and Senor and Senorita Sandwich. The site also offers a scrapbook
of the career of Gobler, president and founder of Gobler Toys, and
links to animated commercials.
</P>
<P>
   But anyone doing research into the toy business will soon find
there is no Gobler Toys and no toymaker named Ira Gobler. Rather,
www.goblertoys.com is an example of an increasingly popular trend
in marketing: fictional or fanciful Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   The trend is meant to capitalize on the growing use of and
fascination with the Internet as well as to take advantage of the
capabilities of the Web to produce content at a low cost that
appears to be genuine. In other words, on the World Wide Web, it
can always be April Fool's Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet allows you to be a little more out there in your
approach,'' said Peter Capper, vice president and account
supervisor at BVK/McDonald in Milwaukee. ``It's much more accepting
of different ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   For one client, Sun Country Airlines in Mendota Heights, Minn.,
BVK/McDonald created a campaign centered on a fanciful Web site,
www.heybill.com, which is separate from the airline's official
site, www.suncountry.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill'' refers to the president and chief executive at Sun
Country, Bill La Macchia Jr., who has appeared in quirky
television, radio and print ads for the airline.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people looked at me as part of the brand,'' La Macchia
said, adding that the silly site was meant to further the airline's
goal of sponsoring ``relationship marketing'' instead of just
traditional advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Heybill.com was built to resemble a friend's home page,
featuring travel tips, a trivia game about famous people named Bill
and opportunities to negotiate with La Macchia for low ticket
prices. To put up the site, BVK/McDonald worked with Mark Net World
in Milwaukee, which is owned by BVK/McDonald and a group of private
investors.
</P>
<P>
   The fictional Web site for Gobler Toys was created by two toy
lovers who met two years ago at the International Toy Fair in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we would love to have is our own Mattel, our own
Hasbro,'' said Steve Fink, vice president for marketing at Bang
Zoom Design in Cincinnati, describing the virtual company he
concocted with Steve Casino, a toy inventor at Kiscom in Englewood,
N.J. ``But obviously, we can't do that because we don't have the
money.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought the next best thing,'' he added, ``is to have a
fake one.''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Web surfers who check out www.rentarelative.com will
see information that appears to be about a company renting stand-in
replacements for people unable to attend family functions because
they are restricted from redeeming frequent-flier miles.
</P>
<P>
   The site presents what seems to be information about the
company's staff, employment opportunities and a detailed price
chart; for instance, if a meal is not served while a stand-in is
working, the price goes up $25.
</P>
<P>
   Sound real? As if.
</P>
<P>
   The site was created as an advertising ploy for a company called
WebMiles.com, which promotes itself as offering members ways to
earn frequent flyer miles with fewer restrictions than conventional
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Case, vice president for marketing at WebMiles.com in
Sandy, Utah, described the site as the ``creative concept by which
we're going to get the message of Web Miles across.''
</P>
<P>
   A humorous television commercial by the WebMiles.com agency,
GMO/Hill, Holliday in San Francisco, shows a laid-back young man
turning up at a reunion of a family clearly not his own: The family
is Asian-American and he is Caucasian. After the man explains he
has been sent to stand in for a cousin who could not attend because

   Making up a Web site is ``definitely an idea that has legs,''
said Terry Rietta, a creative director at GMO/Hill, Holliday, part
of the Interpublic Group of Companies.
</P>
<P>
   To keep the spoof going, WebMiles.com sent out news releases and
e-mail announcing the formation of RentaRelative.com that only
briefly referred to WebMiles.com, calling the real company a
``strategic partner.''
</P>
<P>
   In the April issue of Esquire, published by Hearst Magazines,
Ted C. Fishman wrote an article meant to parody the abundance of
Web sites for products that seemed too good to be true. To ``take
readers for a ride,'' Fishman said, he described a company offering
free cars to people who agreed to have them plastered with ads, as
if it were real. He and Esquire then actually put up a site at
www.FreeWheelz.com, complete with impressive graphics and a section
titled ``about us.''
</P>
<P>
   But the company may not have been fantastic enough. Fishman said
he heard from advertisers who did not get the joke, asking for
information about becoming sponsors, as well as from people who
said he had been able to get a site up before they could.
</P>
<P>
   In June, Fishman sold the domain name www.FreeWheelz.com for
$25,000 to an entrepreneur who said he was starting his own
free-car ad company. Fishman said that he and Hearst split the
money.
</P>
<P>
   It seems when it comes to fictional sites, the difference
between fiction and fact can be slight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started this as a fake thing,'' said Fink of the
make-believe Gobler Toys site, ``but it could end up being very
real.''

STEVE JOBS COMPLAINS ABOUT BOOK; NBC ADDS REALITY TV SHOWS 
</HEADLINE>
  c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   STEVE JOBS FINDS FAULT WITH PORTRAYAL IN BOOK &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Steve Jobs, the co-founder and chief executive of Apple
Computer, is not a happy man at the moment.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Jobs called the chief executive of Random House,
Peter Olson, to complain about a book the Broadway Books division
is scheduled to publish in October, according to Stuart Applebaum,
a spokesman for Random House, a unit of Bertelsmann.
</P>
<P>
   The book, ``The Second Coming of Steve Jobs,'' by Alan
Deutschman, portrays Jobs as an abusive, insecure narcissist who,
through a ``reign of terror,'' turned around the once-moribund
company and reclaimed his authority.
</P>
<P>
   Deutschman, a reporter who has worked for Fortune and GQ and is
now a contributing editor at Vanity Fair, says that Jobs took
delight in humiliating Apple employees.
</P>
<P>
   The book also chronicles some of Jobs' business failures.
</P>
<P>
   Jobs, in his call to Olson, ``was concerned that we were
publishing a quote-unquote hatchet job on him,'' Applebaum said. He
added that Olson had no comment for Jobs on the observation.
</P>
<P>
   But Jobs can take some comfort because one place he will not be
reading about his temper and business problems is in the October
issue of Vanity Fair.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine, which had negotiated a contract with Random House
to publish an excerpt from the book, told Deutschman last on Aug. 7
that the excerpt would not appear because there was not enough
space in the October issue.
</P>
<P>
   Deutschman said that he was surprised that Vanity Fair, which is
published by the Conde Nast unit of Advance Publications, had
canceled his excerpt so late in the production cycle; the magazine
will be sent to the printers this week, and Deutschman had already
scheduled his final phone call with the article's fact-checker.
</P>
<P>
   Deutschman said he believed that Jobs had put pressure on the
magazine, but he had no proof of that.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Tyrnauer, the editor at large who edited Deutschman's
excerpt, said there was no conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is unfortunate, but for space reasons three pieces had to
be dropped from this issue,'' Tyrnauer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because this is a book excerpt and has to come out before the
book's publication date,'' he said, ``it could not hold for a later
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Jobs, through spokesmen, declined to comment on the book or the
excerpt.

   IN REALITY SHOW DERBY, NBC HAS 2 NEW ENTRIES
</P>
<P>
   After a lengthy delay, NBC will announce this week that it has
acquired the rights to ``Chains of Love,'' a reality show that will
literally chain four men to one woman for a week.
</P>
<P>
   NBC has also acquired the rights to a hidden-camera show that
will begin as a special, but which NBC has the option of turning
into a series. In ``Sweet Revenge,'' a contestant will be offered a
chance to get back at a friend or family member for some perceived
offense by setting him or her up for some embarrassment on a hidden
camera.
</P>
<P>
   NBC has agreed to buy 16 episodes of ``Chains of Love,'' which
will likely run in five-episode segments, after one initial
special. That means NBC has bought the rights to three separate
editions of the series, which NBC is internally calling ``Dating
Game Meets Survivor.'' In the show, the woman discards the men one
at a time and picks the winner.
</P>
<P>
   Both shows come from the Dutch production company Endemol. The
deal has been formally finished for some time, an executive
associated with Endemol said. Endemol had negotiated to retain most
of the control over the shows, as it did for its first reality
series, ``Big Brother,'' which has seen some of its cast members
become controversial figures this summer. One participant was found
to be a follower of black leader Khalid Abdul Muhammad, who has
expressed anti-Semitic views in the past.
</P>
<P>
   According to the executive associated with Endemol, the
production house has sought even more control over ``Chains of
Love.'' Shirley Powell, the spokeswoman for NBC's entertainment
division, said, ``I'm assuming we'll have more control than CBS
had, especially after what's happened with `Big Brother.''' In the
event of an on-screen fiasco, the networks could be in a far more
vulnerable position than the production house.
</P>
<P>
   But Endemol's negotiating position has been strengthened by its
long list of reality formats, as many as 60, which are much in
demand at the networks. The shows are not only being looked on as
possible breakthrough hits, like ``Survivor'' has been for CBS, but
also as possible alternative programming if Hollywood unions
representing writers and actors go on strike next summer, as is
currently feared.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is making contingency plans,'' Powell said.

WOMEN ONLINE GO BEYOND FUN; KINKO'S AND FEDEX PLAN SERVICE 
</HEADLINE>
 (Eds: two articles; bylines at bottom of each) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; INTERNET IS MORE THAN JUST FUN FOR WOMEN &QL; 
 &LR;  Women, it is clear, are not passing hour upon hour at their
computers watching the online equivalent of ``General Hospital.''
</P>
<P>
   A new survey shows that women go online for practical reasons,
like shopping, travel reservations and to seek specific
information, and tend to be loyal to a few chosen sites. Men, on
the other hand, tend to roam around, sometimes looking for
amusement.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is one thing women don't want to do online: linger in
front of their monitors with a cup of Cafe Vienna,'' said Jesse
Berst, editor of ZDNet Anchor Desk, an industry newsletter. The
reason? Simply put: ``Women are more pressed for time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, ``It's a Woman's World Wide Web,'' was conducted by
Jupiter Communications with Media Metrix. Besides examining the
sexes' online behavior, it showed that for the first time, women
outnumber men online, with a 50.4 percent share of the online
population.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women are interested in a more efficient experience _ getting
online and getting off,'' said Anya Sacharow, an analyst at
Jupiter. ``Men are more interested in technology for technology's
sake, and in the more random aspects of Net surfing.''
</P>
<P>
   Sacharow said the survey pointed to different priorities. Women
are ``often juggling kids, jobs and taking care of the house,'' she
said. ``Men more often than not are only responsible for
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The study found that older women use the Internet to make their
lives easier. Bolstering this notion that women go online to
simplify their lives rather than fulfill them, the study found that
many consumer product sites had disproportionate numbers of female
visitors. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   &UR; KINKO'S AND FEDEX PLAN DOCUMENT SERVICE &QL; 
 &LR;  Kinkos.com, an online start-up, has announced a deal with the
Kinko's chain of copy shops and FedEx to create a service that
promises to deliver finished presentations and reports within a few
hours of receiving the data.
</P>
<P>
   Online document delivery services, so far offered only by a
small number of start-ups with names like Mimeo.com and
NowDocs.com, have struck a chord with business travelers and others
who want to transmit documents to printing shops for formatting,
proofread them on screen and have them delivered throughout the
country at designated times.
</P>
<P>
   Kinkos.com was formed March 1 as a separate company from Kinko's
Inc., the nation's largest chain of copy and document preparation
stores. Its financial backers include Kinko's and America Online.
</P>
<P>
   The three-way deal, announced last week, will use the 1,000
Kinko's stores and FedEx's delivery network.
</P>
<P>
   ``What customers need is `time definite,''' said Rick Steele,
Kinkos.com's chief executive, meaning they want to know exactly
when their documents will be delivered. With the new service,
customers can have finished documents within four hours in 20 major
markets; the companies plan to add 35 more by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the deal, the service, called Print to Kinko's, will
be on both the FedEx and Kinkos.com Web sites. The deal with FedEx
will allow the companies to scale the operation quickly as customer
demand grows, said David Roussain, FedEx vice president for
electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   FedEx already operates service centers in 50 Kinko's stores; it
plans to increase that number to 150 in about nine months.

   Some notes on battling Satan in the movies, for the producers of
(beginitalic)Bless (enditalic)(beginitalic)the Child:(enditalic)
</P>
<P>
   Generally, the Prince of Darkness cannot be defeated with
conventional weapons. Pistols and tear gas are no good. You need
some sort of ancient dagger or book of runes.
</P>
<P>
   When arriving at Satan's residence to serve an arrest warrant,
do not enter the premises without backup, especially if said backup
disappears into some sort of evil mist.
</P>
<P>
   Do not, under any circumstances, sneak into a house full of
devil worshipers armed only with a kitchen knife and a winning
smile.
</P>
<P>
   Avoid the room with the big altar in it. Bad things happen
there.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, Satan plays poorly with a lead. As soon as he gets the
upper hand, his imps start strutting around and talking trash. This
is the time to act.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the makers of (beginitalic)Bless the Child
(enditalic)didn't remember many of these important guidelines and
ended up with a pretty dopey movie, which is watchable just the
same.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Basinger stars as Maggie, a nurse who raises her infant
niece, Cody (Holliston Coleman), after the girl is dumped on
Maggie's doorstep by her druggie sister (Angela Bettis). By age 6,
we learn, Cody is ``special,'' that is, she can make objects spin,
reanimate dead animals, simple stuff like that.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Cody is also the target of evil Eric Stark (Rufus
Sewell), a cult leader with a direct line to Lucifer. Stark wants
to kidnap Maggie and turn her to evil, much like Darth Vader tried
with Luke Skywalker, except with less stuff blowing up.
</P>
<P>
   Maggie gets some help from handsome FBI agent John Travis (Jimmy
Smits, who apparently never turned in his (beginitalic)NYPD Blue
(enditalic)trench coat). Travis is trying to solve a series of
child murders, and - well, you can see where all this is going.
</P>
<P>
   That's sort of the fun of (beginitalic)Bless the
Child(enditalic). Hokey and contrived, yes. But it holds your
attention, in that Saturday-matinee sort of way.
</P>
<P>
   Like dozens of Satan-battling movies before it,
(beginitalic)Bless the Child (enditalic)comes with the
(beginitalic)Exorcist (enditalic)starter set: crying statues,
self-lighting candles, sinister ancient symbols and the handy
all-knowing priest. The dialogue is uniformly weak, when it's not
simply lifted from other films.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the internal logic makes no sense. The devil worshipers
constantly capture Maggie but never finish her off. Maggie meets a
street urchin (Christina Ricci) who knows everything but hasn't
bothered to tell the cops. Satan can conjure hundreds of demons but
is easily thwarted by the closing door of a subway car.
</P>
<P>
   While Basinger thrives in certain roles (case in point, her
Oscar for (beginitalic)L.A. Confidential(enditalic)), she doesn't
really have the range to carry a whole movie. Smits is serviceable
as the FBI agent but tends to fade into the woodwork on the big
screen.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the movie gets a lift from Sewell
((beginitalic)Dark City(enditalic)), who plays a pretty good imp.
And Coleman, who is only 7 years old, does a splendid job as Cody.
</P>
<P>
   All told, (beginitalic)Bless the Child (enditalic)is a pretty
mindless movie. But it has some thrills and chills, and doesn't
descend into quite the gorefest of films such as (beginitalic)End
of Days(enditalic).
</P>
<P>
   If only they knew the rules.

NURTURED BY TV, BLACK COMICS ARE BREAKING BOUNDARIES AT THE BOX
OFFICE 
</HEADLINE>
   By ELVIS MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The slogan for the remake of `Shaft'' _ ``Still the man'' _
turned out to be more than an idle boast. The picture topped the
box-office charts in its first week of release, coming in at $21
million. ``Shaft'' was preceded by ``Big Momma's House,'' the
Martin Lawrence comedy, which made $25 million its first week. Both
were followed by ``Scary Movie,'' directed by Keenen Ivory Wayans,
which hosed its competition with $54 million, the biggest opening
ever for an R-rated movie. Then ``Nutty Professor II'' opened at
$42 million, the largest first-weekend take for an Eddie Murphy
movie.
</P>
<P>
   That all four topped the $15 million ceiling said by the studios
to be the limit for black-themed movies means they are no longer
just for a niche market; four times isn't just a fluke. Next up is
``The Original Kings of Comedy,'' a concert film featuring the
stand-up comics Steve Harvey, D.L. Hughley, Cedric the Entertainer
and Bernie Mac; it opens on Friday, and it will be interesting to
see if it continues the winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   This spate of black films may be the biggest sign yet of a new
era. At the same time that young white kids _ 'N Sync, Britney
Spears and Eminem _ are tearing up the pop charts by appropriating
hip-hop and soul, black-themed movies have made a run at the
audiences that are buying that music. In last year's ``Office
Space,'' by the writer-director Mike Judge, the creative force
behind ``Beavis and Butt-head'' and ``King of the Hill,'' a young,
white software engineer drives along and raps furiously to a
gangsta tune; shamefaced, he lowers the volume when he sees a black
man walking within earshot. (I noticed the sea change in 1992
during a live call-in show on MTV during the Los Angeles riot, when
Chuck D of Public Enemy took questions. Not a single call came from
a black viewer; there was no ``Fear of a Black Planet'' among MTV
viewers, many of whom probably had the album, and it made evident
the fact that rap had a large white fan base.)
</P>
<P>
   The mainstream appetite for such material has been stimulated by
television, whose young, white constituency _ the glowing red
center of the target demographic that studios are always aiming for
_ has been steadily growing. Murphy, Wayans and Lawrence fought
their way up on the small screen, where they initially caused a
stir.
</P>
<P>
   The new audience, for which hip-hop is simply a part of its
grammar, has demolished the ceiling for black movies. John
Singleton, who directed the remake of ``Shaft'' for Paramount, has
said the reason MGM didn't put it into production was because that
studio had no faith that there was an audience for it; apparently
MGM is much choosier than it was in 1971 when the original
``Shaft'' saved it from bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   The financial glory of these films _ ``Scary Movie'' is the
first by a black director to make $100 million _ proves that
African-American talent has planted a flag right in the middle of
the mainstream. Will Smith's three hits (he even brought viewers
out for ``Wild, Wild West'') can no longer be shrugged off as an
aberration, an exception that proves the rule.
</P>
<P>
   The groundswell probably got going 10 years ago, when ``In
Living Color,'' the sketch comedy show of which Wayans was creator
and host, made its debut on the Fox network. ``In Living Color''
provided a forum for thoughts generally voiced by black comics only
in nightclubs. (That nightclub feel later became available when
``Def Comedy Jam,'' the all-the-way-live and raw stand-up comic
showcase, ran on HBO and provided a home for Lawrence, Cedric the
Entertainer, Hughley and Mac, among others.)
</P>
<P>
   ``In Living Color'' limned the anger that many African-Americans
felt while sitting through ``Driving Miss Daisy'' _ the throwback
foot-shuffling melodrama that was officially certified with Oscars
_ in a sketch where the chauffeur turned the tables on his
demanding charge. ``In Living Color'' had a killer instinct in
playing up a subject _ race comedy from the African-American
perspective _ and folding in shrewd and swift references that had
been given short shrift on network television.
</P>
<P>
   The show displayed its first-strike capability in pieces like
``The Wrath of Farrakhan,'' a ``Star Trek'' parody that blew up
into something much bigger: Wayans' brother Damon was Farrakhan,
the nemesis of a hammy, ineffectual Captain Kirk, played by Jim
Carrey. (``In Living Color'' was the offshoot of the 1987 black
culture film comedy ``Hollywood Shuffle,'' which was directed by
its star, Robert Townsend, and written by Townsend and Wayans. The
projects that Townsend later produced for television _ a
short-lived sketch show ``Townsend Television'' and ``The Parent
Hood'' _ were as gentle and optimistic as their star. The Wayans
brothers' output is considerably more coldblooded.)
</P>
<P>
   During the series' four-year run _ it stalled out creatively
after Wayans disagreed with Fox over the direction of the show and
left, and was canceled soon after _ it was the home of more future
movie stars than ``Saturday Night Live'' in the same period. Jamie
Foxx was a cast member, and Jennifer Lopez bounced to the bumping
segue as a Fly Girl, with moves choreographed by Rosie Perez.
Carrey, who was bypassed when he auditioned for ``Saturday Night
Live'' in the late '80s, got noticed on ``In Living Color'' and
made ``Ace Ventura, Pet Detective,'' the stealth comedy that came
from nowhere to crush its competition.
</P>
<P>
   The series often seemed like a Triple A training camp for the
Wayans family, though they proved to be up to the challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Damon, with his heavy-lidded and placid face, took center stage
in sketches, playing the surly convict who tossed off overripe
malapropisms _ ``Allow me to flatulate my liquids,'' he would
snarl, pleased with himself. Or Antoine, one of the soi-disant
movie critics of the recurring ``Men on Film'' sketch, who happily
meowed the virtues of ``big sweaty mens'' in a gay parody of
thumbs-up, thumbs-down critique.
</P>
<P>
   The Wayans brothers Shawn and Marlon are the featured players in
``Scary Movie'' and co-writers of its script. (They're very canny
about the branding of their surname; the title of their WB sitcom,
``The Wayans Brothers,'' plays on the jokey nepotism by treating
the family name as if it were the most important part of their
resumes.) The frenetic and scattershot film is in the tradition of
attention-deficit comedies like ``Kentucky Fried Movie.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The picture has moments good enough to have been sketches on
``In Living Color'' in its heyday: at a movie theater showing
``Shakespeare in Love,'' a young African-American woman (Regina
Hall) who prattles on her cell phone to her homey (``Brad Pitt's
girlfriend is a freak!'') and eats food that's as loud as she is,
is attacked first by the masked killer and finally by the theater
audience.
</P>
<P>
   The success of ``Scary Movie'' is likely to stir the inevitable
sequels and rip-offs that followed ``Scream.'' That kind of
reflexive moviemaking helped kill off the small renaissance of
black film in the 1990s, a movement that included ``Boyz N the
Hood,'' ``Straight Outta Brooklyn,'' ``South-Central'' and ``Menace
II Society.'' The same film was getting made over and over.
</P>
<P>
   Black coming-of-age movies of that period took themselves too
seriously; the melancholy note they sounded was unrelieved and
sentimental. In real life, rappers displayed a gallows humor and
short temper that those movies were never allowed to exploit. And
after all the pathos had been wrung out of the genre, it was as if
the urban experience had been all used up, because no one wanted to
see those pictures anymore.
</P>
<P>
   The plea for understanding had a callow, well-meaning
earnestness, which the Wayanses parodied in 1996's ``Don't Be a
Menace to South-Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood.''
(This was a better sketch idea than a film; the title does all the
work.) Black films about adult concerns, however, like ``To Sleep
With Anger'' (1990) _ in which Danny Glover uses his soothing,
honeyed voice for less than altruistic reasons _ lacked the easy
sell of the other films.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately comedy is still the genre where black movies can
score most. Even in ``Shaft,'' Samuel L. Jackson's black-avenger
oppressiveness is so self-conscious that he might as well wink at
the camera as he hauls his magnificence around. The laughs undercut
the crude vigilantism in the current remake. The scene in which
Shaft pulls a pistol on a drug dealer and beats him on the streets
is troubling, but at least he has already quit the police force.
</P>
<P>
   It's far more insidious when, while still a cop, Shaft punches a
suspect in front of a crowd and television cameras. That is meant
to be a bravura gesture, but it debases the worldliness and aplomb
that Shaft is meant to represent; he's supposed to be smarter than
the Dirty Harrys who would beat the sweat off a criminal.
</P>
<P>
   Now the comics who have moved from television to film are
starting to act like men. The maturity that Murphy is showing as an
actor means he may be ready to ease into much more serious work. In
``Bowfinger'' he was Jif, the shy and eager-to-please brother of a
megalomaniac movie star (he also played Kit, the paranoid brother,
without the makeup he used in ``Professor''), and the character was
so vulnerable it could have been painful. Jif's physical discomfort
branded him a needy loner, more pathetic than the Julius Kelp that
Jerry Lewis played in the original ``Nutty Professor'' and to whom
Jif seems a loving tribute. Murphy has grown up without losing his
enthusiasm for comedy.
</P>
<P>
   He was so poised and confident in ``48 Hrs.'' that it's easy to
forget he was only 20 when he walked away with the picture and held
his own against Nick Nolte, who made the mistake of trying to give
his underwritten character some psychological depth. Murphy was so
accomplished and appealing an entertainer that he could laugh at
his own jokes and have the audience laugh along with him.
</P>
<P>
   He has also learned from his mistakes, and some of them, like
``Harlem Nights,'' cost him dearly. The vulgar display of egotism
in that film _ its biggest laughs came at the number of times his
name appeared in the credits _ showed how isolated he had become.
Murphy's cockiness has burned away; he has the finesse of a
grown-up and isn't worried about being upstaged anymore. Once he
would look another performer in the eye only when a scene was being
stolen; he is tickled and stunned by Bronson Pinchot's effrontery
in purloining their scene together in ``Beverly Hills Cop.''
</P>
<P>
   Parts of ``Nutty Professor II'' show that Murphy is ready for a
comedy with feeling. And the audiences that grew up with him _ and
with Lawrence and the Wayanses _ could move along into that next
phase without a hint of fuss. After all, this is the same audience
that rented the ghetto stoner comedy ``Friday'' in droves and made
a movie star of Chris Tucker; they followed him from Blockbuster
and into movie theaters.
</P>
<P>
   It is obvious that these performers can attract the most
desirable mainstream audiences with less demanding fare. These kids
have matured with them, as well as the baby African-American comics
Kenan and Kel on Nickelodeon. Film grosses indicate that this crowd
feels that hip-hop culture belongs to them; it's in the air, part
of the way they express themselves. That interest transcends race
and can be translated into something bigger.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the time is ripe for an alliance something along the lines
of First Artists, the production company that the '60s stars Paul
Newman, Barbra Streisand, Steve McQueen and Sidney Poitier created
so they could make the movies they wanted. They were so powerful
that no one could say no to them. (Sadly, First Artists fell into
chaos, with bruised egos leading to the collapse of the company.)
</P>
<P>
   The most remarkable aspect of the black film renaissance is that
the major television networks have totally missed the point. It was
television that nurtured the audience that grew up with this welt
of actors, writers and directors and trailed happily after them
into the movies. It's unbelievable that while these pictures have
made a mark at the box office, there are no television series
capitalizing on that interest.
</P>
<P>
   After all the noise last summer, when the NAACP announced a
campaign to press for more diversity on television, and the
networks vowed to make changes, the prime-time schedules still look
as white as a box of long-grain rice. The networks deserve to have
viewers fleeing their bland fare in droves.

   Ford Releases Data on Tires That Firestone Recalled
</P>
<P>
   Ford Motor released documents showing that Bridgestone/Firestone
had received for years an unusually large number of warranty claims
on the tires that were recalled last week.
</P>
<P>
   Warranty data showed that the tires being recalled were the
subject of 15 to 65 times as many warranty claims as other
Firestone tires. The highest numbers of claims by a wide margin
were for tires produced at Bridgestone's factory in Decatur, Ill.,
in 1994 and 1995, when the factory was operated by replacement
workers.

   Jobs Finds Fault With New Book
</P>
<P>
   ``The Second Coming of Steve Jobs,'' a book by Alan Deutschman,
portrays Steve Jobs, the co-founder and chief executive of Apple
Compute, as an abusive, insecure narcissist who, through a ``reign
of terror,'' turned around the company and reclaimed his authority.
Last week, Jobs called the chief executive of Random House, the
publisher's parent, to complain about the book, referring to it as
a ``hatchet job.''

<P>
   After a long delay, NBC will announce this week that it has
acquired the rights to ``Chains of Love,'' a reality show that will
chain four men to one woman for a week. NBC has also acquired the
rights to a hidden-camera show called ``Sweet Revenge,'' in which a
contestant will be offered a chance to get back at a friend or
family member by setting him or her up for embarrassment on a
hidden camera.

   A Space Detour for Web Traffic
</P>
<P>
   Delivering simultaneous streams of music to thousands or even
millions of listeners over an ever more clogged Internet has become
increasingly frustrating. If the audio stream hits too many traffic
jams, listeners may find radio programs stuttering or stopping in
the middle of a song. One promising remedy involves sending the
stream up to a satellite and landing it at a network hub closer to
listeners.

<P>
   Networks' Convention Role Shrinks
</P>
<P>
   The three main broadcast networks are likely to continue to play
a role at political conventions, and the parties are likely to
continue to covet every moment on these high-visibility networks.
But the scaling back in prime time that occurred this year is
expected to only intensify the next time.

   Japan Heads to Web Without Wires
</P>
<P>
   While Internet access through high-speed lines is booming in the
United States, the business in Japan is barely sputtering. The
Japanese are heading onto the Internet in droves _ but by wireless
means. There are at 20 million to 27 million Internet users in
Japan, or one of every five people in the nation. Of that number,
nearly half are connecting to the Internet wirelessly.

<P>
   Web Entrepreneurs Stepping Aside
</P>
<P>
   Anecdotal evidence suggests that a changing of the guard is
under way in the Internet industry, as the early proponents of the
Web are stepping aside for the mainstream business people who have
migrated to the new medium. Analysts say the executive shift could
have broad implications for e-commerce.

   DESTIN, Fla. _ The sand dunes of Okaloosa Island, like
snowbanks, line both sides of U.S. Highway 98 between Fort Walton
and Destin, and they are so pretty that people weave off the road,
looking at them. The golden sea oats waft in the summer breeze, and
gnarled pines, blasted by hurricanes that hit or barely missed,
lean from sand so purely white that the sun flashes off it like a
mirror and hurts the eyes.
</P>
<P>
   To the south, just beyond the dunes, is the Gulf of Mexico, an
emerald green when the sun is out and a deep, deep blue on the
cloudy days. And across the spit of the sand, to the north, is a
wide bay, its water darker, a place where wading birds prowl the
shallows, spearing fish and crabs.
</P>
<P>
   But at 55 miles an hour, this three-mile stretch of protected,
mostly undeveloped federal land flashes past in an instant. In the
amount of time it takes a tourist to tune his car radio, the little
oasis is gone.
</P>
<P>
   And looking around at what has become of the rest of this part
of the Florida Panhandle on each side of that stretch of sand, part
of Eglin Air Force Base, it is enough to make some visitors wonder
if what they saw was even real.
</P>
<P>
   Concrete condominiums, as imposing as anything in Miami or Fort
Lauderdale, line the beachfront on both ends of this paradise,
blocking views of the Gulf. Tower cranes in the distance promise
more.
</P>
<P>
   Thick traffic on 98 moves like syrup on a cold day, and turning
left against the gridlock, to one of the gigantic new seafood
emporiums that look almost like amusement parks with their expanse
of neon, can be a hair-raising adventure. The real estate people
have a term for this kind of growth: ``Turning sand into money.''
</P>
<P>
   Fort Walton, to the west, is ``built out,'' the locals like to
say, but to the east, at Destin and beyond, the building boom is
still raging. Destin, which had long been regarded as one of the
last little jewels of coastal old Florida, has been transformed
into a coastal city of condominiums.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been discovered,'' said Commissioner Nick Nicholson of
Okaloosa County.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't happen overnight; it just seems like it to people who
come only every few years. The Panhandle has been a prize for
developers for decades. Destin, once known as the ``World's
Luckiest Fishing Village,'' has been growing and changing for
years.
</P>
<P>
   Now the village is gone, at least the village that older people
here remember.
</P>
<P>
   The fishing is no longer so lucky.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of heartbreaking to see it turn into a concrete
jungle,'' said Dewey Destin, 47, great-great-grandson of the town's
founder, Leonard Destin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bittersweet feeling,'' said Destin, a part-owner of
Destin Seafood Market and a city councilman since 1985. ``There are
more jobs, and the properties are worth more money.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it has destroyed our community. It has destroyed the local
natural fishery. We now have much dirtier water. But this is what
you get when you exchange nature for economic well-being.''
</P>
<P>
   People used to saunter across 98 in their bathing suits. Now,
they wait for a break in the traffic, and run like a mean dog was
after them.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had a choice, I would have restricted the development to
have low density,'' said Destin, who points out that most zoning
during the early boom years was handled by the county, not the
city. ``I would have done it much differently.''
</P>
<P>
   The population statistics show growth, but do not show the true
changes in Destin and the surrounding coast.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, the population of Okaloosa County was 88,188, according
to state statistics. By 1990, it had climbed to 143,776, and by
1999 it had climbed to almost 180,000.
</P>
<P>
   But the tourists and the part-time residents have truly altered
the landscape, real estate figures show.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, there were 194 sales of new condos in southern Okaloosa
County, which includes Destin, and in rapidly developing southern
Walton County, to the east.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, there were 937 sales of new condos, many of which will
be vacant for part or even much of the year, or leased to tourists.
</P>
<P>
   The boom shows no sign of stopping. Sales of condos and town
homes here almost doubled in just the past year.
</P>
<P>
   Real estate developers say Destin and much of the rest of the
Florida Panhandle have become playgrounds of the new, fat economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the boom, baby boomers and e-commuters are
purchasing places as second homes or working from their homes
here,'' said Dave W. Hubbard, a broker here. ``The younger
generations are getting their money early on and coming to play on
the water. Condos are starting at $300,000 and going to $1.4
million. That's about average for a Gulf view.''
</P>
<P>
   Some residents say it had to happen sooner or later, and make no
excuses for the transformation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew that we weren't going to be able to keep this beauty
secret for a long time,'' said Michael Beaubien, who owns Born to
Boogie Charter Boat Fishing. ``How could we put a fence around us
and say, `No, get out'?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Developers are not going to sit there and say, `We'll take
care of this land and leave it as a habitat for the redheaded
woodpecker,' '' Beaubien continued. ``It's just not realistic to
think that.''
</P>
<P>
   But people who loved it for what it was hate what it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``Storm water runoff has affected the bay, and all the
fertilizers they put on the golf courses are killing it,'' said
Jacquelyn L. Tatjes, a secretary at Sexton's Seafood, a place where
locals and tourists have gone for years to get fresh shrimp and
crabs to boil.
</P>
<P>
   Tatjes has lived here 25 years, after fleeing the building booms
in California. Here it is, she said, all over again.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way a local can even go to the beach,'' she said.
``They say there's public access, but there's no parking. You can't
even see the beach anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   And the new people have no connection to the place, beyond their
time-share agreement or deed, longtime locals say.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're rude. Instead of accepting our heritage of a small
town, they just want to change it,'' Tatjes said. ``They want it to
be just like where they came from. It's lost all its charm.''
</P>
<P>
   As soon as the value of her property peaks, she said, she is
moving.
</P>
<P>
   Others have already left.
</P>
<P>
   Evan Bergwall is now a senior vice president at a bank in
Neosho, Mo., a small city outside Joplin. Bergwall and his family
left Destin this year, for good, after living here 10 years. ``What
I went there for disappeared,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a place to get away,'' he said, ``it isn't, anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Like some exotic animal in a cage, the undeveloped stretch of
land between Destin and Fort Walton is fenced off on the Gulf side.
But people regularly cross the fence, climb the dunes and look at
the water, and run or roll back down them.
</P>
<P>
   They commit a small disobedience, just to see what, once, this
was all like.

MURDOCH DEAL COULD REVAMP NEW YORK TV 
</HEADLINE>
   By BILL CARTER and GERALDINE FABRIKANT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Media analysts and network executives said over the
weekend that the sale of TV stations owned by Chris-Craft
Industries to the owner of the Fox network, News Corp., was likely
to create a host of opportunities for News Corp. _ and raise almost
as many questions.
</P>
<P>
   The questions will affect News Corp. and Viacom, which until
Friday had also been bidding to acquire the stations.
</P>
<P>
   The sale, expected to be announced this week, is valued at $85 a
share, or about $3.5 billion. It will add 10 stations owned by
Chris-Craft to News Corp. and present News Corp.'s leader, Rupert
Murdoch, with a competitive edge _ ownership of two powerful TV
stations in a number of major cities, including New York and Los
Angeles. It will also give him extended control over dissemination
of local news in New York, where he would own both Channel 5 and
Channel 9 as well as The New York Post.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, however, raises questions about how News Corp. will
deal with current Federal Communications Commission restrictions.
These include a limit on how much reach one broadcasting company
can attain and a ban on cross-ownership of newspapers and TV
stations in the same city, for which Murdoch won a waiver when only
Channel 5 was involved.
</P>
<P>
   The deal especially throws into question what may happen to UPN,
which is now owned by Viacom but will become the Paramount Network
in January.
</P>
<P>
   No network has ever succeeded without owning stations in the two
largest media markets of New York and Los Angeles. Viacom, which
also owns CBS, finds itself in the position of running a network
whose two biggest stations will be owned by a company that also
owns a rival network. And the affiliation agreement between the
Chris-Craft stations and the Paramount network expires in January.
</P>
<P>
   Some network executives are already predicting that the Viacom
president, Mel Karmazin, will simply decide that the UPN Network,
now losing between $100 million and $150 million a year, is a
property not worth keeping. Faced with some CBS cable TV assets
that had little prospect of turning a profit in the next five
years, the Eye on People channel and Tele-Noticias, Karmazin chose
to shut down both of them.
</P>
<P>
   But the UPN Network had shown recent signs of growth, having
found a hit in a weekly wrestling franchise. One media analyst said
that Karmazin, in recent private conversations, said ``UPN will be
profitable in a year.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very much of a mind to keep it,'' the analyst added.
</P>
<P>
   Whether that will still be true with News Corp. owning the most
important stations broadcasting the network is far from certain.
But the analyst, who spoke on condition of anonymity, cautioned
against any facile predictions that Karmazin will quickly pull out
of UPN.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are too many advantages to owning two networks,'' the
analyst said. ``You could put a CBS News nightly newscast at 10
p.m. on the alternate network and amortize so much more of the
costs of an expensive news division. You can cross-promote to your
second network when your main network may have a show that has a
totally different appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   It is similar opportunities on the local level presented by dual
ownership of stations in the same city that is at the center of
News Corp.'s plans for the Chris-Craft stations. Michael J. Wolf,
who heads the media department at Booz Allen &AMP; Hamilton, said:
``There are cross-promotions that can take place, similar to the
way that companies are able to drive viewers from one cable network
to another. The same thing can work in local television markets.''
</P>
<P>
   Two stations in the same city can also achieve great economies
of scale, Wolf said, by combining news operations and advertising
sales staffs. ``This would let News Corp. get a bigger piece of an
advertiser's budget,'' Wolf said. And it could open up
possibilities in sports, he added, by allowing News Corp. to place
a team's games on two channels. For example, Channel 5 carries
Yankees games. But because that is the flagship station of the Fox
network there are many nights when Fox cannot pre-empt
entertainment programming for a game. Now it might be possible to
move some games over to Channel 9.
</P>
<P>
   Dual-ownership is certain to be most noticed in New York because
of Murdoch's ownership of The Post. Presumably he will have to gain
an additional waiver from the FCC to add Channel 9 if he intends to
retain The Post because of the continuing restriction on
cross-ownership of newspapers and stations.
</P>
<P>
   But Fox will be much more aggressive in seeking to overturn
another FCC restriction, the one that limits a broadcasting company
to owning stations that reach no more than 35 percent of the
nation's homes. Fox was already at that cap before this
acquisition. With the Chris-Craft stations, the network will be far
above the cap. Fox has already filed suit in federal court to
challenge the regulation and analysts and executives said this
weekend that Fox would surely step up its lobbying efforts in
Congress to have the limits either raised or eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the restrictions stay in place, Fox is not likely to
simply sell off stations to get down to the limit. ``You may see a
lot of station swapping take place,'' a Fox executive said. Another
network executive compared what might take place to ``a game of go
fish, where you take one card and I take another.'' The point of
the game: Match up stations and cities to create dual ownership.
</P>
<P>
   But all this presumes that owning stations will continue to be
good business, a point broadcast executives disagree on. One senior
executive with experience at two networks said that many
family-owned companies with long histories running TV stations had
recently decided to quit the business, sensing that the future was
too unpredictable. ``It's not like by adding Channel 9, you now
have two of seven stations in New York. With all the cable channels
out there, it means you have two of 100.''
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, one News Corp. acquisition, the Family Channel,
which Murdoch bought for $1.9 billion in 1997, has struggled to
find an identity and to make money.
</P>
<P>
   Still, David Londoner, a media analyst with ABN Amro, said there
was a prospect that coming digital technology would expand the
reach of local stations by multiplying their signals from one
channel to as many as four. ``More channels in big cities? You
should be able to do something with that,'' he said.

   I really liked (beginitalic)The Replacements (enditalic)the
first time I saw it - when it was called (beginitalic)The Longest
Yard(enditalic).
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe it was (beginitalic)Major League(enditalic). Or
(beginitalic)Necessary Roughness(enditalic). Or any of a dozen
sports movies that feature a ragtag band of misfits who succeed
against all odds.
</P>
<P>
   In that respect, (beginitalic)The Replacements (enditalic)lives
up to its name. It's essentially a collection of spare parts from
other movies, a cheesy knockoff without a whit of creativity.
</P>
<P>
   The film stars Keanu Reeves as a quarterback who blew the big
college game but gets called back to action after NFL players go on
strike. The movie wastes no time in trotting out every sports movie
stereotype and overused scene.
</P>
<P>
   The replacement team (the fictional Washington Sentinels),
includes the usual gang of underdogs we see in every movie: the
psycho linebacker, the overweight sumo wrestler, the wisecracking
receiver with bad hands, the oddball kicker, the gun-toting
gangster and the Bible-thumping preacher.
</P>
<P>
   Don't forget the platitude-spewing coach, played by Gene
Hackman. He becomes a parody of himself about halfway through,
mostly because he's stuck reading dialogue left over from
(beginitalic)Hoosiers(enditalic).
</P>
<P>
   You have to wonder why Warner Bros. made this turkey at all,
especially since the last NFL strike was in 1987. You get the idea
the script was moldering on a shelf somewhere, right next to the
(beginitalic)Rocky VI (enditalic)screenplay. Whoops, I guess that's
a bad example.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, its anti-union message finds really great timing,
given the current actors' strike in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the story, which is simply a collection of scenes
from other sports movies. There's the initial goofy practice
sequence, the argument in the cafeteria, the contemplative moment
in the empty stadium, the bar brawl, the jail cell dance number and
big locker room speech.
</P>
<P>
   There are some laughs here and there, but they mostly dry up in
the second half, when the movie just pounds out the formula.
</P>
<P>
   (beginitalic)The Replacements (enditalic)also features John
Madden and Pat Summerall, real-life football announcers who read
their lines with all the enthusiasm of Soviet newscasters. Madden's
performance is especially stilted, sounding much like the
mix-and-match one-liners he records for his ubiquitous football
video games.
</P>
<P>
   On top of that, the movie doesn't even get its football right.
Since when does the season end on Thanksgiving? Since when do the
cheerleaders go on strike with the players? Since when do teams
carry only one quarterback?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it's only a movie, but it's certainly likely to attract
football fans, who will spot the obvious flaws, such as skinny
Reeves shucking off 250-pound linebackers on his way to the end
zone.
</P>
<P>
   At the screening I attended, the film broke with about 20
minutes left in the movie. That gave the audience time to guess at
the ending.
</P>
<P>
   Amazingly, we all guessed right.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Your story goes here.
</P>
<P>
   (beginitalic)But I'm a Cheerleader (enditalic)is a confused
movie about a confused young woman.
</P>
<P>
   So, of course, you can understand the confusion.
</P>
<P>
   At times, the movie plays as broad satire, lampooning
intolerance against homosexuality. In other places, it seems to
lash out at gay males, portraying them as mincing stereotypes.
Embossed atop the whole thing is a love story that seems more
suited to a John Hughes movie, if he ever made a film about
same-sex relationships.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a movie that tries to be about something but will
probably just offend everyone. That's a shame, because director
Jamie Babbit had some good ideas.
</P>
<P>
   The movie starts out in amusing fashion, as we meet Megan
(Natasha Lyonne), a cheerleader who's confused about her sexuality.
Her boyfriend loves to make out, but she couldn't be more bored
with him. In fact, she's more interested in her fellow
cheerleaders, but she's not quite sure why.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Megan's ultraconservative parents, who immediately arrange
an intervention (a hilarious scene by itself) and ship Megan off to
a homosexual deprogramming camp. There she meets counselor Mike
(RuPaul, out of drag and wearing a ``straight is great'' T-shirt)
and Mary (Cathy Moriarty), who runs the home while trying to
deprogram her own hunky son (Eddie Cibrian).
</P>
<P>
   Since this is a ``message'' movie, the counselors are portrayed
as unsympathetic, tin-plated ideologues who spout ridiculous
theories on sexuality. Much of this is played for laughs, though it
often flies way over the top.
</P>
<P>
   The sets are fun, done in bright colors with a sort of Kmart
chic. The house where the camp is held is even surrounded by a pink
picket fence. The costumes (blue for the boys, pink for the girls)
add a few laughs as well.
</P>
<P>
   Those touches give the movie an unconventional tone, somewhat
akin to John Waters' (beginitalic)Hairspray(enditalic).
</P>
<P>
   For the first half-hour, (beginitalic)But I'm a Cheerleader
(enditalic)is mostly a farce, as Moriarty tries silly methods to
make her charges behave ``normally.'' There are plenty of sight
gags and double entendre, all aimed at showing that the treatment
isn't working.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it's almost having the opposite effect as Megan strikes
up a friendship with Graham (Clea DuVall), a girl who doesn't buy
the brainwashing but pretends to go along. At this point, the film
starts to unravel, lurching from satire to a serious love story.
</P>
<P>
   We also have to endure Babbit's strident, off-putting depiction
of heterosexual sex, as the students try to simulate guy-girl
relationships. This is Babbit telling us that society has no
business trying to force homosexuals to be hetero, and it has all
the subtlety of an anvil dropped from a great height.
</P>
<P>
   And that's the trouble with much of the movie. By the end of it,
we're not so much enlightened as we are sore from being beaten over
the head.

DANCE REVIEW: TROUBLING IMAGES OF MAN AND APE, FROM SENEGAL 
</HEADLINE>
   By JENNIFER DUNNING   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BECKET, Mass. _ ``Le Coq Est Mort'' (``The Rooster Is Dead'') is
on the face of it a fairly simple piece. The 70-minute work,
performed by Company Jant-Bi on Saturday in the Ted Shawn Theater
at the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival here, begins with a brisk
processional of men dressed in business suits and carrying attache
cases. They begin to bond, to fight and to drink together,
eventually shedding all but their trousers to regress to that
essence of primitivism or the natural world, the lolloping ape.
</P>
<P>
   The voyage of self-discovery from frantic, soulless Wall
Streeter to Noble Savage is a familiar enough theme in dance. But
there is one big difference here. The eight men are black Africans,
and the piece was created by Susanne Linke, a leading German
Expressionist choreographer who happens to be white.
</P>
<P>
   ``Le Coq Est Mort,'' set to a seamless weave of Shostakovich and
music by Etienne Schwarcz and Abdou Mama Diouf, grew out of the
participation of Linke and the dancers in collaborative workshops
in 1998. It has been criticized as cultural colonialism and racist
by European intellectuals, both black and white. Germaine Acogny,
the company's charismatic director, was herself troubled initially
by the ape scene. But it did not bother the dancers and the
townspeople of Toubab Dialaw, Senegal, where Jant-Bi is based and
where the premiere took place last year.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the piece would be quite a different matter if it were
performed by white or Asian dancers, given the inbred bigotry that
is so much a part of everyday life today in the United States and
Europe. And the impact and impressive accomplishment of this
disturbing yet strangely exhilarating piece is attributable in
large part to its casting.
</P>
<P>
   Linke and the powerful dancers, each with a face and stage
presence of his own in this putatively faceless chorus, take the
audience through an arduous journey. It begins with movement whose
plainness and repetition grow tedious and continues with
insidiously building signs of disarray, symbolized by the churning
and scuffing of the sand that covers the stage floor.
</P>
<P>
   Then comes the tension of witnessing racist-seeming imagery
placed front and center, unashamedly and without defiance. Further
shocks to the system come with the sudden devastation of the
dance's last moments. Blasts of gunfire are heard. All but one of
the apes drop into the sand, mourned by a single cheeping,
increasingly frantic creature.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly and miraculously, however, his arms straighten like wings
and the sound of animal chirps, crowing, barking and growls begins
to rise from the bodies, muffled at first but growing stronger. The
sounds turn to faint singing, which also grows louder as one by one
the men rise and come forward. Their song, an anthem associated
with Senegalese wrestling matches, ends ``Le Coq Est Mort.''
</P>
<P>
   There are considerable intellectual pleasures to the piece. One
becomes fascinated by the gradual layering and melding of everyday
and modern-dance movement with African dance forms and motifs that
are revitalizing American modern dance today. As fascinating is the
transition from stiff, upright contained movement to tilting,
intricately articulated torsos and resilient bent-kneed travel. The
stage picture is extraordinarily handsome, particularly in the ways
Horst Muehlberger's quietly innovative lighting enhances small
differences of color, texture and light and shadow.
</P>
<P>
   There are a few puzzling or loose philosophical ends. One jokey
moment having to do with a first experiencing of Champagne does
seem condescending. But this is a dance that provokes thought long
after the curtain falls.
</P>
<P>
   Linke addresses man's growing alienation from his own
physicality, an effect of his striving for power. Developing the
piece, the dancers said that they found the ape movement
technically challenging and inherently beautiful rather than
demeaning.
</P>
<P>
   Viewers must be willing to loosen their grip on the constructs
of racism and the parameters of Western physicality to embrace this
journey into an unnerving unknown.
</P>
<P>
   The performers make this possible, especially the genially
implacable Abubakar Usman and the febrile, almost painfully
innocent Chrysogone Diangouaya. The fine cast was completed by Cire
Beye, Djibril Diallo, Amadou Gueye, Moustapha Gueye, Papa Sy and
Jean Tamba. Avi Kaiser was co-choreographer. Oumou Sy designed the
costumes.

POP REVIEW: LATIN AMERICAN BANDS ROOTED IN THE '70s AND '80s  
 By JON PARELES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As Latin Americans invent their own kind of rock,
they eagerly recycle music from afar, happy to mix and mismatch.
Sometimes they turn pop discards into trophies. Three South
American bands _ La Ley from Chile, Los Amigos Invisibles from
Venezuela and Illya Kuryaki and the Valderramas, from Argentina _
performed at Central Park Summerstage on Saturday afternoon,
latching on to 1970s and 80s styles with respect and mockery. The
concert was the lead-in to the first Latin Alternative Music
Conference, a music-business convention in New York City running
through Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   La Ley, which topped the bill and ended up playing through a
downpour, was a Spanish-speaking echo of the 80s, particularly of
British and Irish bands that took themselves extremely seriously.
La Ley's songs addressed grand subjects: faith, love, destiny, the
meaning of life. In ``Eternidad,'' which opened La Ley's set, Beto
Cuevas sang, ``I'm nearing the end of an existential highway.''
</P>
<P>
   The music approached its high-minded messages with sounds that
ruled MTV in the mid- &UR; ' &LR; 80s. In rock marches that had the triumphal
tone of Simple Minds' songs, Pedro Frugone used plenty of U2's
echoing guitar effects, while Cuevas emoted with the melodrama of
Dave Gahan of Depeche Mode.
</P>
<P>
   Brief touches of surf guitar and funk hinted that La Ley, which
has been performing since the early  &UR; ' &LR; 90s, was once less pompous.
But for the most part the band presented the least encouraging side
of rock en espanol: a direct Spanish translation of an imported
style.
</P>
<P>
   Los Amigos Invisibles had a simpler imperative: to get people
dancing. Their core sound is the smooth mid- &UR; ' &LR; 70s funk that
returned in the  &UR; ' &LR; 90s as so-called acid jazz, and their songs are
built around the scrubbing, syncopated rhythm-guitar chords of Jose
Luis Pardo, Los Amigos' main songwriter. But Los Amigos also toyed
with other styles: merengue, boogaloo, hip-hop, even a techno
bassline spattered with conga drumming. Julio Briceno sang more or
less sardonic come-ons, making romantic promises while sometimes
grabbing his crotch. Listeners could enjoy the ironies, or ignore
them and keep on dancing; Los Amigos have done their funk homework.
</P>
<P>
   Illya Kuryaki and the Valderramas also love  &UR; ' &LR; 70s funk. Their
current album, ``Leche'' (Universal), has a guest appearance by
Bootsy Collins of Parliament-Funkadelic, and onstage the band also
performed a song modeled on P-Funk's 70s rivals, Earth Wind and
Fire.

<P>
   But funk is only one of the styles tossed into the band's songs.
Illya Kuryaki's music is a wild patchwork, ricocheting from hip-hop
to rock to funk to salsa to a Spanish-language revamp of Queen's
``Another One Bites the Dust,'' easily jumping from suavity to
noise. And the lyrics, rapped and sung by Emmanuel Horvilleur and
Dante Spinetta Zalazar, add a layer of surreal poetry, full of
rebelliousness, death and raunchy transfiguration; in ``Jennifer
del Estero,'' Jennifer Lopez leaves her derriere in the singer's
freezer. Illya Kuryaki is a promising sign that rock en espanol
plans to respect no boundaries.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Terry McAuliffe is standing on the stage of the
Staples Center, site of what he habitually calls ``the greatest
convention ever, `` when he takes a call from Mayor Richard
Riordan.
</P>
<P>
   McAuliffe has been itching to talk to Riordan all morning, ever
since he learned that Riordan, a Republican who helped bring the
Democratic convention here, was scheduled to speak at the other
convention in Philadelphia that night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dick!'' McAuliffe shouts into his cell phone. ``I thought you
were endorsing us and going to be a Democrat!''
</P>
<P>
   Pause.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want you to start disrupting, throw like marbles out, I want
you to disrupt this thing, Dick.''
</P>
<P>
   Pause.
</P>
<P>
   ``Listen, I got great plans here. I think we have a good ticket
here, but get out of Philadelphia and get back here.''
</P>
<P>
   Pause.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to make theirs look like a kiddie show. We got
everything here. I'm actually in the arena right now. It looks
spectacular!''
</P>
<P>
   Meet Terry McAuliffe, master of the (Democratic) universe, the
uber fund-raiser of American politics. At 43, McAuliffe has perhaps
raised more money for the Democratic Party than anyone, ever _ from
the first $238,000 he raised for President Carter in 1979 at the
age of 21, to the record $26.5 million he raised for Democrats in a
tribute to President Clinton last May.
</P>
<P>
   As one of Clinton's closest friends, McAuliffe has raised the
money for Clinton's legal defense fund, his not-yet-built
presidential library in Arkansas and Clinton's 1996 re-election
effort. By some reckonings, he has helped raise $300 million.
</P>
<P>
   Now, McAuliffe is chairman of the committee responsible for
mounting the Democratic convention, called in by Clinton and Vice
President Gore at the 11th hour to salvage an operation facing
perilous financial problems.
</P>
<P>
   There was an $11 million budget shortfall to cover, messy labor
disputed to solve and the small matter of what to do with 25,000 to
50,000 anticipated demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
   Not to mention the really big problems, such as how to allocate
precious convention floor passes to Really Important Members of
Congress, all of whom insisted on more passes than they were
allocated.
</P>
<P>
   With Gov. George W. Bush riding a strong post-convention bounce,
the heat is on McAuliffe and convention organizers to deliver a
strong Democratic convention for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a tremendous amount of pressure on us,'' McAuliffe
says. ``We know we have to deliver a convention that works.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to provide energy and excitement for the Gore
campaign,'' he continues. ``He's got to come out of this convention
like a turbo-charged booster rocket.''
</P>
<P>
   The rocket metaphor aptly describes McAuliffe. To spend a day in
Terry's World is to enter a testosterone-filled universe where egos
roam large and connections are the coin of the realm.
</P>
<P>
   McAuliffe combines the brashness of Jerry McGuire, the fictional
Hollywood sports agent, with the enthusiasm of Mary Poppins.
</P>
<P>
   Terry-speak is the colloquial of the consumate deal maker.
Financial contributors are ``the money guys.'' Greetings include
``Are you pumped?'' or ``Light the candle!'' or ``You're the man.''
</P>
<P>
   Volume is important and attitude is everything. An Irish
Catholic who has made a fortune in real estate and a host of
private ventures _ much of it from contacts established through his
fundraising _ McAuliffe grins a lot and laughs in a deep baritone.
He cajoles. He needles. He jokes. His attention span is short, so
motion is important.
</P>
<P>
   When all else fails, he succeeds because he is best friends with
the most powerful man in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the day, everyone knows that I talk to the
president every day, everyone knows that I talk to the vice
president and everyone knows that I talk to Hillary,'' McAuliffe
says.
</P>
<P>
   McAuliffe is the grease that keeps the Democratic Party working.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terry is probably one of the most popular people in our
party,'' says Senate minority leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.).
``Because of his energy, because of his loyalty, because of his
incredible organizational skills, because of who is.''
</P>
<P>
   On a recent morning, McAuliffe is sitting around a small, round
table in his 42nd floor office overlooking the downtown. Photos
decorate the walls. There is McAuliffe and his wife and three older
children sitting with the Clintons at the millennium party on the
Washington mall; another with McAuliffe standing between Rep.
Richard Gephardt (D-Mo.) and Gore.
</P>
<P>
   In his in-basket, there is an dire plea for $50,000 to help pay
for a convention party honoring a Democratic member of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa), then in the hunt for the vice
presidential pick, has already left an urgent message. McAuliffe
calls Harkin in Iowa. The conversation is off the record.
</P>
<P>
   Afterwards, McAuliffe grins and whistles through his teeth, ``He
wants it bad.''
</P>
<P>
   McAuliffe is then briefed on new plans to allow the
demonstrators space directly across the street from the
convention's entrance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could have been worse,'' convention lawyer Jeff Modisett
tells McAuliffe.
</P>
<P>
   But McAuliffe is staring at Lou Vasta, the logistics coordinator
in charge of getting delegates in and out of the convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you go to bed last night?'' McAuliffe asks Vasta. ``You
look half dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Vasta tells McAuliffe he's fine. McAuliffe studies him some
more.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't like it, Lou, I can tell,'' says McAuliffe,
referring to the prospect of having demonstrators so close to the
convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel as good I can knowing that we have 50,000 demonstrators
coming and a convention to run,'' Vasta says. ``We can make it
work.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the attitude!'' McAuliffe exclaims. ``It works. It's
not ideal, but it works.''
</P>
<P>
   McAuliffe is then briefed on what he should say at a news
conference to unveil the two, official convention posters.
</P>
<P>
   A small television is tuned to CNN, broadcasting the day's
proceedings at the GOP convention 2,000 miles away. The sound is
off, and McAuliffe doesn't watch.
</P>
<P>
   At the news conference, McAuliffe rushes up to greet poster
artist Phoebe Beasley.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen your work,'' gushes McAuliffe, who actually only
saw a smudgy black and white photcopy of the poster. ``It's
fabulous.''
</P>
<P>
   In front of the television cameras, McAuliffe says, for perhaps
the thousandth time, that Los Angeles can expect ``the greatest
convention ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving the convention center, McAuliffe takes 30 minutes
to see how the hall is coming together. The podium is in place, but
the arena is mostly a jumble of cables, speakers and sawdust.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ricky!'' McAuliffe shouts to Ricky Kirschner, the convention
producer. ``Come on, pump up. The greatesteadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``He encourages people to get in there and solve it,'' says
Gorman. ``The guy can pick up the phone and get anybody. That
helps.''
</P>
<P>
   When Gore begged McAuliffe to take the chairman's job after
former Colorado Gov. Roy Romer left, McAuliffe knew there were
money problems.
</P>
<P>
   What he didn't know was that the city host committee, charged
with raising the convention money, was short at least $4 million
and he had a week to find $4 million to pay contractors to start
work at Staples.
</P>
<P>
   McAuliffe and Riordan turned to the city council for a bail out,
cajoling the 15 member body to pony up $4 million.
</P>
<P>
   McAuliffe quickly declared that the money problems were over to
squelch negative stories that he feared would tag the convention a
loser. The claim was part bravado.
</P>
<P>
   While he and Riordan closed the immediate shortfall, the actual
amount they needed to finish the convention kept growing.
</P>
<P>
   The host committee is still short up to $2 million, but
McAuliffe insists the money problems are over. ``In 21 years of
doing this, when I say it's done, it's done,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   In the afternoon, spin master James Carville calls to ask
McAuliffe for a favor at the convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen a guy get more done,'' Carville says later.
``He doesn't have sticks. He just has carrots. He can just call
people and they send him checks.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, Carter was so impressed with McAuliffe that he made him
finance director at the Democratic National Committee. He was 23.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, he has assembled perhaps the longest Roledex of
``money guys'' of anyone in the business.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people ask for help,'' says Brian Hardwick, the DNC's
finance director. ``Terry asks for the money. In fundraising you
have to ask for it, but he makes people feel good about it. He
jokes about it. He says, 'oh come on, a man of your stature can do
much more than that,' stuff like that.''
</P>
<P>
   DNC Chairman Ed Rendell says a month before the May gala, which
set the fund-raising record for a single event, McAuliffe assembled
a group of 25 donors to meet Gore.
</P>
<P>
   McAuliffe introduced everyone to Gore, Rendell says, announcing
that each had contributed twice as much as they had actually
pledged to give.
</P>
<P>
   ``He talked about you in such glowing terms and with jokes and
fun and laughter, that Terry was upping the ante on these people
right in front of their eyes, in front of the vice president of the
United States, and they were loving it!'' says Rendell.
</P>
<P>
   It's two o'clock and McAuliffe has just hit the first snag of
the day. Assistant Jessica Smith informs him that Spago, one of
L.A.'s trendiest restaurants, can't give him a dinner reservation
until too late.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them you were really famous,'' Smith offers meekly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, we'll see if we have any juice,'' McAuliffe says,
instructing Smith to call ``the guy who owns the place.''
</P>
<P>
   McAuliffe knows a lot of people in politics, but he is almost
culturally illiterate. He gleefully tells the story of going to the
late Pamela Harriman's house, seeing former Illinois Sen. Paul
Simon, and being introduced to someone else named Paul Simon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I say to him, Are you Senator Simon's son?'' he cackles.
</P>
<P>
   McAuliffe attends more meetings, but he can't stop talking about
the $15 million Republicans raised at two fundraisers in
Philadelphia. ``Shameless,'' he happily tells three reporters who
call.
</P>
<P>
   Then he laughs at his own chutzpah. ``The Republicans are really
going to love that coming from me!'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Good news arrives in the form of McAuliffe's assistant, who
tells him he is on at Spago ``for the whole evening.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You hear that?'' McAuliffe says. ``We're on for the whole
evening.''
</P>
<P>
   En route to Spago, McAuliffe makes no apologies for the
controversial $1.3 million in cash he put up so the Clintons could
purchase their home in New York, or the fundraising excesses of the
1996 election, which he blames on the DNC not the Clinton-Gore
committee that he chaired.
</P>
<P>
   His only regret about the loan to the Clintons _ subsequently
abandoned after a media backlash -_ was that he nearly forgot to
tell his wife, Dorothy, about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Listen, everybody is with you when you are winning,'' he says,
summing up his friendship with Clinton. ``Your true friends are
with you when the chips are down.''
</P>
<P>
   At Spago, McAuliffe's newest friend is GiGi Bose, a manager of
the restaurant who fawns over McAuliffe and sends out an appetizer
of salmon tartar served in a cracker ice cream cone.
</P>
<P>
   During dinner, McAuliffe spots a Lebanese oilman who he calls a
``billionaire.'' He stops by his table and returns with the news
that the oilman has offered to pick up the dinner tab.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if I was going to have one friend in the world, it
would be this man,'' says the benefactor in accented English,
stopping by the table later.
</P>
<P>
   But McAuliffe still has one more friend to make before the
evening is done: Chris, the waiter, who McAuliffe learns was a Gulf
War veteran.
</P>
<P>
   McAuliffe urges Chris to call him if he wants to drop by the
convention after it starts. He rises from the table and leads the
group in a round of applause.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thanks, Chris,'' McAuliffe says, smiling broadly. ``You're the
next mayor!''

IN BEATING RUIZ, HOLYFIELD RAISES MORE QUESTIONS THAN ANSWERS 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL ARKUSH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ The right hand late in the third round stunned his
opponent, who began to wobble. A visit to the canvas seemed
imminent. But at this pivotal moment in Saturday night's World
Boxing Association heavyweight championship bout against the
unheralded John Ruiz, 37-year-old Evander Holyfield could not do
what he almost surely would have done during his best years. He
could not put his opponent away.
</P>
<P>
   He could not do it the rest of the 12-round fight, either. In
fact, he almost lost it, escaping with a narrow decision before
about 8,500 fans at The Paris Las Vegas Casino Resort. Two judges
scored it 114-113, and the other judge had it 116-112. Only by
capturing the final round did Holyfield avoid defeat.
</P>
<P>
   But now that this close call is over, Holyfield may have an even
tougher time avoiding the doubts. Doubts about whether he can
regain the form that made him one of boxing's most admired
warriors.
</P>
<P>
   He was not, after all, not facing Lennox Lewis or Riddick Bowe
or Mike Tyson, fighters of supreme skill or power. He was facing
Ruiz, a 4-1 underdog, who had not beaten anyone of distinction and
who once lost to David Tua in 19 seconds. Yet, except for the
third-round flourish and a few good shots later in the fight,
Holyfield never had Ruiz in any real trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield, who weighed in at 221 pounds, does not believe in
doubts. He never has. He has been counted out before, yet always
found a way to bounce back with victories against the best in his
sport. So in his postfight comments, he sounded as proud and
confident as ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I attempted to reach a goal, people told me I
wouldn't make it,'' said Holyfield, who, by beating Ruiz, became
the first fighter to win the heavyweight crown four times, although
many say this one is tainted because Lewis, the former champion,
lost his WBA belt in the courts, not in the ring.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I fought Buster Douglas, everyone said I won because he
was out of shape,'' Holyfield added. ``He might have been out of
shape, but that's not my problem. I did beat him. After fighting
Bowe, I came back and won. My goal was to win again and I did.''
</P>
<P>
   As for his inability to put the 224-pound Ruiz away, Holyfield
had an answer for that, as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``He leads with his head,'' said Holyfield, who earned $5
million and improved his record to 37-4-1. ``I hit him with hard
punches. He is an awkward fighter.''
</P>
<P>
   Awkward or not, Ruiz, who was attempting to make his own history
_ the first Latino to capture the heavyweight championship _ had a
different analysis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fought my heart out and I feel like I won the fight,'' said
Ruiz, 28, of Chelsea, Mass. He lost for the first time in 12 bouts
since the Tua fight, dropping his record to 36-4. ``This was a big
setback. This is something I've been dreaming about. But that's
life. I will keep fighting on.''
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after the fight, Holyfield said he would offer Ruiz
a rematch but hoped to ultimately face Lewis in a bid to reunify
the title. Lewis had been the undisputed champion until he was
stripped of his WBA belt by a federal judge who ruled that he had
violated a contract by refusing to fight Ruiz, then ranked as the
association's top contender. Lewis, who still owns the World Boxing
Council and International Boxing Federation titles, instead fought
Michael Grant, knocking him out in the second round on April 29 in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not going anywhere. I am the WBA champion,'' said
Holyfield, who lost a unanimous decision to Lewis in their second,
and most recent, fight last November. Their first match, in March
1999, ended in a controversial draw.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has two belts and I have one,'' Holyfield said. ``I am very
happy to be the first four-time world heavyweight champion, but
this is just the first step.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a first step that almost went backward.

   DONGGUAN, China _ A banner identifies the bustling warren of
streets in this southern Chinese city as the New Garden Village
Meat and Vegetable Market. And, indeed, one can find meat and
produce in many varieties _ fresh or cured, hanging from hooks or
still squawking in cages.
</P>
<P>
   At first, it looks like just another Chinese town, but not on
closer inspection.
</P>
<P>
   New Garden Village is one of China's most notorious ``concubine
villages.'' Hundreds of mainland Chinese women here live in a dozen
rows of drab, concrete high-rises, kept there as mistresses or
common-law wives of Hong Kong men. On a recent evening they prowled
the market _ incongruously clad in skin-tight black pants and
clingy tops _ buying groceries for dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, a real estate agent hawked cheap apartments on the order
of glorified motel rooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can rent by the month,'' she said, winking at a passer-by
and the woman with him.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the ties that bind Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland,
there may be few more pervasive than sex. The link is not largely
fueled by quick thrills and anonymous encounters, though both are
readily available. Rather, it is based on a remarkably durable web
of relationships that have flowered between relatively poor Chinese
women and more affluent Hong Kong men, whose jobs require them to
spend days or weeks at a time in the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Hong Kong reverted to Chinese rule in 1997, the
border between the two had become increasingly porous. Hong Kong
companies set up scores of factories in cities like Dongguan,
dispatching managers to oversee the assembly lines and truck
drivers to haul goods to and fro.
</P>
<P>
   Whether to soothe their loneliness, stroke their egos or indulge
their fantasies, many of these commuters support mistresses or de
facto second wives. Concubine villages have sprouted up across
Guangdong province.
</P>
<P>
   To some of these Lotharios, having a mistress is a totem of
success _ proof that they can afford to maintain two households.
Granted, the cost of housing in Guangdong is a fraction of that in
Hong Kong. Two-bedroom apartments in New Garden Village rent for as
little as $195 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the affordability of the practice, anthropologists say it
is deeply rooted in Chinese culture: The emperors had their
concubines, Mao was famous for his serial conquests and traders
kept spouses in every port. In Hong Kong, even when it was a
rule-bound British colony, concubines were legal until 1971.
</P>
<P>
   But now the Chinese government is starting to view wholesale
adultery as a social menace, and it is cracking down.
</P>
<P>
   In July, the Guangdong authorities sentenced a Hong Kong man to
10 months in jail for living in ``factual bigamy.'' The man, Choi
Kai-pang, had a wife in Hong Kong but lived with a mainland woman
in the border city of Shenzhen. The couple even had a phony Chinese
marriage certificate.
</P>
<P>
   Men who do not pretend to be married to their mistresses are
only slightly less at risk. Guangdong recently changed its laws to
make long-term cohabitation by unmarried couples a crime. Although
a single act of adultery is not illegal, a man who lives with a
woman to whom he is not married can be sent to a labor camp for two
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government is taking measures to prohibit this behavior
because the affairs have caused family problems and violence,''
said Paulina C.Y. Kwok, a social worker with the charity Caritas
Hong Kong, who counsels the wives of wayward men. ``They say it
goes against Chinese values.''
</P>
<P>
   Women's groups in China contend that the proliferation of
extramarital sex corrodes the Chinese family. Though the problem is
most acute in freewheeling southern China, mass migration and
economic dislocation have made infidelity a problem across the
country. The children who result from these liaisons also make
Beijing's family-planning policies less effective, prompting some
legal experts to call for marriage laws that mandate cohabitation
with one's spouse.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The changes will not come soon enough for Mrs. Lam, a Hong Kong
woman who says her 26-year marriage has been devastated by her
husband's philandering on the mainland. She declined to give her
full name to avoid embarrassment. Four years ago, the couple moved
to a village in Guangdong to start a fish-breeding farm. Her
husband visited karaoke bars, where he met young women from rural
China who worked as prostitutes.
</P>
<P>
   When Mrs. Lam returned to Hong Kong for a lengthy medical
procedure in 1997, her husband secretly took a mistress, she said.
He rented a cozy apartment for the woman in a neighboring town and
lent her his wife's clothes. In addition to rent, her husband paid
the woman several thousand dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``These mainland women have beautiful skin and pretty faces,''
Mrs. Lam said, her face creased with sorrow and bitterness. ``They
know how to please another woman's husband. They do it for economic
stability.''
</P>
<P>
   To save her marriage, Mrs. Lam, 48, demanded that her husband
move back to Hong Kong. But recently she discovered that he had
taken up with yet another woman. She contends that the morals of
Guangdong have corrupted her husband, making him believe that
mistresses are the social norm.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in some ways, the concubine village here seems less a
red-light district than a starter community. Women wheel babies,
stopping to browse for kitchen utensils. Children scamper around a
leafy park.
</P>
<P>
   But there are reminders that New Garden Village is no Mayberry.
Next to the kitchen shop is a beauty salon, where little hair was
being cut. Instead, three heavily made-up young women loitered on a
divan, waiting for customers.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   One Hong Kong factory manager who has commuted to China since
1993 predicts the new laws will not curb the problem. For one
thing, the police will arrest a man on charges of bigamy or illegal
cohabitation only if a complaint is lodged against him here. Hong
Kong and China are separate legal jurisdictions.
</P>
<P>
   A Hong Kong woman who wants to haul her husband into a Chinese
court must also make sure that the state can prove he is living
with a mistress _ not easy to do in the rent-by-the-month world of
concubine villages.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many in Hong Kong are sure to welcome the crackdown. The
territory has watched nervously as its men have sired a generation
of illegitimate children _ 520,000 by one estimate _ with one foot
in the mainland and one in Hong Kong. Last year, a local court
briefly granted those children residency in Hong Kong; the ruling
was overturned by the Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
   ``If men are in danger of going to prison, they may control
their impulses,'' said Kwok, the social worker.
</P>
<P>
   But she added that laws alone would not solve the problem.
China, she said, must improve the status of women, particularly the
young, penniless ones who pour in from the hinterland. ``If these
women can get real jobs, if their status in society improves, they
won't get into this business to begin with,'' Kwok said.

CLINTON LEGACY ALSO A HOPE FOR HILLARY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Legacy.
</P>
<P>
   That's the big theme of this opening night of the Democratic
National Convention _ not just a fond look back at Bill Clinton's
eight years as president, but also a longing look ahead at Hillary
Rodham Clinton's possible six years or more as senator.
</P>
<P>
   At the festivities' outset, Hillary is being presented as no
less a star than Bill, Al, or Joe. She headed a star-studded,
soft-money-raising concert on Saturday, another fund-raiser at Sony
Studios Sunday night, and Monday night _ the capper _ she will
speak from the podium for 15 minutes in prime time.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's supporters hope that all these events will boost
her own political prospects _ and perpetuate the Clinton name as a
force in American politics.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly she could use a boost.
</P>
<P>
   After more than a year of constant campaigning, Mrs. Clinton,
one of the most famous women in the world, is barely holding her
own against her opponent, Representative Rick Lazio, who was
unknown outside Long Island a few months ago and who, even now,
casts only the vaguest impression.
</P>
<P>
   Of two statewide polls released last week, one puts her ahead by
two points and the other puts him ahead by seven. Both results fall
within the statistical margins of error.
</P>
<P>
   The poll in which she trails, issued by John Zogby, shows her
support slipping in most demographic categories _ upstate and
suburbs, among the middle-aged and seniors, the middle-income and
poor, white people, men, even union members.
</P>
<P>
   In the survey that puts her in the lead, by the Quinnipiac
College Polling Institute, she hasn't lost ground, but she hasn't
gained any, either.
</P>
<P>
   Most political analysts agree that she is doing just about
everything she can _ campaigning nearly every day, touching base in
every one of New York's 62 counties, spending extensive time
upstate, returning to her safety zones in the big cities now and
then to keep her base fired up.
</P>
<P>
   Her speeches have become less mannered. Huge crowds greet her
everywhere, most of them enthusiastically. She has made the
obligatory late-night talk show appearances _ with David Letterman
and, just last Friday, Jay Leno _ and come off relaxed and even
funny.
</P>
<P>
   Still, her polling numbers haven't nudged. At no point has a
poll shown her support rising above the magical 50 percent _ not
even when Rudolph W. Giuliani, the formidable mayor of New York
City, dropped out of the race and the obscure Lazio took his place.
</P>
<P>
   The final Clinton vs. Giuliani poll showed the two tied, at
45-45. The first Clinton vs. Lazio poll put her ahead, 47-32. In
other words, even then, her numbers hardly rose a blip; only the
undecideds surged. Then, after a week _ enough time for people to
get an initial impression of Lazio _ the numbers went back to where
they were.
</P>
<P>
   The underlying fact seems to be this: Many people like the first
lady a lot, many can't stand her, and the electorate is pretty
evenly divided between these two groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``This race is Hillary vs. Hillary,'' Zogby said over the
weekend. ``Her opponent could be _ well, not X, but X with a face,
and the numbers would be the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Her supporters hope that Monday night's speech will highlight
two of Mrs. Clinton's strongest points _ her stature in the
Democratic Party and her identification as an advocate of its major
social and economic causes.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is clearly a big deal at this convention, while Lazio was
a little man who wasn't even officially at the Republican
convention,'' said Maurice Carroll, head of the Quinnipiac poll.
``This is a plus for her.''
</P>
<P>
   But she has to play the scene carefully. Many of the first
lady's critics suspect she is using the Senate race as a stepping
stone to regain the White House, this time in her own name. She has
laughingly denied this accusation. Still, she must know that she
needs to come off as a leader but not The Leader.
</P>
<P>
   If her recent campaign speeches are any indication, her address
Monday night will play up the differences between Democrats and
Republicans generally _ in the presidential election, in
congressional contests nationwide, and, perhaps only by
implication, her own race.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, her campaigners have known that she could
win if the election were decided on the issues _ and that she could
lose if it came down to personalities. This became particularly
true after the departure of Giuliani, who had his own knack for
rubbing people the wrong way.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of New York voters, though more conservatice than
several years ago, are still Democratic, by a 5-3 margin. President
Clinton won every county here in the 1996 election. On the
high-profile issues _ education, health care, gun control, abortion
_ most state voters are closer to the Clintons and the Democrats
than to Lazio or George W. Bush and the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   This is why Lazio has tried to make the race about Mrs. Clinton
_ and why, Monday night, Mrs. Clinton will take a chunk of free TV
time to make it about the issues.
</P>

SPORTS COLUMN: A ROOKIE'S GOOD INTENTIONS GONE AWRY 
</HEADLINE>
  By   IRA BERKOW   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The passerby sees the headlights of a parked automobile and
opens the door to turn them off when he is arrested for car theft.
A guy goes to light the cigarette of a woman and as she bends
forward her hair catches fire. You volunteer to hammer a nail into
the wall for a friend and the plaster collapses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sir,'' Samuel Johnson once said, ``the road to hell is paved
with good intentions.''
</P>
<P>
   Enter Jack Golden. Poor Jack Golden. Put another brick on that
road, Jack.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you've already heard about Jack Golden _ Good Samaritan,
Team Player, Alleged Schnook.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you saw some of the headlines in Saturday's newspapers
that followed Jack Golden and the final play of the Giants football
game against Jacksonville: ``Good Start Turns Awful for Giants,''
``For Golden, Giant Gaffe,'' and ``Jints Chill Out on Golden
Goof.'' And maybe somewhere else there was: ``Golden Opportunity
Fizzles.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack Golden, a 23-year-old rookie linebacker fresh out of
Oklahoma State, is trying to realize a dream and stick with the Big
Blue. He understands that he must impress the coaches, primarily
the head coach, Jim Fassel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach Fassel talked all week about needing to play smart,''
Golden said, after Friday night's preseason game in Jacksonville,
``and as soon as I came to the sidelines I looked in his eyes and I
said, `I messed up.' I was trying to be smart and wasn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Return with us now to that fateful moment: Giants are leading,
13-9, with seven seconds left in the last quarter. While this game
doesn't count in the standing, it still would be a morale booster
for the Giants to beat a Super Bowl contender. So in what may be
the final play of the game, cornerback Fred Lewis, Golden's fellow
rookie on the Giants, intercepts a pass a foot or so in front of
the goal line. He starts to run with the ball instead of taking a
step back and dropping to one knee in the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it would give the Jaguars 2 points for a safety, but so
what, the Giants would still win, 13-11. By running around _ he did
step back into the end zone, but only to run crossfield _ he was
jeopardizing a fumble, a Jags recovery, and potential touchdown
that would send our heroes to Loserville.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, in the heat of battle, in the searing split seconds
of battle, Lewis doesn't compute all this. But guess who does? You
got it: Golden. Golden ventures what any far-thinking, well-meaning
citizen in shoulder pads and face mask would. He tackles Lewis!
Lewis, not expecting friendly fire, fumbles. Guess who recovers the
ball in the end zone? No, not Golden, but Brandon Christenson, who
does not wear a white jersey, but a teal one. Giants lose, 16-13.
</P>
<P>
   ``Holy smokes!'' Fassel said after the game, among other
exclamations. And when asked to explain what occurred on that play,
he said, ``Lord only knows why. ...''
</P>
<P>
   Too facile. What he should have said was, ``Golden made an
outstanding play, a smart play. Einstein-ian even. Ball just took a
bad bounce.''
</P>
<P>
   You're supposed to know the rules, and Golden obviously did.
While the result wasn't what a Giant partisan wishes for, it is
still a pleasure to see brains exercised with brawn _ though, yes,
in this case an eager rookie upon contact demonstrated a little too
much brawn.
</P>
<P>
   From little league on up, an athlete is instructed to consider
what he would do if the ball is hit to him, or the football spirals
his way, or if he snares a squirming basketball. Yet too often we
see the reverse in players who should know better, but don't.
</P>
<P>
   Like Benny Agbayani's blunder Saturday night _ catching a fly
ball in left field in the fourth inning and, thinking there were
three outs instead of two, giving the ball to a boy in the stands.
Meanwhile, two runs scored for San Francisco, giving the Giants a
2-1 lead. The Mets finally won, 3-2. Agbayani said he had misread
the scorebaord. In the future, the Mets might want to equip him
with a cell phone to be in touch with the dugout after every pitch.
</P>
<P>
   I've also seen a Knicks' player try to save a ball going out of
bounds under his own basket and throw it to the other team for a
score. We've seen a star college player call timeout in the crucial
final seconds of a game, in which his team was out of timeouts,
thus garnering a technical foul and giving significant free throws
to the opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it is true, as noted elsewhere, that the best laid
plans do go awry. Like the man in Los Angeles who boarded a plane
thinking he was going to Oakland, Calif., and wound up in Auckland,
New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   Or the saga of Jim Marshall, a defensive end for the Vikings,
who scooped up a fumble against the 49ers in 1964 and raced 66
yards to the end zone. On the sideline, Fran Tarkenton, the
Vikings' quarterback, ran nearly the whole distance yelling and
waving to Marshall. The crowd was screaming so loud Marshall
couldn't quite catch Tarkenton's words. He thought it was simply to
cheer him on. What Tarkenton was hollering was, ``Go back, you fool
you, go back!'' Jim had run the wrong way.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the reverse _ unplanned good fortune: Christopher
Columbus spotting land and shouting, ``India! India! At last,
India!'' And a man named Crawford Long coming upon the idea for
surgical anesthesia after hurting himself and feeling no pain while
stoned on ether at a party. Of somewhat less historical
significance, I've seen a guy throw a bad pass that bounced off a
teammate's head and into his basket.
</P>
<P>
   Some, now, have wondered if Golden's tackle would sink the
Giants into despair. More likely, it makes the Giants a better
team, a smarter team. Is there not a man on the squad who won't be
thinking before every snap what options he has? Rather than be Jack
Golden, they'd rather not be Fred Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   A Yiddish proverb goes, ``Better to lose with a wise man than
win with a fool.'' Because, goes the belief, the next time _
everything equal _ the wise man will win.
</P>
<P>
   For the Giants, it may indeed prove to be the Golden rule. &QL;

 &HT;    TEXAS DEMOCRATS IN L.A. NOT HUGE PLAYERS
 &HT;    By DAVE McNEELY
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It is not by accident that the Texas Democrats are
housed in a hotel at the Los Angeles airport, a 45-minute drive
from the convention center where the Democrats will pick Al Gore
and Joe Lieberman as their presidential ticket.
</P>
<P>
   It is not so much that the other Democrats don't like Texans,
though expect the state's record under Gov. George W. Bush to take
a pounding.
</P>
<P>
   It's just that when it comes to the votes that count in the
electoral college, Texas hasn't been worth much to Democratic
presidential candidates in recent years. The last one to win the
state was Jimmy Carter in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest role the Texas Democrats seem to have had in recent
years is to supply converts to the Republican Party such as Sen.
Phil Gramm, Lt. Gov. Rick Perry and Comptroller Carole Keeton
Rylander.
</P>
<P>
   A principal reason has been that for the four presidential
elections from 1980 through 1992, a Republican Texan named George
Bush was on the ballot either for vice president or president.
Since under federal campaign finance laws, presidential campaigns
get only so much money to spend nationally on the general election
campaign, they're not eager to spend much in states they know
they'll lose.
</P>
<P>
   So, with the exception of 1988, when Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas
was the vice-presidential nominee, Texas has been pretty much
ignored by the Democratic presidential ticket.
</P>
<P>
   And after Bill Clinton in 1992 became the first Democrat to win
the presidency without winning Texas, he didn't even try in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   That lack of spending by the presidential campaign has
contributed to the rapid erosion of once-solid Democratic strength
down the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   And so, the Texans, who once could boast the likes of Lyndon
Johnson and Bentsen, get star treatment and be housed near the
convention site, are now many miles from the convention center and
TV anchor booths.
</P>
<P>
   That said, there are still 231 delegates and 32 alternates from
Texas. Every Texas Democrat in Congress _ all 17 of them _ are
so-called superdelegates, as are three state senators and 22 state
representatives.
</P>
<P>
   There are no Democratic statewide elected officials here, since
there no longer are any. But former state Comptroller John Sharp
will be here, as will former Land Commissioner Garry Mauro.
</P>
<P>
   Since there's no nomination battle to fight over, the Democrats
here will party _ something they're good at.
</P>
<P>
   The Texans are already angling for tickets to some of the bigger
star-studded shindigs, like the one co-sponsored by George
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   They'll also have duty that should be a little easier.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Democrats, even though their sessions will end around
the cocktail hour because they're angling for East Coast prime-time
TV from the West Coast, will also get their get their breakfast
marching orders at the more civil time of 9 a.m.

<TEXT>
<P>
   On a muggy night in Philadelphia, Rick Kaplan sat in the CNN
control booth in an advanced state of bliss. His floor
correspondents were killing themselves to get good material. The
Texas delegates, bowing their heads in prayer during a speech by a
gay congressman, made for a nifty TV moment. And a marquee speech
by Sen. John McCain proved to be just this side of cryptic,
excellent late-evening fodder for Jeff Greenfield and the other
analysts on the skybox anchor desk.
</P>
<P>
   Facing a wall of 100 television screens, Kaplan, CNN's president
of U.S. operations and producer of the convention coverage, could
not contain his joy. ``There's so much news here!'' he exclaimed.
</P>
<P>
   It was the declaration of a man totally in his element, a
representative of a news organization that was clear about its
mission at the conventions: to be everywhere, to see everything, to
throw the equivalent, in the words of another CNN executive, of ``a
political cocktail party.''
</P>
<P>
   The shindigs may be going full blast at all-news cable networks
like CNN, a unit of Time Warner; Fox News Channel, a unit of News
Corp.; and C-Span. But on the broadcast network side of television,
the parties are ever more modest affairs. In fact, turn on ABC, NBC
and CBS this week and take a look at how they cover the Democratic
convention, because you may never see the like on these networks
again.
</P>
<P>
   All three are likely to continue to play a role, and the
political parties are likely to continue to covet every moment on
these highest of high-visibility networks. But the widespread
expectation is that the scaling back in prime time that occurred
this year will only intensify the next time, perhaps limiting the
big three to broadcasting the acceptance speeches of the
presidential and vice presidential nominees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prime time is a different landscape than it was a decade
ago,'' said Al Ortiz, executive producer of the ``CBS Evening
News.'' ``I can't imagine that four years from now the networks are
going to want to spend millions of dollars to come to these places
and do the same thing. They said this four years ago, and yet it's
a big story that we did cut back on a little bit, and I think that
in four years, there will be a further reduction.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, there has been talk in political circles of reducing
the four-day conventions by a day or two, but the networks seem
poised to make the decision themselves. ``Under the current format
it's Monday and Tuesday that are at risk clearly for both
parties,'' said Paul Friedman, executive vice president of ABC
News, referring to the first two convention nights. Noting how
meticulously the parties try to pack these evenings with stars,
like retired Gen. Colin L. Powell and McCain in Philadelphia and
President Clinton in Los Angeles, he added, ``If we have two
totally packaged events there will be less coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   If ABC, NBC and CBS once had similar styles of convention
coverage, blocking out the same sections of prime time and relying
on the same type of programming, the 2000 conventions are
demonstrating the separate paths the three networks are taking. ABC
News remains the most traditional, providing prime-time exposure on
each of the four nights and following up on ``Nightline.'' NBC has
made the most radical departure, drastically reducing its coverage
on the flagship broadcast network and making liberal use of its
brand-name stars on MSNBC, the joint venture of Microsoft and NBC,
which itself is a unit of General Electric.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Lack, the president of NBC News, said the networks have
merely been responding to changes in the nature of the conventions
and the political process. ``The broadcasting platform serves more
as a public service, when the nominee, say, makes that acceptance
speech,'' he said. ``But we don't have much of an obligation to go
through the party's celebration. On the cable platform, you have a
different situation: The 24-hour format is geared toward covering
the news of the day. And they cover the story, no matter what.''
</P>
<P>
   The networks, too, are relying ever more heavily on their Web
operations. Lack said that MSNBC.com was recording about 2 million
users a day during the Republican convention, ``a little bit of a
bump'' over normal usage.
</P>
<P>
   The tension, though, between the commercial demands of prime
time and the networks' civic obligations was evident in
Philadelphia. At CBS, the way that convention coverage was inserted
on the first and second nights into the 10 p.m. editions of ``48
Hours'' and ``60 Minutes II'' was criticized both inside and
outside the organization. And top news personnel, from Andrew
Heyward, the president of CBS News, to Jeff Zucker, executive
producer of NBC's convention coverage, spoke publicly of their
frustrations with the plastic in which the conventions are being
wrapped.
</P>
<P>
   The grumbling, if anything, has created something of a divide in
television news. Cable networks like CNN say they would be just as
happy if the broadcast networks would scale back and just stop
complaining about the lack of news at the conventions, a practice
that Kaplan believes turns off viewers. Indeed, ratings were down
for CNN and the broadcast networks from coverage of the 1996
Republican convention in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview the morning after McCain's speech, Kaplan said:
``I mean, tell me: It's a waste of time to cover a Republican
convention, and it's not a waste of time to put on a failed rerun
of a failed show?'' He was referring to NBC's decision to show a
rerun of its low-rated drama ``First Watch,'' consigning coverage
of the first night of the Republican convention to its cable
partner MSNBC.
</P>
<P>
   ``Journalists ought not to be against covering news,'' he
continued. ``They shouldn't be embarrassed about it. Instead,
they're here to tear the story down.''

POLICE ACTIVITY INCREASES IN CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
   By CRAIG S. SMITH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI, China _ Police activity has been increasing in several
parts of China as the country undergoes a tightening of social
controls ahead of the Oct. 1 National Day holiday.
</P>
<P>
   While the summer sweep of discos and karaoke bars and the
detention of people voicing political dissent happen every year,
the crackdown appears unusually harsh this year.
</P>
<P>
   It coincides with the annual gathering of Communist Party
leaders in the northern seaside resort of Beidaihe, where growing
social discontent and the economic challenges of China's planned
entry into the World Trade Organization are expected to be high on
the agenda.
</P>
<P>
   China is climbing out of an economic slump in which its overall
economic growth rate dipped by close to 7 percent last year.
Several regions of the country went into a deep recession, leading
to scattered unrest in heavily industrialized regions. Now a severe
drought has increased disquiet among much of the country's rural
population.
</P>
<P>
   China's entry into the trade organization, expected later this
year, will increase economic pressure on the bottom rung of the
country's population as it struggles to compete with multinational
corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Following other reports of a crackdown on dissent in recent
days, the police detained a reporter in central China after he
talked to an American journalist about unrest among local farmers,
a human rights group said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Hong Kong-based Information Center for Human Rights and
Democracy said that a Shaanxi province television reporter, Ma
Xiaoming, was picked up by the police after he met a journalist
from an unspecified news organization to talk about farmers trying
to sue the government. Ma was later released.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers in the province have complained of exorbitant taxes and
beatings by the local authorities. And the residents of eight poor
Shaanxi villages are trying to free their lawyer, who was jailed
last year after he went to Beijing to appeal to the central
government on their behalf.
</P>
<P>
   In Beijing the police apparently continued to hold a poet and
editor, Bei Ling, after they seized hundreds of copies of an
independent literary journal he had edited, The Associated Press
reported.
</P>
<P>
   Bei disappeared Friday after telling friends he planned to hold
a discussion forum that afternoon to review the August issue of his
quarterly journal, Tendency, which includes a photograph of the
exiled Chinese dissident Wang Dan and a poem by a dissident
literary critic, Liu Xiaobo.
</P>
<P>
   And in Shanghai, police officers shut down several discos and
bars for minor infractions in what the police described as a
national campaign to clean up China's night life. Several
establishments crowded with foreigners and Chinese have been raided
by vanloads of uniformed police officers for no clear reason, and
some have been told not to reopen until after Oct. 1.

<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ The ``Hang Suharto!'' protesters were out
in the streets, as always. But so was a small rally demanding clean
air, another involving a local land dispute and another promoting
breast-feeding.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, the streets of Jakarta were mostly quiet as
Parliament met last week _ an indication, perhaps, that despite its
daunting problems and continuing disarray, there is hope in
Indonesia for a more ordered and cohesive future.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not over yet,'' cautioned a local journalist. But with
another week to go, this has been the first major political event
since Suharto was driven from office 2{ years ago that has not been
riven by chaos and bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost surreal,'' said a diplomat who has in the past
watched Jakarta burning and residents fleeing. ``The popular vote
is out there on the streets. The popular vote is give this
government a chance. People are speaking by not speaking.''
</P>
<P>
   Clean air and breast-feeding are the kinds of issues that have
been drowned in the past by tidal waves of political rage.
</P>
<P>
   That is not to say that everything here is calm. The politically
critical Parliament session has been as tumultuous and passionate
in its way as the street demonstrations of the past. The session
was to focus on updating the country's patchwork 1945 constitution,
but in fact there is little evidence that the people's business is
being addressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're watching a power struggle in Parliament,'' said Dennis
Heffernan, a director of Van Zorge, Heffernan and Associates, a
political consulting firm. ``It's very primitive from an issue
standpoint, but it's being done without gunpowder or even
fisticuffs. And if that ain't a giant step toward democracy ...''
</P>
<P>
   One thing that has changed is that the opposition now has a
voice inside government, he said. ``The streets are quiet because
the politicians in the halls of power have some constituency, some
basis among average people in this country,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, for the first time in half a century, the Indonesian
people voted in a free election, choosing candidates for Parliament
who had not been vetted by the party in power. But they were
elected to an institution that had little experience in democratic
give-and-take.
</P>
<P>
   The battle inside Parliament now involves raw ambition as
emerging power blocs jostle for dominance in a nation that is
working out new alignments on every front after 32 years of one-man
rule by Suharto.
</P>
<P>
   The session is a sort of D-Day in a concerted multiparty attack
on President Abdurrahman Wahid, a compromise leader with few
political defenses. The parliamentary coalition of opposing parties
that chose him as president 10 months ago has mostly turned against
him, and he finds himself racing back and forth along the cliff top
batting down their attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The dirty little secret of the battle is that despite loud talk
of impeachment, few of his opponents actually want to depose him.
His most prominent challengers _ Amien Rais, who leads an Islamic
coalition, and Akbar Tandjung, who leads Suharto's former ruling
party _ realize that they could not at this time hold a government
together, political experts said.
</P>
<P>
   So Wahid, who remains personally popular, is still the most
acceptable figure among the warring parties. And although
Indonesians inside and outside Parliament have become exasperated
by his erratic and often incompetent administration, he commands
respect for his tolerant and democratic vision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, the vehemence we're seeing in Parliament is
fabricated,'' said Wimar Witoelar, a leading political commentator.
``The game these people are playing is toward positioning for the
next election. They are feeling things out and sounding out the
other guy and seeing how it will play in 2004. Are they going to be
Moslems or nationalists or pragmatists? They will play any game as
long as they can come out of it in a better political position. If
you play the tapes from what they said last year and this year, it
even becomes funny.''
</P>
<P>
   In the tumult, most of the substance has been drained from the
parliamentary session. With every issue now so politicized and with
the session preoccupied by infighting, most political experts now
say any constitutional changes are likely to be postponed.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, personal ambitions aside, the session has become a
forum for working out the dynamics of an infant democracy. It is a
struggle for dominance between the executive and legislative
branches, which in the past were both under the unquestioned
control of Suharto.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have never had a system of checks and balances before,''
the diplomat said. By ganging up on Wahid, the disparate parties
have sought to assert the dominance of Parliament over the once
all-powerful presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, they jeered Wahid at a special session they called
to demand an explanation for his unpopular dismissal of two of his
cabinet ministers. He stubbornly refused to explain himself,
asserting the constitutional division of power.
</P>
<P>
   Last week they forced him to hand over day-to-day government
administration to Vice President Megawati Sukarnoputri. Having done
so, Wahid shifted immediately into his familiar mode of bob and
weave, insisting that it was only duties _ not power _ that he had
given the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   So Parliament is now demanding the right to codify the
arrangement in law, and the president is resisting.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The political nature of the standoff is underscored by the fact
that nobody expects Megawati to be a better administrator than
Wahid. Passive and seemingly uninterested in politics or
administration, Megawati has been a notably absent figure as vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say the trouble with Mega is knowing what she wants,''
a presidential confidant said acidly, using her popular nickname.
``And I suspect she doesn't know herself.''
</P>
<P>
   She has taken little action on the major assignment Wahid gave
her last year, to try to bring peace to a secessionist movement in
remote Irian Jaya and to the Maluku Islands, where religious
fighting has taken more than 3,000 lives. In addition, people close
to the president say that in the past, she has declined the kind of
arrangement that has now been announced.
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement has been pushed in Parliament by her opponents
as well as his, apparently as a sort of Trojan horse in the hope
that she can be manipulated, some experts said.
</P>
<P>
   But recently she has come to demand a bigger role, apparently in
part at least for personal reasons.
</P>
<P>
   According to a number of people active in politics, she has
become irritated by what she sees as the president's dismissive
attitude toward her. And she was reportedly angered in April when
the president fired Laksamana Sukardi, a cabinet minister who is
one of her closest advisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the straw that broke Mega's back,'' Witoelar said.
``Without that incident, maybe Mega would still be content to be a
sort of passive partner. But she either got very angry or somebody
reminded her to be very angry.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that she has gotten what she demanded, one cabinet minister
said, the burden is on Megawati to show that she can govern.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her problem is to shed the image of a housewife, of
uncertainty, of incompetence,'' he said. ``I would probably give
her the proverbial 100 days, see how she does.''
</P>
<P>
   The new partnership at the top could be made to work, he said,
both because Megawati has surrounded herself with a strong circle
of managers and because Wahid could still appoint a sort of chief
of staff to report to both of them.
</P>
<P>
   But unless the coming week explodes in some unexpected way
either on the streets or inside the Parliament building, the most
important event will come after the legislature adjourns.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, Wahid has said, he will appoint a new cabinet and
particularly a new team to manage the flagging economy.
</P>
<P>
   The feuding and the unwieldy cabinet in place now are the
products of the political deals he cut last October to win office.
With the coalition fractured, experts said, he will have more
leeway this time to select his ministers on the basis of merit.
</P>
<P>
   It is this new government lineup _ much more than the political
excitement of the moment _ that may determine the success or
failure of Wahid's struggling government.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Judging by polls and media reaction, Al Gore
engaged the public's interest before the Democratic Convention with
his choice of Joseph Lieberman at least as well as George Bush did
before the Republican event by choosing Dick Cheney. But Gore has
to take a very different tack this week in Los Angeles than the
Republicans did in Philadelphia. If the objective of the GOP was to
soften differences between the parties, Gore's goal has to be to
make the distinctions abundantly clear.
</P>
<P>
   Here the job is principally his. The otherwise smart choice of
running mate not only won't help, but may make the task more
difficult, since Lieberman's record includes often considering
compromises with the GOP on tax cuts, privatization of Social
Security and other issues.
</P>
<P>
   Bush made a strong personal showing in Philadelphia _ one that
Gore will struggle to match. It's unlikely that Gore will overtake
his opponent on voter perceptions of charm, leadership ability or
even the much hoped-for but never observed stature gap. And since
his early stumbles, Bush has not looked like a candidate who will
fall on his face at a critical juncture.
</P>
<P>
   Gore must gently but clearly counter the notion that Bush and
his party are more compassionate and inclusive than Republicans
past. And he has to make voters feel there is something at stake in
the election. A surprisingly large number don't think who's elected
president matters.
</P>
<P>
   For many Americans, the first year of the campaign served to
blur, rather than accentuate, issue differences. A Pew Research
Center survey in June found a bare 51 percent majority of voters
thinking Bush and Gore took different positions. The number saying
their stands were similar had actually increased from 24 percent to
33 percent since last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Little wonder we also found as many as 32 percent saying either
candidate could do a good job and about the same percentage saying
it did not matter who was elected. (In 1992, by contrast, only 18
percent saw the presidential choice as unimportant.)
</P>
<P>
   This is bad news for Al Gore, because when specific issue
questions are raised, he and his party score significantly higher
than Bush and the GOP. The public has expressed more confidence in
the Democrats than Republicans on health care, entitlements,
education, the environment and gun control. And most candidate
image polls until recently also found Gore holding the edge on
these issues, except for gun control.
</P>
<P>
   But so far this issue advantage has not sunk in. Just before the
GOP convention, 53 percent of respondents told Newsweek pollsters
Bush shared their views on top issues, while 43 percent said that
about Gore. After the convention, a follow-up Newsweek poll found
Bush had made progress on some specific issues, like education, as
well.
</P>
<P>
   If Gore wants to move ahead, he has to drill home his
differences with Bush on Social Security reform, health maintenance
organizations, the environment, gun control and education. But
there could be pitfalls. He can't let himself be seen as trying to
scare the public about risks of privatizing Social Security or
introducing school vouchers or tax cuts, but rather as pointing out
how the trade-offs come home to average voters. And he must avoid
seeming mean-spirited. (The Republicans did a brilliant job of
finding the right tone with the general message ``It's not that
President Clinton is a bad man _ he robbed you of an
opportunity.'')
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, who has often worked across party lines, may be
little help to Gore in starkly defining the Democratic position.
But Gore also can't seem to be moving too far to the left, and in
that regard the choice of the centrist Lieberman may be helpful.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It is a long distance from the political
conventions that nominated Al Smith and Franklin D. Roosevelt to
the weeklong infomercials that are called conventions today. Once
conventions were battlefields where real fights were waged over
platforms, personalities and power. Vice presidential choices were
not made beforehand; the selection of the presidential nominee was
seldom sure until the convention had run its course. Conventions
had lives and logic all their own. And they mattered.
</P>
<P>
   This was true for both parties, but the conventions where I
observed it were Democratic.
</P>
<P>
   In Philadelphia in 1948, Hubert Humphrey, then mayor of
Minneapolis, gave a speech that made history. ``The time has
arrived,'' he said, ``for the Democratic Party to get out of the
shadow of states' rights and walk forthrightly into the bright
sunshine of human rights.'' President Harry S. Truman accepted the
civil rights platform, causing the Dixiecrats to bolt the
convention, splitting the party _ or so it seemed. In fact, Truman
united the party by giving it a cause.
</P>
<P>
   In 1952, in Chicago, delegates drafted Gov. Adlai Stevenson of
Illinois at Truman's urging _ the last presidential draft. Four
years later, when Stevenson was nominated again, he threw the
choice for vice president open to the convention, which eventually
nominated Estes Kefauver of Tennessee. I supported Humphrey, by
then a senator, and managed his campaign on the convention floor.
John F. Kennedy was also a contender.
</P>
<P>
   Fast-forward to 1968. The Democratic Convention was controlled
by President Lyndon Johnson and Mayor Richard Daley of Chicago. The
process was corrupted and the people betrayed. Even the effort to
pass an antiwar platform was stifled.
</P>
<P>
   The last real Democratic convention was in 1960. Although
Kennedy arrived in Los Angeles in very good shape, his nomination
was not a sure thing. The reason was Stevenson, who still commanded
considerable support even though he had done little to promote his
candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   On the first day of the convention, I attended a pro-Stevenson
luncheon at which Eleanor Roosevelt spoke, and I spoke at a
late-night rally.
</P>
<P>
   The next day the Minnesota delegation's leaders caucused on the
question of whom to support. Humphrey was undecided. Gov. Orville
Freeman, who would be making Kennedy's nominating speech, argued
for supporting him on the first ballot. I announced my support for
Stevenson.
</P>
<P>
   The next evening I placed Stevenson's name in nomination on the
floor. Only 79 of the 1,512 delegates voted for him. But the
demonstrations after my speech and the seconding speech were far
more intense and enthusiastic than those for the other nominees.
</P>
<P>
   Those who were strong for Adlai cheered, of course. Others
uttered purging cries of approval to make their change of loyalty
easier. And the rest cheered simply as a testimonial to the career
and example of Stevenson.
</P>
<P>
   That 1960 convention marked the end of the active political
career of Adlai Stevenson, the purest politician of our times. He
was indifferent to what history might say about him and, in 1956,
willing to be a sacrificial candidate for the common effort. He
became a national figure not because of the press, or even
primaries, but because of conventions.
</P>
<P>
   (Eugene J. McCarthy was a senator from Minnesota from 1959 to
1971.)

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Democratic National Convention has been
carefully scripted to help Vice President Al Gore declare his
independence from President Clinton. But one important moment will
wrap Gore more tightly than ever in Clinton's legacy: the passage
of the Democratic platform.
</P>
<P>
   Far from stamping a distinctive Gore imprint on the Democratic
Party, the document the delegates will approve on Tuesday warmly
embraces the centrist policies of the Clinton administration and
lavishly credits them for the prosperity of the last seven years.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1992, Bill Clinton and Al Gore were elected to turn the
American economy around,'' the platform declares in its opening
pages. ``Today, the success of these new ideas is clear.''
</P>
<P>
   From those opening lines through most of its 35,000 words, the
platform articulates a ``new Democrat'' agenda that cuts a middle
path between welfare-state liberalism and laissez-faire
Republicanism, advocating active but smaller government, fiscal
discipline, free trade and tough crime policies.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton first imposed those positions on the party in 1992 over
the objections of liberals, and Gore's aides fought back efforts _
albeit weak ones _ by progressives again this year to pull the 2000
platform leftward on health care, defense spending and trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both the rhetoric and the positions are where the party set
off in '92,'' said Thomas Mann, a senior fellow with the Brookings
Institution, a nonpartisan policy organization. ``Everything is
designed to say: `We are continuing with the policies and the
progress of the Clinton years, even though we are separating
ourselves from the man.'''
</P>
<P>
   But if the Democratic platform represents continuity, the
platform adopted by the Republicans in Philadelphia makes more of a
break, in tone if not always in substance, with Republican
platforms of the recent past.
</P>
<P>
   Much like Clinton in 1992, Gov. George W. Bush has tried to use
the 2000 platform to capture a broader swath of moderate swing
voters. While the platform remains fundamentally conservative,
strongly opposing abortion, gay rights and gun control while
calling for tax cuts, smaller government and more military
spending, the hard-edged proposals from 1996 are gone. The platform
would no longer deny citizenship for the American-born children of
illegal immigrants, abolish the federal department of education and
end federal financing of the arts. Instead it calls for more
inclusive attitudes toward immigrants, a strong federal role in
making schools more effective and the preservation of the biggest
of big government programs, Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   In their broad efforts to reach toward the center, the
Republican and Democratic platforms can sound strikingly similar at
times. Both call for holding schools more accountable for student
performance, stricter control of the nation's borders, expanding
global trade, strengthening the military and maintaining the death
penalty.
</P>
<P>
   But in the details, the two platforms sharply diverge on most
issues, providing clear indications of how Gore and Bush
administrations would differ.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Democrats offer modest, targeted tax cuts to help
middle-class families, while the Republicans call for an
across-the-board income-tax cut to stimulate the economy.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Democrats call for increased funds for public schools,
while the Republicans support taxpayer-financed vouchers to help
parents pay for private schools.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Democrats would keep the Social Security system as it is,
bolstering it with general tax revenues. The Republicans call for
allowing taxpayers to invest part of their payroll taxes in the
financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Democrats propose extending Medicaid, the government
health care program for low-income people, to more children, while
the Republicans advocate tax breaks to help people buy private
health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Democrats call for developing the technology for a limited
system to protect the nation from ballistic missile attacks, while
the Republicans support moving full-speed ahead with an ambitious,
space-based system.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Democrats endorse civil rights protections for homosexuals
and support laws intended to expand the rights of unions to
organize workers. The Republicans oppose gay rights and support
laws intended to reduce the ability of unions to organize.
</P>
<P>
   For all those clear disagreements, the platforms are alike in
that they closely reflect the styles, broad visions and campaign
agendas of the two candidates. Writing a platform usually tests a
candidate's ability to manage the factions within his party, and
both Bush and Gore successfully enforced a high degree of unity on
their platform committees.
</P>
<P>
   (In contrast, Bob Dole claimed in 1996 that he had not bothered
to read the Republican platform, presumably because its staunchly
conservative tone clashed with his attempts to present a moderate
face.)
</P>
<P>
   But for both candidates, tamping down open dissent from their
parties' most militant wings meant accepting language that
sometimes went beyond their own positions.
</P>
<P>
   For Gore, the major fight was over trade. Over the objections of
labor unions, the platform endorses the policy of ``fast track,''
which would allow presidents to negotiate certain treaties without
congressional approval. But at the behest of unions, the platform
also calls for negotiating labor and environmental standards into
all trade accords.
</P>
<P>
   For Bush, adopting softer positions on issues like education and
immigration meant accepting language flatly opposing abortion in
all situations, even though he would personally allow it in cases
or rape, incest or danger to the life of the woman.
</P>
<P>
   Tonally, both platforms also reflect the stump styles of the two
candidates. The Republican platform is heavily salted with the kind
of optimistic, inclusive-sounding phrases that flavor Bush's
speeches.
</P>
<P>
   ``We approach these challenges with compassionate conservatism,
a concept that is as old as the pioneers heading West in wagon
trains, in which everyone had responsibility to follow the rules,
but no one would be left behind,'' the platform says.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic document mirrors Gore's knife-edged efforts to
cast Bush as a risk to the nation's peace and prosperity. Thus, the
platform asserts, the Republicans ``eschew fiscal discipline and
offer up nothing less than fiscal disaster.'' Bush's Social
Security plan would ``take the `security' out of Social Security.''
And the Republican proposal for a space-based missile defense
system ``would plunge us into a new arms race.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet even as it attacks the Republicans, the Democratic platform
manages to echo the Republicans' words. ``If America is to secure
prosperity, peace and security for all, we cannot afford to go
back,'' it says. ``We must move forward together and we must not
leave anyone behind.''

 &HT;    PROTESTERS PREPARE AS CONVENTION APPROACHES
 &HT;    770&AMP;add.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ On the eve of the Democratic National Convention,
activists gathered at their MacArthur Park headquarters _ nicknamed
the Convergence Center _ for lessons on to cope with tear gas and
pepper spray and how to behave when confronted by police.
</P>
<P>
   Their printed schedule for the week includes marches to protest
police brutality and sweatshop conditions, as well as a beach party
to protest what's essentially another beach party.
</P>
<P>
   There's a legal team, on-site medical services and a makeshift
kitchen to feed hungry volunteers. There's even a ``Bike Library''
where people can borrow _ what else? _ bikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are firmly committed to non-violence,'' Brian Montes said
Sunday morning, clutching a 24-page booklet entitled ``Direct
Action at the DNC.'' ``Direct action means music and dance and
poetry, and other creative actions to get our ideas out.''
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, some 2,000 activists launched the first major
protest of the convention, gathering at a downtown square to speak
out against the death penalty and police brutality and in support
of Mumia Abu-Jamal, on death row for killing a Philadelphia police
officer.
</P>
<P>
   At Pershing Square, some activists distributed leaflets for
protests scheduled later in the week while others waved picket
signs opposing the death penalty. One sign read, ``Not one more
lynching'' and was emblazoned with a picture of Abu-Jamal, who was
convicted of killing an officer in 1981. Supporters contend he was
framed by racist police.
</P>
<P>
   By supporting the death penalty, Al Gore and George W. Bush have
continued to ``march the retarded, the young and quite possibly the
innocent to their deaths,'' actor and activist Ed Asner told the
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Convergence Center, a former swap meet building, is Ground Zero
for the latest round in what has been the real Y2K surprise: The
re-emergence and refinement of street demonstrations during major
political and governmental gatherings. Starting with the frequently
violent protests in Seattle during the World Trade Organization
meetings and continuing through the two major parties' conventions
this summer, plenty of people have turned out to challenge the
notion that these are the best of times.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Clinton-Gore administration has been selling out the
environment as much as the Bush administration before them,'' said
Andy Paik, 35, who'd come down from Seattle to stay in the
apartment of someone he'd met at a World Bank protest in Washington
and was pinning letters on a large felt banner protesting the
cutting of ancient forests.
</P>
<P>
   Directly behind Paik, large puppets depicting everyone from
vice-president Al Gore to the ``Indonesian Military'' were propped
against a wall. Outside, a police helicopter circled noisily over
MacArthur Park, where some 30 activists practiced waving their
puppets or banners (``Books in the `Hood'' read one) for an
upcoming rally.
</P>
<P>
   Planning for the Convergence Center began several months ago as
a way to organize disparate groups of activists during the
convention and advise them on everything from non-violent protest
tactics to whom to call in cases of arrest or how to support
suspected police misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   A poster inside the center lists the umbrella group's
``demands'' of the U.S. government (amnesty for undocumented
immigrants, an end to ``the racist death penalty,'' etc.), while
the booklet includes a set of participant guidelines (no violence,
weapons or drugs) and a schedule of events (like Sunday night's
beach party outside the Democrats' high-priced fund-raiser on Santa
Monica Pier.)
</P>
<P>
   Yet as the helicopter and handful of police at the nearby subway
stop attest, the center has also become a focus of authorities
hoping to stem trouble before it starts outside the convention. On
Friday, all the protesters won a victory when a federal judge
issued a temporary restraining order preventing police from seizing
materials that protesters use to characterize politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Like puppets. Goofy as it may seem, police raided a so-called
``puppet factory'' in Philadelphia during the Republican
Convention. Here, the tension level is high enough that puppets and
caches of paint have been stashed around the city, one organizer
said Sunday in MacArthur Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``So if our space gets raided,'' said David Solmit, a
36-year-old carpenter who says he'll be doing ``puppet first aid''
during marches and rallies, ``we still have puppets.''
</P>
<P>
   Why puppets, you ask? For poetic reasons _ ``It's much more
clear what we're doing when you SEE Al Gore represented as a
corporate puppet,'' Montes explained _ and for pragmatic ones. TV
loves filming protesters waving big, colorful puppets, several
organizers said.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, with many of the 15,000 accredited media having arrived
here this past weekend, well in advance of Monday's convention
kickoff, the feel downtown has been of a party waiting to happen.
Close to the Staples Center, the convention site, an Italian
restaurant got lots of attention for a blackboard of specials that
included convention T-shirts and buttons served along with one's
plate of spaghetti or lasagna. Meanwhile, Los Angeles newspaper
reporters took to interviewing out-of-town reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Things didn't get much better at Saturday night's official media
party, held at L.A.'s Department of Water and Power Plaza (at a
cost of $1.5 million), and which seemed to feature as many
delegates and other convention types as anyone. If the best-known
faces were onstage, where Patti LaBelle performed, it may have been
because the Los Angeles Times was having its own party for media
bigwigs and stars who have played journalists in movies or on TV
(Albert Brooks of ``Broadcast News,'' for example).
</P>
<P>
   But that's nothing. Sunday night's big party was to be thrown by
the cast of television's ``The West Wing.'' How exclusive was it?
Even the National Journal, which finds out everything going on here
for its ``Convention Daily'' newspaper, couldn't find out what time
it was supposed to start.

<P>
   DEM-DELEGATES (Undated) _ A poll of Democratic delegates: who
they are and what they believe. How they compare with Republican
delegates, who were polled before the Republican National
Convention. By Adam Clymer and Michael R. Kagay.
</P>
<P>
   DEM-PLATFORM (Los Angeles) _ Far from stamping a distinctive
Gore imprint on the Democratic Party, the platform the delegates
will approve on Tuesday warmly embraces the centrist policies of
the Clinton administration and lavishly credits them for the
prosperity of the last seven years. By James Dao.
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-PUTIN (Moscow) _ Since becoming president of Russia,
Vladimir Putin has capitalized on a voter mandate and high poll
ratings to begin putting Russia back in order after a decade of
wild economic and political swings. But along the way, he is
breaking a lot of china, indulging some of the anti-democratic
instincts, his critics say, that came with his KGB training. By
Patrick E. Tyler.
</P>
<P>
   AFRICA-AIDS-TEACHERS (Bazra-Nattis, Ivory Coast) _ Six teachers
a week in this nation of 15 million people die of AIDS, a 1998
government study found, and officials believe the number has only
gone up since then. The elite status afforded by their education
makes teachers, nearly all of them men, particularly susceptible
when, young and single, they enter remote villages for their first
teaching jobs: young village women compete for their attention. The
result is multiple sexual relationships, made riskier because the
men are unlikely to use condoms. By Norimitsu Onishi.
</P>
<P>
   WELFARELESS-COUNTY (Rushville, Ill.) _ Welfare has completely
disappeared from Schuyler County, Ill. For more than a year, there
have been no new cases, no old cases, no one on the rolls. This
results not just from a strong economy, but also from hard work by
local welfare officials, who give lots of personal attention to
each case _ and have many lessons to teach the rest of the country.
By Robert Pear.
</P>
<P>
   MIDEAST-TALKS (Washington) _ U.S. officials are talking about
the possibility of reviving the Palestinian-Israeli talks, saying
the time is short, that Egypt appears ready to be helpful and that
they see some signs of willingness on both sides. By Jane Perlez.
</P>
<P>
   TIRE-RECALL (Detroit) _ The Ford Motor Co. released documents
Sunday showing that Bridgestone/Firestone Inc. had begun receiving
by 1997 numerous complaints of injuries and property damage
involving certain Firestone tires that were not recalled until last
Wednesday. By Keith Bradsher.

coverage you see this week will probably be the last time you'll
ever see anything like the oldtime convention coverage on a
broadcast network. By Peter Marks.
</P>
<P>
   DEM-SCRIPT (Los Angeles) _ A look at the way the Democrats plan
to control the message. From the sea of see-through IMAC computers
on the convention floor to a center-stage program of prominent
officials engaged in issue ``dialogues'' with ordinary people, the
Democratic National Convention is intended to be, in look and feel,
a brainier and meatier antidote to the Republicans' feel-good
Philadelphia spectacle. By Peter Marks.
</P>
<P>
   DEM-PLATFORM (Los Angeles) _ Far from stamping a distinctive
Gore imprint on the Democratic Party, the platform the delegates

   DEM-WIRED (Los Angeles) _ Picture the scene on the convention
floor in Los Angeles. There are Democratic delegates galore with
banners and balloons, funny hats and confetti. And, of course,
computers. And Palm Pilots, digital cameras, wireless beepers and
all sorts of other high-tech gadgets to showcase the party's
technological prowess and burnish its party-of-the-future image.
``We've basically wired the entire city of Los Angeles,'' said Naz
Nageer, director of technology for the Democratic National
Convention Committee. By Leslie Wayne.
</P>
<P>
   DEM-PLAYBOY (Los Angeles) _ By most measures, Hugh Hefner and
his daughter, Christie, are hardly the largest donors to the
Democratic Party. But, this week, as a controversy swirled around
the use of the Playboy Mansion for a Hispanic fund-raiser, they
became, for a moment, among the most visible. By Leslie Wayne.

   REFORM-PARTY (Long Beach, Calif.) As the presidential nominees
of the two Reform Parties left Splitsville this week to campaign
across the rest of the country by bus, their associates began
plotting legal strategies to seize the $12.6 million in federal
campaign money that is awaiting the real party's true nominee _ as
soon as a court decides what and who they are. By Michael Janofsky.

Richard Riordan. By Ken Foskett.

Foskett.

the Democratic National Convention showed up Sunday, but don't look
for the man who may be atop the Democratic state ticket in 2002.
Laredo oilman Tony Sanchez, emerging as a potential gubernatorial
contender, can't be here. He is supporting Republican Gov. George
W. Bush for president.

Kranish and Anne E. Kornblut.
</P>
<P>
   DEMS-CLINTON (Los Angeles) _ The story of Al Gore's struggle for
power _ the task that has trailed him from his battle with former
Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey a year ago to his triumph in the
caucuses and primaries of winter and spring all the way to now, the
morning before the Democratic National Convention opens here _ is
his effort to untangle his destiny from that of Bill Clinton. By
David M. Shribman.
</P>
<P>
   DEMS-DELEGATES (Los Angeles) _ Despite apparent willingness
among delegates to go along for the good of the party, disputes are
simmering just below the surface. By Michael Kranish.
</P>
<P>
   DEMS-HILLARY (New York) _ It's not just a fond look back at Bill
Clinton's eight years as president. At least as crucial, it's a

 &HT;    Lottery foes bucking odds in S. Carolina
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ South Carolina has been rid of video poker since July,
and several groups are trying to make sure a state lottery doesn't
take its place.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Democrat Jim Hodges won the governorship largely
on a promise to support a Georgia-style lottery for education.
Voters in November will decide whether to make that lottery a
reality. Polls have shown lottery support running about 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   This week, anti-lottery groups will crank up their side of the
argument.
</P>
<P>
   Hodges' lottery organization opened shop Aug. 1 when members of
his Pro-Education Lottery Coalition met in Columbia. Proponents
estimate a state lottery could raise $150 million annually for
education. South Carolina residents spend an estimated $110 million
a year in Georgia's lottery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Republicans, if they can defeat it, can label it as a failure
of Jim Hodges' administration,'' said College of Charleston
political science professor Bill Moore.
</P>
<P>
   Starting Tuesday in Charleston, the Bipartisan Lottery
Opposition Committee (BLOC) will open a series of six statewide
meetings designed to focus on lottery problems. Opponents are
facing an uphill battle. Polling during the last 11 years has shown
South Carolina lottery support ranging between 65 percent and 74
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not surprised by that,'' said South Carolina Secretary of
State Jim Miles, co-chairman of BLOC. ``Most people feel that since
we have a bad education system that all of a sudden we'll have a
great education system if we have a lottery. I'm not so sure. The
facts will show there's a big cost to get the lottery.''
</P>
<P>
   Miles' group will focus on pathological gamblers, economic
impacts and alternative funding for education.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, state lawmakers had planned for voters also to
decide whether to keep a controversial video poker industry that
annually took an estimated $2.8 billion in bets.
</P>
<P>
   But the state Supreme Court ruled that proposed vote was
unconstitutional, triggering legislation that killed video gaming
July 1.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves the state's gambling debate focused on a lottery
modeled after Georgia's games, which gross about $2 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   The lottery will be South Carolina's top statewide election
issue. Neither U.S. Senate seat is up, the next governor's race is
in 2002, and Republican George W. Bush is far outpolling Democrat
Al Gore in the presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Lottery detractors are buoyed by last year's vote in Alabama,
where voters for years had told pollsters they would support a
state-sponsored game.
</P>
<P>
   But after an aggressive television campaign by anti-lottery
forces that portrayed the games as immoral and potentially corrupt,
Alabama voters overwhelmingly rejected the proposal, which had put
Democrat Don Siegelman in the Governor's Mansion.
</P>
<P>
   Before Labor Day, South Carolina lottery opponents expect to run
ads negatively depicting the games.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina churches that mobilized to defeat video poker now
are ready to tackle the lottery.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of that organization is still in place,'' said Joe Mack,
director of Christian Life Concerns for the South Carolina Baptist
Convention.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Geddings, Hodges' former campaign manager and one-time
chief of staff, has been the primary spokesman for the lottery. One
challenge, he said, is to demonstrate to churches that it is ``not
inconsistent to be a practicing Christian and still support a
lottery.''
</P>
<P>
   In Alabama, churches played a key role in defeating the lottery
referendum.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the South Carolina Baptist Convention have
consulted with their Alabama counterparts to learn how they
orchestrated their successful anti-lottery campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly one of every five people in South Carolina belong to the
Southern Baptist Convention. The United Methodist Church, as it did
in Alabama, also is working to defeat the lottery.
</P>
<P>
   Mack said lotteries disproportionately drain money from
low-income players. ``This is not some benign PTA raffle that
happens once a month. It's much more aggressive than that.''

A COUNTY WITHOUT WELFARE KEEPS ITS WELFARE WORKERS BUSY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill.)   By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RUSHVILLE, Ill. _ Holly E. Cain, manager of the local welfare
office, used to post job openings for welfare recipients just
inside the front door of her agency here. But she nearly put
herself out of business. Welfare disappeared from this county. For
more than a year, there have been no new cases, no old cases, no
one on the rolls receiving cash assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Cain still clips and posts help-wanted advertisements from local
merchants, schools and hospitals. But the notices are no longer
intended for welfare recipients. All sorts of people stop by to
check what jobs might be available.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's new,'' said Cain, who has run the four-person Schuyler
County office of the Illinois Department of Human Services for 20
years. ``It's a very positive change.''
</P>
<P>
   Schuyler, on the prairie west of Springfield, Ill., was the
first county in the state and one of the first in the nation to be
``welfare-free.'' As other counties have approached that status,
they have found that the last cases are among the most difficult.
</P>
<P>
   This county, with a population of about 7,500, illustrates in
microcosm some of the profound changes that have transformed much
of the nation's welfare system in the nearly four years since
President Clinton signed a landmark welfare law to put time limits
on aid.
</P>
<P>
   The elimination of cash assistance here resulted not just from a
strong economy, but also from hard work by local welfare officials,
who gave lots of personal attention to each case _ and who have
many lessons to teach the rest of the country. With practice, they
became adept at matching welfare recipients with jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually all the former welfare recipients in Schuyler County
have kept their jobs or moved on to higher-paying jobs, Cain said.
</P>
<P>
   But poverty has not disappeared here, and life is not easy for
the former welfare recipients, some of whom take home less than
$1,000 a month from their jobs. But they say they have more
self-confidence and self-esteem because they are earning paychecks
and not getting cash assistance any more.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was scary,'' said Karen J. DeMoss, 46, describing her
transition to work after 12 years on welfare. ``But I have more
confidence now. And I wish I had gotten off public aid a long time
ago.''
</P>
<P>
   DeMoss once held factory jobs, but in her years on welfare she
got into a rut. ``Your self-esteem gets really low,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Tears welled up as she recalled how she had to explain to her
two teen-age sons that the family was poor. That was three years
ago. Now, she said, the boys are proud of her because she caters
banquets and wedding receptions. ``They think it's nice their mom
can cook for 300 people,'' DeMoss said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Deanna D. Zeisler, 34, who now works in a restaurant
and does cleaning, said: ``I didn't feel good when I was on public
aid. I feel good about myself now. I'm working. It feels good to
have a paycheck in my name. It may be a tiny paycheck, but I earned
it. It wasn't just handed to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Life is still austere for Zeisler. ``I can't afford to go to the
movies,'' she said. She volunteers at the local theater, taking
tickets and selling popcorn, in return for the privilege of seeing
a film with her three sons.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The goals of the 1996 law and the intent of Congress are
thoroughly understood by Cain and her colleagues at the welfare
office here. Drawing on their experience and their contacts in the
community, they devised a strategy to carry out the law by matching
workers with jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't wave a magic wand,'' Cain said of her effort to
whittle down the welfare rolls. Her supervisor at the regional
office in Springfield, Gregory Matarelli, said ``it's not
happenstance'' that Schuyler County was the first to eliminate
welfare, though that was never an explicit goal.
</P>
<P>
   The welfare office here went about its work methodically and
systematically. Whenever a welfare recipient got a job, Cain or her
caseworkers would call the person every two or three weeks for five
months, to make sure the person kept the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``We pretty well know most of our clients, or their family
members,'' Cain said. (In 1995, the last year for which Census
Bureau estimates are available, Schuyler County had a median
household income of $27,370, about 80 percent of the comparable
figure for the nation as a whole.)
</P>
<P>
   Of the 102 counties in Illinois, four others _ Cumberland,
Hardin, Putnam and Washington _ had no welfare cases in July. A
total of 53 counties had fewer than 20 cases each.
</P>
<P>
   State officials pay close attention to those counties. They
receive a monthly report describing the circumstances of each
family on welfare in any county with fewer than 50 cases.
Supervisors like Matarelli want to know if the families are
working, and if not, why not. They discuss each case with local
welfare officials, suggesting techniques that have proved effective
in other counties.
</P>
<P>
   As the number of cases dwindled, Cain formed a ``5 o'clock
club'' for those who remained on welfare _ the cash assistance
program officially known as Temporary Assistance for Needy
Families. They met on Monday evenings to share their job-hunting
experiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``They gave support to one another,'' Cain said. ``They listened
to one another much more readily than they'd listen to me standing
up there saying the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   DeMoss said caseworkers prodded her to start looking for work.
``They made it sound like a positive thing, not like it was
doomsday and we'd be out on the street with nothing,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The number of families on welfare in Illinois has fallen below
100,000 this year for the first time in three decades. State
officials say 86,600 families are receiving cash assistance, down
from a peak of 247,800 in 1994. More than two-thirds of the cases
are in Cook County, which includes Chicago, but even in that county
the number of families receiving cash assistance has declined by 50
percent in the last three years.
</P>
<P>
   Illinois differed from many other states in one crucial respect.
It encouraged people to hold on to Medicaid and food stamps after
they took jobs and lost cash assistance.
</P>
<P>
   The number of people in Schuyler County receiving Medicaid or
food stamps rose to 418 in July of this year from 368 in July 1997,
even as the number of people on cash assistance dropped to zero.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   In many states, people were inadvertently dropped from Medicaid
when they lost cash assistance. But in Illinois, state and local
officials saw Medicaid as an indispensable form of assistance that
could help tens of thousands of welfare recipients take low-wage
jobs offering no health insurance benefits. Indeed, Matarelli and
Cain said they had audited the records of closed welfare cases to
make sure families were receiving the medical and food assistance
to which they were entitled.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Renee Baker, secretary of the Illinois Department of Human
Services, said, ``We are aggressive about letting families know
they may still be eligible for food stamps and Medicaid.'' In
addition, she said, the state increased spending on child care by
30 percent this year, to $648 million.
</P>
<P>
   The staff at the Schuyler County welfare office has not been
reduced, despite the absence of welfare recipients since April
1999. Cain said the four employees still had plenty of work to do,
arranging Medicaid, food stamps, child care, transportation and
other services for needy county residents, including former welfare
recipients. Matarelli said those services helped welfare recipients
``get some traction in the economic mainstream.''
</P>
<P>
   Cumberland County, in east central Illinois, had 143 welfare
cases in September 1994 and has not had any in eight of the last 12
months. Asked why the numbers were so low, Paul D. Marti Jr.,
manager of the local welfare office, said, ``It's a combination of
good case work, a good economy and good follow-up.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   If trends continue, Marti said, many more counties may become
welfare-free. ``That would mean that everyone has gotten work or
has been assisted in some way to get beyond welfare,'' he said.
But, he added, ``State officials discourage talk of that goal,''
for fear that caseworkers might improperly limit access to welfare
if they focused too much on caseload statistics rather than on
serving clients.
</P>
<P>
   Cain and Marti said the last cases were the most difficult
because these welfare recipients often had mental or physical
disabilities, alcohol or drug abuse problems, little work
experience, few job skills and limited education.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' Marti said, ``because the numbers are so low, you have
a lot more time to work with clients, and you can focus on them
quite a bit. They're the toughest cases, but they're also the most
gratifying when you're able to help them.''

CONVENTION SPEAKERS ON MONDAY 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Among the speakers on Monday evening's program:
</P>
<P>
   Sens. Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer of California
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Californians made history by pulling the lever for both
Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer. In her eight years in
Washington, Feinstein, a native Californian and the former mayor of
San Francisco, has quietly pushed for anti-crime legislation and
issues close to home. One of her biggest victories was attaching an
assault weapons ban to the crime bill passed by President Clinton
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer is a strong abortion rights advocate who has vigorously
fought the ban on partial birth abortion. Boxer is linked to the
Clinton White House by the marriage of Hillary Rodham Clinton's
brother, Tony Rodham, to her daughter, Nicole.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Barbara Mikulski of Maryland
</P>
<P>
   After organizing neighbors to protest the construction of a
16-lane highway through the historic Fells Point area of Baltimore,
Barbara Mikulski plunged into politics in the late 1960s. Then a
social worker, Mikulski went on to serve as City Councilwoman in
her hometown of Baltimore, before serving in the House from 1976 to
1986 and being elected to the Senate in 1986. She is also the
co-author of two mystery novels with a political twist. ``Capitol
Offense'' and ``Capitol Virtues'' sketch the life of a freshman
female senator from Pennsylvania who Mikulski has called a
``somewhat younger, somewhat slimmer, but no less politically
savvy'' version of herself.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Mary Landrieu of Louisiana
</P>
<P>
   Mary Landrieu was elected in 1996, and with Sen. John Breaux of
Louisiana, she forms the last of the all-Democratic Senate
delegations in the South. Landrieu grew up in New Orleans, the
oldest of nine children of Moon Landrieu, the mayor of the city in
the 1970s. In 1979, after graduating from Louisiana State
University, she became, at 23, the youngest woman ever elected to
the state Legislature. She was elected to the Senate in 1996, with
a moderate platform.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Blanche Lambert Lincoln of Arkansas
</P>
<P>
   Growing up on a rice farm in Helena, Ark., Blanche Lambert
Lincoln, 39, was elected to the Senate two years ago. After serving
two terms in the House, she took a two-year leave from public life
because she was about to give birth to twin boys. When she ran for
the Senate in 1998, she put their pictures on her campaign posters.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Debbie Stabenow of Michigan
</P>
<P>
   Elected to the House in 1996, Debbie Stabenow is involved in
what is shaping up to be one of the nation's most bitterly
contested Senate races. She is challenging Sen. Spencer Abraham by
highlighting her own legislative record that goes back to 1975,
when she became county commissioner by fighting a proposal that
would have shut down a local hospital that accepted Medicaid.

PLAYBOY'S FOUNDER HAS HISTORY OF GIVING TO LIBERALS 
</HEADLINE>
   By LESLIE WAYNE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   By most measures, Hugh Hefner and his daughter, Christie, are
hardly the largest donors to the Democratic Party. But this week,
as a controversy swirled around the use of the Playboy Mansion for
a Hispanic fund-raiser, they became for a moment among the most
visible.
</P>
<P>
   In the last decade, the Playboy Enterprises founder, Hugh
Hefner, and the company's chief executive, Christie Hefner, have
given about $95,000 to Democratic candidates and committees, with a
large portion of their donations going to female candidates and to
liberals _ and at least $8,000 going to the Clinton and Gore
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   What is striking about the Hefners' contributions is how
personal, consistent and targeted they are, reflecting mainly the
Hefners' socially liberal ideology.
</P>
<P>
   Their publishing empire, which had sales of $348 million last
year, has no political action committee, nor does it make the
large, unregulated soft-dollar donations that many corporations do
to gain political access in Washington. In fact, few Playboy
executives besides the Hefners give much money, and when they do,
it is not always to Democrats _ Libertarian candidates, too, have
received money from Playboy employees.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Hefners' brand of quiet and personal giving drew
attention when the the Democratic National Committee pressured Rep.
Loretta Sanchez of California to move a fund-raiser for Hispanic
candidates from the Playboy Mansion, fearing it would project the
wrong image for a party trying to distance itself from President
Clinton's personal scandals.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez, feisty, Hispanic and female, is exactly the kind of
candidate the Hefners support _ in principle and with dollars. Hugh
Hefner has given Sanchez $3,000, starting with a $1,000 donation
when Sanchez was the underdog in her tight and tough first race, in
which she unseated incumbent conservative Robert Dornan.
</P>
<P>
   As givers, the father and daughter are about equal _ Hugh Hefner
has given Democratic candidates around $43,000 since 1992 and
Christie Hefner has given them around $51,000.
</P>
<P>
   But what is most consistent is the pattern of their giving,
especially from Christie Hefner, whose Democratic donations have
largely gone to female candidates and committees. Christie Hefner
is a major donor to Emily's List ($11,500), which raises money for
female Democrats, and has also given to Voters for Choice/Friends
of Family Planning ($7,000), Woman Unite 2000 ($2,500) and PAC for
Change ($1,000).
</P>
<P>
   Female Democratic candidates for Congress who have received
contributions from Christie Hefner include Hillary Clinton, Patty
Murray, Susan Hynes, Dottie Lamm, Carol Moseley-Braun, Barbara
Boxer, Mary Boyle, Elaine Baxter, Lana Pollack, Lynn Yaekel, Dianne
Feinstein and Liz Holtzman. Male Democrats who have received
contributions from Christie Hefner include Charles Schumer, Bob
Kerrey, Paul Tsongas, John Dingell, Mark Udall, Charles Robb,
Harris Wofford and Terry Sanford.
</P>
<P>
   Hugh Hefner has a more mainstream approach to giving, primarily
making large contributions to leading Democratic Committees _
$20,000 in 1998 and $5,000 in 1996 to the Democratic Congressional
Campaign Committee, $5,000 this year and $5,000 in 1998 to the
Democratic National Committee, and $5,000 to Leadership 98, Vice
President Al Gore's leadership PAC, along with $1,000 to Gore 2000
in 1999.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Except for Sanchez, who received four-figure donations from Hugh
Hefner on three occasions, he has not given directly to candidates
other than Gore and Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   He has, however, allowed the Playboy Mansion to be used for
numerous political fund-raisers, for people including Harold
Washington, the late mayor of Chicago; Tom Bradley, former mayor of
Los Angeles; Jerry Brown, former governor of California; and
presidential aspirants John Anderson and Eugene McCarthy.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Harshbarger, president of Common Cause, a nonprofit
advocacy group, said the Hefners were an example of ideologically
motivated donors who were being ``tainted unfairly'' by the Sanchez
episode.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people who give do so because they believe in the cause
or they believe in the candidate,'' said Harshbarger, ``but they
get tainted in the same way as people who are giving for less noble
reasons of gaining access and influence. It's a corrupt system and
it taints everyone in it.''

 &HT;    STUDY: INTERNET POLITICS NOT READY FOR PRIME TIME
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Internet sites are scaling back their presence at
the Democratic National Convention amid charges, reflected in a new
Harvard-sponsored study, that their coverage is not ready for prime
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first online convention (held by the Republicans) failed
to live up to the hype that preceded it,'' Michael Cornfield, an
expert on the Internet and politics and a professor at George
Washington University in the nation's capital, said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet Alley effort in the GOP media tent yielded such
meager results among online viewers that Pseudo.com, a key player
in Philadelphia, withdrew completely from covering the Democratic
National Convention, which opens here Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The receding tide in the political dot-com world was also
evident in the sharp drop in hyperlinks. Eight of the 19 media Web
sites Cornfield studied offered a direct link to the Republicans.
In Los Angeles, only one such site, USAToday.com, linked to the
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Cornfield, who watched the entire GOP convention proceedings
solely online at the behest of the Shorenstein Center at Harvard's
John F. Kennedy School of Politics, said the poor results should
not be seen as surprising, ``because the convention was not an
exciting news event.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Moreover, he added, ``technical difficulties plagued
convention innovation, the online audience paid only modest
attention and the Republican Party made little effort to
incorporate the Internet in their media strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   PC Data Online, a firm that meters the choices of 120,000 home
Internet users across the country, found a 14 percent dip in online
traffic to the four most popular news sites during the convention
week when compared with the previous week.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of traffic, the top four are MSNBC.com, CNN.com,
NYTimes.com and WashingtonPost.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``The clear implication of (the) data is that there was a drop
in online news attention during the Republican convention.''
</P>
<P>
   Cornfield's findings were sharply criticized Sunday by Gerald
Levin, chief executive of Time Warner and a panelist on a
Shorenstein Center on ``The Impact of Information Technology on
American Democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost everything in that report is mistaken,'' Levin said,
noting that he had read an advance copy that had been sent to him
via e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in a very early stage in a new medium,'' he added. When
dedicated people want to provide 24-hour coverage even though
nothing is happening, we ought to regard that as a breakthrough.''
</P>
<P>
   Levin likened the Internet political experience to having
watched, ``as a youngster, the 1948 national political conventions,
the first ones to be televised.''
</P>
<P>
   Two networks, NBC and DuMont, covered both events, which were
held in Philadelphia, with one camera apiece, feeding their signal
by coaxial cable to several cities from Boston to Richmond, Va.
</P>
<P>
   This year, America Online, which plans to merge with Levin's
Time Warner, was one of two Web sites that bought skyboxes from the
Republicans. AOL's Philadelphia neighbor, pseudopolitics.com _
Pseudo.com's corporate child _ allowed visitors to choose their own
viewing angles from its 12 cameras.

MEDIA REV UP AS DEMOCRATS GET READY TO SHINE 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICK LYMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Maybe it was the sunshine and palm trees. Maybe it
was the prospect of celebrity-stuffed parties in the Hollywood
Hills. Or maybe there just seemed a bit more news to fuss over in
the lead-up to the Democratic National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the case, the truffle-hounds of the networks, cable
channels and World Wide Web sites appeared more invigorated Sunday
than they had two weeks ago on the eve of the Republican gathering
in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally, it's the Democrats' time to party,'' CNN's Bill Press
enthused.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, the vice presidential
nominee, made the same rounds of Sunday talk shows that his
Republican counterpart, Dick Cheney, had made two weeks ago. This
time, it seemed like a battle of the research departments, as each
program tried to dig up examples of how Lieberman had differed on
issues with Vice President Al Gore. School vouchers. Privatizing
Social Security. Bashing Hollywood. ``You've got a great research
team,'' Lieberman said to NBC's Tim Russert at one point.
</P>
<P>
   The Fox News lead-in to its interview said that Lieberman was
``making waves as the first Jewish vice presidential candidate''
and would be ``taking off the gloves.'' And as the senator answered
Tony Snow's questions, the words ``letting loose'' were emblazoned
on the screen below him.
</P>
<P>
   Really? This was letting loose? Maybe in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   The genial Lieberman answered pretty much the same questions in
pretty much the same way he had all day (although his answers did
get more detailed and focused as the day wore on, perhaps a tribute
to the Democrats' own research team).
</P>
<P>
   Several of the Web sites and Sunday news shows provided reports
from Saturday's night's celebrity bash in Brentwood, at which stars
like Shirley MacLaine, Cher, Melissa Etheridge and Paul Anka paid
tribute to Bill and Hillary Clinton. ``You ignite in others things
we have not resolved in ourselves,'' MacLaine was quoted as telling
the first couple in one report.
</P>
<P>
   No translation was provided.
</P>
<P>
   Writing for Inside.com, Michael Cieply said that by convention's
end, so many entertainers will have appeared that ``you might just
forget how dull politicians really are.''
</P>
<P>
   Several commentators made their lead-in to the convention a look
at recent movies and television series about politicians. On CBS,
the ``Sunday Morning'' television critic, John Leonard, played a
clip from TNT's ``Running Mates'' in which Tom Selleck, as a
presidential nominee who has just embraced campaign finance reform,
is serenaded at the convention podium with chants of ``America's
not for sale!''
</P>
<P>
   Cut back to Leonard: ``And I am the Shah of Iran,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It took Cokie Roberts of ABC's ``This Week'' to point out that
the Democratic convention was opening during a full moon, an
observation that caused her fellow commentators to erupt in
giggles. Sam Donaldson was still chuckling several minutes later.
``Cokie,'' he said, ``you're wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Journal, on its convention Web page, peered into
the world of limousine liberals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're expecting it to be like the Oscars, the Olympics, the
Super Bowl and the World Cup all rolled into one for a week,'' said
Jim Baron of Rely Transportation. However, many celebrities and
tycoons, he said, were opting for less conspicuous town cars,
fearing limousines might attract protesters. Indeed, A-List
Limousine was offering, for a slight extra charge, an armed guard
with each limousine.
</P>
<P>
   How many people will actually watch the Democratic convention on
television? Fox asked visitors to its Web site. As of Sunday
afternoon, 25.8 percent said they would watch, 65.7 percent saying
they would not and the rest weren't sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a scientific poll,'' cautioned Fox. No kidding.
But still, here was a group of people who had already taken the
trouble to log onto a political Web site and then to vote on this
question, and even they didn't intend to watch.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe if it were more like the fractious Reform Party
convention, which resulted last week in two presidential
candidates, the conservative pundit Pat Buchanan and a physicist,
John Hagelin, each claiming the true crown.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan appeared on ``Meet the Press'' Sunday and said that,
despite appearances, the party was really pretty united behind him,
considering. ``It's casting off the old shell and growing a new
one,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   We've had the New Deal, the New Frontier and the New Covenant,
so why not the New Shell?
</P>
<P>
   In a story on the Democratic Party's official campaign Web site,
the chairman of the Democrats' convention committee, Terry
MacAuliffe, went surfing and promised free lessons to all of the
15,000 media representatives covering the convention. The lessons
would be offered through the Paskowitz Surfing School of Santa
Monica whose owner, Izzy Paskowitz, said he could teach anyone,
even a journalist, to stand up on a surf board.

SYDNEY'S NEXT HURDLE: GET TRAINS IN SHAPE FOR OLYMPIC GAMES 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN SHAW   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ Ron Christie, the man with the job of making
the Olympic trains run on time, says there are ``no quick fixes''
for Sydney's rail network, which is plagued by problems as it
prepares to double its traffic during the Games, which start Sept.
15.
</P>
<P>
   But Premier Bob Carr, whose New South Wales state government is
organizing and underwriting the 2000 Olympics, hopes to quickly
improve the performance of the 800-mile, 300-station train system.
It is expected to have to handle 34 million passenger trips during
the Games, which run through Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   More than 400 trains carrying half a million people are
scheduled to run each day to and from the main venue, Olympic Park,
where 15 sports arenas are clustered around the main 110,000-seat
stadium seven miles from downtown. About 3,500 buses will also
carry Olympic spectators, most on highway lanes dedicated to Games
traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Christie, the city's coordinator-general for rail, said there
were ``contingency plans to minimize disruptions,'' but added, ``it
would be naive to suggest there will be no rail incidents during
the Games.''
</P>
<P>
   Five weeks from the start of the biggest Games in Olympic
history, Sydney's rail lines are wracked with delays, derailments,
errors and incompetence. Rookie drivers making mistakes, signal
failures, lagging maintenance, and divided management are being
blamed for the wave of accidents, equipment failures and shabby
service.
</P>
<P>
   There have been 30 derailments this year and 60 drivers
suspended from duty for errors, including 33 instances of driving
through red lights. The suburban accidents so far have been at low
speed, resulting only in minor injuries and damage.
</P>
<P>
   At peak times on some of the busiest routes, only 75 percent of
trains have been on time.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been tremendous rail problems,'' Carr said. ``I
don't defend the performance.'' He called the service
``inexcusable, lamentable, embarrassing, indefensible.''
</P>
<P>
   Inspectors from the International Olympic Committee, including a
committee vice president, Anita de Frantz of the United States, had
given Sydney high marks earlier for its overall preparations. They
appeared to approve rail plans on the basis of a new track and
station costing $100 million (U.S.) that was built to link Olympic
Park with the suburban network serving this sprawling city of four
million.
</P>
<P>
   Carr said he was confident of having solutions in time. ``We are
working to fix the problems,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm optimistic that we will be able to move people to and from
the Olympic venues,'' Carr told interviewers this week. ``Our
trains and buses successfully handled huge crowds at recent
football games, concerts and millennium events _ we delivered then
and we will again.''
</P>
<P>
   To try to get the system back on track in time for the Olympics,
Carr last month appointed Christie as the coordinator-general for
rail with wide powers, a blank check and an annual pay raise of
$50,000 (American) to $200,000. Impatient with his transport
minister and railway officials, Carr slashed red tape and cut legal
corners to give Christie complete rail responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Christie, a veteran railroad manager, has much to coordinate.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, Carr's government decided to divide rail
authority, believing administrative reforms would increase
efficiency. Services, maintenance and track were doled out to
separate departments. It proved to be the wrong way to run a
railroad.
</P>
<P>
   Christie has the urgent task of putting the system back on the
rails, getting such organizations as State Rail, City Rail, Rail
Services Australia, Rail Access Corp. and Department of Transport
to work together.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no quick fix to some of the reliability issues,'' he
said recently. He has a six-point plan to reduce accidents and run
on time _ and less than five weeks to make it work.

DODGERS SHOW SIGNS OF LIFE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's funny, in that bizarre kind of way, how the
emotion of a long baseball season can ebb and flow from a measly
nine innings.
</P>
<P>
   Despair on Sunday morning was replaced by hope again Sunday
evening. The Los Angeles Dodgers aren't fixed, but they still are
involved in a playoff race, regardless of what else is going on
internally.
</P>
<P>
   That was clear after they salvaged the finale of a three-game
series with Atlanta as right-hander Darren Dreifort won his
career-high sixth straight and Shawn Green homered and drove in
three in the Dodgers' 7-2 win at Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers ended their season series by beating the Braves
twice in nine games, and they lost the first two games of this
series. But the Dodgers pulled to within 4 games of San Francisco
in the National League West, thanks to the drubbing the Giants are
getting in New York. The Mets have won three straight from the
Giants.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed that for our mental state more than anything,''
Dodgers first baseman Eric Karros said. ``We lost six of seven, so
a win was important.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Sheffield hit his league-leading 37th homer in the seventh
inning, the second highest total in Los Angeles history. Mike
Piazza hit 40 in 1997. Todd Hundley also homered and leadoff man
Tom Goodwin made a diving catch, drove in two runs and reached base
three times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Goodwin had a good day, the offense geared up a little bit,
and that's our formula,'' Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said. ``You
look at (the scoreboard), but you're more concerned about playing
good ball, and we played a pretty good ballgame.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the All-Star break, Dreifort has been nearly perfect,
winning six straight starts to improve to 10-7. He's 6-0 with a
2.33 ERA after the break and hasn't allowed an earned run in three
of those starts.
</P>
<P>
   But Dreifort wasn't at his best against the Braves, though he
limited them to one unearned run and nine hits in five innings. The
lone run he allowed came after third baseman Adrian Beltre booted a
ball in the bottom of the first, but Dreifort also was aided by
some strong defense, including a pair of double plays.
</P>
<P>
   Chipper Jones' sharp grounder back to the mound turned into a
double play that ended a first-inning rally, and a line drive to
shortstop Alex Cora, who flipped to Beltre at third for a double
play, ended the Braves' fourth inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big defense,'' Dreifort said. ``We made clutch defensive plays
at clutch times and (Hundley) did a hell of a job back there mixing
pitches and mixing location. It was clutch hitting, clutch defense
and the bullpen comes in and gives you four quality innings.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Atlanta pitching coach Leo Mazzone, ``Dreifort had a
horseshoe up his (butt).''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers move on to open a three-game series at Florida
today, then return home for three games with the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   But rather than looking to make up all the ground immediately,
the feeling is to chip away and be in position come September when
the schedule should, in theory, favor the Dodgers. They play 19 of
their final 28 games at home. Their last 22 games are against the
National League West, including six against Arizona and three
against San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   It was only nine days ago the Dodgers could have pulled within
1games of first place had they beaten Milwaukee, but instead they
lost in 10 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be three games out with a month left is really not a big
deal,'' Dodgers second baseman Mark Grudzielanek said. ``That's
what we should look at. You try to look at the bright side. We're
not playing well, but before that we won 10 of 13. You have to try
and hover when you're not playing well, and right now we're playing
terrible. But we're still in contention.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet there's also Dodgers' home record. They're a solid 32-29 on
the road _ the only club in the division above .500 _ but they're
28-27 at home. The Dodgers also have a solid 17-12 mark within
their division.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can gain a game a week in the next three weeks, then
we're back in,'' said Green, who hit his 22nd homer in the ninth
inning. ``That's the way you have to look at it.''

 &HT;    L.A., WHERE THE UNUSUAL MEETS THE STRANGE
 &HT;    By TOM BAXTER
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ There wasn't much of an official nature going on
over the weekend at the Beverly Hills hotel where Georgia's
delegation is staying for the Democratic National Convention. But
the scene in the lobby reflected a little of the zany quality of
the larger event.
</P>
<P>
   As the Georgia delegates began to drift in, they found
themselves rubbing shoulders with the spiffily groomed Nation of
Islam security men who guard the Rev. Louis Farrakhan, who was in
town to promote his Million Family March.
</P>
<P>
   It was an amiable enough mingling, although Farrakhan's presence
in the same hotel where Jimmy Carter is staying did pose problems
for the former president's Secret Service detachment, which had
Carter's room moved to another floor (Farrakhan, reportedly, had
already booked the presidential suite).
</P>
<P>
   Different groups bump into each other in the hotel lobbies of
every major city, but this location guarantees as wide a range of
conceivable juxtapositions as any city you can think of.
</P>
<P>
   That makes this an exciting place for Democrats, who have been
buffeted by the progress of George W. Bush's campaign this summer,
to gather. It also presents a challenge for a party striving to
present a coherent message to the American people this week.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans held their convention in an orderly,
traditionally Democratic city, where the streets are compatible
with riot control tactics, and where nothing else threatened to
overshadow their presence.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats have pitched their tent in America's vast City of
Dreams, where one's importance is normally measured by last
weekend's box office returns, and small disturbances have been
known to metastasize into sprawling riots.
</P>
<P>
   Someone once defined the movie term ``high concept'' as an idea
so simple and direct it can be shouted across a parking lot, such
as ``Star-crossed lovers on a sinking ship.'' Vice President Al
Gore will fill in some of the dialogue in his acceptance speech
Thursday night, but the rest of the convention is supposed to be
devoted to presenting that high concept on which his candidacy
stands.
</P>
<P>
   How to be simple and direct, however, in a city where
message-crafting is a major industry?
</P>
<P>
   The expected campaign posters line the street near the Staples
Center, where the convention begins tonight. On closer inspection,
however, the candidate turns out to be Tom Selleck, and the poster,
really an ad for his new movie.
</P>
<P>
   One of the hottest party tickets was for Sunday night's party
thrown by the cast of the television show ``West Wing''_imaginary
politicians, in other words, standing on the hors d'oeuvres line
with politicians who sometimes act.
</P>
<P>
   A mural with the portraits of Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt,
Martin Luther King, Bobby Kennedy and Cesar Chavez rises
majestically on the side of the Figueroa Hotel overlooking the
center.
</P>
<P>
   Look again, however, and you notice this quintet of liberal
heroes is arranged around the logo of Apple Computers, with its new
slogan, ``Think Different.''
</P>
<P>
   To be as appealing as a star, and yet somehow come off as
genuine to average Americans; to give imagination free play,
without ignoring the hard realities of an election campaign in
which he lags behind_that's the challenge facing Gore and his party
here this week.

JOHNSON WILL FINISH SEASON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Wanting to put the focus on the Los Angeles Dodgers'
playoff race instead of the status of their manager, Dodgers
general manager Kevin Malone said Sunday no changes in the on-field
staff will take place during the season.
</P>
<P>
   Malone said evaluation of everyone, including manager Davey
Johnson and his staff, wouldn't take place until after the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``From ownership to management, we're not making any changes
(during the season),'' Malone said via telephone. ``We want to put
an end to wherever the speculation came from. This is the team
we're going with. It's a very talented team. We want Davey to
succeed. We want to make sure we stay focused.''
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers president and chief operating officer Bob Graziano
called Johnson after Sunday's game with the Atlanta Braves to tell
Johnson to stop wondering about his status because nothing was
going to happen during the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him he's our manager, he's going to be our manager
through this pennant race,'' Graziano said. ``He shouldn't worry
about anything but trying to win. There's nothing more that
(managing general partner and CEO) Bob Daly would like to see,
nothing more I would like to see, nothing more Kevin would like to
see than Davey having unquestionable success.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Johnson's job remains in jeopardy. If the Dodgers don't
make the playoffs, he'll likely be fired, sources continue to
state.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has come under heavy scrutiny since the Dodgers' front
office questioned his on-field strategy and philosophy last month.
But Malone said the front office has never said Johnson's job was
on the line.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Malone said all attention and effort belongs on how the
Dodgers play the rest of the season, especially since the playoffs
are within reach. Malone also said the Dodgers, who are 4 games
behind San Francisco in the National League West, had time to make
a run at the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is pulling away from it,'' Malone said. ``There is a
sense of urgency, but we're in a position to make a run and win
this thing. At the end of the season, everyone will be
re-evaluated. We can't say what's going to happen at the end of the
year. We'll evaluate everybody, like every organization does.
</P>
<P>
   ``There should be no concern for Davey or the coaching staff. We
want Davey to succeed. We think we can win with this group of
players. We think they're talented. It's a nonissue. We want this
team to succeed. (Johnson's status) has never been an issue with
ownership or management.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Elster's future: Dodgers shortstop Kevin Elster isn't playing
much these days, having started twice this month because of Alex
Cora's emergence. But Elster, 36, who didn't play last season, said
he's unsure whether this will be the last couple months of his
career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't know if I want to play,'' Elster said. ``It
depends on the situation. Next year, I'm not going to go to spring
training without a guaranteed contract. But I would certainly like
to play again.''
</P>
<P>
   Elster came to spring training as a nonroster player and won the
starting job from Cora. But Cora has garnered much of the playing
time for the last two months. Elster is batting .222 with 12 homers
and 29 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   A club source said Elster wouldn't be offered a guaranteed
contract with the Dodgers after the season.
</P>
<P>
   __ Support, please: Today against Florida, right-hander Kevin
Brown makes his 60th start since joining the Dodgers before the
1999 season. He's 28-13 but doesn't get much run support. The
Dodgers have been shut out in five of the games, scored one run
three times and scored two runs twice.

 &HT;    Woods overshadows PGA competition, unlovable course
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ Maybe the PGA of America should spot Tiger
Woods a three-stroke lead when he steps to the first tee in
Thursday's first round of the 82nd PGA Championship.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe Jim Awtrey, the PGA's chief executive operating
officer, should spend the week as Tiger's personal chauffeur.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the PGA brass owe the world's No. 1 player a huge
favor or two for deflecting some of the heat from a return this
week to controversial Valhalla Golf Club.
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake, if we didn't have the Woods machine rolling
into town with a chance for a third straight major and hogging most
of the attention, the PGA would be receiving even harsher flak _
from players and media _ for selecting Valhalla to host another
championship after millennium majors at super-venues Pebble Beach
and St. Andrews.
</P>
<P>
   Woods pumped new life into the PGA Championship last year at
storied Medinah, when he beat Sergio Garcia by a shot, to spend the
year as defending champion. And now, as the 2000 PGA commences,
Woods is again the dominant story, pushing the quality (or lack of
it) of the venue to secondary status.
</P>
<P>
   When Awtrey was in Atlanta last week to oversee the
one-year-to-go push for the 2001 PGA at the Atlanta Athletic Club,
he hardly ever mentioned Valhalla without putting Tiger in the same
sentence.
</P>
<P>
   It will be much the same for the next few days as Woods tries to
become the first player in 47 years to win three majors in the same
year. Ben Hogan was the last to accomplish it, in 1953, when he
missed qualifying for the PGA (everybody had to do so back then) to
compete in the British Open.
</P>
<P>
   With the Woods story in place, the PGA can focus on its more
positive things, such as:
</P>
<P>
   The strongest field in major championship history (since the
rankings were established) with 93 of the top 100 players
participating _ including the top 75. Even Jumbo Ozaki, who
normally needs a typhoon to be pushed out of Japan, is on the
property.
</P>
<P>
   The continuing story of Ernie (Avis) Els, who is trying not
become the first to player to finish second in all of the year's
four majors. He was second to Vijay Singh at the Masters and a very
distant runner-up to Woods at the U.S. Open and British Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because you feel like this is your last chance (at a major in
2000),'' Els said, ``you give it all you have.''
</P>
<P>
   It's unfortunate that the PGA has been so stubborn with
Valhalla, trying to force-feed a major venue on both players and
fans. In much of the 1990s the tournament usually has been a
stellar experience when the venues have been special. Clearly, the
PGA usually runs a quality event.
</P>
<P>
   The so-so years were at the questionable sites _ 1996 at
Valhalla, when Mark Brooks defeated Kenny
(I-don't-need-to-hit-any-range-balls) Perry in a sudden-death
playoff; and in 1998, when Singh won at Sahalee Country Club near
Seattle, a course so tight that drivers were often holstered.
</P>
<P>
   Everywhere else the PGA has visited recently, when famous venues
were utilized, the tournament has flourished.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the PGA usually has gotten what it's paid for.
</P>
<P>
   While still clearly the fourth ranked of the four majors, mostly
great stories unfolded in:
</P>
<P>
   1993, when Paul Azinger won a sudden-death playoff against Greg
Norman at Inverness.
</P>
<P>
   1994, when Nick Price won his second straight major, blitzing
the field at Southern Hills.
</P>
<P>
   1995, when Steve Elkington beat Colin Montgomerie in a
sudden-death playoff at Riviera.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, when Davis Love III took his first major under a
rainbow at Winged Foot, outplaying buddy Justin Leonard, then the
reigning British Open champion.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, when Woods held off the charging Garcia, Europe's most
dominant young player, in a Sunday duel at Medinah.
</P>
<P>
   All the indicators are there for low scoring at Valhalla _ not
just for Woods _ and that goes against the par-is-a-good-score
theme commanded by traditional major venues. Although Valhalla's
Bermuda rough is very thick from recent rain, the greens are also
receptive. A winning score in the 280 range seems likely at a
course where all the par-5s are reachable for the majority of the
players.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a better golf course now (than in 1996),'' Valhalla
superintendent Mark Wilson contends. ``People (want to) compare us
to Pebble Beach and Augusta. My line is this: We're in better shape
at 14 years old than they were.''
</P>
<P>
   BRIEFLY. . .
</P>
<P>
   Tom Lehman had arthroscopic knee surgery last Monday after being
forced to withdraw from the International, but is expected to play
in the PGA . . .Doug Tewell, the PGA Seniors champion, and club pro
Rick Hartmann withdrew from the field and were replaced by Skip
Kendall and Paul Stankowski. . .David Duval still expects to play
despite recent back problems. . .Mike Gill of Columbus is the
Georgia Section's representative in the tournament and one of 25
club pros participating.

DEMOCRATS AIM FOR ISSUE-ORIENTED, `ANTI-FLUFF' CONVENTION 
</HEADLINE>
   By PETER MARKS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ From the sea of see-through iMac computers on the
convention floor to a center-stage program of prominent officials
engaged in issue ``dialogues'' with ordinary people, the Democratic
National Convention that opens Monday is intended to be, in look
and feel, a brainier and meatier antidote to the Republicans'
feel-good Philadelphia spectacle.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats, meeting in the Staples Center through Thursday,
say that the Republicans were so consumed with banishing the
divisive demons of gatherings past that they missed the opportunity
to give American voters a comprehensive sense of what they stood
for in 2000 _ or of who their standard-bearer truly was.
</P>
<P>
   ``They spent a lot more time battling their 1996 convention than
they did battling the Democrats,'' said Joe Andrew, national
chairman of the Democratic National Committee. ``Ultimately what
people saw was the surface image. We are going to focus on issues,
because we know the issue landscape is home turf for us.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, viewers will not only be getting a refresher course
on the accomplishments of the Clinton-Gore administration: The
opening day is being devoted to discussions of the economy and the
needs of working families. But viewers will also hear enough talk
of weighty policy matters to fill a social-studies textbook. Health
care is to be a constant thread, introduced in several panel
discussions and reinforced in addresses by the week's major
speakers. The other big issues include education, retirement
security and fighting crime.
</P>
<P>
   Even the sleek computers, made by Apple and supplied to each
delegation on the floor, are intended subtly to reinforce the idea
of the Democrats as the party of the future, and Vice President Al
Gore as the candidate of innovation. (Computers were few and far
between on the floor of the First Union Center in Philadelphia.)
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a message in and of itself: `Think Different,''' Andrew
said, invoking the theme of the Apple computer advertising
campaign. ``We think outside the box.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats promise a convention less rehearsed than that of
their rivals. The party is not well known for sticking to the
script anyway, as demonstrated over the weekend by the tussle over
the plans by Rep. Loretta Sanchez of California to stage a benefit
at the Playboy Mansion, and by Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr.'s tepid
expression of support for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in other ways both symbolic and substantive, the Democrats
are taking pains to turn the Staples Center into a palace devoted
to the art of rebuttal.
</P>
<P>
   The physical layout of the hall itself is an answer to the
Republicans' goal of a four-day variety show: While the
Philadelphia rostrum was modeled on an Oscar telecast, complete
with wide steps leading directly to the stage, the Democrats have
installed a more traditional-looking podium, with a 12-foot
retractable wall between the speakers and the delegates.
</P>
<P>
   The approach to selling the message is different, too. In
Philadelphia, the Republicans came up with a slogan: ``Renewing
America's Purpose. Together,'' that was used as the gathering's
overarching theme. The Democrats, by contrast, chose not to adopt a
slogan, using instead the blandly generic ``America 2000'' as a
kind of campaign trademark. In fact, the party talks so much about
how it wants to differentiate itself from the Republican convention
that the motto could have been, ``Not the Republican National
Convention.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republican convention made no mistakes, but it wasn't
successful because it didn't leave people with anything,'' said
Sen. Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y. ``I think what we're trying to do
is focus on some issues, not abstract issues, that make people's
lives better. I think that is going to be our theme, and that
theirs was sort of all fluff.''
</P>
<P>
   To make this the convention of anti-fluff, the Democrats are
putting bright party lights like Schumer, as well as celebrities
like the actor Jimmy Smits, in major supporting roles at the
convention. They will be moderators of talk-show-style panels early
each day in the proceedings, which are to be gaveled to order at 5
p.m. ET, to accommodate prime time on the East Coast. The panels,
called ``American Dialogues,'' will feature ordinary Americans
talking about the issues that affect their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer's panel, on Wednesday, will examine crime and victims'
rights, and among his ``guests'' will be the parents of Matthew
Shepard, the young gay man murdered in Wyoming in October 1998.
``The challenge of our convention is going to be to stick to the
message,'' the senator said. ``If it doesn't seem meaty in
comparison, we've sure flunked.''
</P>
<P>
   The message discipline may not reach the levels it did at the
Republican convention, where copies of media talking points nine
pages long were placed daily on the seats of every delegate. In Los
Angeles, the emphasis will be on a reiteration of Gore's positions
on issues that have tested well: Across the board, for instance,
candidates, officials and Gore surrogates will be talking about the
vice president's advocacy of adding a prescription drug plan to
Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats actually may find obstacles to the delivery of
their message on television from a surprising source: their own
speakers. Addresses on the initial nights by President Clinton,
Hillary Rodham Clinton and Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman could be major
media events unto themselves, and thus could distract attention
from Gore in a way that Gov. George W. Bush largely did not have to
deal with in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Burstein, executive producer of special events for ABC
News, said that those speakers had the potential to be riveting.
``The fact that you're going to have the president and the first
lady speaking, in light of his comments the other day, it's
certainly going to be compelling television,'' he said, referring
to Clinton's talk in Illinois on Thursday about his adulterous
affair. Gail Evans, executive vice president of CNN, added that
Lieberman's nomination as the first Jew on a national ticket is
great talk-show fodder.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's wonderful for discussion because everyone's got an
opinion about it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Democratic officials believe they have developed a
strategy that ensures that they get their message out even if the
national press and the political pundits are not cooperative. They
say they have committed vast resources to the creation of their own
Democratic News Service. It will deliver news feeds via satellite
to more than 500 local television stations around the country, as
well as provide sound bites for radio and content for Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew, for one, is convinced that this dimension of the
convention may be the most important. ``Our money is being spent
more on that than on the show,'' he said. And as for those Imacs,
Andrew said they were part of that mission too.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason we have computers on the floor is not so the podium
can communicate with the delegates,'' he added, ``it's for us to be
able to track the officials in each delegation so we can send the
message back home, `Here's what's happening in your Indiana
delegation.'''

RUSSIANS WONDER IF PUTIN CAN CREATE DISCIPLINE WITHOUT SACRIFICING
FREEDOM 
</HEADLINE>
   By PATRICK E. TYLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Earlier this summer, the newly elected Russian
president, Vladimir Putin, flew to Tatarstan to take part in the
spring planting festival known as Sabantui. There he donned a Tatar
hat, stuck his face in a vat of yogurt to bob for coins and then
engaged a Tatar girl in arm wrestling.
</P>
<P>
   What happened next simply astounded Alexander B. Asmolov, a
leading psychologist at Moscow State University, who watched on
television as Putin, a black belt in judo, did not hesitate or
politely feign a struggle, but simply slammed her arm to the table
in a single overpowering motion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked at that and said, `This man has a ton of ambition, a
mountain _ no, a cosmos _ of ambition,''' observed Asmolov.
</P>
<P>
   From his office across from the Kremlin, the professor has
written letters to the new president counseling him to rule with
more tolerance and noted: ``We have a fighter who has come to power
and whose nature is not to play, but to win. He not only is
motivated to succeed, he is maniacally motivated to succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   The only thing many Russians do not yet fully understand is:
Succeed at what?
</P>
<P>
   In almost five months since he was elected, Putin has
capitalized on a voter mandate, high opinion poll ratings and an
economy buoyed by strong oil prices to begin putting Russia back in
order after a decade of wild economic and political swings under
Boris Yeltsin, the country's first democratically elected
president.
</P>
<P>
   In the course of a summer, Putin, who will be 48 in October, has
laid out an economic program that has won praise from Western
governments and pushed a new tax code through a cooperative
parliament.
</P>
<P>
   He has begun a major reorganization of the country's unruly
regions, dividing the country into seven large new administrative
areas and installing his own men over them. He has humbled its
autocratic governors by siphoning off their power and their tax
revenues to the federal authorities and begun the process of
separating a class of super-rich oligarchs from their influence
over the Russian government.
</P>
<P>
   Next, it seems, is the military. After firing six senior
generals at the beginning of the month, Putin closeted himself for
four hours on Friday evening with his national security council _
men who would usually be on vacation this time of year _ to decide
what may be the most significant restructuring of the Russian
military in two decades.
</P>
<P>
   Putin may be proving himself more adept at using the enormous
powers of his office to consolidate central control than his often
ailing predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   But the question that seizes many Russians and Westerners alike
is whether Russia's weak democratic institutions _ a nascent
business class, free press and an ever-changing assortment of
political parties and organizations _ are strong enough to resist
the undemocratic, authoritarian streak that critics ascribe to the
former KGB official who is now president.
</P>
<P>
   Can he meld freedom and discipline into a new state structure
for Russia _ an almost ungovernable land of 11 time zones and
diverse ethnic populations _ that avoids a slide toward the Soviet
past?
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Gelman, a writer who now works with the former Soviet
President, Mikhail Gorbachev, on building a social democratic party
in Russia, said in an interview that Putin had made mistakes, but
was correctly seeking the proper balance between freedom and order,
a traditional feature of politics in a country where power has long
proven indivisible.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very important to link freedom with discipline in this
country,'' Gelman said. ``Russia is made in such a way that it
either had a very strict discipline or it was anarchy. The most
difficult task was always to combine these two things, so that
freedom does not interfere with discipline and discipline does not
interfere with freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   But others see freedom already being compromised.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new team of our new president is energetically crushing
freedom and democracy,'' said Sergei Kovalyov, the human rights
campaigner and longtime protege of the Nobel laureate Andrei
Sakharov. ``Putin is building a country that is neither a
democratic nor federal state. He is building, in fact, a unitary
state based on force and trying hard to create the good old Soviet
idea: unbroken vertical power from top to bottom.''
</P>
<P>
   Kovalyov's critical assessment, which is shared by a number of
Russian intellectuals, including many former dissidents who
suffered at the hands of the KGB, carries great weight inside and
outside Russia.
</P>
<P>
   But it has not dented Putin's high popularity ratings at home,
where many other Russian intellectuals, younger reformers and
liberal members of the old Soviet establishment support him.
</P>
<P>
   Last Thursday, Gorbachev, the last leader to rule over a unified
Russia within an even larger Soviet Union, and a rare visitor to
the Kremlin during Yeltsin's rule, emerged from a two-hour meeting
with Putin and pronounced that his youthful successor was on the
right path.
</P>
<P>
   ``I support Putin's efforts to strengthen order and
responsibility,'' Gorbachev said, warning that ``regionalism is
threatening to lead to the country's disintegration.''
</P>
<P>
   More discipline lies ahead, Putin's advisers say. He is
preparing legislation to reform the country's chaotic system of
customs laws and their corrupt administration and, in the fall, a
major overhaul of Russia's legal system: courts, prosecutors and
law enforcement agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Next month, around the anniversaries of the terrorist blasts
that killed nearly 300 Russians in apartment blocks in Moscow and
other cities last year, Putin is expected to dedicate a new
memorial to the victims. Aides say he will ask Russians to stay the
course in the ``anti-terrorist campaign'' in Chechnya that has
killed thousands, displaced 270,000 people and left much of the
rebellious region in ruins.
</P>
<P>
   Internationally, especially in Europe, Putin's rise was viewed
with skepticism and alarm as Russian tanks flattened Grozny, the
Chechen capital, last winter. But the new president took an
unexpectedly activist role in fanning European opposition to U.S.
plans for a national missile defense system that would not cover
Europe and could ignite a new arms race in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   To the leaders of the largest industrial nations, he presented
the face of an earnest problem solver, visiting North Korea and
pressing its leader, Kim Jong Il to abandon his long-range missile
program.
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Lukin, former Russian ambassador in Washington and now
a deputy speaker of parliament from the liberal party Yabloko, said
that because Russia today has only a weak hand to play as a world
power, Putin is seeking a constructive role to complement his
reform efforts at home. That, Lukin said, will require a Western
orientation, though not necessarily close relations with the
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he added, ``Putin and his staff understand that whether
Russia finds its place in the international division of labor
depends mostly on our relations with Europe and the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   At home, freedom has taken a few jolts that rattled even Putin's
most ardent supporters, most notably the storming of the
headquarters of Media-Most, the conglomerate that owns the NTV
television network, a frequent critic of Putin.
</P>
<P>
   After seizing documents, prosecutors ordered the arrest of
Media-Most's chairman, Vladimir Gusinsky, held him for four days
and charged him with financial crimes related to assembling his
media empire.
</P>
<P>
   The charges were dropped, but only after Gusinsky was summoned
for a private meeting at the Kremlin with Putin's chief of staff,
Alexander Voloshin. The contents of that conversation have yet to
be made public.
</P>
<P>
   Since the meeting, the government-controlled natural gas
monopoly, Gazprom, has been putting pressure on Gusinsky to sell a
controlling stake in his media empire by threatening to call in the
loans that the gas giant extended him in the salad days of 1995-96,
when oligarchs like Gusinsky were helping Yeltsin win re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Yevgeny Kiselev, the general director of NTV and anchorman of
its popular news program Itogi, told an interviewer last week that
Gusinsky would surrender control of his media properties only ``at
gunpoint.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I worked for the government-owned media for years, like many
of my colleagues,'' Kiselev said, ``and I don't believe any wishful
talk that government-owned media in Russia can be independent.''
</P>
<P>
   It may take months before the fate of Gusinsky's empire is
settled, but many Russians already view the case as the most
profound test of press freedom.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very serious mistake,'' said Irina Khakamada, referring
to the government assault on Gusinsky.
</P>
<P>
   A deputy speaker of parliament and leader of the pro-market
Union of Right Forces party, Khakamada supports Putin, especially
for his commitment to economic reform. But her optimism is leavened
with reservations about what she calls Putin's ``enlightened
authoritarianism.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think his personal dream is to demonstrate that a liberal
and enlightened market economy with the help of civil institutions
can be successfully combined with more strict and rigid authority
in the system of power,'' she said. ``The idea is not to strengthen
his own personal power, but to strengthen Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   Many influential Russians remain more skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   As the sirens wailed last week around Pushkin Square, where a
bomb shattered the evening calm with an explosion that so far has
killed 11 people and left more than 50 with serious or critical
injuries, a group of prominent intellectuals and businessmen was
issuing an ``appeal to society'' for a new political movement to
counter any drift toward authoritarianism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russian democracy is young and too dependent on the recent
totalitarian past,'' the appeal said. The Putin government reflex,
of seizing power from oligarchs and regional governors alike, is
endangering the ``main achievements of the last decade,''
especially intellectual freedom, the group said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because it is August, vacation season, the appeal failed
to generate any groundswell response from ordinary Russians, who
anyway have a strong instinct for gravitating toward the existing
power.
</P>
<P>
   For all his talk of reform and strengthening the power of the
center, Putin has yet to dismiss a single governor or mayor, though
new legislation will soon arm him with clearer authority to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Vladislav Surkov, a deputy chief of staff under Putin, said in
an interview that a full-fledged anti-corruption campaign was
impossible, since it would be interpreted as a political purge and
evoke images of 1937 and Stalin's terror.
</P>
<P>
   Surkov said reforming the functions of government was the only
way to fight corruption for now.
</P>
<P>
   ``We inherited a thick layer of problems that accumulated during
decades,'' Surkov said. ``If you think they can be solved without a
certain consolidation of power, as we say, then you are mistaken.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Putin was aware that many people did not see him as
committed to democracy. ``I want you to believe me that the
president is a democrat,'' he said. ``It's true. But I don't
understand how the elementary desire to establish order, and I mean
elementary order, is considered undemocratic.''

   RUSSIA-PUTIN (Moscow) _ Since becoming president of Russia,
Vladimir Putin has capitalized on a voter mandate and high poll

wild economic and political swings. But along the way, he is
breaking a lot of china, indulging some of the anti-democratic
instincts, his critics say, that came with his KGB training. By

local welfare officials, who give lots of personal attention to
each case _ and have many lessons to teach the rest of the country.

makes teachers, nearly all of them men, particularly susceptible

U.S. IS CONSIDERING REVIVING MIDEAST PEACE TALKS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House has calculated that the effective
deadline for a final Middle East peace settlement during the
Clinton presidency is the end of September, a senior administration
official said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton is prepared to reconvene a summit meeting _
intense, but shorter than last month's Camp David talks _ but only
if he is assured that the Israelis and Palestinians are ready to
settle all outstanding issues, including Jerusalem, the senior
official said.
</P>
<P>
   The narrow time frame was dictated, the official said, by the
start of the Jewish religious holidays, which stretch from late
September into much of October, and by the return from a long
recess of the Israeli Parliament, at the end of October.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure to move quickly has intensified, the official said,
because the administration has concluded that the Israeli
government of Prime Minister Ehud Barak will not be able to survive
long after Parliament reconvenes.
</P>
<P>
   Recently published opinion polls in Israel suggest that Barak's
popularity has dropped precipitously. If he is still in dire
straits when Parliament returns, the rightist opposition party
Likud is likely to succeed in maneuvering for new elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is not a huge window of time that is available,'' the
administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has threatened to declare a
Palestinian state on Sept. 13, the deadline set by both sides for a
final peace agreement, if there is no such accord by then.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat did not get much support for such a unilateral move
during a recent trip to Europe and Russia, the senior
administration official said. Arafat is expected to continue to
seek support for statehood when he visits leaders of Pakistan,
China and India.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has sent messages to both sides, but is not in the same
intense mode as at Camp David, the official said. There has also
been a ``wide array'' of contacts between senior Israeli and
Palestinian officials, but no direct contact between Barak and
Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Camp David talks ended, ``the Egyptians have made it
clear to us that they are prepared to be helpful'' in persuading
Arafat to make tough decisions, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   One indication of this, according to another administration
official, was the cool reception that the Egyptian leader, Hosni
Mubarak, gave to Arafat's idea of an Arab summit meeting on
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of the Camp David talks, the Egyptian leader
infuriated senior White House aides with his outspoken statements
discouraging Arafat from making a compromise on Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   In public, however, Mubarak has continued to sound a stern note
of noncompromise, saying in an interview published over the weekend
that no Arab or Muslim state could relinquish the traditional claim
to Jerusalem and its holy sites.
</P>
<P>
   Mubarak was briefed extensively about the Camp David talks by a
U.S. emissary, Edward Walker, the assistant secretary for Near East
affairs, who has been touring Arab capitals.
</P>
<P>
   Walker, who participated only briefly at Camp David, has
instructions to tell Arab leaders the broad outlines of what went
on there and to urge them to help Arafat to compromise, U.S.
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat returned to his headquarters in Gaza on Saturday to
contemplate the results of visits to Europe and Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
   France, currently in the chair of the European Union, encouraged
Arafat to continue to talk to his ``partner,'' Barak, the official
said. This was in contrast, he said, to the message that Arafat
received from the French when he was negotiating with the previous
Israeli government under Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whom
Paris considered more of an obstacle to Middle East peace.
</P>
<P>
   In the Arab capitals, Arafat garnered support for his refusal to
compromise on the question of sovereignty of East Jerusalem. But
there was no broad endorsement for an Arab summit meeting that
would develop into a platform for Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   The White House is sending Dennis Ross, its senior Middle East
negotiator, to Israel late this week. He is expected to travel in
the region.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The administration insists that Camp David created a new
dynamic, because issues that had never been dissected before _
especially the future status of Jerusalem _ were broached in a
serious manner.
</P>
<P>
   Jerusalem remained the hardest hurdle, with the most intractable
problems concerning sovereignty over the Temple Mount, known to
Muslims as Haram, and the status of the Old City and the
immediately adjoining areas, the senior administration official
said.
</P>
<P>
   At Camp David, the administration suggested that the
Palestinians have sovereignty over the Muslim and Christian
quarters and the Israelis over the Jewish and the Armenian quarters
of the Old City. Another proposal revolved around the Palestinians
having sovereignty over several of the neighborhoods surrounding
the Old City and having administrative autonomy within the walls.
</P>
<P>
   A third notion was to defer the Jerusalem problem for some
years.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the Israelis nor the Palestinians showed much enthusiasm
for deferring the issue while completing a peace agreement on
territory, security and the fate of Palestinian refugees, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
   One of Barak's declared objectives has been to secure an accord
that would enable him to announce that it was a final agreement
ending all Palestinian claims on Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat has argued that East Jerusalem must be the sovereign
capital of the new Palestinian state. ``I wouldn't dismiss the
possibility of getting the agreement on everything,'' the official
said.
</P>
<P>
   The official stressed that the administration remains willing to
do all it can, but only the two sides can actually reach agreement.

 &HT;    MISSING MAN IS NOTICED AT TEXAS DEMOCRATS CONVENE IN LOS ANGELES
 &HT;    ATTN TEXAS PAPERS
 &HT;    By KEN HERMAN
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Everybody who is anybody among Texas Democrats is
in Los Angeles this week for the Democratic National Convention _
except the man who may be their gubernatorial candidate in two
years.
</P>
<P>
   Laredo oilman Tony Sanchez, seen by some Democrats as the man to
lead them out of the political wilderness, would be out of place
here as his party nominates Al Gore for president. Sanchez is a
high-dollar backer of Republican presidential nominee George W.
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   For Texas Democrats, it's a political conundrum that makes
Sanchez the most interesting no-show. And some top Democrats _ the
same ones who generally have little nice to say about Democrats
backing Bush _ went to work Sunday defending Sanchez.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know him and he is an outstanding man,'' said Texas
Democratic Chairwoman Molly Beth Malcolm. ``He has been a Democrat
all his life. He is friends with George Bush. A lot of people have
friendships.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the friendship and the big money Sanchez has raised for
and given to Bush, Malcolm is among the Democrats who are very
interested in seeing Sanchez atop the 2002 ticket as the party
attempts its comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, potential statewide candidates (something the
Democrats are short on) hang around at national political
conventions to curry favor among delegates.
</P>
<P>
   Former Comptroller John Sharp, moving toward a potential re-run
for lieutenant governor in 2002, will host a Wednesday night
dessert-and-champagne reception for the delegation. Sharp, who lost
to
</P>
<P>
   Republican Rick Perry in the 1998 race for lieutenant governor,
would have an increased chance of winning in 2002 if the Democrats
have a Hispanic atop the ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez, who has declined to say whether he will run for
governor, had little to say recently when asked if he planned to
show up in California.
</P>
<P>
   ``No politics,'' he said during last week during a meeting of
University of Texas System Board of Regents, on which he serves as
a Bush appointee. ``I'm not going to comment on any politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Later in the week, Sanchez's staff in Laredo said he had no
plans to attend the national convention. His absence helps
Democrats avoid an uncomfortable question: Can their 2002
gubernatorial candidate be a Bush
</P>
<P>
   appointee who personally gave $106,000 to Bush's gubernatorial
races and has raised more than $100,000 for Bush's presidential
race?
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Mario Gallegos of Houston, who has traveled around
the nation to bad-mouth Bush's record at home, is willing to
overlook Sanchez's support of the governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we can support somebody like Tony Sanchez,'' said
Gallegos, a longtime friend who said a Sanchez gubernatorial
candidacy would invigorate Hispanic voters and benefit all
Democratic candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of folks that have given George Bush money,
especially in Texas, that are Democrats,'' said Gallegos, adopting
a forgiving tone not reflected by Texas delegates walking around
the convention floor
</P>
<P>
   wearing buttons inviting passers-by to ``Ask about my
governor.''
</P>
<P>
   Longtime party activist Ed Martin chose his words carefully
Sunday as he sat in his hotel lobby and pondered the possibility of
a Democratic gubernatorial nominee with close ties to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of people think (Sanchez) would bring a lot of
ability, a lot of resources, and certainly would bring a lot to a
Democratic ticket,'' Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   But are Texas Democrats ready to nominate a man who has become a
key cog in the Bush campaign?
</P>
<P>
   ``That matter will be dealt with if and when he decides when he
is running,'' said Martin. ``We will deal with that in 2002.''
</P>
<P>
   While they are understanding of Sanchez's support of Bush, some
in the Texas delegation are not as easy-going about the team of
Texas Democrats who back Bush and will hold daily briefings in Los
Angeles to make their point.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's what I've said all along. It takes Democrats to help
George Bush get anything he wants to get done,'' Malcolm said of
the Bush Democrats, including House Appropriations Chairman Rob
Junell of San Angelo and
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Ken Armbrister of Victoria.

 &HT;    Last round won crown for Holyfield
 &HT;    By Mike Tierney
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Evander Holyfield can hear them now.
</P>
<P>
   He's getting old. His skills are eroding. He better bow out
sooner rather than later.
</P>
<P>
   And he smiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``That sets up other (fighters) to say, `I can beat Evander.'
Then I bust them up.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, Holyfield knows that he won over no converts with a plodding
decision, unanimous though seat-squirming tight, Saturday night
over John Ruiz to assume the vacant WBA heavyweight title.
</P>
<P>
   But he also knows that unorthodox boxers often give him fits.
Case in point: Ruiz.
</P>
<P>
   Chillin' in the 26th-floor penthouse suite at his Vegas digs
early Sunday morning, Holyfield said, ``I knew this guy was going
to fight hungry and bulldog me. I didn't want to get in a slinging
contest with this guy because he leads with his head.''
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield countered with elbows and other body parts _
unintentionally, he says; underhandedly, says the Ruiz camp.
WWF-like throwdowns resulted.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't give me room to do anything,'' Holyfield said.
</P>
<P>
   It took Holyfield until the last round to figure out that he
could hold out his glove and grab Ruiz's head as the younger boxer
bore in.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield likes to say that styles make a fight. And if the
style is difficult to decipher, it spells trouble. Ruiz was Rubik's
cube.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know if he would throw a right hand or a left hand.
It was another Vaughn Bean,'' he said of the supposed fall guy who
extended him for all 12 rounds at the Georgia Dome two years ago.
``You never knew what he was going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why Holyfield might handle a one-trick pony like Mike
Tyson with greater ease than John Ruiz.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Holyfield believes the fight's 11-week postponement
because of his pulled stomach muscle was a blessing. Without it, he
fears he might have been totally in the dark.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helped me,'' he said. ``It gave me the opportunity to see
some things (on film). I saw that that boy was going to try and
trick me.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I would have fought him the first time, he would have tore
me up.''
</P>
<P>
   As it was, Holyfield entered the final round even with Ruiz on
two of three judges' cards. If the pair had not awarded the third
round to Holyfield 10-8, he would have trailed.
</P>
<P>
   A booming left hook that felled Ruiz was ruled a slip by the
referee, but Holyfield still may have broken Ruiz's nose during a
dominant last three minutes to keep the goal of undisputed champion
within his sights.
</P>
<P>
   The next key fight is not his own. WBC/IBF designee Lennox Lewis
takes on David Tua in November, with Holyfield waiting for the
winner. First, though, he likely must wade through a WBA title
defense against whoever is promoted to No. 1 contender.
</P>
<P>
   By then, Holyfield will have turned 38, an age at which most
fighters have moved on to less strenuous pursuits.
</P>
<P>
   No matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to keep taking care of my body,'' he said, vowing
even to work out regularly in Sydney while he attends the Summer
Olympics on Coca-Cola's dime. ``I'm still learning things. Going to
start shadow boxing again in front of the mirror.''
</P>
<P>
   He also will work on his mind, continuing to shoo away thoughts
than anytime he steps into the ring could be the last time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't do that anymore,'' he said. ``That only hinders you
from being the very best.''
</P>
<P>
   Against Ruiz, Holyfield was far from his very best. At this
stage, just being better than the other guy is all that counts.

PROTESTERS DETERMINED TO GET THEIR MESSAGE THROUGH 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The head was in the alley; the hand had to be
somewhere. David Solnit's mission was to find it amid all the other
body parts strewn on tables and propped against walls.
</P>
<P>
   Solnit is a puppet master. His specialty of late: mass protests.
He has seen his work paraded through the streets of Seattle and
smashed by police in Philadelphia. An equal opportunity
demonstrator, he's helped make papier-mache caricatures of both
George W. Bush and Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, at a building that until recently sat abandoned but is
now dubbed the Community Convergence Center by protesters taking on
the Democrats at their national convention, his immediate concern
was a puppet named the Mask of Fake Democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Around him, hundreds of mostly young volunteers cut out letters
for banners decrying deforestation, painted signs demanding access
to health care, and chopped lettuce for the free lunch that is
served daily. Upstairs, dozens more demonstrators were learning how
to resist arrest, and how to handle an LA jail if their resistance
fails.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go limp, go limp, go limp,'' urged Sarah Seeds, an instructor
in nonviolent protest. ``See, that way they can't pick you up.''
</P>
<P>
   But the demonstrators have every intention of standing firm
against what they call the sellout of democracy to big business.
Even after the Republican National Convention in Philadelphia,
where hundreds were arrested and the puppet factory was raided, the
center near downtown Los Angeles has been packed from morning to
night with artists, activists and demonstrators. They have,
however, learned some lessons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've become guerrilla artists,'' Solnit said. ``We've
strategically cached supplies and puppets around the city. There's
nothing the LA police can do to shut us down. If they destroy our
puppets, we'll just make more.''
</P>
<P>
   That sort of fervor was evident everywhere in the chaotic
convergence center, from the overly hotclassrooms to the booth
where crude musical instruments were being fashioned out of any
available material, including rubber bands and plastic tubes.
</P>
<P>
   Despite sleeping on friends' floors or in hostels, despite the
sweaty smell of hard work that filled the building, the
demonstrators in their 20s and 30s said they welcomed another
opportunity to grab attention. Jennifer Waltz's only concern was
for her mother, who, she said, had a heart attack when she saw her
daughter on television being pepper-sprayed at the World Trade
Organization meeting last year in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``But she likes that I do this because she was active in the
civil rights movement,'' said Waltz, 28, an environmental activist
from Northern California.
</P>
<P>
   Like her, Brian Couser has attended mass protests before. He
came to Los Angeles from Austin, Texas, and Sunday he attended a
class for protesters taught by law students from a group called the
Midnight Special Law Collective. He worked on a huge, cardboard
puzzle for a demonstration slated for Santa Monica. He both fit
right in and stood right out, with his short hair and clean,
unwrinkled clothing.
</P>
<P>
   Many of his fellow demonstrators looked more like hippies from
the 1960s than the techies that have come to represent their
generation. And they sounded as optimistic as the new economy
dreamers. Among the classes and lectures available at the center
Sunday were ``antiracism for white activists,'' and the ``Asian
left forum.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a lot of grief the first day I got here,'' said Couser,
26, who recently graduated from the University of Texas with a
degree in American literature. ``I guess a lot of people thought I
was a cop or something. They kept asking me if I had an escort.''
</P>
<P>
   As adamant as they are about opening up the political process,
demonstration organizers and the demonstrators themselves can be
distrustful of outsiders. And they insisted that their paranoia is
legitimate.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers representing them for free have accused police of
harassment. Sunday, police cars could be spotted up and down the
street, but the police have been visible everywhere downtown. No
matter how many times a visitor drops by the center, an escort is
required.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the demonstrators have run into each other time and
again in the last nine months. And they often greet each other with
hugs and warm hellos.
</P>
<P>
   ``Activists find each other when we see a chance to put our
message out there,'' said Simmi Gandhi, 33, a nurse and first-timer
at a mass protest whose main issue is decent health care for every
American.
</P>
<P>
   At the entrance to the building, run down and lacking air
conditioning, participants were invited to leave personal messages
at an altar of flowers and candles. Dozens had tacked index cards
to a bulletin board. ``I am love,'' read one. ``I am here to create
visions,'' said another. A third explained: ``I am here because I
am a protest junkie!''

PARK OUTDUELS MARTIN FOR FIRST WINSTON CUP VICTORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WATKINS GLEN, N.Y. _ Steve Park and his team spent 76 races and
parts of four years attempting to solve NASCAR's toughest riddle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been trying to decipher what it takes to win in Winston
Cup,'' Park said Sunday afternoon. ``It just takes a perfect day, a
perfect car, you've got to drive perfectly and have perfect pit
stops. And if you're lacking one thing, you're not going to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Lacking for nothing at Watkins Glen International, Park scored
his breakthrough Cup victory on a day when everything clicked for
the native New Yorker before his home-state fans. Park used a
picture-perfect pit stop to take the lead for the first time from
road-racing ace Mark Martin on Lap 31 of the scheduled 90.
Fittingly, Park was forced to fend off Martin _ a three-time winner
here _ over the final 10 laps en route to victory in the Global
Crossing at The Glen.
</P>
<P>
   The race also saw an unceremonious end to three-time Cup
champion Jeff Gordon's six-race winning streak on road courses,
following heavy contact with the car driven by Tony Stewart and the
Armco guard-rail barrier between turns 3 and 4 on Lap 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to race our guts out to win it, and beat a guy (Martin)
who's known for winning a lot of races on road courses,'' said
Park, whom Martin admittedly tried to lure into a lapse during the
waning laps around the 2.45-mile, 11-turn layout. ``We definitely
weren't a favorite. We had to come from 18th. We had to pass cars
and we had to race to get it. We had to be one of the best to win,
and that just makes it even more rewarding to know we didn't beat
them with fuel mileage or have it be a fluke.''
</P>
<P>
   Park truly earned his first Cup victory, leading a race-high 54
of 90 laps on a track where qualifying had been rained out twice,
and practice was squeezed in between showers both Friday and
Saturday. Until Sunday, the furthest back a winner had started in
the 17-race Cup history at The Glen was 13th, by Rusty Wallace in
1989 and Geoffrey Bodine in 1996. And Park's margin of victory over
Martin, 0.384 seconds, eclipsed the former record of 0.440 seconds
between native New Yorker Bodine and runner-up Terry Labonte in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Park, whose car is owned by seven-time Cup champion Dale
Earnhardt, posted his fifth top-10 finish of the season and first
top-10 in four races at WGI. His previous best Cup finish here was
12th in 1999. But Park, a 32-year-old resident of East Northport,
N.Y., has enjoyed a career full of success at this track in
NASCAR's Featherlite Modified, Busch North, Craftsman Truck and
Busch Grand National series.
</P>
<P>
   Park's familiarity with the track paid off against Martin and
his Roush Racing teammate, Jeff Burton, as that threesome dominated
the parade over the final 40 laps. Burton tried to muscle Park out
of the lead with a fender on a restart at Lap 71, but Park held his
ground. Martin worked his way past Burton on Lap 79, and had 10
laps to reel Park in. With five laps remaining, Martin was within
three car-lengths of Park and the No. 1 Pennzoil Chevrolet Monte
Carlo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was going to try to pass him anywhere I could,'' said
Martin, the winner here in 1993, '94 and '95 and driver of the No.
6 Valvoline Ford Taurus. ``When we really turned it up and put the
pressure on him, he withstood the pressure and never made a slip. I
never got alongside of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Burton, meanwhile, was compelled to almost apologize for his
career-best road-course third-place finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Mark got by me, he just left me,'' said Burton, driver of
the No. 88 Exide Batteries Ford. ``I guess I was holding him up.
When he drove away from me so fast, my heart sank because I thought
I cost him a win. But I knew it would be hard for anybody to beat
Steve because his car sat real flat on the track. It didn't roll
much. When he got in the gas, it hooked up and turned real well.''
</P>
<P>
   In becoming the 13th different winner in 21 events this year,
Park averaged 91.336 mph in a race that took 2 hours, 24 minutes
and 51 seconds to complete.
</P>
<P>
   After taking the checkered flag, Park saluted his fans by
driving to the middle of the frontstretch and climbing onto the
roof of his yellow-and-black car. The celebration will continue all
week at Dale Earnhardt Inc. in Mooresville, N.C., where Park's team
flag will be flown in front of the sprawling race shop.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's an honor,'' Park said. ``And Dale is going to buy lunch
for everybody this week. That's another perk we have for winning.''

DELEGATES MORE LIBERAL THAN THEIR FELLOW DEMOCRATS, POLL SHOWS

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Democratic delegates arriving here to nominate
Vice President Al Gore for president think of themselves as
moderates, but their views on issues from affirmative action to an
activist federal government are more liberal than those of the
public or even Democratic voters generally, a New York Times/CBS
News Poll shows.
</P>
<P>
   On one issue, the death penalty, a random sample of 1,042 of the
4,339 delegates was decisively more liberal than Gore himself,
though 56 percent said they were moderates. Asked to choose between
the death penalty and life in prison without parole, only 20
percent of the delegates preferred executions, compared to 46
percent of Democrats generally and 51 percent of the public. Gore
supports capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth R. Moore, a 72-year-old delegate from Sun Lake, Ariz.,
explained that attitude. He said: ``I've gone 180 degrees on the
death penalty. I used to favor it. But with the questionable
executions recently, particularly with the mentally retarded, I
Just can't support the death penalty without standards that require
absolute proof and an adequate defense. Without that, there is no
justice.''
</P>
<P>
   The ideological distance between the Democratic delegates and
their rank and file was similar to the gap displayed two weeks ago
in Philadelphia, where Republican delegates were strikingly more
conservative than ordinary Republicans or ordinary Americans _ and
such gaps have been found at past conventions.
</P>
<P>
   The death penalty is an example of Democratic delegates being
distant from public attitudes. Occasionally, though, they were
closer than Republicans were. For example, 63 percent of Democratic
delegates and 64 percent of the American public, agreed with the
statement: ``We must protect the environment even if it means jobs
in your community are lost because of it.'' Only 32 percent of
Republican delegates did.
</P>
<P>
   Donna I. King, a delegate from Norwalk, Conn., explained her
view Sunday: ``Now is the right time to focus on the environment.
The economy is strong, unemployment is low. Address this issue in
the best of times, and focus on inspection, regulation and
enforcement.''
</P>
<P>
   One distinct difference between the Democratic and Republican
delegates was their confidence about the election. Only 51 percent
of the Democrats said Gore was the favorite in their state, and in
fact just 27 percent called him a big favorite. Among Republicans,
68 percent said Gov. George W. Bush of Texas was a favorite in
their state and 44 percent said that he had a big edge. The
Democratic poll had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3
percentage points; the survey of Republicans had plus or minus 2.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the interviewing of the delegates was conducted in
July, with no more than a few dozen interviews conducted after the
selection of Sen. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut as Gore's running
mate. That selection plainly made some delegates more hopeful.
</P>
<P>
   Rosemary Trump, a labor organizer from Murrysville, Pa., who had
called the Pennsylvania race a ``toss-up,'' said the Lieberman
choice ``will have a big impact.'' She said, ``It's going to be a
close election here in Pennsylvania, but this will energize those
of us who feel empowered by this choice to work even harder.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephen W. Long, a lawyer from Crestwood, Ky., had also called
his state a toss-up. He said: ``Lieberman being a moderate helps
him here in Kentucky. I don't think the Jewish factor will be a
problem at all here. His stances on taxes and education exemplify
what Gore has been standing for and also strengthen Gore's
personality as a `straight shooter.'''
</P>
<P>
   The surveys also showed major differences of sex, race and
income in the two groups of delegates. Forty-eight percent of the
Democrats are women, compared to 35 percent of the Republicans.
Nineteen percent of the Democratic delegates, like 19 percent of
Democratic voters, are black; 4 percent of Republican delegates and
2 percent of Republican voters are.
</P>
<P>
   While only 19 percent of all voters said their family incomes
exceeded $75,000 last year, 57 percent of the Democratic delegates
and 67 percent of the Republican delegates did. And 17 percent of
Republican delegates, compared to 6 percent of Democrats, would not
answer the question. Almost twice as many Republicans, 23 percent
to 12 percent for Democrats, called themselves millionaires.
Thirty-one percent of Democratic delegates said they belonged to a
labor union; only 4 percent of Republicans did. The median age of
Democratic delegates was 51; for Republicans it was 53.
</P>
<P>
   There was also one major similarity on issues. Sixty-four
percent of the public, with insignificant differences between
Republicans and Democrats, said they thought the large unregulated
contributions from companies, unions and rich people known as soft
money should be banned. Neither set of delegates was in step with
those attitudes. Republican delegates wanted them permitted, by 65
to 24 percent; Democratic delegates were split, with 44 percent
wanting them allowed and 47 percent calling for a ban.
</P>
<P>
   But more often one party or the other proved out of step with
its own voters or the public. On affirmative action for minorities,
83 percent of Democratic delegates said they favored it, compared
to just 51 percent of the public generally and 29 percent of
Republican delegates. Deborah Goldberg, a Democratic delegate from
Farmington, Mich., explained, ``As long as there is discrimination,
there should be affirmative action.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic delegates strongly opposed tuition vouchers for
private or religious schools, by 86 percent to 10 percent. Ordinary
Democrats were opposed, too, but only by 54 percent to 16 percent,
and the public was about evenly split, with 47 percent in favor and
46 percent against. But Republican delegates, who favored them by
71 percent to 20 percent, were almost as far out of step with the
public uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic delegates were much closer to public attitudes than
Republican delegates on questions of increasing safety and
environmental regulation of business and requiring trigger locks on
handguns. But while 73 percent of Democratic delegates said the
government should do more to solve national problems, only 33
percent of the public did.

DELEGATE DISCONTENTMENT EXPECTED TO REMAIN SUPPRESSED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Tom Hayden, the liberal activist and California
state senator, arrived here Sunday to be a convention delegate for
a Democratic Party he barely recognizes. Al Gore's running mate,
Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, was picked for his
centrist credentials. The Democratic platform, written weeks ago
with scant public notice, is so moderate that much of it sounds
Republican.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a dentist worked his way through the Democratic convention,
he would find a lot of bitten-off tongues,'' Hayden said. But like
most delegates, Hayden is willing to put aside his differences to
help elect the Gore-Lieberman ticket. The potential election of
Republican George W. Bush ``is a big motivator,'' Hayden said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, disputes are simmering just below the surface. The
AFL-CIO has worked against Gore and Lieberman in trying to defeat
free-trade deals, but the union has endorsed the Democratic ticket.
Many union members, who make up 28 percent of the delegates, remain
unhappy with the party's strong tilt toward free trade and
especially the US role in the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the teachers' unions initially expressed some concern
about the selection of Lieberman, who has voted for allowing a
pilot project that would use public funds to help parents pay for
private schools in Washington, Lieberman has since said that he
would follow Gore's lead and oppose a national voucher program.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, some delegates may not particularly care about the
``fiscal responsibility'' section of the platform, which for the
first time says Democrats will pay off the public debt and will
always balance the budget. The platform also supports the death
penalty.
</P>
<P>
   The disagreements are not merely from random delegates. House
minority leader Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri and House minority
whip David E. Bonior of Michigan disagree with Gore and Lieberman
on free trade, but both have made clear in recent days that they
won't focus on the dispute. Bonior said Sunday on CNN that he is
convinced that Gore will be better on free trade than President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Party chairman Joe Andrew promises that dissenters will be given
a prominent speaking role.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a real convention,'' Andrew said in an interview
Sunday, referring to what he described as an artificially scripted
GOP gathering two weeks ago in Philadelphia. ``We have nothing to
hide.'' Andrew said he has ``no idea'' what some speakers will say.
</P>
<P>
   But Andrew predicts that few delegates will complain publicly
about the differences. Like the Republicans, the Democrats are
willing to put aside their differences and put forward a unified
message during a week that could make or break Gore's candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   A sign of how the party intends to mold the message of the
convention can be found in the platform. Unlike the Republicans,
who held their platform hearings in Philadelphia amid considerable
media attention right before their convention, the Democrats held
their hearings in Cleveland weeks ago in sessions that received
hardly any coverage or public notice. The process was strictly
overseen by the Gore campaign, which wanted a mostly centrist
document _ and got it.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the platform sounds as if it were written by the GOP,
with calls for paying off the debt and supporting free trade. An
effort by a group calling itself the Progressive Caucus, which
included Hayden, tried and failed to insert a statement saying the
United States should withdraw from the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   US Representative Barney Frank, the Massachusetts Democrat, said
Sunday that most delegates probably disagree with the platform's
support of free trade and the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Frank said, ``there is no real fight going on.
There is a disagreement. What people are forgetting is that the
conventions aren't the decision makers. The primaries have replaced
the convention as the decision maker.''
</P>
<P>
   And Gore easily won the primaries, defeating former senator Bill
Bradley. An Associated Press survey found that 86 percent of the
delegates favor Gore, while 8 percent back Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   While Democrats are convinced that the platform appeals to the
typical American, there is a risk that some union members and
others would be attracted to alternative party candidates such as
Green Party nominee Ralph Nader and whoever is determined to be the
Reform Party nominee, Patrick J. Buchanan or John Hagelin.
</P>
<P>
   Nader presents the biggest danger. He is at 4 percent in some
national polls but has been in the high single digits in some
California polls. If Nader continues to remain that strong, he
could siphon enough votes to cost Gore this vital state and the
November election.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats watched how Republicans sought to present themselves
as a diverse party, with many minorities given prominent speaking
roles. Andrew, the Democratic Party chairman, said this convention
``will be the most diverse in the history of the world.'' While
that is impossible to prove, the AP survey found that the delegates
here are more representative of the United States than at the GOP
gathering. Eighteen percent of the Democratic delegates are black,
compared with 4 percent at the Republican convention and 13 percent
of the general population.
</P>
<P>
   The AP survey also found that 68 percent of the delegates think
gun-control laws are not strong enough; that 82 percent think guns
should come with trigger locks; and that 52 percent think states
should provide civil and other benefits for same-sex couples. Asked
for their top issue priorities, 30 percent said health care; 29
percent said education, and only 0.3 percent said moral values.

SOME PROGRESS IN PHONE STRIKE, BUT AGREEMENT PROVES ELUSIVE
</HEADLINE>
  By SIMON ROMERO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A quick end to the strike by more than 86,000 employees of
Verizon Communications, the nation's largest telecommunications
employer, appeared out of the grasp of negotiators Sunday after
unions rejected parts of the company's latest proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Verizon made a new contract offer at 1 a.m. Sunday that did not
overcome the unions' objections.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is old wine in new bottles,'' said Robert Master, a
spokesman for the Communications Workers of America, which
represents the majority of the striking workers.
</P>
<P>
   The communications workers' union and the International
Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, which represent Verizon
employees in 12 Eastern states and Washington, D.C., are still at
odds with the company on issues like mandatory overtime, stress
levels and the movement of work resulting from Bell Atlantic's $72
billion acquisition of GTE, which formed Verizon.
</P>
<P>
   Still, progress was made in establishing a framework for a
contract for several dozen employees of Verizon's wireless unit.
And both sides agree that perhaps the main stumbling block to an
agreement was overcome last week in an understanding that would
allow unions to organize more easily at Verizon Wireless.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, the strike illustrates an effort by organized labor
to find its footing in the high-technology industries that are
reshaping the economy. Instead of wages and benefits, the main
objectives of the strike involve an effort to gain a union foothold
in new areas and secure concessions for a work force weary of long
hours and the concern that mergers might translate into fewer jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Optimism over Verizon's concession in the wireless area gave way
over the weekend to feelings among negotiators that a fast
resolution to the strike, which is entering its ninth day, has
become more remote.
</P>
<P>
   The main remaining difference between the two sides concerns the
movement of work resulting from the Bell Atlantic-GTE merger.
</P>
<P>
   The unions are seeking to limit the movement of jobs or tasks by
agreeing on a flat percentage of Verizon's work force of 260,000
employees that would be subject to such movement, similar to the
half a percentage point agreed upon with Bell Atlantic after it
bought Nynex in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Verizon, though, wants a more flexible agreement that would
limit movement of work by measuring it in net additions or
subtractions within a given region.
</P>
<P>
   In one part of Verizon's offer, the company proposed limiting
the number of employees who could transfer from stressful jobs at
call centers to other parts of the company. The unions said this
proposal would actually make matters worse.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the union reiterated concern over Verizon's move to
expand in the high-speed Internet access business by acquiring
NorthPoint Communications. Verizon told the unions about 300
union-represented jobs would be shifted into the NorthPoint
operation, but details involving the outsourcing of related tasks
remained blurry, a person close to the talks said.
</P>
<P>
   Although an overall agreement is within reach, both sides
acknowledged that little progress was made over the weekend. If the
walkout drags on, the communications workers' union said it would
start using its $400 million strike fund on the 15th day of the
strike.
</P>
<P>
   The fund would pay its members $200 a week. If the strike were
to last a month, the amount each member would receive rises to $300
a week.
</P>
<P>
   Verizon said it had 90,000 repair requests Sunday, up from about
80,000 during most days last week, although the company attributed
the increase to rainstorms that knocked out service in parts of
several Eastern states. Meanwhile, the number of pickets thinned to
about 750 Sunday, down from the thousands at Verizon sites each day
last week.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Republicans on MSNBC's ``Equal Time'' were
having a hard time depicting the smiling, smooth-faced guy in
glasses and a brown suit _ the one trying in vain to offer an
opinion _ as being in league with Al Gore's ``slaughterhouse
killers.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, that nice Joe Andrew, the chairman of the Democratic
National Committee, who will bring the gavel down to start his
party's convention in Los Angeles on Monday, did manage to break
into the conversation a couple of times.
</P>
<P>
   When Oliver North asked, ``Is Joe Lieberman going to the Playboy
bunny club on the Feast of the Blessed Virgin,'' referring to a
convention-week fund-raiser unsanctioned by the party, Andrew
sighed and said no. ``I'd love to stop it but I can't,'' he said .
</P>
<P>
   Then he exchanged ideas on the issues with Jim Nicholson,
chairman of the Republican National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholson: ``Is Joe Lieberman going to work in the
slaughterhouse?'' _ as Gore's wild-talking campaign manager, Donna
Brazile, recently called their headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew: ``It's called the kitchen'' _ the Gore campaign's name
for its ``war room.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicholson: ``No, it's killers in the kitchen.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrew: ``The only killers in this process are Dick Cheney.''
</P>
<P>
   Not quite as tame as he looks, but not entirely comfortable with
the zingers, either. After the show, Andrew tried a little friendly
chitchat on Nicholson: ``Hey, they didn't even need us in there,
did they?''
</P>
<P>
   What he got back, though, was the tight smile of an airline
passenger engrossed in a really good book and hoping to discourage
instant intimacy without being totally rude.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew whispered, ``I'm always the one who asks about his kids''
_ not the other way around. He often sounds surprised by the
brusqueness of life in the capital, having arrived here with his
wife and two children just last year, ``plucked from the obscurity
of the cornfields of Indiana,'' as he puts it.
</P>
<P>
   When George W. Bush was asked, not long ago, to respond to a
charge that Andrew had made, his response was ``Who is Joe
Andrew?''
</P>
<P>
   But then Andrew did not get his job because he was a brand name.
He got it in part because the party's heaviest hitters were not
begging to take over at a time when the national committee was
going broke, but also because he had turned around the state
operation in Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   He loves to tell the story of how, on his first day in the
Washington job, he took some union officials to lunch and handed
the waiter his brand-new corporate credit card: ``They came back to
the table and said, `I'm sorry, Andrew, but your card has been
rejected.' I didn't know we hadn't been able to pay Visa for six
months.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then he seems to have excelled at the unsexy business of
cutting costs, upgrading the party's online efforts and taking care
of Democrats around the country _ while the better-known general
party chairman, Ed Rendell, handles fund raising.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew's ``boring, difficult, unpopular'' cuts helped get the
operation back in the black last year, as one party operative put
it. And Andrew has emerged as a favorite of unions and state
parties, which like his regular-guyness and do not care if he fails
to dazzle on cable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe Andrew has been a shot of adrenaline,'' said Judith Hope,
chairwoman of the New York State Democratic Party. ``It means a lot
to those of us in the trenches that he's been there himself.''
</P>
<P>
   The humble-Hoosier routine is no put-on. After an initial
meeting with a reporter, in which his behavior was correct in the
extreme, he asked an associate, ``Do you think I came on too
strong?'' But he is also better connected than his frequent
references to cornfields would suggest.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, one of those six-degrees-of-separation diagrams that
showed all Hollywood linked to Winona Ryder might work for Joe
Andrew in Washington. Gore's new running mate, Sen. Joseph
Lieberman, had Andrew in class as a Yale undergraduate and
recommended him for his current job.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew once worked on a legal case with William M. Daley of
Chicago, who is running Gore's campaign. He is close to Jesse
Jackson, whom he got to know because Jackson regularly attended
Black Expo, an annual cultural festival in Indianapolis. He has
worked for Sen. Evan Bayh of Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   That is how he got to know a bunch of people with ties to Gore _
including Bob Squier, Gore's longtime media consultant, who died
earlier this year, and Carter Eskew, Gore's top consultant. Ron
Klain, Gore's former chief of staff, is a fellow Hoosier whom
Andrew knows from Indianapolis _ a networking hot spot, it would
seem. And Klain also had a hand in bringing him into Goreworld.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In a long interview over dinner, Andrew, 40, said it was
politics that had gotten him interested in the wider world in his
hometown of Poe, Ind., population 87, where he was one of nine
children in a Republican family
</P>
<P>
   His father, a barber who went back to school and became a
doctor, moved the family to ``an actual corn-and-soybean farm,'' as
Andrew called it. ``His idea was to be a gentleman farmer,'' he
said of his father, ``but when they divorced, it became a real
farm.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of a Newt Gingrich story,'' Andrew said, with a
partisan spin even on the story of how his father left the family.
</P>
<P>
   After that, his mother, a former teacher whom he described as
``a woman who likes a good glass of wine and a Shakespeare
festival'' had to learn how to farm. ``My entire adolescence was
spent mowing weeds,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His escape, his passion, his entertainment and probably his
rebellion were Democratic politics _ as inspired by Robert F.
Kennedy. At age 12, his idea of fun was to go to the mall and slap
bumper stickers for local Democratic candidates on the cars of
unsuspecting shoppers. The Allen County party headquarters became
his hangout.
</P>
<P>
   About that time, a ``very liberal'' teacher began encouraging
him to shoot for Yale University, mostly because a local man had
set up a scholarship to that school, Andrew said, and that is how
he went to college. He later graduated from Yale Law School.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, he met Lieberman. ``But for Lieberman,'' he
said, modestly, ``I would never had gotten involved in any of it.''

 &HT;    Gators hope to get back on track
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAINESVILLE, Fla. _ The record shows that Florida did play for
the SEC football championship last December. Still, it was not a
very pleasant offseason here in Gator Country.
</P>
<P>
   For coach Steve Spurrier, 1999 provided way too many ``firsts''
in his successful decade as the head ball coach in Gainesville:
</P>
<P>
   Florida ended the season with consecutive losses to No. 1
Florida State, Alabama in the SEC championship game, and Michigan
State in the Citrus Bowl. That marked the first time Spurrier had
lost three straight games at Florida.
</P>
<P>
   With a 9-4 record, Florida failed to win 10 games in a season
for the first time since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Florida failed to finish in the final Associated Press top 10
for the first time since 1990, Spurrier's first year as coach.
</P>
<P>
   Florida lost twice (Alabama, Florida State) last season at home
in Ben Hill Griffin Stadium, a.k.a., the Swamp. That was a first.
Florida had lost only a total of twice at home in the previous nine
seasons (Florida State 1993, Auburn 1994).
</P>
<P>
   Around the SEC, the whispers began. Had Florida, which won five
SEC championships from 1991-96, merely hit a bump in the road? Or,
after going three straight years without a conference title, were
the Gators beginning to lose their bite?
</P>
<P>
   Spurrier put his players and his coaching staff on notice not
long after the season ended. Florida would get back on top in the
SEC, he told them, and everyone in the room would be held
accountable for doing their part.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh it was clear,'' defensive coordinator Jon Hoke said. ``As
always, he said `it starts with me.' But everybody knew what he
meant. We were all going to be held accountable and that's the way
it should be.''
</P>
<P>
   So it was no coincidence that Florida went out last February and
signed what is arguably the best recruiting class in Spurrier's 11
years in Gainesville.
</P>
<P>
   ``In retrospect, we probably got out of last season what we
deserved and it probably helped us in recruiting,'' said Spurrier,
who has won 102 games in 10 seasons at Florida. ``I think some of
those freshmen thought the mighty Gators weren't so mighty anymore
and they could step right in and play.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking back, Spurrier now believes Florida was lulled into a
false-sense of security last season by its 23-21 win over Tennessee
in Gainesville. In that game, Florida won despite committing five
turnovers and having two touchdowns called back for penalties.
Those kind of mistakes would plague Florida the entire season. The
Gators had 15 penalties against Florida State and kept two Seminole
drives alive by simply lining up offsides.
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, Spurrier says he won't do as much yelling this
season. He'll just have another player ready to go if the first guy
keeps messing up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just going to make sure the players play the way they
are coached,'' Spurrier said. ``It's no disgrace to lose a game if
a guy just outplays you. But to lose with all those mental errors,
that's embarrassing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He got our attention in the spring, that's for sure,'' said
quarterback Jesse Palmer. ``There is no excuse for all the mistakes
we made last season.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida will be better in 2000 because the defense will be
better. A year ago the Gators were inconsistent on defense, showing
flashes of greatness (Tennessee) followed by inexplicable lapses
(Alabama twiships when they have a big-time tailback (i.e. Errict
Rhett, Fred Taylor) to control the ball in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Spurrier concedes the Gators haven't been as talented as 1995
and 1996, when they played for the national championship. But just
hang on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it will be this year, but we'll get there,''
Spurrier said. ``I believe we'll get it back to where it used to
be.''

AIDS TAKES HEAVY TOLL ON TEACHERS AND EDUCATION IN AFRICA

<TEXT>
<P>
   BAZRA-NATTIS, Ivory Coast _ Among the precious few classrooms in
this village in West Africa, one squat two-room building is no
longer in use. A green bicycle chain looped around the door handles
bars entry.
</P>
<P>
   A peek through the shutters shows desks and chairs, dusty from
disuse, though in good enough condition to be used when
schoolchildren gravitate back in September from the surrounding yam
and corn fields.
</P>
<P>
   Most likely, though, the building will stay shut. No new teacher
has been assigned to it since the previous occupant died of AIDS in
1997. Six teachers a week in this nation of 15 million people die
of AIDS, a 1998 government study found, and officials believe the
number has only gone up since then.
</P>
<P>
   So this small village in the heart of the Ivory Coast has come
to represent the big problems facing this country and others in
Africa, where AIDS has weakened the already troubled educational
systems.
</P>
<P>
   Soldiers and long-distance truck drivers have been particularly
affected by AIDS in Africa because they move around without their
families in the course of their work and are more likely to have a
variety of sexual partners. But, paradoxically, the study found
that AIDS had also affected teachers, who are often the only
educated people in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   Most African teachers are men, who, especially in Muslim
countries, are more likely to be educated beyond primary school.
The elite status afforded by their education makes such men
particularly susceptible when, young and single, they enter remote
villages for their first teaching jobs: young village women compete
for their attention. The result is multiple sexual relationships,
made riskier because of ignorance about AIDS and because the men
are unlikely to use condoms.
</P>
<P>
   This country, like most others on the continent, remains
ill-prepared to deal with the effects of AIDS on education. If
unchecked, the trend is expected to prove catastrophic in the near
future. Already, many classrooms are overcrowded as teachers take
on pupils whose previous teachers died of AIDS; other schools
simply remain closed because replacements cannot be found.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Bazra-Nattis, after the teacher died, the schoolchildren
ate their meals inside the building _ until last year, when a
strong wind blew off the aluminum roof one night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We concluded that the same misfortune that had claimed the
teacher struck again,'' said Nahangnena Kone, the principal of the
Bazra-Nattis public primary school. ``So we closed the building for
good.''
</P>
<P>
   In many other African nations, where a chronic shortage of
teachers is only one of the symptoms of their ailing schools, AIDS
has aggravated their troubles in recent years, according to figures
compiled by the Joint U.N. Program on HIV/AIDS, or UNAIDS.
</P>
<P>
   In southern Africa, 1,300 teachers died of AIDS in Zambia in the
first 10 months of 1998 _ that is about two-thirds of all teachers
trained each year and more than double the number who died in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In the Central African Republic, between 1996 and 1998, the
number of retiring teachers was almost matched by the number of
teachers who died of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   ``AIDS constitutes one of the biggest crises and the biggest
threats to the global education agenda that we have known,'' Dr.
Peter Piot, the executive director of UNAIDS, said at a World
Education Forum in Senegal in April. ``There is no other single
factor in the world today that so systematically undermines the
gains of decades of investment in human resources, education,
health and the well-being of nations.''
</P>
<P>
   No other continent has been damaged as much by AIDS as this, the
world's poorest. Of the estimated 34 million people worldwide who
have AIDS or HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, 24 million are
believed to be in Africa. The majority of those live in sub-Saharan
Africa, whose population of perhaps 610 million is relatively small
compared with those in some other regions of the world.
</P>
<P>
   The rates have been highest in southern Africa. In West Africa,
where Islam and other factors slowed the spread of AIDS, it is now
climbing.
</P>
<P>
   The Ivory Coast, long an economic crossroad as the richest
nation in French-speaking Africa, now has the highest rate of AIDS
and HIV in the region. Nearly 11 percent of the adult population is
believed to carry HIV, according to UNAIDS; 72,000 died of AIDS in
1999 in this country.
</P>
<P>
   Here, like elsewhere on the continent, ignorance regarding AIDS
and condom use appears to be one of the main causes of the rapid
spread of the disease. The difficulty educating a largely
illiterate population is emphasized by the fact that most teachers
know little of the disease either.
</P>
<P>
   ``In principle, it is normal to rely on the educational sector
to help fight back the HIV/AIDS epidemic,'' said Dr. Mamadou Lamine
Sakho, an official with UNAIDS in Abidjan, the commercial capital
of the Ivory Coast. ``Unfortunately, the educators themselves are
poorly informed or not informed at all.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   That reality was documented by a government study conducted from
September 1996 through August 1998. During that period, 641
educators died of AIDS throughout the Ivory Coast _ six a week. In
the first year, about 64 percent of all teachers' deaths were AIDS
related; during the second year, the rate rose to 69 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Issa Malick Coulibaly, executive director of the Program of
the National Fight Against AIDS during the study and one of its
authors, described the effects of AIDS as a ``catastrophe for
education and consequently for the country.''
</P>
<P>
   On average, the teachers had 13 years of experience and would
have taught 17 more years, Coulibaly said. In some remote areas of
the country, like Odienne in the northwest, schools have been
closed for the last two years because there have been no
replacements, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If nothing is done between now and the year 2005,'' Coulibaly
said, ``there will be 5,000 children who, because of a lack of
teachers, will not be able to go to school and will swell the
number of street children.''
</P>
<P>
   But teachers and private organizations that focus on AIDS
education say the government has done little to combat the epidemic
in recent years, and any such activities have been frozen since the
military seized power last December.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been no follow-through at all since the report came
out,'' said Drigone Bouabi, a former teacher who is HIV positive
and founded a group called Virus Village to raise AIDS awareness in
rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   In the area surrounding Bazra-Nattis, Bouabi's private
organization has held AIDS workshops for teachers and students
alike. Some teachers here said that prior to Bouabi's efforts, they
knew little about AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   ``AIDS is not something we talked about,'' said Mousa Traore,
27, who has taught here for three years. ``It's still a hidden
disease. So my knowledge was very superficial. I can't say I knew
the proper way to use a condom.''
</P>
<P>
   His concerns were echoed by other teachers in the region. In the
town of Bahoulifla, south of here, a school has been similarly
devastated by the death of a teacher. Douba Vanie Michel, a teacher
at the school, expressed concerns similar to those in Bazra-Nattis.
</P>
<P>
   Many teachers said they believed that AIDS had had such an
impact on their profession because of the career pattern followed
by teachers in the Ivory Coast. Typically, after teachers college,
new graduates are dispatched to rural areas for their first
assignments. They are paid very little at the beginning so they
must essentially rely on a local village for shelter and food.
</P>
<P>
   ``The village chief will usually assign a girl to prepare your
meals and take care of you,'' said Kone, the principal. ``But
because you are the only civil servant in the village and are
considered an elite, other girls will bring you food simply to
tempt you.''
</P>
<P>
   Ago Akpoue, a 38-year-old teacher here, added: ``You suddenly
find yourself in a village with no television _ maybe not even a
radio signal _ no distractions at all. And there are all these
women. For me, I had never spent more than a week in a village.
What else can you do?''
</P>
<P>
   The result is that many teachers take on multiple sexual
partners. If a teacher goes to a village that has condoms, they
often run out, and there are no new supplies.
</P>
<P>
   And while many African men are reluctant to use condoms, so are
many women, who feel that a man's insistence on wearing a condom
suggests that the woman belongs in the rank of prostitutes and
other high-risk women. So they will press men to have sex without
condoms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say that women are even more reluctant than men to use
condoms for that reason,'' said Solange Chieda Adou, 26, the only
woman among the 10 teachers in Bazra-Nattis. ``In general, in the
villages, many people don't even believe that AIDS exists.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the teacher died of AIDS here in 1997, a shortage of
teachers has meant that children have been doubled up in classrooms
or that they attend school on half-day shifts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The students' educational level is very, very low because of
the chronic disruptions during the school year,'' Adou said.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, last year Akpoue had a classroom of 110 pupils.
That meant he had very little time to get to know any of the
students, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, with each pupil having one exercise book for
French, one for mathematics and one for other subjects, Akpoue
found himself each day with the daunting task of correcting 330
exercise books. The work had to be done at night by hurricane lamp
since there is no electricity in this village.
</P>
<P>
   Kone, the principal, said that despite the death of their
colleague, his teachers remained reluctant to confront the
realities of AIDS. Presumably, he said, some were still having sex
without condoms; perhaps some even carried the virus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've asked them numerous times to be tested for HIV,'' Kone
said. ``But not one of them has accepted. I am the only one to have
been tested.''

`SHADOW CONVENTION' ADDS A BIT OF STAR POWER TO ITS POLITICS 
</HEADLINE>
  By   BERNARD WEINRAUB   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Let's get serious! That's what Arianna Huffington
_pundit, gadfly, author, party-giver, intellectual and, yes, enigma
_ &UR;  &LR; proclaimed as her ``Shadow Convention'' opened Sunday night at
Patriotic Hall on Figueroa Street, not far from that other
convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``We created this because of the vacuum created by the
Democratic and Republican conventions _ &UR;  &LR; they've drained all the
politics out of the conventions and turned them into floor shows
and charades!'' Huffington exclaimed. ``Look at what's happening
Wednesday night at the Democratic convention. The theme is the Vice
President as the principled fighter of special interests. Give me a
break. The convention has lost any grounding in reality.''
</P>
<P>
   To some degree, Huffington, who was born in Greece, educated in
England and spent several years with her millionaire former
husband, Michael Huffington, in Houston and Washington, perfectly
embodies her new hometown, Los Angeles. The 50-year-old author, and
sometime Republican, had hardly fit into the stuffy Georgetown
social strictures in Washington &UR; .  &LR;  Like many in Los Angeles, she's
constantly re-inventing herself.
</P>
<P>
   On one level the ``Shadow Convention'' seems very serious. There
are sessions on drugs, poverty and, what she termed, ``the
corruption of money in politics.'' One session will deal with gun
violence and communities poisoned by pesticides _ issues that,
Huffington said, are being avoided by the Democratic convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've cleaned up the streets of the homeless, they're
holding the convention in the poverty capital of the U.S. but not
talking about the poor. They're holding an invitation-only golf
tournament at the Riviera Country Club,'' she said, referring to a
glitzy and hugely-expensive golf club in the Pacific Palisades.
``They give nothing but lip service to the real problems we're
facing.''
</P>
<P>
   At another level, though, the convention's agenda is marked by
some silliness, intentional or not.
</P>
<P>
   Not only will Bill Maher, host of ``Politically Incorrect,''
where Huffington frequently appears, play an important role, but
pundits like Christopher Hitchens (The Nation, Vanity Fair) &UR; ,  &LR; 
Robert Scheer (The Los Angeles Times) &UR; ,  &LR;  Jonathan Alter (Newsweek)
and Norman Orenstein (The American Enterprise Institute) will
weigh-in with their Really Important Thoughts. What convention or
media gathering is possible without hearing from these savants? At
the finale of the Democratic convention journalists will be joined
by _ who else? _ Roseanne.
</P>
<P>
   Because the convention is in Los Angeles, Huffington seemed
fully aware that a bit of glitz (her pal, Warren Beatty, may show
up) as well as shallowness are necessary to lure crowds and,
especially, newspaper and television coverage. She said happily
that, during the Republican convention in Philadelphia, newspapers
like The Boston Globe and The Philadelphia Inquirer wrote about her
convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see the shadow conventions as part of building a movement
that will force the two parties to change, in the same way that the
civil rights movement forced change within the Government.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course the civil rights movement did not include Roseanne.
Or, for that matter, Arianna Huffington.

COMMENTARY: BILL'S THIRD ACCEPTANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ My Fellow Democrats:
</P>
<P>
   After that rousing eight-minute demonstration, I accept your
love. I accept your appreciation for triangulating you out of the
Carter-Mondale-Dukakis wilderness and back into the White House for
eight glorious years. And were it not for that damnable two-term
amendment the Republicans put through to get even with FDR, tonight
I would be saying, ``I accept your renomination!''
</P>
<P>
   That's how I'd like to start my valedictory speech. And then
there are a few other things I wish I could say.
</P>
<P>
   On the contrition business, I'd like to tell Bush and Cheney
where to get off with all their barbs about ``restoring honor and
dignity'' and other code words condemning my private life. But that
line of attack from me would play into their hands.
</P>
<P>
   So I'll choke back my feelings and pretend to be grateful to Joe
Lieberman for calling me to moral account on the Senate floor.
That'll get a big hand; We can't let the Pat Robertson crowd
out-God us. And at least Joe voted right on acquittal.
</P>
<P>
   I showed the other day how I can smother my detractors with
gratitude. My best line to my pastor in Illinois: ``If I hadn't
been knocked down the way I was, and forced to come to grips with
what I'd done and the consequences of it in such an awful way, I
might not ever have had to really deal with it 100 percent.'' Thank
you, Ken Starr and Henry Hyde, for forcing me to deal with it.
Beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   And the convention will tear the place apart if I thank the
two-thirds of the American people for sticking by me in my toughest
time. My personal purging process is not a subject Al wants me to
touch on at a convention that is supposed to be all about him, but
I know what's best for me. And what's best for me is best for him
because this election is about me.
</P>
<P>
   I won't let on about that, of course; I have to say every
election is about the future. But I'll look back, bragging on the
good times, claiming my tax increase in '93 was responsible for all
the prosperity and surpluses today. I'll blame the Democrats' loss
of the House on that unpopular party-line vote, even though
everybody in the hall who lost will know the reason was our
health-care fiasco.
</P>
<P>
   My theme will be the tried-and-true ``You Never Had It So
Good,'' backed up with a pile of facts and figures _ 22 million
jobs! Crime down! Stock market up! _ followed by the fearsome
``Don't Let Them Take It Away.'' Look, maybe we had nothing to do
with prosperity, but if we were in a depression, who would be
getting the blame?
</P>
<P>
   Looking into my own soul, I confess I'm torn. The good part of
me wants Al Gore to win because it would validate my eight years
and show the American people saying, ``We want to give Bill Clinton
a third term.'' On the other hand, the bad boy in me wants him to
lose, to show the Democrats how much they needed me personally to
drag them in and keep them in.
</P>
<P>
   Even more conflicted are my feelings about Hillary's New York
bid. I want her to win because I owe her for all that forgiving and
because she's a backup for my validation in case Al can't make it
without me. But my bad side says if she loses, she'll realize who
the only winner is in this family. Plus which, she wouldn't be able
to get on her high horse and have all that fun in the Washington I
brought her to.
</P>
<P>
   No _ get thee behind me, Satan _ I want Hillary to beat that
pushover unknown, really I do. For six years, ever since her
health-bill fiasco, we've been assuring everybody she hasn't been
affecting presidential policy, especially about the Palestinians.
But the new line is that the opposite was true, that she was deeply
involved in all sorts of big decisions. Look, whichever she wants _
strictly first lady or co-president _ I can teach it either way.
</P>
<P>
   So I'll stand up there for my Third Acceptance and wow 'em by
taking full credit for everything good that's happened in eight
great years. Let Al play Mr. Nice Guy if he likes; I'll be that old
lovable rogue who can make a centrist waffle look like red meat.
I'll make the Democrats miss my charm. I'll scare the viewers with
the prospect of Bush, backward economics and back-alley abortions,
and I'll stupefy my enemies with great globs of gratitude.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton fatigue? Not when I'm finished. Tonight is the first
night of Clinton nostalgia.

GORE _ DISTANCING HIMSELF FROM CLINTON _ ON TRICKY PATH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID M. SHRIBMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Tipper Gore has never gotten over Monica Lewinsky,
and is barely on speaking terms with President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The president, temperamentally unable to refrain from political
freelancing, is so estranged from the Gore campaign that he found
himself last weekend in the uncomfortable position of beseeching
leading Democratic lawmakers for tips on who Gore would choose for
his running mate.
</P>
<P>
   And Clinton's schedule in Southern California in the days
leading up to the Democratic National Convention was drafted
without consideration to Gore's needs _ and without consultation
with Gore's staff.
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton prepares to offer his convention farewell Monday
night, there is no Clinton Factor inside the Gore campaign -- at
least not on the personal and operational level.
</P>
<P>
   But on a political and strategic level, Gore can't escape the
Clinton Factor when he tries to, can't control the Clinton Factor
when he needs to _ and can't embrace the Clinton Factor when he
wants to.
</P>
<P>
   And so the story of Gore's struggle for power _ the task that
has trailed him from his battle with former Senator Bill Bradley of
New Jersey a year ago to his triumph in the caucuses and primaries
of winter and spring all the way to now, the morning before the
Democratic National Convention opens here _ is his effort to
untangle his destiny from that of Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But not too much.
</P>
<P>
   This is a tall order, even here in a corner of America where
generations have come seeking a fresh start and a fresh identity.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a hard trick to pull off,'' said John Bond, a Texas A
&AMP; M University political scientist. ``Gore needs to get credit for
the economic prosperity that has happened and convince the public
that he's played a role in that, and yet he has to distance himself
from the personal problems of the president.''
</P>
<P>
   The maneuvers required to accomplish that are the political
equivalent of performing a Tennessee square dance in a telephone
booth.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, of all the case studies of the political opportunities
and challenges inherent in the vice presidency _ from William
Howard Taft's struggle for independence from Theodore Roosevelt to
Hubert H. Humphrey's frustration in his effort to break loose from
Lyndon B. Johnson _ the difficulties faced by Al Gore in his effort
to succeed Bill Clinton may be the most perplexing, the most
frustrating, the most agonizing.
</P>
<P>
   It involves respect _ and resentment. It involves loyalty _ and
betrayal. It involves soaring public popularity _ and profound
public distaste.
</P>
<P>
   It is marked by the tensions inherent in the complex
relationship of a calculating man -- Clinton -- whose political
style seems completely intuitive _ and an intuitive man -- Gore --
whose political style seems completely calculated. It is the story
of the frayed ties between a man accustomed to following as he
struggles to learn how to lead _ and a man accustomed to
luxuriating in the limelight as he wrestles with the humbling
prospect of occupying the shadows. It is the chronicle of the
collision of interests between a man obsessed with salvaging his
legacy _ and one determined to win his chance.
</P>
<P>
   It is the irrepressible clash of a president who, in the
twilight of his term, is, as one Democratic senator put it,
``wandering, lost,'' and a vice president who, on the verge of his
own nomination, still hasn't found his voice. It is the epic
conflict of a man who can't let go of power _ the president speaks
on the phone nearly every day with William R. Daley, Gore's
campaign chief _ and a man who, though he formally accepts his
party's presidential nomination Thursday night, still hasn't
grabbed hold of the public imagination.
</P>
<P>
   ``In business, it's much easier for a chief executive to
establish his own identity,'' says Abraham Zaleznik, emeritus
professor of leadership at the Harvard Business School. ``In
government, a president has to get his power from the electorate
and then has to share it. There are big ambiguities in politics
that aren't present in business, and Gore is right in the middle of
those ambiguities.''
</P>
<P>
   The contours of those ambiguities were set by one of the least
ambiguous figures in American history, William Jefferson Clinton of
Hope, Ark.
</P>
<P>
   As the president reaches the clubhouse turn in his route to the
end of power, 55 percent of Americans approve of Clinton's job
performance while only 48 percent have a favorable opinion of
Clinton himself _ the opposite of what is typical for a president.
</P>
<P>
   And though both his last two predecessors as two-term
presidents, Dwight D. Eisenhower and Ronald Reagan, were involved
in delicate maneuvers with the Soviet Union as their days in office
drew to a close, Clinton nonetheless remains more at the center of
action in his 91st month of power than either Eisenhower or Reagan.
Just this summer, for example, Clinton was the stage manager of
important negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians _ even
as he was attending a summit of leaders of industrialized nations.
</P>
<P>
   But that is not the only reason Clinton' shadow falls on Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship between the two men, so firmly fixed in the
public's mind today, is in reality only eight years old, an
extraordinarily brief time for two politicians who grew up in the
same region, same generation, same party and same tradition. The
two are from neighboring states and have both been in politics for
most of their adult lives, and yet they hardly even knew each other
until they came together as the Democratic ticket in the summer of
1992.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, Gore, who occupied the bottom of the 1992 ticket, has
always seemed part of an older cohort in American politics than
Clinton. A classic political insider with a father in the Senate
and his own experience in the House and Senate, Gore had run for
president four year before Clinton had and then, fatefully, passed
up a chance to run in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   That marked Gore _ and his vice presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``That set up a relationship with the president and myself where
I never felt as some vice presidents have, that that should be me
in the Oval Office and I could do it better,'' Gore said in a Globe
interview, adding: ``And so I threw myself into it wholeheartedly
without any emotional or spiritual reservations, and that made all
the difference for me. It was a great and fulfilling experience _
to be sure, very difficult at times, but always fulfilling.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the vice presidency itself was an office in
transformation. Three of the last four occupants of the position _
Walter F. Mondale, George H. W. Bush, and Gore _ substantially
enhanced the importance of a job that is endlessly bewitching to
those who seek it but endlessly frustrating to those who win it.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made Gore a full partner, sometimes putting off a policy
or political decision until he could consult with the vice
president. Meetings waited until Gore arrived. Decisions weren't
final until Clinton could get Gore on the telephone.
</P>
<P>
   The vice presidency gave Gore a role _ and a role model. He
helped teach Clinton some of the prosaic lessons of the capital,
Clinton helped teach Gore some of the lessons of raw political
performance. Gore was an avid learner, but often he was in awe of
the president's skill, and often, as Clinton worked a problem or
worked his way through a room, it was almost possible to imagine
the gears turning in Gore's head: (itals)Why can't I think the way
he thinks? Why can't I see the things he sees?(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   Then came the Monica Lewinsky affair, the long path toward the
House impeachment, the winding trail of the Senate trial. Gore kept
a brave face. Inside he was in turmoil. On the second day of the
crisis he invited four journalists to his West Wing office. The
tension was nearly unbearable. The vice president sat there
awkwardly, almost icily, repeating that the president was his
friend, that he would stand by him and stand with him.
</P>
<P>
   He did. But in truth he was ``aghast'' _ the phrase comes from a
leading Democrat who knows both Clinton and Gore well _ first at
Clinton's recklessness and then at his refusal to acknowledge his
wrongdoing. Though sickened, angry and hurt, Gore remained
steadfast, even while others in the Clinton circle, including such
high-level aides and confidantes as George Stephanopoulos and Dick
Morris, wrote books and sought to place a distance between
themselves and the president.
</P>
<P>
   Of all those around the president, only Gore did not break. On
the South Lawn of the White House he made the remarks that neither
Clinton nor the president's Republican rivals would ever forget,
his prediction that the second chief executive to be impeached
would be ``regarded in the history books as one of our greatest
presidents.'' And those who are close to Clinton believe that the
president knows he is indebted to the vice president for that.
</P>
<P>
   That may explain the president's extraordinary remarks last week
when, in suburban Chicago, he spoke of his own failings and of
Gore's presidential campaign: ``Surely, no fair-minded person would
blame him for the mistakes I've made.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardly anyone does. But the danger for Gore is the resiliency of
the word ``scandal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I doubt that when people go into the voting booth they will
take Bill Clinton's personal behavior heavily into account,'' said
Roger B. Porter, who was President Bush's domestic-policy adviser.
``Gore's bigger worry should be the fund-raising scandal. There his
own behavior is at issue.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gore's challenge here is also to make his own character and
his own abilities the issue. For years he has been, in Eugene
McCarthy's cruel description, somebody else's man. From this week
on he must be his own man.

A PLAYER WHO SOARS WITH THE MOUTH THAT ROARS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Fla., N.Y., W.Va., Calif.)   By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ The offense of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers hit a
small lull last week during a dreary preseason game against Miami.
Suddenly, wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson, always the life of the
party or the huddle, saw something that would perk things up.
Dolphins cornerback Jerry Wilson, barely 5 feet 10 inches, was
guarding, all by himself, the 6-4 Johnson. The best defensive backs
in the game, some built like small forwards, have a difficult time
matching up with Johnson's combination of power and size.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson did not know it yet, but he was in big trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Inside Johnson's head an alarm went off, and his heart began
racing. Johnson trotted back to the huddle and looked at
quarterback Shaun King, who speaks softly compared to Johnson, who
is a 15-piece orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh my goodness, Jerry Wilson is on me,'' Johnson told King.
``Get me the ball. Let's move the chains.''
</P>
<P>
   The next few plays could not have been more predictable. Johnson
beat Wilson rather easily _ several times, in fact. But Wilson
should not feel bad. Johnson, over the course of his four-year
career with the Jets, bruised the egos of many cornerbacks. That is
why the Buccaneers reached deep into their wallets _ and their
draft-day goody bag _ to pay Johnson $56 million over the next
eight years. The team traded away two first-round picks to get him.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was an expensive acquisition, but one Tampa Bay needed,
because its passing offense last season _ when the Bucs went to the
National Football Conference championship game _ was ranked next to
last in the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keyshawn gives us some identity on offense,'' said Warren
Sapp, a team leader and one of the best defensive linemen in
football. ``We should put some points on the board.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson did not leave New York quietly. He accused Jets Coach Al
Groh of engineering the trade, and absolved Bill Parcells, the
team's chief of football operations. Johnson recently tossed one
more grenade at Groh when he said in an interview: ``No, I don't
like Al Groh. I did like him. I don't now. The way he handled the
situation. There was a lack of communication on his part and he
displayed poor judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson gives Tampa Bay something the team has not had in years,
maybe ever _ a wideout who blasts off like a rocket every time he
leaves the line of scrimmage and can single-handedly change a game.
With the addition of Johnson, and with awesome talent like Sapp and
the Pro Bowl fullback Mike Alstott, along with one of the best
young coaches in the game in Tony Dungy, the Buccaneers are favored
by many to reach the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   But Tampa Bay did not sign Johnson simply for his talent. The
Buccaneers also liked Johnson's attitude. And when it comes to
attitude, Johnson's mouth runneth over. His brashness and
rambunctious nature make him so very good. Away from the field,
they make him so very quotable. He is the player who soars with the
mouth that roars.
</P>
<P>
   The latter was never more apparent when Johnson sat down for an
interview over the weekend, and the main topic was his former team,
the Jets, a subject that still gets his blood pumping all these
months later. Some of Johnson's comments will certainly rile his
old pals, as he went on at length about:
</P>
<P>
   -- Wayne Chrebet. Their relationship became strained after
Johnson called Chrebet a ``team mascot'' in his book. A Jets player
said that the real rub between the two stemmed from Johnson's
belief that Chrebet receives extensive attention in the news media
because he is white.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not a secret,'' Johnson said. He later added: ``The
better question to ask is: Are there other people who can do what
he does? Yeah. I can get a dozen of them right now, from Jackson
State, from Morgan State, from Grambling, from Southern, from
Howard.'' Johnson used traditionally black colleges as his example.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could really care less if he is black or white,'' Johnson
said. ``The only thing that I have a problem with is when people
try to compare us when there is no comparison.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson also said that another reason for Chrebet's popularity
was his status as a local player from Hofstra University in
Hempstead, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   A Jets spokesman said Sunday that Chrebet was not available for
comment because it was an off-day for the players. When asked
earlier this month what training camp has been like without
Johnson, Chrebet said, ``Quiet.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Bill Parcells. Johnson believes that if Parcells were still
on the sideline, Johnson, too, would be in New York, because
Parcells would have broken the Jets' tradition of not tearing up an
existing contract with more than a year remaining on it for a new
one. Johnson had two more years left on his deal before he was
traded.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Johnson said, the Jets almost gave him a new deal at
the beginning of his third season. Parcells, according to Johnson,
proposed that Johnson give back a certain amount of money and, in
exchange, the Jets would chop two years off his contract, allowing
Johnson to become a free agent more quickly. The league's
management council rejected the proposal. Parcells has declined to
talk specifically about Johnson's contract.
</P>
<P>
   When Bill Belichick replaced Parcells as coach _ albeit for a
brief period _ he, too, was willing to break with Jets' tradition
and work out a new deal, according to Johnson. Belichick proposed
giving Johnson what amounted to a one-year contract worth $5
million, the receiver said, as a temporary solution until a longer
deal could be reached. But Belichick later resigned from the Jets
and headed for New England. Belichick had no comment on Johnson's
remarks.
</P>
<P>
   -- The spying game. Johnson is the first to speak publicly about
something Jets players have whispered about for years. Johnson said
the team installed an elaborate hidden camera system in the locker
room and weight rooms to spy on the players. Johnson said that he
once, jokingly, made an obscene gesture toward a camera he had
located.
</P>
<P>
   A team spokesman said the organization had no comment.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   -- Team focus. Johnson said that some players were too concerned
about things other than winning. ``Some of those guys I just could
not deal with,'' Johnson said, making it clear he was not speaking
of the entire team. ``There were too many guys worried if they had
a commercial.'' Johnson also said a significant number of Jets
players had little interaction off the field.
</P>
<P>
   --Quarterback Ray Lucas. By drafting the rookie Chad Pennington,
the Jets basically signaled the end of the Lucas era. ``If I was
Ray, I would curse out the organization and then play somewhere
else,'' Johnson said, ``because there is no loyalty there.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson maintained that the Jets purposely steered away
potential national news media interviews, as well as lucrative
endorsement deals, as a way to keep his ego in check. Johnson said
that when GQ Magazine once called to schedule an interview, the
team said Johnson was not interested, without first asking Johnson.
A team spokesman said the Jets had no comment.
</P>
<P>
   Jets executives may not be saying much publicly about Johnson,
but clearly they are tired of hearing him reliving the old days. A
team official said he wished Johnson would ``simply be quiet about
us.'' Johnson said a Jets official he declined to identify relayed
a message on behalf of the team to pipe down.
</P>
<P>
   In fairness to Johnson, he is being asked by news media
representatives to talk about the Jets, not vice versa. ``Maybe the
Jets should stop worrying about me,'' Johnson said. ``They have
enough to worry about.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes Johnson's harsh words, which can be both painful and
truthful, overshadow his substance. In many ways, he is an ideal
National Football League player. Johnson is a Pro Bowler, with 31
career touchdowns and more than 4,000 career yards. He owns a
restaurant in Beverly Hills, Calif., his name does not show up on
the police blotter, and his work ethic is renowned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do everything I'm supposed to,'' he said. ``I do not get
into trouble. I work my butt off. That's all I do.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the high-profile nature of the trade, Johnson may
have a bigger national following than ever before. When President
Clinton visited the Buccaneers training camp recently, one of his
first questions to team officials was ``Where's Keyshawn?''
</P>
<P>
   He is easy to find. He's the one catching all the passes _ and
talking about it.

POLLS CAN GIVE FALSE HOPES; JUST ASK MICHAEL DUKAKIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WALTER V. ROBINSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Ten days ago Governor George W. Bush left the
Republican convention with such a boost in national polls that he
might have been tempted to ponder the prospect of victory in
November. On the other hand, Bush might have pondered the fate of
Democrat Michael S. Dukakis.
</P>
<P>
   Two days after his convention Bush held a breathtaking
17-percentage point lead over Vice President Al Gore in a Gallup
poll, and a 15-point edge in a CBS News poll _ statistical
evidence, said some analysts, that Gore faces a steep uphill road
if he is to win in November.
</P>
<P>
   But Dukakis, the former Massachusetts governor, says of such
polls: ``It's all absolute foolishness.'' And he should know:
Dukakis left the Democratic convention in Atlanta in 1988 with a
17-point lead over Bush's father. Dukakis lost that November, and
not by a little.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't be surprised if Al Gore is ahead after the
Democratic convention,'' Dukakis added. ``But that won't be real,
either.''
</P>
<P>
   What seems real to pollsters and political analysts in both
parties is that the general election campaign is likely _ almost
certain, some say _ to be extremely tight. Right now, most voters
are paying little attention, said Democratic poll taker Mark
Mellman, much like magazine readers who flip right past the color
ads for new automobiles in August and start to look closely only
when it comes time to shop for a car in October.
</P>
<P>
   For now, what pollsters are measuring are the fickle preferences
of a largely disengaged electorate, who are asked to make a choice
before many of them are ready to, and with swings in allegiance
traced to which candidate commands the stage at the moment.
</P>
<P>
   Before the GOP convention in Philadelphia began on July 31, Bush
held a slim lead in most polls, in some cases within the margin of
error. But almost two weeks of media attention on his vice
presidential selection and convention gave Bush a substantial boost
in many polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each side gets to tell its story uninterrupted, and now it's
Al Gore's turn,'' said William A. Carrick, a Democratic political
consultant in California.
</P>
<P>
   Both Bush and Gore, Carrick said in an interview, ``start with
the support of polarized political coalitions. But there are a lot
of people in the middle without strong ideology who share positions
offered by both sides.'' It is these voters, Carrick said, who
swing back and forth. Many women voters, he said, liked what Bush
had to say about values. But this week, some of those same voters
are likely to be swayed by Democratic arguments about gun violence
and education, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to such swing voters, the polling tide has already begun
to turn: For the last week, Gore has preempted the political stage
with his selection of Senator Joseph I. Lieberman as his running
mate. Over the weekend, CBS News, ABC News, and Newsweek all
released new polls showing that Bush's lead had slipped back to
about 10 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Ari Fleischer, the Bush campaign spokesman, said Sunday that the
governor of Texas expects the race to be ``about dead even'' by
Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
   By Fleischer's reckoning, about 70 percent of voters are ``done
and committed,'' leaving 30 percent up for grabs once voters start
to play closer attention in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   If Gore's prospects seem to be brightening, some of the
underlying numbers in the latest round of polls are more worrisome
for him than what Dukakis and others describe as the relatively
meaningless horserace figures.
</P>
<P>
   In the Newsweek poll, for example, Bush leads Gore, 48 percent
to 38 percent, in the head-to-head matchup. (Minor party candidates
Ralph Nader and Pat Buchanan each drew 3 percent of the tally.) But
when voters were asked about the qualities they look for in a
president, Bush was seen as having stronger leadership qualities
and being more ethical and honest. Gore was seen as slightly more
intelligent and well informed.
</P>
<P>
   If voters are mercurial in August, it's no wonder. Poll takers
are asking them for whom they would vote for if the election were
being held now. When voters are simply asked, as they seldom are,
for whom they plan to vote for in November, the percentage of
undecided voters inevitably soars.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, polling that is done on Election Day as voters leave the
polls consistently finds substantial numbers of voters who say they
did make up their minds until Election Day neared. In 1996, even
though the choices _ Clinton and Sen. Bob Dole, two shopworn
commodities _ were well-known, 30 percent of voters said they made
up their minds in the month before the election. Eleven percent _
more than one voter in every 10 _ settled on their choice in the
three days before the election.
</P>
<P>
   If history repeats itself, Democrats hope, Bush's lead will
evaporate just as Dukakis' did in 1988. But Fleischer, the Bush
spokesman, counters that with a little history of his own: Only
once since 1952 has the candidate who trailed on labor day won the
election, according to Gallup polls. The exception: Ronald Reagan
in 1980, who narrowly trailed President Carter on Labor Day.

BUSH DEFENDS CHENEY'S $20 MILLION RETIREMENT PACKAGE AS STANDARD
PRACTICE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Texas)   By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Gov. George W. Bush over the weekend defended the
generous retirement package that his running mate, Dick Cheney,
received from his former employer as a standard practice for a
company executive.
</P>
<P>
   But senior Democrats on Sunday derided Bush, the Republican
presidential nominee, for standing behind the settlement when the
Republican-led Congress has resisted increasing the minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   After accepting Bush's offer to join him as the
vice-presidential candidate, Cheney resigned as chairman and chief
executive of the Halliburton Co., a Dallas-based energy services
company. Halliburton awarded him a financial settlement worth an
estimated $20 million after five years of service during which he
received about $12.5 million in pay and stock options now worth $39
million.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with The Los Angeles Times that was published
Sunday, Bush said he was aware that Cheney would receive a
retirement package, as any successful chief executive would. Bush
said: ``I think what you ought to do is ask, `Does the board of
directors know what they are doing? Are they expert? And let the
experts make the decision as to what's fair.'''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Lehane, a spokesman for Vice President Al Gore, said the
size of the retirement package and Bush's approval reflects the
close relationship between the Republican Party and big business
that working families might find troublesome.
</P>
<P>
   Dirk Vande Beek, communications director for Cheney, said
critics were making too much of the matter, ``especially when no
one complained about the $200 million compensation package Bob
Rubin got after leaving Goldman-Sachs.''
</P>
<P>
   Juleanna Glover, press secretary for Cheney, said Halliburton
planned to disclose details of the retirement package on Wednesday.
Details of the package Robert E. Rubin received after leaving the
firm he headed to become chairman of President Clinton's National
Economic Council in 1992 could not be independently confirmed.

CONVENING DEMOCRATS TO PRESS `ISSUES, NOT IMAGES' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN AND SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Hoping to boost Vice President Al Gore's chances
of winning the White House in November, Democrats convene to bid
goodbye to President Clinton and to make the case for his
understudy.
</P>
<P>
   It marks the first time the Democratic party has held a
convention in Los Angeles since 1960, when the party nominee was
John F. Kennedy and the talk was of the politics of the ``New
Frontier.''
</P>
<P>
   The weeks's events, organizers say, will focus not so much on
new frontiers but on the familiar, core issues the party believes
will bolster Gore's campaign in the fall election. Among them are
prescription drug coverage for senior citizens, Medicare, Social
Security and the right of patients to sue their health insurance
plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our convention, unlike the other party's, will be driven by
issues and not images,'' said Tad Devine, a senior strategist to
the Gore campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The message for voters, Devine said, is how far the nation has
travelled over the last eight years and how much is at stake come
November. ``If we make the wrong choice and go down the wrong road,
this nation will suffer,'' Devine said.
</P>
<P>
   As Texas Governor George W. Bush retired to his ranch for a
week's vacation, the Republican nominee's campaign said it was
ready for the Democratic onslaught.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to try to claim credit for our nation's
prosperity and cast blame for those things they didn't get done,''
said Dan Bartlett, a Bush spokesman. ``Governor Bush believes you
had your chance, you didn't lead, we will.''
</P>
<P>
   At the convention, delegates will formally nominate Gore on
Wednesday, and vote to ratify the nomination on Thursday, just
prior to Gore's acceptance speech. Gore's running mate, Connecticut
Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, will address the convention Wednesday,
but will not be formally nominated or voted upon until the next
night.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, however, the spotlight will be on Clinton, the man
who has occupied the Oval Office for the last eight years and hopes
to see his partner in public policy assume the mantle of
commander-in-chief.
</P>
<P>
   Since he arrived here Friday for a round of fund-raising and
golf, Clinton has been giving periodic previews of his speech. For
example, at a star-studded tribute to the president that raised
money for his wife, Hillary, he told the crowd why they should
support Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``He understands how to keep this magical prosperity going and
how to spread it to the people that, I regret to say, are still
left behind,'' Clinton told Cher, Diana Ross and a plethora of
A-list celebrities Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want somebody in the White House that understands the
future, because it's really unfolding fast,'' he said. Added
Clinton: ``The best is still out there, and the problems are still
out there, and the challenges are still out there.''
</P>
<P>
   And Sunday, Clinton attended a brunch hosted by Barbra Streisand
that raised $10 million for his presidential library. It couldn't
be determined if he continued his pitch for Gore, as only the
high-rolling donors behind closed doors could hear what he said.
</P>
<P>
   Amid intense speculation that Clinton's presence could be a
distraction from Gorea at a crucial time for his candidacy, the
vice president assured the Ohio News Network in Cleveland Sunday
that everything would work out fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``The convention will be an opportunity for me to introduce
myself for who I am, not as a vice president who stands on stage
without saying too much,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's going to be a lot of surprises at the convention,'' he
said. ``We're going to concentrate on substance instead of the
balloons and the confetti.''
</P>
<P>
   As he accepts his party's nomination, Gore said, he will talk
about a middle-class tax cut and Social Security. Aides say he will
also pledge to continue his town-hall meetings with voters across
the country if elected.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show Bush with an edge over Gore at the start of the
convention. But campaign chairman William Daley said he hopes Gore
will draw even by the end of a week of intense media focus.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a year and a half of relentless campaigning by Gore,
Daley said voters are only beginning to take in the election
activity. ``Most people don't pay attention to this stuff,'' Daley
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore has to convey to the American people that as the next
president of the United States, his history qualifies him to be
that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pointing to history, Daley noted that former Vice President
George Bush was in a quandary similar to Gore's in 1988 despite
serving under President Reagan for two terms. ``Most people didn't
know who George Bush was,'' he said. ``He had to introduce himself
in '88 and talk about his history in the war, his heroism, and what
he did in all those offices.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic officials have mocked Gov. Bush's Republican
convention in Philadelphia where blacks, Latinos and women filled
the stage, even as the party advocated policies which Democrats
hold to be at odds with the needs of those groups.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Democratic organizers will make heavy use of
imagery, too. Their roster of speakers include members of almost
every Democratic interest group, from the National Education
Association to the AFL-CIO to National Abortion and Reproductive
Rights Action League. But Devine said the difference is that the
speakers are linked to Gore and Lieberman's plans to fight for
working families.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning in Cleveland Sunday, Gore hosted a policy-heavy
group chat about children's health care, taking pains not to
criticize his opponent, for his record on health care for children
in his home state of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Gore didn't need to bring up the issue. He had actor-director
Rob Reiner on hand, and Reiner blasted Bush for failing to insure
all eligible children and for presenting the Republican party as
wide-open to diversity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to get this off my chest,'' Reiner told parents,
health care workers and ill children at the Rainbow Babies and
Children's Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other side talks about being the party of diversity and
the party of inclusion. How do they figure this, unless they define
diversity as two guys at the head of the ticket who are from
different oil companies?''
</P>
<P>
   Reiner was referring to the fact that both Bush and his
running-mate, Dick Cheney, worked for energy companies. Cheney, the
New York Times reported Saturday, received a $20 million retirement
package from his Wyoming company when he resigned to run for vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president outlined his plan to expand the Childrens
Health Insurance Program (CHIP), which pays for health care for
children in poor families. Two million children are insured under
CHIP currently. Gore's proposal, at an estimated cost of $42
billion over ten years, would make another 1 million children
eligible for assistance. There are now 11 million uninsured
children in America, and some of them are already eligible for
CHIP, but states are not reaching out to them, Gore aides said.
</P>
<P>
   States have a great deal of latitude in administering the
program, and some states maker it harder for families to get the
help, Gore said. The states must pay for part of the program.
</P>
<P>
   Texas has enrolled more than 12 percent of eligible children in
the CHIP program, said Bartlett of the Bush campaign. The state got
a late start, since its legislature meets only every other year.
The federal CHIP legislation passed in summer 1997; the Texas
legislature couldn't address it until January of 1999, he said.

   LOS ANGELES _ In shrink talk, it's called ``anticipatory
anxiety.''
</P>
<P>
   And according to Dr. Robert R. Butterworth, it's natural that
everyone around here feel this as the demonic Democratic National
Convention begins today in and around Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``With widespread reports of anarchists coming to disrupt the
convention and memories still fresh from the past Lakers
celebrations that turned into a mini-riot, it's no wonder that
people are leaving town, downtown shops are boarding up windows,
army surplus stores report sales of gas masks . . . people are
jumpy,'' the L.A.-based media savvy doc said in a press release
just in case anyone cared about his opinions.
</P>
<P>
   So just how do you equate an Al Gore coronation to a Shaq and
Kobe victory dance?
</P>
<P>
   It's not as if thousands of desperate political nuts are gonna
be partying outside Staples, watching the big video screen as Gore
accepts the nomination _ hey, what happened to Bill Bradley? _ and
then start torchin' police cars.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters? They're harmless. An L.A. form of protest is the
Doo-Dah Parade.
</P>
<P>
   True, with Jerry West gone, Lakers fans have every right to feel
``anticipatory anxiety.'' But as for the rest of the city, try
calling it anticipatory apathy. . . .

   LOS ANGELES _ On the eve of the Democratic National Convention,
activists gathered at their MacArthur Park headquarters _ nicknamed
the Convergence Center _ for lessons on how to cope with tear gas
and pepper spray and how to behave when confronted by police.
</P>
<P>
   Their printed schedule for the week includes marches to protest
police brutality and sweatshop conditions, as well as a beach party
to protest what's essentially another beach party.
</P>
<P>
   There's a legal team, on-site medical services and a makeshift
kitchen to feed hungry volunteers. There's even a ``Bike Library''
where people can borrow _ what else? _ bikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are firmly committed to non-violence,'' Brian Montes said
Sunday morning, clutching a 24-page booklet entitled ``Direct
Action at the DNC.'' ``Direct action means music and dance and
poetry, and other creative actions to get our ideas out.''
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, some 2,000 activists launched the first major
protest of the convention, gathering at a downtown square to speak
out against the death penalty and police brutality and in support
of Mumia Abu-Jamal, on death row for killing a Philadelphia police
officer.
</P>
<P>
   At Pershing Square, some activists distributed leaflets for
protests scheduled later in the week while others waved picket
signs opposing the death penalty. One sign read, ``Not one more
lynching'' and was emblazoned with a picture of Abu-Jamal, who was
convicted of killing an officer in 1981. Supporters contend he was
framed by racist police.
</P>
<P>
   By supporting the death penalty, Al Gore and George W. Bush have
continued to ``march the retarded, the young and quite possibly the
innocent to their deaths,'' actor and activist Ed Asner told the
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Convergence Center is Ground Zero for the latest round in what
has been the real Y2K surprise: The re-emergence and refinement of
street demonstrations during major political and governmental
gatherings. Starting with the frequently violent protests in
Seattle during the World Trade Organization meetings and continuing
through the two major parties' conventions this summer, plenty of
people have turned out to challenge the notion that these are the
best of times.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Clinton-Gore administration has been selling out the
environment as much as the Bush administration before them,'' said
Andy Paik, 35, who'd come down from Seattle to stay in the
apartment of someone he'd met at a World Bank protest in Washington
and was pinning letters on a large felt banner protesting the
cutting of ancient forests.
</P>
<P>
   Directly behind Paik, large puppets depicting everyone from
vice-president Al Gore to the ``Indonesian Military'' were propped
against a wall. Outside, a police helicopter circled noisily over
MacArthur Park, where some 30 activists practiced waving their
puppets or banners (``Books in the `Hood'' read one) for an
upcoming rally.
</P>
<P>
   Planning for the Convergence Center began several months ago as
a way to organize disparate groups of activists during the
convention and advise them on everything from non-violent protest
tactics to whom to call in cases of arrest or how to support
suspected police misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   A poster inside the center lists the umbrella group's
``demands'' of the U.S. government (amnesty for undocumented
immigrants, an end to ``the racist death penalty,'' etc.), while
the booklet includes a set of participant guidelines (no violence,
weapons or drugs) and a schedule of events (like Sunday night's
beach party outside the Democrats' high-priced fund-raiser on Santa
Monica Pier.)
</P>
<P>
   Yet as the helicopter and handful of police at the nearby subway
stop attest, the center has also become a focus of authorities
hoping to stem trouble before it starts outside the convention. On
Friday, all the protesters won a victory when a federal judge
issued a temporary restraining order preventing police from seizing
materials that protesters use to characterize politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Like puppets. Goofy as it may seem, police raided a so-called
``puppet factory'' in Philadelphia during the Republican
Convention. Here, the tension level is high enough that puppets and
caches of paint have been stashed around the city, one organizer
said Sunday in MacArthur Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``So if our space gets raided,'' said David Solmit, a
36-year-old carpenter who says he'll be doing ``puppet first aid''
during marches and rallies, ``we still have puppets.''
</P>
<P>
   Why puppets, you ask? For poetic reasons _ ``It's much more
clear what we're doing when you SEE Al Gore represented as a
corporate puppet,'' Montes explained _ and for pragmatic ones. TV
loves filming protesters waving big, colorful puppets, several
organizers said.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, with many of the 15,000 accredited media having arrived
here this past weekend, well in advance of Monday's convention
kickoff, the feel downtown has been of a party waiting to happen.
Close to the Staples Center, the convention site, an Italian
restaurant got lots of attention for a blackboard of specials that
included convention T-shirts and buttons served along with one's
plate of spaghetti or lasagna. Meanwhile, Los Angeles newspaper
reporters took to interviewing out-of-town reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Things didn't get much better at Saturday night's official media
party, held at L.A.'s Department of Water and Power Plaza (at a
cost of $1.5 million), and which seemed to feature as many
delegates and other convention types as anyone. If the best-known
faces were onstage, where Patti LaBelle performed, it may have been
because the Los Angeles Times was having its own party for media
bigwigs and stars who have played journalists in movies or on TV
(Albert Brooks of ``Broadcast News,'' for example).
</P>
<P>
   But that's nothing. Sunday night's big party was to be thrown by
the cast of television's ``The West Wing.'' How exclusive was it?
Even the National Journal, which finds out everything going on here
for its ``Convention Daily'' newspaper, couldn't find out what time
it was supposed to start.

   LOS ANGELES _ More than 3,500 protesters, ranging from gay
rights to animal rights activists, marched through Los Angeles
Sunday, the eve of the Democratic National Convention, demanding
the end of capital punishment and a new trial for a death row
inmate, the convicted murderer Mumia Abu-Jamal.
</P>
<P>
   After two hours of music, poetry and speeches at a rally
downtown condemning the death penalty and ``corporate greed,'' the
demonstrators marched for about a mile under a blazing sun along
downtown streets, lined with police officers guarding stores and
office buildings, to the heavily guarded Staples Center, the site
of the convention and the home of the city's basketball and hockey
teams. Once at the Staples Center, there was more music, poetry and
speeches.
</P>
<P>
   Abu-Jamal, a former radio journalist, has been on Pennsylvania's
death row since his 1982 conviction for killing a Philadelphia
police officer. Jamal's supporters around the world say he deserves
a new trial. His detractors say he is a ``cold-blooded cop
killer,'' who turned a young bride into a widow.
</P>
<P>
   His case has become an international cause, and for many
protesters he has become the face of death row.
</P>
<P>
   The rally at the downtown square took on aspects of a festival
and a funeral. Speaker after speaker reminded the crowd that time
was running out for Abu-Jamal.
</P>
<P>
   The actor Ed Asner, a longtime foe of capital punishment, said:
``We must fight the establishment, and we must fight the press.
This fight is for the nation's soul. Mumia must not die.''
</P>
<P>
   Scores of police officers quietly stood by on the edge of the
square named in honor of the World War I general, John J.
``Blackjack'' Pershing. Dozens of officers on motorcycles were
stationed on nearby streets, and Joe R. Hicks, executive director
of the city's Human Relations Commission, and his staff wandered
through the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Pam Africa, a leader of the effort to win Abu-Jamal a new trial,
came to Los Angeles from Philadelphia, where she also organized a
similar demonstration in that city during the Republican
convention. ``We're here to educate people,'' she said. ``A lot of
people just vote blindly. We want people to know that when it comes
to capital punishment, there is no difference between the Democrats
and the Republicans. They're both killers.''

   Holyfield feat more like Hollywood farce
</P>
<P>
   By JOHN P. LOPEZ
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   There were days when a heavyweight fight meant something, when a
nation collectively stood up and gasped with anticipation and awe
at the spectacle of it all.
</P>
<P>
   Many of us remember those days, because they weren't so long
ago. Maybe we sat on lawn chairs on the front porch with our dads,
a freshly popped bag of popcorn between us, nervously staring at
the radio as voices from Zaire gave us unforgettable blow-by-blow
accounts of the Muhammad Ali-George Foreman ``Rumble in the
Jungle.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe we staked out seats at a nearby theater for closed-circuit
broadcasts of Ali-Leon Spinks, marveling at the larger-than-life
figures before us when the great one took an unprecedented third
world title.
</P>
<P>
   They were special moments in sports. They were exciting,
thrilling days when heavyweights were kings. But they're gone now,
and probably, they're gone forever.
</P>
<P>
   Most of us couldn't have cared less Saturday night when Evander
Holyfield topped Ali's record of winning the heavyweight crown on
three separate occasions by winning a fourth crown _ the WBA's
version of this alphabet-soup mess. Holyfield decisioned someone
named John Ruiz, but the fight was sluggish, lightly attended,
hardly sold on pay-per-view, and, typical for this era of boxing,
the decision was a joke.
</P>
<P>
   One judge scored Holyfield the winner 116-112, which might have
been the right score, but only if Ruiz had been ruled the winner.
</P>
<P>
   Was anyone surprised? Did anyone care?
</P>
<P>
   This is a sport that has given us maybe the greatest athlete and
most captivating sports personality of the 20th century in Ali.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent years the heavyweight division has dwindled badly
through a series of controversial decisions, overrated fighters,
bitten ears, threats to eat someone else's children, contrived
contenders, shady promoters, out-of-shape fighters, cable networks
(HBO, Showtime) shamelessly one-sided toward fighters in their
stable, over-the-hill names from the past, and daughters of the
kings _ Joe Frazier, Foreman and Ali _ staging glorified scuffles.
</P>
<P>
   The saddest part is that the fighters, those great figures of
bygone days, have been replaced by mere puppets for promoters like
Don King and Bob Arum. Holyfield included.
</P>
<P>
   The only reason Holyfield ``earned'' Saturday's WBA shot was
because King manipulated the Holyfield-Lennox Lewis contract of
last November to include Ruiz _ surprise, surprise, he's a King
fighter _ as a mandatory opponent for the Holyfield-Lewis winner.
</P>
<P>
   When Lewis, an Arum fighter, won the decision, he promptly
refused to fight Ruiz and ultimately was stripped of the WBA crown.
Holyfield, another King man, stepped in, and King ranted as only he
can about the beauty of Holyfield's earning another shot at the
crown.
</P>
<P>
   But it was a farce, much like the entire division and much of
the sport has become. The window into boxing's crumbling world
never became more clear than in Saturday's undercard, which was
supposed to feature hard-hitting welterweight James Page against a
quality contender.
</P>
<P>
   But when Page signed with rap music mogul James Prince, King
became so outraged he scratched other big names and forced Page to
fight the virtually unknown Andrew ``Six Heads'' Lewis. Don't ask.
</P>
<P>
   Everything legitimate about the sport is gone. When the public
showed an enormous amount of sense by not buying into the Holyfield
hype, King spent the majority of the final week before fight night
pumping Christy ``The Coal Miner's Daughter'' Martin, who also was
featured on the undercard.
</P>
<P>
   That didn't sell, either.
</P>
<P>
   Where once there was Frazier, Foreman, Ali captivating the
masses, now there are people known as ``Butterbean'' drawing only
casual interest.
</P>
<P>
   The championships are splintered, the contenders are either
has-beens or never-will-bes, and the rankings and matches are
manipulated by promoters.
</P>
<P>
   Quick, name just two of the WBC's top-10 heavyweight contenders
outside of Holyfield and Mike Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   Did you forget Kirk Johnson, Wladimir Klitschko, Oleg Maskaeve
and Henry Akinwande? No one can blame you.
</P>
<P>
   The heavyweight division has become a pathetic charade. It's
sad, and there are only two ways the sport will become legitimate
again.
</P>
<P>
   As much trouble as players associations can cause in team
sports, boxing needs some sort of athletes' organization that could
sort through the farce and demand honest matches and true
champions. It won't happen as long as the likes of King and Arum
run the show.
</P>
<P>
   The other chance at getting back the sport is ours. Don't buy
into the farce.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday night, few fight fans did. Maybe there's still hope.
</P>
<P>
   $$$

LESSONS FROM REAGAN FOR CLINTON IN PASSING THE TORCH 
</HEADLINE>
  By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When you watch President Clinton at the Democratic
convention, it may look like he is stealing President Ronald
Reagan's script from 1988. As Reagan did then, Clinton plans to
officially bless his No. 2 on Monday evening. And as Reagan did
then, Clinton is expected to implore Americans to build on the
triumphs of the current administration.
</P>
<P>
   As was the case 12 years ago, members of the party faithful are
a bit edgy about their ticket and grouse that their new standard
bearer is not nearly as dynamic as the man he wants to replace.
While Reagan savored a 54 percent job approval rating in the New
York Times/CBS News Poll on the eve of his party's convention in
1988 _ impressive for a lame duck _ Clinton's stands even higher at
61 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all the apparent similarities, the two presidents could
not have handled their valedictory appearances any differently.
While Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton have been roundly accused of
hogging the spotlight from his vice president, Reagan drew plaudits
for how he choreographed the passing of power in his party.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton popped up in Los Angeles on Friday for
fund-raising events and appearances that drowned out the attention
_ and complicated fund-raising _ for Al Gore, Reagan did not arrive
in New Orleans until the Sunday before the convention eight years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Reagan pulled off what was widely described as a sentimental,
nostalgic and certainly graceful journey. He was greeted at a rally
in New Orleans to shouts of ``Four More Years! Four More Years!''
Delegates wiped tears from their eyes as the president at the
convention hailed the party for lighting ``a prairie fire'' that he
said transformed the nation. He promised never to bid a final
goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the gossip among delegates, lobbyists and
hangers-on here was whether Clinton would  &UR; ever  &LR; _ or even should _
say goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   Even as they acknowledge that Clinton is dominating the ramp up
to the convention, many delegates sounded wistful about his leaving
the White House. Some said they did not view Gore as alluring a
leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all know that if there were not term limits, Bill Clinton
would be running for president again,'' said Martha Aasen, a
delegate from Westport, Conn. ``Gore doesn't turn me on. He's
different. He's sincere. He knows the issues, but he's different.''
</P>
<P>
   She was glad, she said, that Gore was not speaking until three
days after Clinton, so there would not be back-to-back comparisons.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Short, a delegate from Detroit, took issue with those who
are eager for Clinton to leave. ``He's still the president and has
every right to be here,'' he said. ``He raises a lot of money that
other Democrats are certainly willing to take. Let's not beat the
guy up for his mistakes in the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   The difference, of course, between the Clinton and Reagan models
is that while Vice President George Bush tried to distance himself
from Reagan on the Iran-Contra case, he did not have to worry about
being connected to anything approaching the embarrassment of
Clinton's personal scandals. So Gore is faced with the far more
confounding task of trying to take credit for the booming economy
encouraged by the current administration but not wanting to be
linked to the baggage.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Andrew, the Democratic national chairman, said the party
studied Reagan's approach in 1988 but decided that Clinton had a
different place in his party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people would see the transfer in 1988 as being
successful; it was gracefully done,'' Andrew said. ``But there was
a very different goal. They wanted George Bush to be Ronald
Reagan.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked then if the Democratic Party did not want Al Gore to be
Bill Clinton, he demurred, saying, ``We want Al Gore to simply be
Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   It is especially striking that Clinton has been ridiculed for
pulling attention from Gore given that he has been much more
aggressive in helping his vice president than was Reagan. In fact,
Reagan's endorsement of Bush was so feeble _ almost like an
afterthought _ that he had to clarify his comments the next day.
</P>
<P>
   Robert M. Teeter, who was a top strategist for Bush, said
Clinton's transgressions are a horrible burden for the vice
president. ``We had the challenge of Bush having to establish
himself in his own right,'' he said. ``In Gore's case, it's a very
difficult strategy because the economy's in pretty good shape but
people want a change. There's real tension.''
</P>
<P>
   David Leland, the chairman of the Ohio Democratic Party, said he
understands the political need for Clinton to depart on Tuesday to
leave the stage for Gore. That doesn't mean he is happy about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in the same hotel as Bill Clinton and I'd love to have him
stay around,'' Leland said. ``We can go out and shoot pool, go have
steaks. Whatever.''

FORD SAYS FIRESTONE KNEW OF FLAW IN TIRES BY 1997 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill.)   (12:01 a.m. ET EMBARGO for electronic media.)  
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Ford Motor Co. released documents Sunday showing that
in 1997 Bridgestone/Firestone Inc. began receiving numerous
complaints of injuries and property damage involving certain
Firestone tires that were not recalled until last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the recalled tires have rates of injury and personal
damage claims up to 100 times greater than those for tires not
recalled, Ford disclosed Sunday. Many of those claims were sent to
Bridgestone by vehicle owners from 1997 to 1999, but the tire maker
did not tell Ford, whose new automobiles, particularly Ford
Explorer sport utility vehicles, are equipped with two-thirds of
the recalled tires.
</P>
<P>
   The automaker said it learned of the high rate of claims only a
week ago, when it performed its own computer analysis of
Bridgestone's data. Bridgestone had resisted Ford's disclosure of
the information, said a person briefed on the automaker's work on
the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Ford said that Bridgestone's factory in Decatur, Ill., had been
the main source of the problem tires, and that the factory had
experienced its biggest quality problems from 1994 to 1996. Those
were the years when the factory was operated mainly by replacement
workers because of a labor dispute between Bridgestone and its
union, although Ford made no mention of that fact Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Bridgestone officials did not dispute Ford's data but said that
the problem had not caught their attention until Ford began
reviewing Bridgestone's files two weeks ago. The overall rate of
complaints on tires from all Bridgestone factories had not been
unusually high, and Bridgestone did not conduct the detailed review
of tire quality by factory that Ford undertook, said Bob Wyant,
Bridgestone's vice president of quality assurance.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Karbowiak, a Bridgestone spokeswoman, said that there was
no evidence that the labor dispute had affected quality in Decatur.
She was also quick to point out during a conference call with
reporters Sunday afternoon that Ford itself had given the Decatur
factory a quality award.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies' mutual sniping was the clearest sign yet of
strain in one of corporate America's oldest relationships.
Firestone, which was bought by Bridgestone in 1988, has been
supplying tires to Ford since 1906, when Henry Ford was still
designing the first Model T.
</P>
<P>
   Ford and Bridgestone had presented a mostly united front since
last Wednesday's recall of 6.5 million Firestone tires, which in
addition to being sold on new Ford vehicles were sold as
replacement tires for several manufacturers' sport utility vehicles
and pickup trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Ford dealers have been flooded with customers seeking
replacement tires, including replacements for Firestone tires not
covered by the recall, while buyers have been leery of buying new
Ford Explorers equipped with Firestone tires.
</P>
<P>
   Ford released the data Sunday partly in the hope of reassuring
customers that Firestone tires not covered by the recall were safe,
notably Wilderness AT tires made at factories other than the one in
Decatur. But the data is unlikely to appease plaintiff lawyers and
safety groups, who scheduled a press conference for Monday in
Washington to call for Bridgestone to expand the recall to include
far more Wilderness brand tires.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Hoar, the founder of Safetyforum.com, a consulting firm
that is coordinating many of the lawsuits against Bridgestone and
Ford, said Ford was trying to put all the blame on Bridgestone to
draw attention from what he described as design defects in the Ford
Explorer's suspension that put strain on the tires. Ford officials
have repeatedly denied this.
</P>
<P>
   The automaker has recalled Explorers in four foreign countries,
equipped with a larger size of Wilderness tires than those recalled
in the United States. Ford said the overseas recall reflected
driving conditions seldom found in the United States, so a broader
recall was unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   People who have been briefed on Ford's work on the tire problem
said the automaker had been deeply disturbed to learn two weeks ago
that Bridgestone had done little work to analyze the reliability of
its tires in the United States despite growing complaints and a
federal investigation that began in May.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Vines, a Ford spokesman, took pains on Sunday to mention
that Ford had used very sophisticated programs and equipment to
analyze the Bridgestone data, including a Cray supercomputer. But
another person briefed on Ford's work said that the company's
analysis was ``not rocket science'' and represented standard
practice for automakers that try to identify quality problems.
</P>
<P>
   Ford faxed a 12-page summary of the data to reporters Sunday
afternoon and then held a conference call during which its
officials discussed the material. Ford initially scheduled the call
only for its own executives, but Karbowiak and Wyant decided to
participate as well. They were mostly silent as Vines explained how
Ford had asked for and received Firestone's data on injury and
property damage claims, and quickly discovered problems.
</P>
<P>
   Vines said Ford officials obtained the data on July 28 and spent
eight days entering it into Ford's computers. Within several days,
Ford had concluded that there was a problem with all Firestone ATX
and ATX II tires of the P235/75R15 size, and with Firestone
Wilderness AT tires of the same size that were produced in Decatur
only. Firestone and Ford then decided on a recall.
</P>
<P>
   The federal investigation that began in May includes 300
complaints about Firestone tires, involving 46 deaths.
</P>
<P>
   The Ford data released Sunday showed that there had been just
one to six tread-separation claims per million Wilderness AT tires
from factories other than Decatur. Wilderness tires from other
factories are being used to replace the Decatur-made Wilderness
tires that are being recalled and various ATX tires being recalled.
</P>
<P>
   For Wilderness AT tires from Decatur, the rate of injury and
property damage claims was more than 50 per million tires produced
in 1996 and close to that level for tires produced in 1997. While
there have been few claims for Decatur-made Wilderness tires
produced since 1998, these have not been on the road long enough
for many claims to have been received, Vines said.
</P>
<P>
   The claims rate was far higher for ATX tires, all of which are
being recalled in the P235/75R15 size regardless of where they were
produced. For factories other than the Decatur plant, the rate
approached 100 claims per million tires for tires produced from
1993 to 1995.
</P>
<P>
   At the Decatur plant itself, the claims rate soared to between
350 and 650 claims per million ATX tires produced in 1994, 1995 and
1996.

<P>
   Thomas F. Dasse, a Phoenix lawyer handling several lawsuits
against Bridgestone, said in an interview on Friday that his
litigation depended partly on testimony from former Bridgestone
employees who had worked at the Decatur factory until 1996 and who
had described quality problems there.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Post reported Sunday that some of the lawsuits
against Bridgestone included testimony from former workers in
Decatur who described manually piercing blisters in the rubber of
flawed tires and sending them to a warehouse for sale, instead of
scrapping them.
</P>
<P>
   Karbowiak described these comments as the views of ``disgruntled
workers,'' and said that Bridgestone disagreed with them. She said
Bridgestone believed that all of the replacement workers had
performed their jobs as well as the union workers had before them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We strongly believe there is no connection based on what we
know of our training and operating procedures,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Decatur factory makes tires of various sizes for other
automakers, and Ford has not analyzed the claims rates for these
tires. Wyant said that Bridgestone did not believe these tires had
problems.
</P>
<P>
   The United Steelworkers of America went on strike against
Bridgestone in Decatur in July 1994. After 10 months, the union
ordered its workers to return to their jobs without a contract, but
the company only hired them when job openings occurred, while
continuing to operate the factory with replacement workers.
</P>
<P>
   The company and the union did not reach an agreement until
November 1996, when the remaining union workers went back to their
jobs with the exception of those who had committed acts during the
strike that the company deemed unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   The claims rate for Wilderness tires made in Decatur began to
fall in 1997 and it is now virtually equal to the claims rate for
Wilderness tires made elsewhere, Ford's Vines said. But Bridgestone
is recalling all Wilderness tires made in Decatur since 1996 as a
precaution.

AFTER REFORM PARTY RUCKUS, STILL NO WINNER IN SIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
  LONG BEACH, Calif. _ As the presidential nominees of the two
Reform Parties left Splitsville to campaign across the rest of the
country by bus, their associates began plotting legal strategies to
seize the $12.6 million in federal campaign money that is awaiting
the real party's true nominee _ as soon as a court decides what and
who they are.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The nominees' departures ended an intense week of bickering here
that left the Reform Party with two of everything, including
nominees claiming to be its presidential candidate: Pat Buchanan
and John Hagelin.
</P>
<P>
   The war, however, continues. It is not only before the campaign
money dispensers at the Federal Election Commission, and later the
courts, that the two sides have to argue their case. In as many as
half the states, the Reform Party is listed on the presidential
ballot by party, which means each side has to convince individual
state election commissions that its candidate is the legitimate
one.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is so much more to play out,'' said Russell J. Verney, a
leading party official who aligned himself with Hagelin after the
split. ``As much chaos as we've had nationally, now we're going to
have it at the state level.''
</P>
<P>
   But if the primary vote that both sides threw out as fraudulent
was any indication, it hardly matters what Buchanan or Hagelin
does, where they go or what they say.
</P>
<P>
   Together, the two men energized all of 78,000 Americans to cast
a vote during a month-long balloting period, a sign that as the
presidential election approaches, voters are not so uncomfortable
with the Republican and Democratic choices that they feel a need
for someone else altogether.
</P>
<P>
   In a political version of ``To Tell the Truth,'' lawyers for
each side are facing the rather daunting prospect of trying to make
sense of the last five days here.
</P>
<P>
   Not that either side views any of this as a life-or-death
struggle. Both candidates have vowed to press ahead through
November, no matter what happens in any legal or administrative
arena. If so, one side would likely have to assume a new party name
or affiliation.
</P>
<P>
   In that context, each candidate still has an edge. As a
self-described red-meat conservative and a fixture in American
politics for almost three decades, Buchanan has achieved something
of cult status as an ideologue who pushes all the right
isolationist, xenophobic and homophobic buttons for his new band of
supporters.
</P>
<P>
   And the more that the major party candidates, Vice President Al
Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, fight for the political
center, the more appeal Buchanan has to hard-right conservatives
left behind.
</P>
<P>
   Hagelin's edge may be that as a longtime leader of the Natural
Law Party, he has something of a reputation among fringe parties.
Aides said he would like to create a broad coalition of third
parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will continue,'' Hagelin said in his acceptance speech on
Saturday. ``Under what banner, I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates have enough money on hand for modest campaign
efforts, their aides said.
</P>
<P>
   Bay Buchanan, chief strategist for her brother, said he has
enough money now, between $1 million and $2 million, and expects to
raise enough through donations to keep him on the road four or five
days a week from Labor Day through the election.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can run the whole campaign on what we have now, but without
any media,'' she said, referring to radio and television
commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Roth, a spokesman for Hagelin, said he could do the same,
with the $2 million the Hagelin campaign currently has.

<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ It was the Al and Rob show, an unlikely new comedy
duo now making occasional appearances on the campaign trail to the
White House. Starring Vice President Al Gore, a politician with a
famously wooden public demeanor, and Rob Reiner, the actor and
director known for sly satire, the team came to the Rainbow Babies
and Children's Hospital here to talk about the serious subject of
children without medical insurance.
</P>
<P>
   But as the two stood side by side in the hospital atrium,
swapping turns with the microphone in a discussion with doctors and
parents, the topic was at times overtaken by two other objectives
of the Gore campaign: making Gore more likable, and finding ways to
attack George W. Bush without turning voters off.
</P>
<P>
   Reiner agreeably took on both challenges Sunday, introducing
Gore as ``a good man,'' and then, almost beseechingly, assuring the
audience that Gore did indeed possess a sense of humor. ``He's a
fun man,'' he said. ``We have laughs together.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, as Gore plowed into a long description of how some states
have thrown up bureaucratic barriers to enrolling children in
government-financed health care, Reiner cut in with deadpan timing.
``Would one of those states be Texas?'' he asked, all mock
innocence.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it isn't, you don't have to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Embracing the straight man role, Gore replied, ``If it is, can I
still not say?''
</P>
<P>
   For Gore's aides, the repartee was a welcome surprise, a moment
to get in a subtle jab at Bush while showing their candidate as a
man who, if not exactly George Burns, is at least capable of adding
a human touch to policy jargon.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months Gore's friends have repeatedly expressed
frustration at his inability to project a certain lightness of
being that seems to come so easily for Bush. One of those friends
is Reiner, who, when asked to explain Bush's lead in the polls,
offered the explanation: ``People like him.''
</P>
<P>
   During a private lunch with Gore, the two watched film footage
of Gore shot by Spike Jonze, the director of the movie ``Being John
Malkovich.''
</P>
<P>
   The footage, paid for by the Democratic National Committee, is
said to show a more appealing side to Gore, and Reiner, the
director of ``This Is Spinal Tap'' and ``The American President,''
gave it a gushing review. The public, he said, needs to see this
kind of footage, perhaps even this week at the Democratic National
Convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a great sense of humor,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the campaign's quest to soften Gore's image, Gore has
markedly toned down his criticism of Bush. ``I pledged not to make
any negative personal attacks and I won't,'' Gore said in one of
several local television interviews Sunday. The same cannot be said
of Gore's press aides and surrogates like Reiner, who did not
disappoint. He launched into passionate attacks on Bush that were
oddly reminiscent of the diatribes he once delivered against
Richard Nixon, back when Reiner played Archie Bunker's liberal
son-in-law in the 1970s sitcom ``All in the Family.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The other side talks about being the party of diversity and
the party of inclusion,'' he said. ``How do they figure this? This
is what I want to know. Unless they define diversity as two guys at
the head of the ticket that are from two different oil companies.
If that's how they define diversity then I guess they are
diverse.''
</P>
<P>
   He was even more animated when Gore's aides had him meet with
reporters. Waving his arms, talking a mile a minute, bobbing about
like an agitated bear, Reiner called Bush ``a hypocrite of
staggering proportions.'' He chided Bush for having ``the
audacity'' to call himself a champion of children when it is Gore
who has proposed spending $42 billion to provide health care to
another million uninsured children and $115 billion to expand
schools and improve teacher pay.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Reiner and Gore advisers said, Bush has resisted
efforts to expand government health care programs to hundreds of
thousands of poor children in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   At one moment, though, Reiner's impassioned advocacy seemed to
get the better of him. Reiner asserted that Gore was one of the
three most qualified men to run for president ``in our lifetimes.''
The other two, he said, were Lyndon B. Johnson and Nixon,
presidents perhaps best known to history for leading the nation
through the twin traumas of Vietnam and Watergate. ``Al Gore, of
those three, is the most qualified,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When reporters burst into laughter at the unlikely comparison of
Gore to Nixon, Reiner tried hard to backpedal. ``Don't just print
the Nixon part,'' he begged, far, far too late.

LORETTA YOUNG: A GIANT FROM SILENT FILM TO TV 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICK LaSALLE  
 c.2000, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Loretta Young's career was so significant and went on for so
long that she's a little like the mythic animal _ so big that the
description varies, depending on whether the describer saw the head
or the tail.
</P>
<P>
   Young, who died Saturday at age 87, is remembered as the great
lady of early television by people in their 50s and as the gracious
leading actress of 1940s films by those who are older. Yet, in the
end, when the histories are written, Loretta Young will be best
remembered as one of the screen's great early stars. The filmed
record of her young beauty _ and her many fine performances, during
the Great Depression, as a struggling working woman _ guarantee her
immortality.
</P>
<P>
   For many it's hard to think of Young as an early star, and yet
she began in silent films. By her own count, she played 98 leads
over the course of some 60 years onscreen, and more than half of
those leads came to her before age 25. Her early films remained
unseen until fairly recently, but their availability, on video and
cable, has borne out film historian David Shipman's contention that
Young was at her best in her apprentice years.
</P>
<P>
   Young's development, from film to film, is fascinating to trace.
``When I started all you had to be is photographable and do what
the director told you,'' Young told The Chronicle in 1998. In her
first talkie, ``The Squall'' (1929), Young was only 16 playing a
girl of about 19, and her presence was merely decorative. A year
later,  &LR; In ``Road to Paradise'' (1930), she played twins separated
at birth, and she was confident and appealing, though not a
striking actress. But a year later, in Frank Capra's ``Platinum
Blonde'' (1931), it was all there: the beauty, the depth of
feeling, the command of the medium.
</P>
<P>
   In these years, Young had the challenge of playing women older
than herself. In ``Platinum Blonde,'' for example, she was 18,
playing a tough city-side reporter. In ``Big Business Girl''
(1931), she was an advertising executive. In ``They Call It Sin''
(1932), she was a successful composer; in ``Grand Slam'' (1933), a
famous bridge player.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for posterity, Young worked often in this period,
churning out six or seven pictures a year. Her pictures could be
said to have come in one of two varieties. There were the Nice
Loretta movies, and there were the Naughty Loretta movies.
</P>
<P>
   The Nice Loretta movies are worth seeing. Young worked at Warner
Bros., and just about everything that studio churned out in the
early '30s had some zing: In ``Taxi'' (1932), she played the loyal
wife of cab driver James Cagney. But he's portrayed as a hard,
troubled man, and the marriage isn't easy. (``Taxi'' is the picture
in which Young strips down to a nearly transparent slip.) In ``Life
Begins'' (1932), she spends the film in a maternity ward, trying to
live through a difficult pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   The Naughty Loretta movies were even better. In ``Employee's
Entrance'' (1933), she's a married woman who gets drunk at an
office party and goes to bed with her sleazy boss (Warren William).
``Midnight Mary'' (1933), which Young herself said was one of her
best films, begins with Young on trial for murder. As the
prosecuting attorney makes his summation, she sits in court reading
Cosmopolitan.
</P>
<P>
   In 1934, Young signed with 20th Twentieth &LR;  Century Studios and
made ``Born to Be Bad,'' about a woman who moves in with her son's
foster parents and seduces the husband (Cary Grant). Unfortunately
20th Twentieth &LR;  Century, which soon merged with Fox, wasn't a good
studio for actresses. ``(Studio boss) Darryl Zanuck had no interest
in women's stories,'' Young recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Even under the Production Code, which went into effect in
mid-1934, Young could have thrived had she stayed at Warner Bros.
Instead she found herself cast in boring wife roles at Fox. ``I
finally told Daryl, I'm sick of playing Mrs. Alexander Graham Bell.
I want to play Bell.''
</P>
<P>
   Young had a resurgence in the mid-1940s. By then it seemed as if
she'd been around forever, but in 1946, when she co-starred with
Orson Welles in ``The Stranger,'' she was only 33. The next year
she played a Swedish immigrant in ``The Farmer's Daughter'' (1947),
for which she won an Academy Award, and had the title role in ``The
Bishop's Wife'' (1947).
</P>
<P>
   By the late '40s she was an angular beauty with a gentle aura,
the opposite of what she'd been in the early '30s: a gentle beauty
with an edge. She still possessed one of the show business' most
watchable faces, and at 40 years old, she made a highly successful
second career in television.
</P>
<P>
   When I think of Loretta Young I think, of course, of the soft
hair and the cheekbones. I think of the look of distress she got in
dramas, with those huge eyes welling up with tears. But I also
think of her sidelong smile and nod, her deft way with a punch
line. And then there was the voice: refined, matter-of-fact and so
clear.
</P>
<P>
   It is probable that Loretta Young is just beginning to be
appreciated. Her body of work is vast. Her early films are winning
her new audiences, and when her television work becomes available,
we'll be able, for the first time, to grasp the full breadth of
this career.
</P>
<P>
   One thing is safe to say: We've just lost a giant _ and one of
the last of them.

`I DON'T WANT ANYTHING MORE THAN THIS' 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL _ Seonwoo Chun Shil has been crying all day _ tears of
anticipation over seeing her long-lost brother Tuesday for the
first time in half a century; tears of sorrow over a lifetime of
separation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no more wishes if I die right after I see my little
brother,'' said Seonwoo, 72, wiping her eyes with a wad of tissues
clenched in her fist. ``I'll be hoping to see him again. But I
don't want anything more than this.''
</P>
<P>
   Seonwoo is one of 1 million people born in North Korea who fled
south during the 1950-53 Korean War and who lost contact with their
parents, children, spouses, or siblings. She will be among the 100
South Koreans who will travel to the North Tuesday for a 72-hour
family reunion _ the most emotional and tangible sign of the
cross-border rapprochement that has blossomed since the first-ever
summit of leaders from the North and South in June.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts believe the reunions carry far more than
humanitarian significance. Such contacts may offer the best hope of
diminishing ignorance and distrust on both sides of the border,
thereby pushing diplomatic efforts toward peace and eventual
reunification.
</P>
<P>
   The governments will reopen liaison offices at the border
village of Panmunjom Monday. On Saturday, they announced a
fiber-optic cable link between the capitals.
</P>
<P>
   The nascent detente may be extending to other nations as well.
Sunday, North Korean leader Kim Jong Il was quoted as saying that
he would establish diplomatic ties with the United States as soon
as Washington removes Pyongyang from its list of states that
sponsor terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   The Korean War, which claimed as many as 2 million lives, ended
with Korea divided along the 38th Parallel, the communist North
backed by China and the Soviet Union, the capitalist South defended
by US forces, 37,000 of whom remain here.
</P>
<P>
   The two Koreas never signed a peace treaty and technically
remain at war. Before the summit, both governments denounced the
other viciously and regularly, with the North sending agents and
spy submarines to infiltrate the South and provoking armed clashes
as recently as last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike German families divided by the Berlin Wall who kept in
touch through letters, phone calls, and in later years, annual
visits, Korean families on either side of the world's most heavily
fortified border have been denied any contact, making the burden of
separation worse and blocking residents of the North from learning
about life outside.
</P>
<P>
   Some southerners have paid thousands of dollars to ethnic Korean
Chinese citizens _ who are allowed to enter the North _ to locate
relatives and smuggle them into China for brief meetings. Two
thousand people managed to track down their relatives in the past
decade, but only 500 succeeded in meeting them, according to South
Korean government figures.
</P>
<P>
   Visits Tuesday of 100 northerners to Seoul and 100 southerners
to Pyongyang are only the second-ever sanctioned reunions since the
country split. In 1985, 50 people from each side were chosen by
their governments for brief meetings. This time, nearly 77,000
South Koreans applied and that number was whittled down to 400 by a
Red Cross lottery.
</P>
<P>
   The lucky 100 from the South were chosen after North Korea
verified their relatives were alive, with priority given to the
elderly and those separated from a parent, child, or spouse.
</P>
<P>
   Like most of the 7.6 million southerners with relatives in the
North _ 15 percent of the southern population _ Seonwoo knows
nothing about what happened to her family and is not sure she will
recognize her 68-year-old brother, although she remembers ``the
shape of his eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   She has packed photos to show him of her late husband, who was a
police officer in the southern city of Pusan, her two children, and
five grandchildren. She bought a shiny pink silk hanbok to wear,
the traditional Korean gown, and an array of gifts _ toothbrushes,
vitamins, clothes, cosmetics, underwear, stockings, watches,
jewelry, and $500 _ half the amount southerners are permitted to
give relatives in the cash-strapped North. It is all she could
afford.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing I will ask him is what happened to our father.
The next thing will be if he ever got married. Does he have
children? Is he happy there? I feel so sorry for him that he might
have had a hard life there,'' Seonwoo said, her eyes watering.
``It's just destiny. We were born in the wrong time period.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Pyongyang to a privileged family (her father was a
senior executive at the Korean Tobacco Company), Seonwoo grew up
with several homes, a pleasure boat, and plenty of land. But by
1949, tensions between North and South were at a fever pitch, and
her family's friends had begun to say they could only survive if
they fled south.
</P>
<P>
   Her widowed father sent her to stay with an aunt but expected
that she would return when things calmed down. He kept his son to
help manage the family property.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pyongyang at that time had a better quality of life than
Seoul,'' Seonwoo recalled. The northern half of the country was
then thriving with industrialization, while the rural South lagged
sorely behind.
</P>
<P>
   Seonwoo, then 21, packed a bag for a 10-day respite in the
South, but the political situation deteriorated rapidly. Militants
swarmed along the de facto border and sealed the roads heading
north. Her aunt feared she would be killed or seized by soldiers
and refused to let her leave. Soon, war broke out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only when Korea was divided for good along the 38th Parallel
did I realize that was it: There was no going home for me,'' she
said. ``I cried all the time. I couldn't accept that I couldn't see
them again. Every year on their birthdays and big holidays, I would
think of them.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, she applied to be considered for the first, limited
reunions but was turned down. Discouraged by the 77,000 others who
were applying this time, she didn't even bother, and was surprised
when the Red Cross contacted her, citing her 15-year-old
application.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea's 100 visitors to Seoul were chosen from the
country's elite _ artists, scientists, officials, and defectors.
Seonwoo's family suspects she was chosen because her brother may be
well-connected to the northern regime.
</P>
<P>
   Seonwoo wants to visit her father's grave, but the government
said that will be impossible. Families will be permitted to see one
another only in their hotels, with North Korean officials present,
and on organized sightseeing trips. She is disappointed that she
won't see her brother's home or sleep in the same room, but she is
grateful for any chance to see him.
</P>
<P>
   She realizes it will be hard to bond in a few days after a
lifetime apart and doubts he will be able to tell her the truth
about his life in North Korea, although ``I'll be able to guess
from his voice and facial expressions.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Cross gave southerners instructions about presents:
nothing expensive, no television sets, nothing with English words,
no South Korean or US flags, no South Korean currency, and no
books, tapes, or videos that could be considered subversive or
insulting to the North Korean government.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether she wishes she could bring her brother back with
her, Seonwoo averted her eyes, now heavy with emotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel so appreciative that I even get to see him _ what can I
expect more than three days? I wish someday I could bring my little
brother to Seoul or Pusan with his whole family. Our wish is
reunification and to all live together.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Democratic National Convention will adopt a
platform on Tuesday that, like its Republican counterpart, makes a
broad effort to reach voters in the middle, calling for schools to
be more accountable for student performance, stricter control of
the nation's borders, expanded global trade, a stronger military
and maintaining the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   But in the details, the platforms sharply diverge on most
issues, providing clear indications of how Gore and Bush
administrations would differ.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Democrats offer modest, focused tax cuts to help
middle-class families, while the Republicans call for an
across-the-board income tax cut to stimulate the economy.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Democrats call for increased financing for public schools,
while the Republicans support taxpayer-financed vouchers to help
parents pay for private schools.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Democrats would keep the Social Security system as it is,
bolstering it with general tax revenues. The Republicans call for
allowing taxpayers to invest part of their payroll taxes in the
financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Democrats propose extending Medicaid, the health care
program for those with low incomes, to more children, while the
Republicans advocate tax breaks to help people buy private health
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Democrats call for developing the technology for a limited
system to protect the nation from ballistic missile attacks, while
the Republicans support moving full speed ahead with an ambitious,
space-based system.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Democrats endorse civil rights protections for gays and
support laws intended to expand the rights of unions to organize
workers. The Republicans oppose gay rights and support laws
intended to reduce the ability of unions to organize.
</P>
<P>
   For all those clear disagreements, the platforms are alike in
that they closely reflect the styles, broad visions and campaign
agendas of the two candidates. Writing a platform usually tests a
candidate's ability to manage the factions in his party, and both
Bush and Gore successfully enforced a high degree of unity on their
platform committees.
</P>
<P>
   For Gore, the result has been a Democratic platform that wraps
him more tightly than ever in Clinton's legacy.
</P>
<P>
   Far from stamping a distinctive Gore imprint on the Democratic
Party, the document warmly embraces the centrist policies of the
Clinton administration and lavishly credits them for the prosperity
of the last seven years.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1992, Bill Clinton and Al Gore were elected to turn the
American economy around,'' the platform declares in its opening
lines. ``Today, the success of these new ideas is clear.''
</P>
<P>
   From those lines through most of its 20,000 words, the platform
articulates a ``new Democrat'' agenda that cuts a middle path
between welfare-state liberalism and laissez-faire Republicanism,
advocating active but smaller government, fiscal discipline, free
trade and tough crime policies.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton first imposed those positions on the party in 1992 over
the objections of liberals, and Gore's aides fought back efforts _
albeit weak ones _ by progressives again this year to pull the 2000
platform leftward on health care, defense spending and trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both the rhetoric and the positions are where the party set
off in '92,'' said Thomas Mann, a senior fellow with the Brookings
Institution, a nonpartisan policy organization. ``Everything is
designed to say, `We are continuing with the policies and the
progress of the Clinton years, even though we are separating
ourselves from the man.'''
</P>
<P>
   If the Democratic platform represents continuity, the platform
adopted by the Republicans in Philadelphia makes more of a break,
in tone if not always in substance, with Republican platforms of
the recent past.
</P>
<P>
   Much like Clinton in 1992, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas has
tried to use the 2000 platform to capture a broader swath of
moderate swing voters. While the Republican platform remains
fundamentally conservative _ strongly opposing abortion, gay rights
and gun control while calling for tax cuts, smaller government and
more military spending _ some of the hard-edged proposals from 1996
are gone. The platform no longer would deny citizenship to the
American-born children of illegal immigrants, abolish the federal
department of education and end federal financing for the arts.
</P>
<P>
   Instead it calls for more inclusive attitudes toward immigrants,
a strong federal role in making schools more effective and the
preservation of the biggest of big-government programs, Social
Security.
</P>
<P>
   But for both candidates, tamping down open dissent from their
parties' most militant wings meant accepting language that
sometimes went beyond their original positions, or flatly
contradicted their views.
</P>
<P>
   For Gore, the major fight was on trade. Over the objections of
labor unions, the platform endorses the policy of ``fast track,''
which would allow presidents to negotiate certain treaties without
congressional approval. But at the behest of unions, the platform
also calls for negotiating labor and environmental standards into
all trade accords.
</P>
<P>
   For Bush, adopting softer positions on issues like education and
immigration meant accepting language flatly opposing abortion, even
though he would personally allow it in cases of rape or incest or
when a woman's life is in danger.
</P>
<P>
   In tone, both platforms also reflect the stump styles of the two
candidates. The Republican platform is heavily salted with the kind
of optimistic, inclusive-sounding phrases that flavor Bush's
speeches.
</P>
<P>
   ``We approach these challenges with compassionate conservatism,
a concept that is as old as the pioneers heading west in wagon
trains, in which everyone had responsibility to follow the rules,
but no one would be left behind,'' the platform says.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic document mirrors Gore's knife-edged efforts to
cast Bush as a risk to the nation's peace and prosperity. Thus, the
platform asserts, the Republicans ``eschew fiscal discipline and
offer up nothing less than fiscal disaster.'' Bush's Social
Security plan would ``take the `security' out of Social Security.''
And the Republican proposal for a space-based missile defense
system ``would plunge us into a new arms race.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet even as it attacks the Republicans, the Democratic platform
manages to echo its rivals' words. ``If America is to secure
prosperity, peace and security for all, we cannot afford to go
back,'' it says. ``We must move forward together and we must not
leave anyone behind.''

PARK KEEPS COMPOSURE TO GRAB A WINSTON CUP VICTORY 
</HEADLINE>
  By DAVE CALDWELL    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WATKINS GLEN, N.Y. _ His boss left on an airplane on Sunday
afternoon without him. Steve Park would have to find a much slower
way to get back to North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll hitchhike home if I have to,'' Park said, beaming.
</P>
<P>
   Park, who drives a Chevrolet owned by the fussy Dale Earnhardt
Sr., was held up because he finally won his first Nascar Winston
Cup race _ and earned the right to pose for photos, spray Champagne
and jump up and down on the roof of his car.
</P>
<P>
   The 32-year-old native of Northport, N.Y., moved into contention
early, held his lead by virtue of a sensational pit stop, then held
off a thrilling late charge by the veteran Mark Martin to win the
grueling, temper-testing Global Crossing at the Glen by not much
more than a car length.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Park received a thumbs-up from Martin and a visit in
the victory circle from Earnhardt, for whom Park has driven for
nearly three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   This was the same racetrack at which Earnhardt first made note
of Park's driving talent a few years ago. Now, after 77 races, an
accident that cost him half the 1998 season and some shuffling of
his crew, Park had his first victory. He felt he had earned it.
</P>
<P>
   ``A young guy like me is not used to the pressure of holding off
a Mark Martin to win a race,'' Park said.
</P>
<P>
   This was an exasperating day for almost everyone but Park. Jeff
Gordon, who had won a record six straight Winston Cup races on road
courses, including the last three here, collided with Tony Stewart
on the second of 90 laps and quickly fell from contention. Gordon
finished 23rd.
</P>
<P>
   When Gordon pulled his mangled car next to Stewart's mangled car
after the race, Stewart summoned him over, and the two drivers
swapped accusations as if they were still banging into each other
on the track.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, pointing a finger and lacing each sentence with
profanity, accused Gordon of reneging on his promise to avoid an
accident early in the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should practice what you preach,'' Stewart said.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Gordon said: ``I made a clean move, and I don't think he
wanted me to pass him. Maybe I was trying to go too hard too early.
But I think there could have been a little bit more consideration
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Dale Earnhardt Jr. lost control of his Chevrolet and spun into
the Styrofoam-lined fence on Lap 2. It was a costly accident for
Earnhardt, who had been hoping to win his eighth Winston Cup race.
</P>
<P>
   He finished 25th, with black tape holding the back of his car
together, and fell 217 points behind Bobby Labonte, the leader in
the points standing. Labonte finished fifth, two spots ahead of
Dale Jarrett, and stretched his lead to a season-best 101 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the car was going to be pretty good today, but we'll
just have to forget about it now,'' Earnhardt said.
</P>
<P>
   Good drivers began to drop out in a hurry. Ron Fellows, the
road-course specialist who finished second to Gordon at the Glen
last year, moved to 15th from 40th in only 13 laps, but abruptly
dropped back because of engine trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like last year was a lot more difficult than we
thought,'' Fellows said. ``It's a shame.''
</P>
<P>
   Rusty Wallace spun into the gravel next to the track. Jerry
Nadeau, after moving to third from 25th place, lost use of third
gear. Ward Burton fell from the top five after he was penalized
because his crew forgot to put all the lug nuts on a tire.
</P>
<P>
   Park told himself to keep his composure, and he moved up in the
pack. He started 18th but was in the top five after 25 laps. He
took the lead one-third of the way into the race and gave it up
briefly on his last pit stop.
</P>
<P>
   But what a pit stop it was. His crew needed only 15.4 seconds to
refuel his car and change his tires. Labonte's crew needed 17.2
seconds to do the same thing one lap later.
</P>
<P>
   Park found himself in the lead after everyone in the field had
made his final stop, and soon the race boiled down to Park and
Martin.
</P>
<P>
   Martin closed on Park's rear bumper and stayed there, as if his
car had a magnet on it. Park said he tried to avoid the temptation
to steal peeks in his rearview mirror to see where Martin was.
</P>
<P>
   Park bobbled twice in the final laps, once when his car appeared
to be nudged by Jeff Burton's, but he kept the lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sure wish I could have won the race, but Steve Park earned
that one,'' Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   When he crossed the finish line, Park remembered to stick his
hand out of the car and wave to the crowd. He forgot to shift,
though, and his car protested with a sudden pop. That was about the
only thing that went amiss on Sunday for Park.
</P>
<P>
   He was asked after the race if he told his boss, now long gone,
that he had won one more race at Watkins Glen than the great Dale
Earnhardt Sr. had. Park smiled again. The boss is still the boss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't want to tell Dale Earnhardt anything that he
wouldn't want to hear,'' Park said. ``He still signs my
paychecks.'' &QL;

AT CONVENTION, DEMOCRATS LEAVE NO DELEGATE UNPLUGGED 
</HEADLINE>
  By LESLIE WAYNE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Picture the scene this week on the convention floor in Los
Angeles: Democratic delegates galore with banners and balloons,
funny hats and confetti. And computers. And Palm Pilots, digital
cameras, wireless beepers, ``smart cards'' and all sorts of other
high-tech gadgets meant to showcase the party's technological
prowess and burnish its party-of-the-future image.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the major party conventions have largely faded as big
television and radio events, the Democratic Party is making a show
of having the most plugged-in national convention in history,
leaving no moment unrecorded and no delegate unconnected. In
cyberspace, that is.
</P>
<P>
   A 360-degree camera will be streaming video images on the
Democrats' Web site for the entire four-day convention. Everyone
making a podium speech will be required to participate in an online
chat immediately afterward. When the cry rings out _ ``The great
state of Tennessee casts its votes for . . .'' _ those votes will
be recorded by one of 56 Apple Imac computers scattered across the
convention floor. And each delegate is being given a card to be
used at any of the more than 100 computer kiosks scattered at the
convention and at Los Angeles hotels, to get late-breaking
information from party officials and to talk to other delegates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've basically wired the entire city of Los Angeles,'' said
Naz Nageer, director of technology for the Democratic National
Convention Committee. ``It's our `e-mersion' coverage. We're on the
frontier of something big; we are in the space of the future. We've
got technological diversity here.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Democrats _ who have a far more extensive technological
display planned than what the Republicans offered in Philadelphia _
the high-tech gadgetry serves purposes both practical and
political.
</P>
<P>
   It connects disparate delegates in the nation's most sprawling
city and is a way to communicate with them on issues ranging from
the party's daily talking points to scheduling changes and
restaurant reservations.
</P>
<P>
   But, more subtly, the gadgetry sends the message that the party
embraces technology and, by implication, the future. ``It's mainly
a demonstration,'' said Adam Clayton Powell III, vice president of
technology for the Freedom Forum, a nonprofit foundation. ``It
becomes a showcase of technology and a way to make the party look
very 21st century. It means we won't have pictures of delegates
sitting in their seats reading the newspapers. The party would
rather have them looking at their Palm Pilots.''
</P>
<P>
   And for some, this technology is also a way to keep delegates in
line. ``All this technology is not so much to solicit opinions of
delegates as it is to tell them what to do and what to say,'' said
Marion Just, research director at the Joan Shorenstein Center at
Harvard University. ``This certainly will help delegates get the
message of the day _ or of the hour _ and provides an opportunity
for the convention to speak with one voice to the media.''
</P>
<P>
   The technological display, which is being offered free by many
high-tech companies, involves gadgets both in real space and in
cyberspace. More than 100 seven-foot-high kiosks will connect
delegates and anyone else to the Internet and to special convention
Web sites. The kiosks, 12 on the convention floor and the rest at
delegate hotels, contain easy-to-use computers with touch screens
instead of mice.
</P>
<P>
   The main Web site is DNC411, a delegates-only part of the main
site (www.Dems2000.com) that is a way for delegates to get
information online at any kiosk rather than having to carry around
sheets of paper.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the computers reinforce the image that this is the party
of the future,'' said Michael Cornfield, research director of the
Democracy Online Project at George Washington University. ``There
really is no other purpose for them.''

LEITER IS PICTURE-PERFECT AS METS TOP GIANTS, 3-2 
</HEADLINE>
   By TYLER KEPNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Al Leiter spotted a photo of a pitcher a few days
ago, and he looked it over with admiration. As the pitcher released
the ball, his arm was like the minute hand on a clock at the top of
the hour. That is impressive, said Leiter, who felt his release
point was off in a sloppy outing at Houston last week.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter, the Mets' left-hander, knew his mechanics would have to
be better. Sunday, they were. Leiter reached out more with his arm,
kept his fingers on top of his pitches and worked eight marvelous
innings to beat the San Francisco Giants, 2-0. He gave up only two
hits and one walk while striking out 12, improving to 13-5.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter left for a pinch-hitter in the Mets' eighth, when Robin
Ventura's double and Mike Bordick's single brought in the only runs
of the game. With Armando Benitez having pitched the last two days,
John Franco worked the ninth inning for his fourth save.
</P>
<P>
   With the victory, the Mets (69-47) moved within a game and a
half of Atlanta, the closest they have been in five weeks. The Mets
have won 16 of 19 games.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in this four-game series, which the Mets can sweep with
a victory Monday night, Leiter talked with Dave Righetti, the
Giants' pitching coach and his friend, about his Sunday opponent,
Livan Hernandez. Righetti told him how sharp Hernandez had been,
and Leiter knew that every pitch would count.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time I'm facing a guy who's quality, that kind of elevates
my concentration, and realizing that the execution of a pitch is
important,'' Leiter said. ``I even thought about that with Barry. I
really wanted to throw a fastball in at some point in one of his
at-bats, and I never did.''
</P>
<P>
   The wind was blowing in from center field, but Leiter feared
Barry Bonds could turn on a pitch and drive it down the right field
line for a homer. So Leiter changed his approach to Bonds, a
left-handed power hitter, and twice struck him out with curveballs.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter had all of his pitches working, even his changeup, which
he used against Ellis Burks to set up the groundout that ended the
seventh inning, just after Jeff Kent singled to end a stretch of 19
consecutive outs.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Bobby Valentine let Leiter hit with a man on third and
one out in the seventh _ he struck out _ and Leiter fanned the side
in the eighth. His high fastball was humming, his slider diving and
his cutter boring in on the Giants' hands.
</P>
<P>
   When Leiter was younger, he would continue to try to make a
nasty pitch when he fell behind in the count. When he struck out a
lot of hitters, he usually walked a lot, too. Sunday, Leiter said,
he mostly tried to throw strikes without worrying whether a hitter
would put it in play.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter got several outs this way, and Righetti noticed how
Ventura, the third baseman, would set up close to the line and
Bordick, the shortstop, would set up in the hole. The wild rookie
whom Righetti knew with the Yankees in the late-'80s now has
superior command of his cutter.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a good, rising fastball and a pretty good slider,''
said Righetti, who was the Yankees' closer when Leiter started his
career there in 1987. ``But he never had that other pitch, that
curveball and that efficient fastball he could spot; it was all
over the place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, he's got that cutter to go along with the other fastball
that he has. He's using a pitch that right-handers have a tough
time dealing with. Even if they hit it good, they have a tough time
hitting it fair.''
</P>
<P>
   Leiter idolized Righetti, who taught him slider grips but whose
professionalism made the most lasting impression. Leiter noticed
how Righetti would sit in the bullpen all game long, even though he
would not be called on until the end, and he said that commitment
taught him respect for the team ideal.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's outing looked like Leiter's best this year, but he did
not care to rank it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really I'm not proud anymore of whether it's a complete
domination or not, so long as we win the game,'' he said. ``I don't
want to give up five runs in my games, because after a while you
realize you're playing with fire, but a win's a win. The
organization, the GM, owner, fans _ all they care about is whether
you won the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Leiter would not have won without the offense finally getting to
Hernandez (11-9).
</P>
<P>
   The Mets left seven runners on in the first seven innings _ they
lead the National League in runners left on base, with 7.76 a game
_ but Edgardo Alfonzo walked to lead off the eighth and scored when
Ventura split the gap with a double that bounced to the wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's really on the upward climb,'' Valentine said of Ventura,
who was slowed at midseason by a shoulder injury. ``He's been very,
very good in the dugout all year long, and very good with his
preparation, but you could tell that he's felt he could contribute
more. Now he's getting right on track.''
</P>
<P>
   So is Leiter, whose mechanics looked just fine to his mentor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing he's doing now is finishing his pitches,''
Righetti said. ``He attacks hitters better out front than he did
before. He used to land and spin off the ball. Now, he's not doing
that. He's finishing.''
</P>
<P>
   His forgettable Houston start behind him, Leiter's performance
was picturesque again.

TIGHT END BRINGS WIDE POSSIBILITIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JILL PAINTER  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Big Sky Conference teams had plenty of trouble
defending Cal State Northridge's prolific offense last year. Now
CSUN is adding another wrinkle: the tight end.
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors, who open camp today, seldom have used the
position, but CSUN coach Jeff Kearin expects that to change this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never really done anything before with a tight end,''
Kearin said. ``We've been more of a spread unit.''
</P>
<P>
   Nate Davenport _ CSUN's tight end last season _ had just six
receptions for 40 yards. He played in six games with an injured
shoulder, but he's healthy now and much improved, Kearin said.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport will compete for playing time with Mt. San Antonio
College transfer Cory DiSanti (6-foot-3, 225 pounds).
</P>
<P>
   ``(DiSanti) is more of a receiving tight end,'' Kearin said.
``We'll keep defenses guessing as to whether we're going to run the
ball or stand him up as a receiver. I'm excited about the ability
to have a tight end.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Crushing blow: Bryson Atkins _ who started at strong safety
toward the end of last season _ blew out his knee playing
basketball last summer and is out for the season.
</P>
<P>
   __ SDSU loss, CSUN gain: San Diego State transfer Jason Stone
should prove to be a big-time receiving threat. The 6-5, 220-pound
Stone played at Santa Barbara City College before receiving a full
scholarship to SDSU. Kearin said Stone wasn't one of SDSU's top
four receivers in the spring and also wanted to be closer to home.
</P>
<P>
   __ Maybe next year: Ron Givan, a strong safety CSUN signed out
of Mt. SAC, is academically ineligible. Givan was a projected
starter but is shy credits to earn his Associate of Arts degree.
Givan plans to finish in the fall and begin practicing with CSUN in
the spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's very disappointing because he's a great player and good
person,'' Kearin said. ``He would've been a good part of this
team.''
</P>

<P>
   &LR; INDIANAPOLIS _ Pretty soon my favorite national sports weekly
is going to appear in my mailbox wrapped in brown paper. What
convinced me of this was the photograph the magazine ran on Jenny
Thompson in the issue currently gracing newsstands.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, one of the U.S.'s brightest gold-medal hopes in
swimming in Sydney, is standing in a Wonder Woman pose, resplendent
in red boots, hotpants, pearl earrings, a navel ring and . . . a
tan. Her fists cover her chest and actually do a much better job of
it than some of the skimpy suits that were !ital!de rigueur before
the advent of full-length bodysuits.
</P>
<P>
   My problem isn't with the photograph, per se. It is, as Kevin
Garnett would say, tastefully done (which is more than I can say
for the headline preferred by some of the magazine's editors, which
was, according to a magazine employee, ``Holding Her Own.'').
</P>
<P>
   I'm peeved on principle. I mean, where is the picture in the
same issue of Dodger outfielder Gary Sheffield naked except for his
strategically placed fielding glove? In a related question, why
hasn't Jan-Michael Gambill appeared on the cover yet?
</P>
<P>
   If Anna Kournikova can be splashed across the front of my
favorite national sports weekly despite never having won a
professional tournament, why not Gambill? He's got comparable good
looks and one title tucked away in his professional dossier, for
good measure.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, if achievement was the only consideration, golfer
Karrie Webb and track star Marion Jones would have graced the cover
of my favorite national sports weekly by now.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just about performance anymore, it's about
personalities and newsstand sales and the 18-to-34-year-old male
demographic. I understand that.
</P>
<P>
   What I don't think the editors at my favorite national sports
weekly understand is that they bare _ pun intended _ their view of
female athletes whenever a profile on one is accompanied by a photo
that's more sexy than sporty:
</P>
<P>
   It's not whether you win or lose, girls, but how you look
playing the game.
</P>
<P>
   The message is unfortunate because it sabotages the bigger
picture, which is that sports doesn't just build muscles, it tears
down walls. To put yourself on the line in the athletic arena is
liberating, empowering, emboldening. Women (and men) should
participate in athletics because of how good it can make them feel
about themselves, not because of how good it makes them look to
others.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of her 100-meter freestyle preliminaries on Sunday,
Thompson, 27, was taken to task by a couple of female reporters for
having agreed to pose for the suggestive picture in my favorite
national sports weekly. With all due respect to them, I think their
indignation was misplaced. They couldn't see the systematic sexism
for the suggestive pose.
</P>
<P>
   They would have been better off venting to the editors of my
favorite national sports weekly. The editors are the gatekeepers of
the magazine, deciding which stories get published and which ones
die on deadline. Until enlightenment breaks down the doors to their
gilded offices, the few female athletes approached to be in my
favorite national sports weekly will face a dilemma:
</P>
<P>
   Do they refuse to play by the magazine's rules, at the risk of
being excluded from the magazine entirely or being re-routed to its
stepsister of a publication?
</P>
<P>
   Or do they overlook the magazine's agenda and use the
incredible, uh, exposure they'll receive to advance their own
agendas?
</P>
<P>
   Thompson chose the latter, believing that in this ``Thin is In''
world it would be beneficial for young girls to see buff females
for a change.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud of my body and the work I've done to get it like
this,'' said Thompson. ``I'd like for young girls to have an image
of strong, muscular women as a positive thing . . . I'd just like
portraying strong women, not flimsy models.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe one day my favorite national sports weekly, in its offices
and on its pages, will embrace strong women. Until then, I feel
compelled to tell you: I subscribe to my favorite national sports
weekly for the articles. I swear.

COMMENTARY: GORE'S CRUCIAL WEEK 
</HEADLINE>
   By BOB HERBERT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If the Republican convention was an infomercial,
the Democratic convention is a minefield.
</P>
<P>
   With friends like Bill and Hillary hijacking the spotlight (and
trailing the noxious memories of Monica behind them), and with
anarchists and other protesters threatening to turn parts of the
city upside down, Al Gore and Joe Lieberman will be lucky to escape
L.A. with any momentum at all.
</P>
<P>
   For a while last week, Gore looked like a genuine leader. The
bold choice of Joe Lieberman as his running mate was deftly handled
and widely hailed. But then the Clintons took over. On Thursday we
were treated to the spectacle of the president appearing before
thousands of evangelical ministers in a Chicago suburb, where he
very publicly revisited _ in the name of contrition _ the
incredible stain he put on the nation's highest office.
</P>
<P>
   By week's end the first couple had arrived in Los Angeles, where
they immediately began hobnobbing with the stars and fund-raising
for themselves. It was another blatant display of the Clintons'
well-known selfishness, and there was little the vice president
could do but try and put the best face on it.
</P>
<P>
   Gore had other problems, one of them being the fallout from the
plan by Rep. Loretta Sanchez, D-Calif., to hold a fund-raiser at
Hugh Hefner's Playboy Mansion. Sanchez was one of the few people in
the entire country who failed to recognize that anything even
remotely connected with playboys and naked ladies is a no-no for
the duration of this campaign. Under tremendous pressure, she
finally backed off.
</P>
<P>
   While these internal conflicts were being played out, the forces
intent on disrupting the convention _ protesters, demonstrators,
anarchists and assorted zanies _ were steadily mobilizing. One
police official said that on a scale of 1 to 10 the likelihood that
violence would erupt was 10.
</P>
<P>
   Some demonstrators said they hoped to thwart legal proceedings
by refusing to wear clothes if they were arrested. The Los Angeles
Times quoted a judge as saying, ``We'll have naked court, if
necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   None of this does Al Gore need. What he needs is a dignified
convention, where he and Lieberman can attempt to make the case
that their leadership and their policies _ not Bill Clinton's and
not the Republicans' _ are the best course for the United States to
follow.
</P>
<P>
   Gore-Lieberman is not a charismatic ticket. They either win on
substance or not at all. But it's awfully hard to get your message
heard amid the din of Clinton narcissism, dumb distractions and
demonstrations in the street.
</P>
<P>
   Forty years ago John Kennedy was nominated by the Democrats in
Los Angeles. In his acceptance speech he said that America stood
``on the edge of a New Frontier.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Beyond that frontier,'' he said, ``are the uncharted areas of
science and space, unsolved problems of peace and war, unconquered
pockets of ignorance and prejudice, unanswered questions of poverty
and surplus.''
</P>
<P>
   In these very early days of the 21st century, the United States
enjoys unrivaled power and prosperity. But the challenges facing
the nation fall into categories remarkably similar to those
identified by Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   This is the week for Al Gore to make his case, to argue
convincingly that government is not the enemy of the people, and
not a servant of the rich, but rather, as Abraham Lincoln said, a
collective effort ``to do for a community of people whatever they
need to have done, but cannot do at all in their separate and
individual capacities.''
</P>
<P>
   Conventions are traditionally exercises in zaniness and
egomania. But they are also serious forums for the expression of
important ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly one in five American children are poor, and many working
families, despite the extraordinary economy, are having trouble
paying bills and putting food on the table. What do Gore and
Lieberman have to say about trying to bring them into the
mainstream? What do they have to say about the nation's school
system, and health care, and global warming, and gun control and
abortion and the Supreme Court?
</P>
<P>
   This is the week to find out. Bill Clinton is not running this
year, and he could help his party and his country by adopting a
lower profile. This election should not be about a stain on a blue
dress. It's time to move on.

  L.A. GET FIRST TASTE OF DEMONSTRATORS
 &HT;      By MARK HELM 
 &HT;     c. 2000 Hearst Newspapers
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The first skirmish in a potential week-long battle
between Los Angeles police and demonstrators ended quietly Sunday
after more than 3,500 protesters marched without incident through
the city's downtown streets under the watchful eye of riot-clad
officers.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters _ chanting for the release of Mumia Abu-Jamal, a
death-row inmate convicted of killing a Philadelphia police officer
_ walked peacefully on a designated route from Pershing Square
downtown toward the Staples Center, site of the Democratic National
Convention, which will begin Monday.
</P>
<P>
   A few protesters broke away from the crowd and ran toward
police, only to stop a few feet before them. On the sidewalks,
tourists retreated into shops when the marchers moved toward them
while some business owners pulled down steel doors over their
storefronts.
</P>
<P>
   Although this demonstration remained trouble-free, Los Angeles
officials made clear they would still take no chances in their
preparation for the arrival of an estimated 50,000 protesters. To
prevent any disruptions to the convention's official nomination of
Al Gore as its presidential candidate,, the city has erected an
armed camp around the convention site.
</P>
<P>
   Patrolled by nearly 10,000 officers from the Los Angeles Police
Department, the L.A. County Sheriff's office, California Highway
Patrol, FBI and Secret Service, the camp's perimeter _ protected by
a 13-foot high fence set in concrete blocks _ runs a mile in length
and a half-mile in width around the Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the perimeter, police cars slowly cruised downtown
streets Sunday while hundreds of officers _ equipped with tear gas,
pepper spray and bean-bag projectiles _ patrolled the area on foot.
In addition, other police units in full riot gear were stationed
nearby, ready to move instantly. Police even commandeered many of
the city's closed-circuit cameras and highway sensors normally used
to traffic control to watch for suspicious activity at hundreds of
locations.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we don't want any trouble, we are prepared to act and to
act decisively,'' Officer Jason Lee, an LAPD spokesman, said.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrators hope to draw attention to such causes as
environmental degradation, poverty, treatment of undocumented
immigrants and campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   To prevent violence, police have also cut down trees, which
could be set on fire, and removed newspaper stands, which could be
used as battering rams, and mail boxes, which could hold small
bombs.
</P>
<P>
   An example of the department's tense position occurred Saturday
morning after police received reports of a large package wrapped in
duct tape in front of the downtown Marriott Hotel. Police quickly
blocked access to the building, closing the street in front of it
for 1 1/2 hours. They refused to allow anyone to enter or leave the
hotel. Officers surrounded the building and deployed a bomb squad
with specially-trained dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the scare was diffused when police opened the box
and found it was filled with kitty litter.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their preparations, police privately admitted they
cannot prevent every act of violence in a city as spread-out as Los
Angeles, which stretches for 469 square miles.
</P>
<P>
   However, police said they felt confident that they can achieve
their two main goals: ensuring the smooth running of the convention
and stopping demonstrators from disrupting the downtown area.
</P>
<P>
   But officials said it will be nearly impossible to stop
protesters from blocking traffic or cutting off access to
businesses in the surrounding suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   They stressed that they are determined to avoid the riots of
1992, when hundreds of police waited for hours as demonstrators _
spurred by a jury's acquittal of four LAPD officers on state
charges in the Rodney G. King beating _ destroyed parts of the
city.
</P>
<P>
   Police Cmdr. Tom Lorenzen, who heads security for the
convention, has said that it will provide a chance for the
department to redeem its tarnished image. But the LAPD also is
dealing with a corruption scandal in which officers were found to
have covered up unjustified shootings, intimidated witnesses and
planted evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Lee said, ``We will treat every demonstrator fairly and
according to the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Protest organizers said they feared that the police in their
desire to keep order and not to repeat the mistakes of the 1992
riots will overreact against peaceful protesters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The area has become a militarized zone, and they think we're
the enemy,'' said Caroline Brown, a spokeswoman for an umbrella
group of protest organizations which calls itself D2KLA.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the Los Angeles City Council voted 13 to 0 to require
city agencies to respect the rights of demonstrators during the
convention. The vote came a day after the American Civil Liberties
Union, on behalf of several protest groups, filed a lawsuit against
the LAPD.
</P>
<P>
   The suit contends that the department has selectively enforced
laws _ including issuing jaywalking citations to protest organizers
in front of their near downtown. The suit also alleges that the
police have photographed people entering the headquarters, demanded
to search the building without a warrant, confiscated protester
property, followed people leaving the building and recorded the
license plate numbers of cars parked nearby.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spying and the harassment of political protesters is the
hallmark of a police state, and must not be tolerated here,'' ACLU
attorney Dan Tokaji said.
</P>
<P>
   Preparing for the worst, protesters have trained themselves in
how to cope with tear gas and pepper spray and how to behave when
confronted by police. ``It's not that we want trouble, but the
police have shown every sign that they're willing to use this kind
of force,'' Brown said.

CLINTON WILL TRY TO IGNITE A GORE COMEBACK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   (For use by clients of the New York Times News Service)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.2000 Hearst Newspapers   
LOS ANGELES _ President Clinton, hoping to ignite a comeback
victory for political heir Al Gore, will launch the Democratic
National Convention Monday night with the claim that he and Gore
transformed the ``terrible economic mess'' they inherited from
Republicans in 1992 into unprecedented promise and prosperity.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Clinton's speech, expected to last as long as an hour, is his
last chance to speak to the Democratic Party faithful as president.
He plans to fly back to Washington on Tuesday after stopping in
Michigan to meet Gore and symbolically pass the torch to his
designated political heir.
</P>
<P>
   As Democrats flocked to this summer-hot convention city Sunday
on the eve of their first convention here since 1960, more than
3,000 protesters choked part of downtown Los Angeles to dramatize
opposition to environmental degradation, poverty and the ill
effects of world trade. Riot-equipped police flanked protesters as
they neared the Staples Center, site of the GOP convention that
opens Monday. Some protesters voiced support for Mumia Abu-Jamal,
on death row in Pennsylvania for killing a Philadelphia police
officer.
</P>
<P>
   In remarks to Democratic activists in beachfront Malibu, Clinton
acknowledged the uphill battle facing Gore, who lags Republican
presidential nominee George W. Bush in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can turn around these polls,'' Clinton told. ``But it's not
the work of a day. It's going to take every day between now and
November.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest nationwide survey showed Gore edging closer to Bush
after Gore chose Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., as his running
mate. Lieberman is the first Jewish American chosen for a national
party ticket.
</P>
<P>
   An NBC-Wall Street Journal poll released Sunday showed Bush
leading Gore by 3 percentage points, 44 percent to 41 percent. The
survey had a margin of error of 3.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The results offered good news to Gore who has trailed Bush by as
much as 14 percentage points in some recent surveys and by 6
percentage points in a comparable NBC News-Wall Street Journal
survey conducted before Bush's GOP convention in Philadelphia
earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Chairman Joe Andrew welcomed signs of Gore gaining
``momentum,'' adding: ``We're in a position where just a decent
convention puts us where we want to be.''
</P>
<P>
   White House chief of staff John Podesta and White House press
secretary Joe Lockhart said Clinton would use his valedictory
address as a symbolic farewell to his supporters before stepping
aside to let Gore seize the political limelight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's his moment to get off the stage and let someone else get
on the stage and do the job,'' Podesta said.
</P>
<P>
   After Clinton leaves the convention, ``politically, the
president will be in the background,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   The presidential aides said Clinton hoped to debunk the claims
that Bush made in a well-received GOP convention address in
Philadelphia on Aug. 3 that the Clinton-Gore team had needlessly
``squandered'' opportunities offered by the longest economic
recovery in American history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Republicans may have had a little amnesia about where
things stood in 1992,'' Podesta said, adding that Clinton ``will be
happy to remind people about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said Clinton will remind the nation that it has been
the Clinton-Gore ``partnership'' and Democrats in Congress who have
been ``reversing a terrible economic mess in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart, who _ like Podesta _ has been working with Clinton on
the speech, said the president would reject Bush's claim that
Clinton and Gore had taken ``an eight-year vacation'' once elected
and that ``everything that happened over the last eight years had
happened by accident.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart emphasized, however, that Clinton had no plans to
apologize during his address for the sexual dalliance with former
White House intern Monica Lewinsky. Clinton was impeached by the
House for obstruction of justice in the aftermath of the affair.
The president was acquitted by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton revived discussion of the sensitive personal issue in an
appearance last week before 4,500 ministers in Chicago en route to
Los Angeles. Clinton, saying that he was still ``trying to totally
rebuild my life from a terrible mistake I made,'' sought to exempt
Gore from criticism leveled at him, saying, ``Surely no fair-minded
person would blame him for any mistake I made.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will leave a rich monetary legacy to his party. He has
raised $100 million for various party entities this year, according
to Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, campaigning Sunday in Cleveland, promised sick children
and their families that he will make expanded federal health
coverage to all children ``a centerpiece'' of his battle with Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's morally wrong in this period of prosperity ... to have
families go through what's been described here,'' Gore told the
families, after hearing their heart rending stories at a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he would be willing to risk criticism as being a
``policy wonk'' in order to load down his address with specific
policy proposals including details of $500 billion in tax breaks to
advance his social priorities.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he would offer America `a positive speech'' that did
not criticize Bush but would underscore ``some of the policy
differences'' he has with the two-term governor of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   In separate comments Sunday, both Gore and Lieberman continued
to subtly distance their ticket from Clinton's shadow. Gore told
reporters in Cleveland that he would ``uphold the oath'' that he
hopes to take as president on Jan. 20, 2001, adding that he had
given his ``whole heart'' to ``every job I have ever had'' and that
he had ``done it according to the highest values and I will
continue to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said that if elected, he might consult with Clinton ``if
there's a subject where he can contribute advice of course _ along
with President Carter'' but ``I don't anticipate that being a
regular occurrence.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, the Democratic vice presidential candidate who was
the first Democratic senator to publicly criticize Clinton's
behavior in September 1998, reminded viewers on NBC News' ``Meet
the Press'' on Sunday that he had favored censuring Clinton for his
personal misbehavior until the day the Senate impeachment trial
ended.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman also ducked an invitation to echo Gore's declaration
that Clinton was ``one of our greatest presidents'' that the vice
president made at a pep rally style gathering on the White House
lawn following the House impeachment vote in December 1998.
</P>
<P>
   As Lieberman put it: ``History will judge... I'm going to leave
the exact words for history.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman said it was ``fine'' with him if Gore had selected him
to join the Democratic ticket in a bid to neutralize GOP criticism
of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans seem to be campaigning mostly against a guy
who's not on the ballot this year, not on his record because the
record is so great but because of his personal mistakes that he
made,'' Lieberman said. ``That's not fair to Al Gore. Nobody who
knows Al Gore can rightly associate him at all with that
behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush spent the day with Sen. John McCain in Arizona before
returning to his Texas ranch.

LIEBERMAN PRAISES, AND PARTS WAYS WITH, GORE ON EVE OF CONVENTION
</HEADLINE>
  By JAMES DAO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As Democrats prepared to kick off their national
convention here on Monday, Sen. Joseph Lieberman, the party's
choice for vice president, sought to minimize his differences with
Vice President Al Gore on some of the leading issues of the
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But in the process he revealed a new and potentially contentious
one, saying proposals to raise the retirement age for Social
Security and Medicare should be ``kept on the table'' for further
discussion.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking on five different news shows, Lieberman acknowledged
that he had held different positions from Gore on a variety of
issues, from affirmative action to school vouchers to legal reform.
But he scoffed at assertions that his views were closer to the
Republicans than to Gore's, and he praised the vice president for
having had the confidence to select a running mate who differs with
him on important subjects.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is again a mark of Al Gore's strength of leadership that he
didn't look for somebody who had 100 percent agreement with him,''
Lieberman said ``Meet the Press.'' ``We've argued, we've debated,
and I think that's what progress comes from, particularly the
willingness to look at new ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, in explaining how he has come to agree with Gore on a
core issue of the campaign _ whether to allow taxpayers to invest
some of their Social Security payroll taxes in the markets _
Lieberman exposed another rift in their views. While Gore has
insisted that he would not consider raising the retirement age for
Social Security or Medicare, Lieberman said Sunday that any debate
on keeping the system solvent should include that idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should keep it on the table for the good reason that people
are living longer,'' Lieberman said, also on NBC's ``Meet the
Press.'' Later, on CNN's ``Late Edition,'' Lieberman said, ``There
is very little you take off the table if you want to be an honest
public official.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sunday interviews capped a remarkable week for Lieberman,
whose selection by Gore infused many Democrats with a new sense of
optimism about the race. But the ability of television interviewers
to throw Lieberman repeatedly onto the defensive Sunday, over his
differences with Gore and his past criticisms of President Clinton,
suggested a line of attack that the Republicans are likely to
pursue.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has denounced the idea of raising the retirement age for
Social Security, and the party's platform is unequivocal on the
issue. Moreover, the Gore campaign has repeatedly hammered the
Republican candidate, Gov. George W. Bush, for even considering the
notion.
</P>
<P>
   But Sunday, Gore's aides sought to play down the differences,
saying that Lieberman supports Gore's broad plan to keep Social
Security solvent through 2055 by using general tax revenues instead
of raising the retirement age, cutting benefits or increasing
taxes. The current retirement age is already scheduled to rise to
67 over the next several decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Lieberman was suggesting that at some future point,
perhaps after 2055, that it might need to be considered,'' said
Doug Hattaway, a spokesman for Gore. ``But not now.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for Bush, sought to exploit the
apparent conflict, saying, ``Al Gore should resolve his internal
differences with Sen. Lieberman so the American people know where
they stand on this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid the back-and-forth over Lieberman's views, Gore spent the
day campaigning in Ohio and Missouri, making his way west for a
Wednesday arrival in Los Angeles and a Thursday evening coronation
as the party's standard bearer.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats are looking to their convention to cast Gore in a
warmer, more appealing light, hoping to close what has been a
double-digit lead for Bush in many polls. Many delegates spent the
day fanning out across this sprawling city performing good deeds,
from picking up litter on beaches to preparing meals for the poor
to planting trees.
</P>
<P>
   Though the four-day extravaganza has been carefully
choreographed to help Gore step out of President Clinton's shadow,
the president and Hillary Rodham Clinton have already been in town
for two days, raising money, visiting supporters, soaking up media
attention _ and causing some grumbling within the Gore camp.
</P>
<P>
   (Gore himself did little to build a sense of separation from the
president Sunday when he told the Associate Press that he would
continue to seek Clinton's counsel after he left the White House.)
</P>
<P>
   Asked on Fox News whether he was worried that Clinton, who is
scheduled to address the convention in prime time on Monday night,
might dominate the convention spotlight this week, William Daley,
Gore's campaign chairman, said no.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's totally appropriate for him to be here to thank
the Democrats, because the Democratic Party stood with him during
good times and difficult times over the last eight years,'' Daley
said. ``But after tomorrow night's speech _ which is an important
speech for the president, for the campaign, and for Democrats _
this is Al Gore's convention.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats are also counting on the convention to demonstrate
that they are every bit as unified as the Republicans. But already,
some liberals have begun warning that Gore and Lieberman's centrist
positions on important issues may have dampened enthusiasm for the
ticket among vital parts of the party's base, including union
members and black voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only option is Al Gore,'' Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr., an
Illinois Democrat, said at a forum at the University of Southern
California on Saturday. ``But if there was another campaign that
was speaking to our issues that had the possibility and
plausibility of winning, we should support that campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   In his television appearances Sunday, Lieberman repeatedly tried
to put to rest concerns that he differed significantly from Gore on
major issues. He said, for instance, that although he had voted for
a pilot program for school vouchers, he would also increase federal
spending on public schools. And he said that while he had raised
concerns about affirmative action, he did not support efforts to
ban it.
</P>
<P>
   He added that Gore had encouraged him to argue his views
vigorously _ in private. But in public, Lieberman said, a Gore
administration would be firmly united. ``When he makes a decision,
I know what the administration policy will be, his,'' Lieberman
said on Fox News.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, who was the first Democrat to chastise President
Clinton from the Senate floor about his affair with a White House
intern, praised Clinton Sunday for seeking repentance at an
Illinois church last week for his adultery. But when asked whether
he would place Clinton among the pantheon of great presidents, as
Gore has, Lieberman demurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, I'm going to leave the exact words for history,''
Lieberman said on ``Meet the Press.'' ``But I think he has done
some great things as president, which makes the personal mistakes
that he made even sadder.''

U.S. IS CONSIDERING REVIVING MIDEAST PEACE TALKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Changes graf that begins ``Jerusalem remained ...'')  
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House has calculated that the effective
deadline for a final Middle East peace settlement during the
Clinton presidency is the end of September, a senior administration
official said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton is prepared to reconvene a summit meeting _
intense, but shorter than last month's Camp David talks _ but only
if he is assured that the Israelis and Palestinians are ready to
settle all outstanding issues, including Jerusalem, the senior
official said.
</P>
<P>
   The narrow time frame was dictated, the official said, by the
start of the Jewish religious holidays, which stretch from late
September into much of October, and by the return from a long
recess of the Israeli Parliament, at the end of October.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure to move quickly has intensified, the official said,
because the administration has concluded that the Israeli
government of Prime Minister Ehud Barak will not be able to survive
long after Parliament reconvenes.
</P>
<P>
   Recently published opinion polls in Israel suggest that Barak's
popularity has dropped precipitously. If he is still in dire
straits when Parliament returns, the rightist opposition party
Likud is likely to succeed in maneuvering for new elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is not a huge window of time that is available,'' the
administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has threatened to declare a
Palestinian state on Sept. 13, the deadline set by both sides for a
final peace agreement, if there is no such accord by then.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat did not get much support for such a unilateral move
during a recent trip to Europe and Russia, the senior
administration official said. Arafat is expected to continue to
seek support for statehood when he visits leaders of Pakistan,
China and India.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has sent messages to both sides, but is not in the same
intense mode as at Camp David, the official said. There has also
been a ``wide array'' of contacts between senior Israeli and
Palestinian officials, but no direct contact between Barak and
Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Camp David talks ended, ``the Egyptians have made it
clear to us that they are prepared to be helpful'' in persuading
Arafat to make tough decisions, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   One indication of this, according to another administration
official, was the cool reception that the Egyptian leader, Hosni
Mubarak, gave to Arafat's idea of an Arab summit meeting on
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of the Camp David talks, the Egyptian leader
infuriated senior White House aides with his outspoken statements
discouraging Arafat from making a compromise on Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   In public, however, Mubarak has continued to sound a stern note
of noncompromise, saying in an interview published over the weekend
that no Arab or Muslim state could relinquish the traditional claim
to Jerusalem and its holy sites.
</P>
<P>
   Mubarak was briefed extensively about the Camp David talks by a
U.S. emissary, Edward Walker, the assistant secretary for Near East
affairs, who has been touring Arab capitals.
</P>
<P>
   Walker, who participated only briefly at Camp David, has
instructions to tell Arab leaders the broad outlines of what went
on there and to urge them to help Arafat to compromise, U.S.
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat returned to his headquarters in Gaza on Saturday to
contemplate the results of visits to Europe and Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
   France, currently in the chair of the European Union, encouraged
Arafat to continue to talk to his ``partner,'' Barak, the official
said. This was in contrast, he said, to the message that Arafat
received from the French when he was negotiating with the previous
Israeli government under Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whom
Paris considered more of an obstacle to Middle East peace.
</P>
<P>
   In the Arab capitals, Arafat garnered support for his refusal to
compromise on the question of sovereignty of East Jerusalem. But
there was no broad endorsement for an Arab summit meeting that
would develop into a platform for Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   The White House is sending Dennis Ross, its senior Middle East
negotiator, to Israel late this week. He is expected to travel in
the region.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The administration insists that Camp David created a new
dynamic, because issues that had never been dissected before _
especially the future status of Jerusalem _ were broached in a
serious manner.
</P>
<P>
   Jerusalem remained the hardest hurdle, with the most intractable
problems concerning sovereignty over what Jews call the Temple
Mount and Muslims call Haram al Sharif, and the status of the Old
City and the immediately adjoining areas, the senior administration
official said.
</P>
<P>
   At Camp David, the administration suggested that the
Palestinians have sovereignty over the Muslim and Christian
quarters and the Israelis over the Jewish and the Armenian quarters
of the Old City. Another proposal revolved around the Palestinians
having sovereignty over several of the neighborhoods surrounding
the Old City and having administrative autonomy within the walls.
</P>
<P>
   A third notion was to defer the Jerusalem problem for some
years.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the Israelis nor the Palestinians showed much enthusiasm
for deferring the issue while completing a peace agreement on
territory, security and the fate of Palestinian refugees, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
   One of Barak's declared objectives has been to secure an accord
that would enable him to announce that it was a final agreement
ending all Palestinian claims on Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat has argued that East Jerusalem must be the sovereign
capital of the new Palestinian state. ``I wouldn't dismiss the
possibility of getting the agreement on everything,'' the official
said.
</P>
<P>
   The official stressed that the administration remains willing to
do all it can, but only the two sides can actually reach agreement.

FOX URGES OPENING OF U.S.-MEXICAN BORDER TO BUILD NEW PARTNERSHIP
</HEADLINE>
  By GINGER THOMPSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN CRISTOBAL, Mexico _ Looking ahead to his first visit to the
United States since winning Mexico's most democratic presidential
election in 71 years, Vicente Fox said Sunday that he will press
U.S. officials to open the border to Mexican workers and denounced
the violence against them.
</P>
<P>
   In meetings this month with President Clinton, Vice President Al
Gore and Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the Mexican president-elect
said he will also begin dialogue about the formation of a North
American common market. Referring to the successes of the European
Union, Fox said that it would promote economic cooperation rather
than competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will never be that good friend, that good neighbor, that
good partner as long as Mexico is lagging way behind in
development,'' Fox said. ``I think it is a solidarity issue. It is
a wisdom issue. It is a talent issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the market, by itself, will do the job,'' he
went on. ``This job has to be done by the intelligence of people,
by the intelligence of governments, by the talent of our nations.''
</P>
<P>
   Since his election on July 2, Fox has become a towering figure
in Mexico, both because he stands 6 foot 5 inches in his signature
cowboy boots and because he is the first man to seize the
presidency from the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party since
1929.
</P>
<P>
   Relaxed and talkative, speaking in fluent English, the
President-elect met with U.S. reporters at his mother's sprawling,
colonial hacienda to discuss his ideas for addressing some of the
most contentious grievances in Mexico's relationship with the
United States, including immigration, the fight against drug
trafficking and corruption.
</P>
<P>
   At many points throughout the 90-minute meeting, he spoke with
candor unique among Mexican politicians about his country's
failings and its continuing need for foreign assistance, and he
encouraged U.S. officials to do the same when he meets Clinton and
Gore on Aug. 24, and Bush, the Republican presidential nominee, the
following day in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   In talking about immigration, Fox, a former executive for
Coca-Cola in Mexico, called the labor force one of his nation's
greatest assets. He said he will push for the creation of new
programs that would allow Mexicans to hold temporary jobs legally
in the United States _ including everything from unskilled
gardeners to qualified computer programmers. This would mean, he
noted, that Mexicans would not be forced to risk their lives
crossing the border as illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``American labor has its own point of view, which I respect,''
Fox said, when asked about anticipated opposition to such ideas
from U.S. labor unions. ``But the United States also knows very
well that it needs people to grow, that the United States economy
cannot grow at rates of 5 percent or more if you don't have
Mexicans there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a country that was built up by immigrants,'' he said of
his northern neighbor. ``I don't know why today immigrants should
be rejected.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox said he would tell Clinton that the violence against Mexican
immigrants on U.S. ranches along the border _ violence in which at
least three immigrants have been killed this year _ is ``not
fair.''
</P>
<P>
   And, he added, ``we are more intelligent than to accept that as
a fact.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he understands clearly that illegal immigration into the
United States is largely caused by poverty, unemployment and hunger
in Mexico, and in order to keep Mexican workers home, he intends to
turn his campaign promises of 7 percent annual economic growth and
350,000 new jobs a year into reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not possible to have a harmonious, stable border. It is
not possible to solve the migration problem if we don't solve the
gap where a worker in Mexico earns $5 a day, and a worker in the
United States makes $60 a day,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Fox went on. ``Migration can be handled with different
alternatives,'' he said. ``By building up walls, by putting up
armies, by dedicating billions of dollars like every border state
is doing to avoid migration, is not the way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of reinforcing the border, Fox proposes slowly tearing
it down by expanding the North American Free Trade Agreement into a
treaty that creates an open market and a freer flow of services,
goods and workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Europe, they don't compete within each other,'' he said,
referring to the 15-nation European Union, in which citizens of any
one country can work in any other member nation, and passport
controls have also largely been abolished. ``The countries that are
involved, they are partners, so they take all the advantages that
each one has and they put them together.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just can't imagine the huge potential of Mexico, the United
States and Canada 20, 30, 40 years from now,'' he added. ``The
capacity of this bloc of nations would be the best in the world. We
three countries would be absolute winners.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   He said he plans to seek similar open market agreements among
some of the members of Mercosur _ Brazil, Argentina and Chile.
Mexico and these three nations, he said, could be ``the four
machines'' that could move Latin America forward and make it a real
power in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   Although he said that most of his meetings in Washington, and in
Dallas with Bush, would be informal opportunities to meet and
greet, he would strongly propose an end to the U.S.
drug-certification program. Under the program, the U.S. Congress
annually certifies that Mexico and other individual Latin American
countries where there is a substantial drug trade are meeting
certain standards for combating the illegal traffic. Those
countries that do not meet the standards face an array of possible
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   The program has long been criticized by Latin American
presidents as interventionist. Fox said he shared that view, but in
addition, he said the program is ineffective.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not serving any purpose,'' he said. ``Drug trafficking
is growing, drug consumption in the United States is growing, the
introduction of drugs to the United States is growing.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox also said that he would consider ``very positively'' U.S.
law enforcement efforts to win the extradition of suspected drug
traffickers, an issue long the focus of acrimony between Mexico and
Washington. And he promised that, under his government, it would be
harder for criminals to bribe their way out of justice.
</P>
<P>
   Summing up his hopes for his visit to the United States, he
said, ``I want to approach the United States with intelligence. I
don't want to approach it with pressures and complaints. I want to
sit down with the United States and talk long-term and short-term,
and to build, not to destroy.''
</P>
<P>
   In a rare moment of evasiveness, Fox backed away from questions
about which of the U.S. presidential candidates seemed more of a
friend to Mexico. He said he had met previously with Bush when Fox
served as governor of Guanajuato, which borders Texas, and he will
meet Gore for the first time in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates, he said, have appeared interested in improving
relations with Mexico, even if only for political reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Latin vote will be very important,'' he said. ``This will
oblige them to really be serious, to really be committed to Latin
America and to Latin Americans living in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to characterize relations between Mexico and the United
States, he smiled and said, ``The thing I have always said is that
it is a difficult relationship. Sometimes we declare love for each
other, but sometimes we give bear hugs _ too tight an embrace, and
so someone gets hurt.''

LINUX BACKERS PLAN ASSAULT ON MICROSOFT 
</HEADLINE>
   (Exclusive)  
 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A group of key Linux software developers and
major computer manufacturers is planning to announce Tuesday at a
Silicon Valley computer conference the first effort to compete
directly with Microsoft's Office suite of applications for the
personal computer.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, the free Linux operating system has had its greatest
impact in the computer server market, where many Internet service
providers and World Wide Web applications and service companies
routinely use the program.
</P>
<P>
   While Linux has gained ground on the PC desktop as an
alternative to Microsoft's Windows operating system, which holds a
giant share of the market, it has not yet been used more widely by
businesses and consumers because it has not developed the wide
application support enjoyed by both Windows and Apple Computer's
Macintosh operating system.
</P>
<P>
   That may soon change. On Tuesday, a group of Linux organizations
will announce the creation of the Gnome Foundation, which will have
the support of IBM, Compaq, Hewlett-Packard, Sun Microsystems and
several other major computer vendors.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation plans to announce a set of initiatives, including
a unified desktop user interface and a set of productivity programs
intended to compete as a free alternative to Microsoft Office.
</P>
<P>
   Gnome is a set of software standards developed by an
international group of programmers led by Miguel de Icaza. The
Gnome software has been gaining momentum in both the Linux and Unix
communities as a way to offer a common software development
environment for programmers.
</P>
<P>
   Sun Microsystems also plans to announce that it will adopt the
Gnome desktop user interface for its Solaris operating system. The
move is part of the Linux effort to create a larger market for
application developers.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the company announced that it was releasing the
source code for its StarOffice software, allowing programmers
around the world to alter the software and share their work.
</P>
<P>
   The announcements to be made on Tuesday underscore both the
progress that Linux has made toward becoming a viable alternative
to Windows and the challenges that remain in persuading businesses
and consumers to adopt the free operating system.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they're doing is extremely valuable,'' said Dan
Dusnetzky, a computer industry analyst at International Data Corp.,
a market research firm. ``However, there's a bigger issue that has
not been addressed yet and that is the availability of the most
popular desktop applications on Linux.''
</P>
<P>
   While Linux currently has about a 24 percent share of the server
market, Microsoft's Windows has an 88 percent share of the desktop
PC marketplace, while Apple's Macintosh has a 5 percent share.
</P>
<P>
   Linux developers say that while progress until now has been
limited, they are confident they can now rapidly close the gap on
Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the end of the year, we will have a desktop software
operating system that compares favorably with Windows,'' said Mike
Boiche, chairman of the Eazel Corp. The company, founded by former
Macintosh programmers, has been developing software called
Nautilus, which is being integrated into the Gnome user interface
for Linux. It is intended to make Linux as simple to use as Windows
or Macintosh.
</P>
<P>
   A number of announcements intended to encourage interest in the
Linux operating system are planned for LinuxWorld, the conference
scheduled to begin on Tuesday in San Jose, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Hewlett-Packard said that it planned to make Linux
its third ``strategic'' operating system in addition to Windows and
HP-UX, its own version of the Unix operating system.
</P>
<P>
   The Tuesday meeting itself will feature a keynote address by
Michael S. Dell, chairman of Dell Computer, and will include an
announcement by IBM that it will make a Gnome version of Linux
available on its Thinkpad portable computers as a user option.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq is planning to announce that it will make a version of
its hand-held iPaq computer available with the Gnome Linux
operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Several industry executives who support Linux said they now felt
confident that the free software world would soon have a direct
competitor to Windows on the PC desktop.
</P>
<P>
   ``A year ago, we were missing the last mile,'' said Nat
Friedman, president of Helixcode, the Cambridge, Mass., developer
of Gnome and a set of PC applications. ``But at the end of this
year my mom could install Helix Gnome and Sun's StarOffice and have
a total office environment.''

MEDIATE BIRDIES THE LAST HOLE TO TAKE THE BUICK OPEN 
</HEADLINE>
  By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND BLANC, Mich. _ For Rocco Mediate, Sunday's final hole was
the perfect time for a birdie. For Chris Perry, it was the worst
time for a bogey.
</P>
<P>
   A two-shot swing on the 18th hole gave Mediate a dramatic
one-stroke victory at the Buick Open, a triumph he will savor for
many reasons. He shot a final-round, six-under-par 66, a determined
performance under pressure. He won over a strong field that
included Tiger Woods, who settled for an 11th-place tie. And with
his fourth career victory, Mediate showed the huge crowd at Warwick
Hills Golf &AMP; Country Club that while Woods may be the world's No. 1
player, he does not corner the market on providing back-nine
excitement.
</P>
<P>
   Shooting 20 under par for the tournament (68-64-70-66-268),
Mediate finished a stroke ahead of Perry, who shot 68 Sunday, and
three shots ahead of Hal Sutton. With the $486,000 first-place
check, Mediate soared to 16th on this year's PGA Tour money list
with more than $1.23 million in earnings, while gaining the fourth
victory of a 16-year career.
</P>
<P>
   For Woods and other top players, this weekend was a tuneup for
the year's final major, the PGA Championship, which begins Thursday
in Louisville, Ky. But for Mediate, it was confirmation that when
his game is right, he need not be intimidated by anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to play where Tiger is playing,'' said Mediate, a
37-year-old player who overcame major back surgery in 1994. ``I
don't want to duck him. I'm not going to beat him for a career, but
I beat him this week. I'm not going to beat him for the next 10, 15
years. Forget it. I'm not even going to try. I think he is going to
be the best player for a long time. But I beat him this week, and
someone can beat him next week.''
</P>
<P>
   While Mediate celebrated, Woods looked forward to the PGA
Championship, where he will try to become the first player since
Ben Hogan in 1953 to win three consecutive majors. Winning this
weekend wouldn't have upset Woods, but he came to Michigan to work
on the type of shots he will need to win the PGA at Valhalla Golf &AMP;
Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   After shooting a 68 Sunday, Woods felt closer to reaching his
peak. His scariest moment came at No. 13, when he felt a twinge in
his left wrist after swinging hard at a ball that was lodged
against a tree root. Woods dropped his club immediately and began
to flex his wrist, but the pain subsided quickly and he completed
his round showing no ill effects.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hurt quite a bit,'' said Woods. ``I took out a root, but I
hit the top edge of it and moved on.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would've been nice to shoot lower scores, but I'm making
progress. I'm not getting the most of my rounds right now. But
winning next week would mean a lot. It would put a nice little cap
at the end of my year.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Mediate who capped the tournament in style Sunday. The
outcome was decided on the par-4, 435-yard 18th, with Perry holding
a one-stroke lead. After Mediate hit a superb drive, Perry drove
into the rough, and his second shot came to rest just short of the
green. Sensing an opportunity, Mediate hit an impressive 9-iron
shot that landed on the green, 15 feet from the pin. Then Perry
made a mistake, hitting a chip shot that rolled 8 and a half feet
past the pin, leaving him a difficult putt attempt for par.
</P>
<P>
   Mediate stood over the putt that would win him the tournament, a
difficult 15-footer over a ridge. He hit it smoothly and the ball
broke into the cup for birdie. The gallery roared, but Perry had a
chance to force a playoff if he made his putt, so Mediate showed no
emotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to do anything disrespectful, because Chris
still had to play,'' Mediate said. ``I wasn't going to pump my
fist. I don't do that. It doesn't do anything for me. We are
professionals. If he makes it, we go to a playoff.''
</P>
<P>
   A playoff was not necessary. Perry's par attempt slid past the
hole, and his knees sagged in disappointment. The huge galleries
this weekend came mainly to see Woods, but it was Mediate who left
with the biggest prize.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been on the tour 16 years, 15 more years than I thought I
would be on tour,'' Mediate said. ``I have also won four more times
than I thought I would. I don't have the greatest swing, I don't
hit the ball better than anybody, but I hit a lot of good shots
when I wanted to today. It sure was a lot of fun.''

 &HT;    WHAT'S WHITE, SQUARE AND BORING? HINT: NOT AL GORE
 &HT;    By FRANK CERABINO
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Could it be just a coincidence?
</P>
<P>
   I'm talking about the National Democratic Convention and the Los
Angeles Tofu Festival.
</P>
<P>
   Really. A tofu festival.
</P>
<P>
   I had to see it for myself. I couldn't imagine an entire
festival making a big deal about tofu _ but then again, I can't
image an entire week making a big deal about Al Gore, whose new
moniker is ``principled fighter.''
</P>
<P>
   Principled fighter? How did those two words end up around his
neck? I've always looked at him more as ... human tofu _ malleable,
tasteless, and available in firm, regular and soft.
</P>
<P>
   At various times in his political career, Gore has been soft and
firm on gun control, gay rights, tobacco company regulation,
campaign finance reform and abortion. And he has picked a running
mate who has disagreed with him on such fundamental things such as
school choice, tort reform, and the need for a missile defense
system.
</P>
<P>
   So what you get with Gore seems to depend on what else is
cooking _ just like tofu.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why I was surprised the Dems didn't find a way to
reschedule the Fifth Annual L.A. Tofu Festival to another weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Why tempt the comparison?
</P>
<P>
   I got to the tofu festival in time to see a humorous
presentation of ``the story of tofu,'' which included Aaron
Takahashi, 29, inside a cardboard box that made him appear to be a
talking tofu cube.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is there anything that will make this more palatable?'' a
person on stage asks.
</P>
<P>
   The tofu man answers: ``If you should happen to find a bottle of
elixir from the Kikkoman.''
</P>
<P>
   I think a similar play will go on Thursday night when Tipper
Gore tells the story of Al from the convention hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is there anything that will make this more palatable?''
convention planners must have asked Tipper.
</P>
<P>
   So she's bringing some heart-warming family photos to spice
things up.
</P>
<P>
   Lucky for the Democrats, most of the conventioneers stayed away
from the tofu festival, which was held close to the skid row
section of downtown Los Angeles, a place where cardboard boxes line
the sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   And these boxes aren't being used as tofu costumes, either.
</P>
<P>
   At first I thought the boxes were just trash, but then I saw
that they were actually makeshift shelters for scores of homeless
people. Seeing this would just dampen the spirits at the
convention, which features _ I swear, this is true _ a performance
by the Men's Homeless Choir.
</P>
<P>
   Eat your tiny hearts out, Republicans. The Republicans throw a
guy on stage with a sombrero and they think they're being
inclusive. But, a choir of homeless people _ now that's compassion.
(Not to mention, the only music act that can both stink and be good
at the same time.)
</P>
<P>
   Although, I can't imagine what homeless people have to sing
about. (Will harmonize for food?) The guys I saw in the cardboard
boxes Sunday didn't appear to be ready to burst into song.
</P>
<P>
   But you've got to hand it to the Democrats. They've thought of
every compassionate angle.
</P>
<P>
   Even the confetti. The Dems announced that half the confetti
dropped during the convention will be made of ``80 percent recycled
fiber.'' The balloons are biodegradable, 30 percent of the delegate
shuttle buses use alternative fuels, and energy for the convention
will be ``generated from wind, water and sun.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially the wind, would be my guess.
</P>
<P>
   But back to the food.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday afternoon, Gore's daughters Karenna Gore Schiff and
Kristin Gore made an appearance as volunteers at the Los Angeles
Regional Food Bank, a network of charities that feeds over 280,000
hungry people in need.
</P>
<P>
   The quest to feed the hungry, though, wasn't restricted to the
lower rungs of the economic ladder.
</P>
<P>
   Other hungry people in need of a meal at Spago, the swank
Beverly Hills eatery under the culinary wizardry of chef Wolfgang
Puck, are out of luck unless they know the right Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The Dems have taken over Spago, reserving it for one luncheon
and four dinners this week. Sunday night, the restaurant was
cooking up a special menu for House Minority Leader Richard
Gephardt and 1,200 of his closest friends. The menu included
Cantonese duck, roasted salmon with pea greens and coconut curry,
and wild mushroom ravioli.
</P>
<P>
   But no tofu.
</P>
<P>
   I may be able to go the rest of the week without eating another
bite of tofu, which was available in every form imaginable at the
tofu festival.
</P>
<P>
   But the guys who really had their fill of tofu were the
contestants in the tofu-eating contest. The idea was to be the
fastest to eat two pounds of raw tofu.
</P>
<P>
   A little bit of tofu isn't so bad. But two pounds? Yuck. That's
like choking down four days of Al Gore.

MALLON WINS CANADIAN TOURNEY AND $180,000 
</HEADLINE>
   By LISA D. MICKEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AYLMER, Quebec _ While all of Canada was caught up in the drama
of one of its own daughters trying to win the final du Maurier
Classic, the veteran Meg Mallon saw her own long-awaited opening
and lunged for it.
</P>
<P>
   Only three weeks ago, Mallon came up short at the U.S. Women's
Open, tying for second. Earlier in the year, she finished third at
the Nabisco Championship. For most golfers on the women's tour,
such a strong season in the LPGA's major tournaments would have
been exceptional. For Mallon, it meant coming up short in a major
once again since winning the LPGA Championship and the U.S. Women's
Open in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   But on Sunday, Mallon charged into the lead with a birdie on the
seventh hole and never let go. The 14-year veteran ended up dueling
with Rosie Jones to win the tournament with a final-round 69 and an
overall score of six-under-par 282. Jones, on the strength of a 68
Sunday, leapt over the field to take second place at 283.
</P>
<P>
   Annika Sorenstam, who was tied for the lead with the Canadian
favorite, Lorie Kane, coming into the final round, finished third
at four-under-par 284, one shot ahead of the rookie Diana D'Alessio
at 285. Kane and Juli Inkster tied for fifth at two-under-par 286.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had such a heartbreak at the U.S. Open this year,'' said
Mallon, who earned $180,000 for winning her third major
championship. ``It's great to come out on top today.''
</P>
<P>
   All week, the buildup to Sunday's final round had been a giant
crescendo for Kane, who was trying to do what only one other
Canadian had done before. Jocelyne Bourassa won at this event's
predecessor, La Canadienne, in its first year, 1973. The tournament
became a major in 1979. Now, Kane wanted to become the last
Canadian to win the event and appropriately close this final
staging, which will most likely expire because of Canadian
anti-tobacco advertising laws affecting the tournament's title
sponsor, Imperial Tobacco. No other Canadian company has indicated
a willingness to sponsor the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Kane seemed to feel the pressure, although she tried to play it
down all week. She did and did not want to be the country's hero,
but she did admit that she wanted to do her part to make Canadian
companies pay attention to what could be the last LPGA tournament
in Canada. In the end, it proved too much to bear. Carrying a
nation's hopes and trying to win a major championship on the same
weekend turned out to be more than the fifth-year player could
handle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made the last putt,'' said Kane, who shot a final-round,
four-over-par 76 and fought back tears on the 18th green. ``And the
whole time I was thinking about this tournament ending. I told
myself, `Put the ball in the hole and then carry on.'''
</P>
<P>
   Kane and Sorenstam both got off to rocky starts. Kane bogeyed
the first hole, and Sorenstam bogeyed the second. Kane lost another
shot on the third hole and Sorenstam took a one-stroke lead, but on
the fourth hole, Kane birdied and Sorenstam bogeyed for a two-shot
swing that gave Kane a one-stroke lead over Mallon and Sorenstam.
That one-stroke margin was the opportunity Mallon needed to make a
move.
</P>
<P>
   Hitting a 9-iron to within 10 feet of the cup before making a
birdie on the seventh hole, the tournament was suddenly in Mallon's
grasp. When both Kane and Sorenstam bogeyed the seventh, Mallon led
by a shot. She added another birdie on the ninth to make the turn
at three-under-par 33. By that point, she had a one-stroke lead
over D'Alessio.
</P>
<P>
   Kane's hopes faded further when she hit her tee shot out of
bounds on the par-five 14th hole. It was her second straight bogey.
D'Alessio three-putted for double bogey on the 11th and Sorenstam,
who was on the wrong side of the hole all day, played defensively
down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tough day, that's all I can say,'' said Sorenstam,
who shot a two-over-par 74.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who started the day one under par, posted birdies on Nos.
3, 6 and 8 to play the front nine at three under par before adding
another birdie on the 10th hole to trail Mallon by one stroke. But
Jones never got any closer, and Mallon rolled in a 15-footer on the
16th to take a two-shot lead.
</P>
<P>
   Mallon's only hiccup came with her lone bogey. It occurred on
the 552-yard, par-five 18th hole, where her approach shot landed
short and her sand wedge pitch to the green left a 12-footer for
par. Mallon missed the up and down, but knew the one-shot lead was
good enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``After so many close calls,'' she said, ``I'm going to cherish
this one for a long time.''

FIRST LADY'S MONDAY NIGHT SPEECH IS AIMED AT WOMEN VOTERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   By JUDY HOLLAND  
 c. 2000 Hearst Newspapers  
LOS ANGELES _ First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton's nationally
televised speech Monday night to the Democratic National Convention
will focus on children and families, with her supporters hoping
those topics will help her win more support from women voters in
her New York Senate race.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Clinton's official role in her 10-minute talk is to introduce
her husband, who then will make his last speech as president to a
Democratic National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton said Sunday she will broaden her speech to focus on
education and health care, topics that pollsters say are of special
interest to women voters.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's spokeswoman Cathie Levine said her boss is actively
involved in writing her speech and believes ``there are real
differences between the presidential candidates, specifically on
how they deal with children and families.''
</P>
<P>
   A Quinnipiac University poll last week showed Hillary Clinton
trailing Rep. Rick Lazio, R-N.Y., her Republican opponent in the
race, 41 to 46 percent among white women.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also said she plans to use her convention speech to take
some potshots at Republicans. ``The other party offers a recipe for
going back to the past,'' she told CNN.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Andrew, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, said
Clinton's theme of the ``values of working families'' is a natural
for her because she has ``done a lifetime of fighting for women and
children.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is part of her genetic makeup,'' Andrew said. ``We
believe she is an excellent spokesperson and one of the building
blocks of that message.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrew added that Clinton's prime-time talk ``is not designed to
assist her in her race for the U.S. Senate, but I'm sure it will
have the added benefit to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist College poll, said the
first lady's 10 minutes in the spotlight ``is important, but it's
not make or break it for New York.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a chance for her to have a ceremonial role,'' Miringoff
said. ``I don't think the 10 minutes is going to restart her
campaign. She doesn't get a fifth chance to make a first
impression. But if she's successful, she will energize some of her
base in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, after Lazio criticized her for doing nothing for New
York during her White House years, Clinton insisted that she has
been more of an active behind-the-scenes policy maker than a
traditional first lady.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want people to know that, because if someone is going to
claim I sat around eating bonbons for the last five or six years, I
think it's only fair that the truth come out,'' she said last week.

IN THE CALM AFTER A RELENTLESS STORM, N.J. SURVEYS FLOOD DAMAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  By ROBERT D. McFADDEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The 20,000 people of Jefferson Township in north-central New
Jersey came out into the gray windy air Sunday, shaking their heads
in disbelief. Saturday's diabolical thunderstorm _ the one that
wouldn't go away _ had finally departed, having dropped 14 inches
of rain on their lovely, lake-dotted little domain.
</P>
<P>
   It is a place where hardly anything ever happens, folks say. But
Sunday, it seemed, the town had been pixilated: 300 homes flooded,
several bridges and roads washed out, driveways running like
millraces, trees down, cars and boats drowned, two dams gone _ and
the small lakes the dams had held back vanished, too, drained into
mudflats littered with dead fish.
</P>
<P>
   Some power and phones were still out, and water pumps were
chugging away in basements and garages in Jefferson Township,
nearby Sparta and other parts of northern New Jersey. The
Musconetcong River was still cresting, and dozens of residents of
Sparta and Hackettstown were evacuated as a precaution.
</P>
<P>
   But water was receding in most of the flooded areas Sunday, and
officials and residents of Jefferson Township and in surrounding
Morris, Sussex, Passaic, Bergen, Warren, Essex and Hunterdon
Counties were counting their blessings as well as their losses as
they began the cleanup.
</P>
<P>
   No one had been killed or injured, and while damage may run into
hundreds of millions of dollars _ the estimate was $7 million in
Jefferson Township alone _ many town residents were more astounded
than stricken by the deluge that had hit their middle-class,
semirural community 40 miles west of New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen the water high, but never anything like this,'' said
Linda Silbert, a 25-year resident of Jefferson Township, 42 square
miles of scenic wooded hills and winding roads in Morris County
north of Lake Hopatcong. ``Everyone I've seen around town is just
in awe.''
</P>
<P>
   Properly so, said Fred Gadomski, a meteorologist with
Pennsylvania State University, who noted that the storm that struck
New Jersey on Saturday was phenomenal. Most thunderstorms dump vast
amounts of rain for a few minutes and pass on. But this one stood
dead still much of the day, dumping rain on a narrow corridor of
northern New Jersey hour after hour after hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the people in Sparta and Jefferson Township,'' Gadomski
said, ``that would have been a once-in-a-lifetime rain.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Christie Whitman and other officials flew over the flooded
areas Sunday to assess the damage and pledged aid. A spokesman for
the governor, Peter McDonough, said officials would have a
preliminary damage estimate on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Graham, his wife and two children were in their Jefferson
Township home on Shawnee Lake on Saturday when, he said, ``I heard
a deafening noise, and the house started to tremble.'' The lake and
two brooks flanking his house had risen up and engulfed his
property.
</P>
<P>
   He and his family were rescued by police boat. When they
returned, they found the waters had dug a moat around their house,
destroyed their car and washed away their sailboat, paddleboat and
rowboat, and a gardening shed full of equipment. They found the
shed 75 feet away, but the boats were gone. ``I don't know where my
boats are,'' Graham said. ``Probably at the bottom of the lake.''
</P>
<P>
   By midafternoon Sunday, power had been restored to all but about
250 of the 10,000 homes that had been blacked out in northern New
Jersey on Saturday, officials of GPU Energy said. About 50 homes in
Jefferson Township were still without power, town officials said.
Phone repairs also were under way, but there was no estimate of the
number of homes and businesses without service.
</P>
<P>
   Roy Creatura, 63, said his house had ``a river going through it.
'' He explained: ``The water was coming in the front door and
sweeping out the back.''

HAMED IS MORE THAN SELF-PROMOTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Naseem Hamed talks as good a game as any fighter in the world.
</P>
<P>
   He'll tell you how no one possesses the power he does, how his
ability is ``unique,'' how no one really has much of a chance of
beating him in or around his weight class.
</P>
<P>
   However, while he truly believes it, that's merely part of his
wildly successful self-promotion. In more candid moments, the
little Briton serves up a satisfying mix of typical hyperbole and
refreshing honesty that could endear him even to those who'd like
to see his head knocked off.
</P>
<P>
   Hamed, who defends his featherweight championship against Augie
Sanchez on Saturday in Foxwoods, Conn., sat with reporters in a
Beverly Hills hotel meeting room and talked animatedly about what
he has accomplished and what is yet to be done.
</P>
<P>
   He has made more money than any fighter his weight has a right
to make, which is the product of that self-promotion. He's the
model after which other like-minded fighters pattern themselves.
</P>
<P>
   His strategy isn't complicated: Get the attention of the fans,
which he does in part with extravagant, if arrogant, ring
entrances, Muhammad Ali-like brashness and a wacky, yet effective
fighting style once he flips himself over the ropes.
</P>
<P>
   Many fans don't take kindly to his shtick. They find it more
obnoxious than amusing. And that's OK with him _ as long as they
watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love it,'' he said smiling. ``You see, I've always said that
if people want me to lose, fine. If people want me to win, fine. If
people are indifferent, I've got a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have to be interested one way or another.''
</P>
<P>
   In that sense, Hamed, 26, is pound for pound one of the greats
of his generation: He has mastered marketing to the tune of
millions of dollars of annual income. However, he admits that
neither the money nor fame is enough. He doesn't want to retire
merely wealthy and the king of self-promotion. He wants to walk
away with the reputation of a great fighter.
</P>
<P>
   Most observers believe he's a long way from that goal. A common
criticism is he's made his fortune mostly against mediocre
opposition or fighters moving up in weight to face him. His
toughest opponent probably was an aging yet still-capable Kevin
Kelley, who gave the Prince all he could handle.
</P>
<P>
   Hamed admits in his own way they're right.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who comes into the ring with an unbelievable entrance, gets to
the ring, does a front flip over the top rope, taken into
consideration that he could roll over on his ankle and mess the
whole fight up, Who does that?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And who takes his opponents out (after something like that)?.
I don't know anyone in boxing today that brings that. I don't want
to pat myself on the back or blow my own trumpet, and I need a big
trumpet if I'm going to blow it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing is that I feel I have a lot to prove. Don't get
me wrong, I have a lot to learn and I know this.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, a victory over a credible opponent is what Hamed
(34-0, with 30 knockouts) needs.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez (26-1, 23 KOs) is capable. The Las Vegas resident has
won 10 straight _ nine by knockout _ since his only loss. He's
well-schooled and has a big left hand. However, a victory over
Sanchez isn't going to propel Hamed to the next level of
recognition. Marco Antonio Barrera might.
</P>
<P>
   Hamed claims that he's been pursuing the highly regarded Erik
Morales for two years but so far has met with rejection. However,
things have a way of working out: Barrera lost a controversial
decision to Morales to re-establish himself as an elite fighter and
appears to be willing to move from 122 pounds to 126 to meet Hamed.
</P>
<P>
   The two are negotiating to fight early next year. If it happens
and Hamed wins, he will have taken a significant step in terms of
his credibility in the ring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched the fight with (Morales) and Barrera,'' he said,
``and I really think Barrera won. Everyone else thinks Barrera won.
I prefer to fight the guy who won the fight. I want to fight the
best out there.
</P>
<P>
   ``. . . . The Barrera fight will happen,'' he said. ``It'll
happen in March or in May. And I want it to happen because he's a
great fighter. And, Morales, I'll probably beat him, too. Let me
rephrase that. !ital!When I beat him, !ital!when I knock him out,
then the boxing world will say this guy can really fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's all I want.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Stamp act: Hamed, whose parents emigrated from Yemen to
Sheffield, England, before he was born, apparently is a hero in
much of the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
   In Yemen, a country hardly known for its athletics, boxing
participation has grown tremendous as a result of his popularity.
</P>
<P>
   ``There never, ever used to be boxing clubs in Yemen,'' he said.
``And all of a sudden there are boxing gyms all over Yemen.''
</P>
<P>
   He's so well thought of there that his image now adorns postage
stamps.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I get mail from Yemen,'' he said, ``I'm on the
envelope.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Counterpoint: Former junior middleweight champ David Reid
took exception to Fernando Vargas' recent suggestion that Reid
succumbed to the magnitude of his bout with Felix Trinidad in
March, in which Reid lost a one-sided decision.
</P>
<P>
   Said Vargas, who could fight Trinidad in December: ``He
respected Trinidad too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Reid's reaction? Respectful but firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't respect nobody when I get into the ring,'' he said.
``. . . . They say fighters have big egos. Well, !ital!I have a big
ego. I don't think anyone can beat me. I don't know why Vargas said
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I fought Trinidad, things just didn't go my way. My game
plan was to outpunch him, outwork him and I just got caught (with a
big punch). That's when his experience took over.''
</P>
<P>
   Reid, who hasn't fought since the Trinidad fight, had surgery
again on his droopy eye last week. Doctors reportedly were pleased
with the result.
</P>
<P>
   He could fight again as early as November. He's moved up to 160
pounds.
</P>
<P>
   __ Last Hamed: Antonio Diaz, one of the sport's rising stars,
faces Mickey Ward in a 10-round junior welterweight bout on the
Hamed-Sanchez undercard.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't an automatic victory for Diaz. Ward is tough.
</P>
<P>
   __ Rabbit punches: Ben Tackie, coming off a victory over Robert
Garcia, faces another tough opponent in Freddie Pendleton in a
10-round junior welterweight bout on Friday on ESPN2. . . . On
Sunday, Paea Wolfgramm faces Eliecer Castillo in a 10-round
heavyweight bout in Bay St. Louis, Miss., on Fox Sports Net.

RUSSIANS WONDER IF PUTIN CAN CREATE DISCIPLINE WITHOUT SACRIFICING
FREEDOM 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Earlier this summer, the newly elected Russian
president, Vladimir Putin, flew to Tatarstan to take part in the
planting festival known as Sabantui. There he donned a Tatar hat,
stuck his face in a vat of yogurt to bob for coins and then engaged
a Tatar girl in arm wrestling.
</P>
<P>
   What happened next simply astounded Alexander B. Asmolov, a
leading psychologist at Moscow State University, who watched on
television as Putin, a black belt in judo, did not hesitate or
politely feign a struggle, but simply slammed her arm to the table
in a single overpowering motion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked at that and said, `This man has a ton of ambition, a
mountain _ no, a cosmos _ of ambition,''' observed Asmolov.
</P>
<P>
   From his office across from the Kremlin, the professor has
written letters to the new president counseling him to rule with
more tolerance and noted: ``We have a fighter who has come to power
and whose nature is not to play, but to win. He not only is
motivated to succeed, he is maniacally motivated to succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   The only thing many Russians do not yet fully understand is:
Succeed at what?
</P>
<P>
   In almost five months since he was elected, Putin has
capitalized on a voter mandate, high opinion poll ratings and an
economy buoyed by strong oil prices to begin putting Russia back in
order after a decade of wild economic and political swings under
Boris Yeltsin, the country's first democratically elected
president.
</P>
<P>
   In the course of a summer, Putin, who will be 48 in October, has
laid out an economic program that has won praise from Western
governments and pushed a new tax code through a cooperative
parliament.
</P>
<P>
   He has begun a major reorganization of the country's unruly
regions, dividing the country into seven large new administrative
areas and installing his own men over them. He has humbled its
autocratic governors by siphoning off their power and their tax
revenues to the federal authorities and begun the process of
separating a class of super-rich oligarchs from their influence
over the Russian government.
</P>
<P>
   Next, it seems, is the military. After firing six senior
generals at the beginning of the month, Putin closeted himself for
four hours on Friday evening with his national security council _
men who would usually be on vacation this time of year _ to decide
what may be the most significant restructuring of the Russian
military in two decades.
</P>
<P>
   Putin may be proving himself more adept at using the enormous
powers of his office to consolidate central control than his often
ailing predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   But the question that seizes many Russians and Westerners alike
is whether Russia's weak democratic institutions _ a nascent
business class, free press and an ever-changing assortment of
political parties and organizations _ are strong enough to resist
the undemocratic, authoritarian streak that critics ascribe to the
former KGB official who is now president.
</P>
<P>
   Can he meld freedom and discipline into a new state structure
for Russia _ an almost ungovernable land of 11 time zones and
diverse ethnic populations _ that avoids a slide toward the Soviet
past?
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Gelman, a writer who now works with the former Soviet
President, Mikhail Gorbachev, on building a social democratic party
in Russia, said in an interview that Putin had made mistakes, but
was correctly seeking the proper balance between freedom and order,
a traditional feature of politics in a country where power has long
proven indivisible.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very important to link freedom with discipline in this
country,'' Gelman said. ``Russia is made in such a way that it
either had a very strict discipline or it was anarchy. The most
difficult task was always to combine these two things, so that
freedom does not interfere with discipline and discipline does not
interfere with freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   But others see freedom already being compromised.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new team of our new president is energetically crushing
freedom and democracy,'' said Sergei Kovalyov, the human rights
campaigner and longtime protege of the Nobel laureate Andrei
Sakharov. ``Putin is building a country that is neither a
democratic nor federal state. He is building, in fact, a unitary
state based on force and trying hard to create the good old Soviet
idea: unbroken vertical power from top to bottom.''
</P>
<P>
   Kovalyov's critical assessment, which is shared by a number of
Russian intellectuals, including many former dissidents who
suffered at the hands of the KGB, carries great weight inside and
outside Russia.
</P>
<P>
   But it has not dented Putin's high popularity ratings at home,
where many other Russian intellectuals, younger reformers and
liberal members of the old Soviet establishment support him.
</P>
<P>
   Last Thursday, Gorbachev, the last leader to rule over a unified
Russia within an even larger Soviet Union, and a rare visitor to
the Kremlin during Yeltsin's rule, emerged from a two-hour meeting
with Putin and pronounced that his youthful successor was on the
right path.
</P>
<P>
   ``I support Putin's efforts to strengthen order and
responsibility,'' Gorbachev said, warning that ``regionalism is
threatening to lead to the country's disintegration.''
</P>
<P>
   More discipline lies ahead, Putin's advisers say. He is
preparing legislation to reform the country's chaotic system of
customs laws and their corrupt administration and, in the fall, a
major overhaul of Russia's legal system: courts, prosecutors and
law enforcement agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Next month, around the anniversaries of the terrorist blasts
that killed nearly 300 Russians in apartment blocks in Moscow and
other cities last year, Putin is expected to dedicate a new
memorial to the victims. Aides say he will ask Russians to stay the
course in the ``anti-terrorist campaign'' in Chechnya that has
killed thousands, displaced 270,000 people and left much of the
rebellious region in ruins.
</P>
<P>
   Internationally, especially in Europe, Putin's rise was viewed
with skepticism and alarm as Russian tanks flattened Grozny, the
Chechen capital, last winter. But the new president took an
unexpectedly activist role in fanning European opposition to U.S.
plans for a national missile defense system that would not cover
Europe and could ignite a new arms race in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   To the leaders of the largest industrial nations, he presented
the face of an earnest problem solver, visiting North Korea and
pressing its leader, Kim Jong Il to abandon his long-range missile
program.
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Lukin, former Russian ambassador in Washington and now
a deputy speaker of parliament from the liberal party Yabloko, said
that because Russia today has only a weak hand to play as a world
power, Putin is seeking a constructive role to complement his
reform efforts at home. That, Lukin said, will require a Western
orientation, though not necessarily close relations with the
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he added, ``Putin and his staff understand that whether
Russia finds its place in the international division of labor
depends mostly on our relations with Europe and the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   At home, freedom has taken a few jolts that rattled even Putin's
most ardent supporters, most notably the storming of the
headquarters of Media-Most, the conglomerate that owns the NTV
television network, a frequent critic of Putin.
</P>
<P>
   After seizing documents, prosecutors ordered the arrest of
Media-Most's chairman, Vladimir Gusinsky, held him for four days
and charged him with financial crimes related to assembling his
media empire.
</P>
<P>
   The charges were dropped, but only after Gusinsky was summoned
for a private meeting at the Kremlin with Putin's chief of staff,
Alexander Voloshin. The contents of that conversation have yet to
be made public.
</P>
<P>
   Since the meeting, the government-controlled natural gas
monopoly, Gazprom, has been putting pressure on Gusinsky to sell a
controlling stake in his media empire by threatening to call in the
loans that the gas giant extended him in the salad days of 1995-96,
when oligarchs like Gusinsky were helping Yeltsin win re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Yevgeny Kiselev, the general director of NTV and anchorman of
its popular news program Itogi, told an interviewer last week that
Gusinsky would surrender control of his media properties only ``at
gunpoint.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I worked for the government-owned media for years, like many
of my colleagues,'' Kiselev said, ``and I don't believe any wishful
talk that government-owned media in Russia can be independent.''
</P>
<P>
   It may take months before the fate of Gusinsky's empire is
settled, but many Russians already view the case as a most profound
test of press freedom.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very serious mistake,'' said Irina Khakamada, referring
to the government assault on Gusinsky.
</P>
<P>
   A deputy speaker of parliament and leader of the pro-market
Union of Right Forces party, Khakamada supports Putin, especially
for his commitment to economic reform. But her optimism is leavened
with reservations about what she calls Putin's ``enlightened
authoritarianism.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think his personal dream is to demonstrate that a liberal
and enlightened market economy with the help of civil institutions
can be successfully combined with more strict and rigid authority
in the system of power,'' she said. ``The idea is not to strengthen
his own personal power, but to strengthen Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   Many influential Russians remain more skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   As the sirens wailed last week around Pushkin Square, where a
bomb shattered the evening calm with an explosion that so far has
killed 11 people and left more than 50 with serious or critical
injuries, a group of prominent intellectuals and businessmen was
issuing an ``appeal to society'' for a new political movement to
counter any drift toward authoritarianism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russian democracy is young and too dependent on the recent
totalitarian past,'' the appeal said. The Putin government reflex,
of seizing power from oligarchs and regional governors alike, is
endangering the ``main achievements of the last decade,''
especially intellectual freedom, the group said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because it is August, vacation season, the appeal failed
to generate any groundswell response from ordinary Russians, who
anyway have a strong instinct for gravitating toward the existing
power.
</P>
<P>
   For all his talk of reform and strengthening the power of the
center, Putin has yet to dismiss a single governor or mayor, though
new legislation will soon arm him with clearer authority to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Vladislav Surkov, a deputy chief of staff under Putin, said in
an interview that a full-fledged anti-corruption campaign was
impossible, since it would be interpreted as a political purge and
evoke images of 1937 and Stalin's terror.
</P>
<P>
   Surkov said reforming the functions of government was the only
way to fight corruption for now.
</P>
<P>
   ``We inherited a thick layer of problems that accumulated during
decades,'' Surkov said. ``If you think they can be solved without a
certain consolidation of power, as we say, then you are mistaken.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Putin was aware that many people did not see him as
committed to democracy. ``I want you to believe me that the
president is a democrat,'' he said. ``It's true. But I don't
understand how the elementary desire to establish order, and I mean
elementary order, is considered undemocratic.''

   MANHATTAN BEACH, Calif. _ Better start getting used to this.
Better stop looking for the flaws, saying it'll never happen,
wondering if the moment will pass.
</P>
<P>
   The Williams sisters, Serena and Venus, aren't exactly
attempting to conceal their ambitions, though being shy never has
been part of their amazing repertoire.
</P>
<P>
   They've already announced their desire to make the WTA into the
``Williams tennis circuit,'' threatening to turn the greatest
women's tennis tour in the world into their own little backyard
sibling rivalry.
</P>
<P>
   Cue the coronation. Order double tiaras, line up the trumpeters,
arrange for the worshippers. Their time might have arrived ahead of
everyone's schedule, save for their father's. It is happening.
</P>
<P>
   They were at it again on Sunday. This time it was Serena
Williams taking home another title, outlasting Lindsay Davenport in
the final of the estyle.com Classic at Manhattan Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   That meant in the past two days, Williams had defeated the
players ranked the No. 1 (Martina Hingis) and No. 2 (Davenport) in
the world. This after having taken off the last five weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Like she needs a lot of work?
</P>
<P>
   ``I can get a lot better,'' Williams said. ``I haven't even
begun. This is just a warmup.''
</P>
<P>
   Goose bumps just shot up the collective backs of every
professional women's tennis player.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to this, Venus had won the last three significant WTA
events, including Wimbledon. Serena, of course, is the defending
U.S. Open champion.
</P>
<P>
   It's getting so the only player who can beat a Williams is
another Williams.
</P>
<P>
   That seldoms happens, however, since they have this nifty way of
almost never playing in the same tournament, unless it's a Grand
Slam. But they can afford to play as much as they like and remain
sharp, having the greatest practice partners in the world _ each
other.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like playing the best all the time,'' Serena said.
</P>
<P>
   They serve better and return harder than probably any other
player on the tour. Any rough parts to their games have been
polished by their last two years on the tour. They are great right
now and getting better.
</P>
<P>
   Strong and powerful, their finely muscled physiques are almost
intimidating in their single-strap tennis outfits. Tennis might
never have seen any players quite like them. Serena is 18, Venus 20
and they're already at another level.
</P>
<P>
   Others are trying their best, but you have to wonder if the
Willliamses are getting into their heads.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, Davenport should have won Sunday. After taking the
first set 6-4, she was serving and leading 4-3 in the second set
and lost. She was serving and leading 6-5 in the third set and
lost, then got swamped 7-1 in the tiebreaker.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport is too experienced a player to presume nerves were a
factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't remember a match when I had so many chances,''
Davenport said.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport said she played well, and really she did, except for
those uncharacteristic 13 double faults.
</P>
<P>
   But much of that credit has to go to the purple-clad Williams.
There's extra pressure to make your second serve a good one when
you know it can come back at you like something conceived at JPL.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said her feet just weren't moving right. Said that
mentally she just wasn't there. Said she just didn't play well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how I won,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   That has to be scary to the rest of the tour, that Williams can
think her game a mess, play for the first time in a month, and
still beat the best players in the world not named Williams.
</P>
<P>
   The rankings are a bit of a joke, anyway. They're based on a
point system, and the Williams sisters aren't playing in enough
tournaments to be ranked first and second.
</P>
<P>
   As it is, Venus is third and Serena seventh, but everyone
realizes the top two players in the world are a couple of sisters
reared on the city courts of Compton.
</P>
<P>
   ``They hit the ball hard and serve very well,'' Davenport said.
``They're tough. They have a lot of similarities to their game.
Right now, Venus is more consistent. But they both have such
dangerous games.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Open is three weeks away. Serena, who predicted her
victory last year, is not backing off this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know who I think is going to win _ the lady in purple,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   If she doesn't, look for her older sister. The Williams era is
at hand. Next stop, domination.

DESPITE DIFFERENCES, LABOR ENTHUSIASTIC FOR GORE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
LOS ANGELES_ Despite huge differences with Vice President Al Gore
on international trade, AFL-CIO President John Sweeney told
boisterous union members at a pep rally Sunday that Gore and his
running mate, Joseph Lieberman, ``are absolute champions of working
families, our agenda and our unions.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sweeney pledged a full-fledged grass-roots effort to get his
organization's 13.5 million members out to vote for the
Gore-Lieberman ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brothers and sisters, this is the beginning of a historic week
for our movement and for the Democratic Party,'' Sweeney told more
than 800 unionists waving signs saying ``Union Families for Gore''
and ``Working Families for Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be the leading advocates for working family issues here
at the convention and throughout the election, and our words will
be heard,'' Sweeney said. ``Al Gore and Joe Lieberman are absolute
champions of working families, our agenda and our unions.''
</P>
<P>
   Absent was any reference to the principal issue dividing the two
candidates and organized labor: more free trade, which the
candidates favor and the unions do not. As happened when Bill
Clinton ran in 1992 and 1996, Gore and labor have agreed to
disagree on this issue and focus on the large number of issues
where they do agree.
</P>
<P>
   Notwithstanding labor's protests, Clinton, Gore and Republicans
on Capitol Hill have stood together on lowering trade barriers,
from the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1993 to permanent
normal trade relations with China, approved by the House last May.
The AFL-CIO and unions outside it such as the United Automobile
Workers view these agreements as licenses to American manufacturers
to export union jobs.
</P>
<P>
   But labor officials insist that Gore is significantly closer to
them on trade than Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican
nominee. Gore favors negotiating labor union rights and
environmental protection into international trade agreements, which
is ``very close to our position on trade,'' Richard Trumka,
secretary-treasurer of the AFL-CIO, said in an interview with the
Hearst Newspapers Sunday. Trumka accused Bush of favoring
``unfettered trade'' without provisions seeking to improve working
conditions and human rights overseas.
</P>
<P>
   ``He won't give us a seat at the table,'' Trumka said.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Gore and labor agree on how to preserve Social
Security and on creating a Medicare prescription drug plan, raising
the minimum wage and opposing government vouchers for private
schools. Gore also supports labor on preserving federal legislation
that requires contractors to pay prevailing wage rates to workers
on government-funded projects. Often that rate is synonymous with
the union wage scale. Bush supports letting states make the
decision on wage rates.
</P>
<P>
   Because of Gore's record supporting labor in his 16 years in
Congress and seven and a half years as vice president, labor is
much more comfortable with him that it was with Clinton in 1992,
Trumka said. Gore ``supports working people in thought, word and
voting deed,'' he added. About 1,500 delegates at the convention
are union members, about 30 percent of the 4,368 total. Bush leads
Gore by 10 points or more in most polls. Union members at the rally
admitted that their enthusiasm for Gore was guided in part by their
fear of a Republican victory. ``If Bush gets in, we're in
trouble,'' said Barbara Biesterfeld, a retired state hospital nurse
and alternate delegate from Tacoma, Washington.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Labor is a shadow of what it was in the 1950s and 1960s, when
about 35 percent or more of the nation's workforce belonged to
unions. Now 14 percent of the work force belongs to unions. But
since 1997, total union membership, including unions outside the
AFL-CIO, has risen from 16.1 million to 16.5 million. Still, that
number is slightly under the 1994 level of 16.7 organized workers.

A SMALL COUNTY WITH AN IDENTITY CRISIS 
</HEADLINE>
   By WINNIE HU   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RAMAPO, N.Y. _ Upstate New Yorkers think of Rockland County as
downstate, while downstate New Yorkers think of it as upstate, if
they think about it at all. Many know it simply as the first rest
stop after they cross the Tappan Zee Bridge: Rockland, then New
Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   At just 176 square miles, Rockland is the smallest county in the
state (after the five boroughs of New York City) and one that is
often slighted because of its precarious foothold west of the
Hudson River above New Jersey. Even some of its own residents say
that Rockland is just the county you have to go through to get
somewhere else.
</P>
<P>
   Yet geography is only partly to blame for this identity crisis.
Although Rockland has pockets of wealth, it has never wielded the
political muscle of Nassau, or enjoyed the same cachet as
Westchester, its better-known neighbor across the Hudson.
</P>
<P>
   It has never produced a governor, and its most honored native,
James A. Farley, the postmaster general under President Franklin D.
Roosevelt, moved to New York City and was buried in Westchester.
``It's another thing to be chagrined about,'' said Thomas F.X.
Casey, the Rockland County historian.
</P>
<P>
   Now an increasing number of Rockland's citizens are seeking
recognition and respect through a surge of civic activism:
protests, town meetings, even bold threats to withhold tax money
from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority if more local trains
and buses are not provided.
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time, many other citizens are fighting to
preserve the serene landscape and quiet charm that have long
defined their county. Like so many places in the Hudson River
Valley, Rockland seems caught between two contradictory impulses as
it tries to decide whether it is ready for a larger role in the
world and the headaches that come along with growth and visibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people who preferred when Rockland was forgotten,''
said Craig H. Long, a police detective and historian for the town
of Ramapo. ``They were content and didn't seek that recognition,
because it was like a well-kept secret here. When you open up the
county, you invite more problems. Some residents feel the worst
thing that ever happened was the Tappan Zee.''
</P>
<P>
   Rockland _ the name is thought to have been inspired by the
rocky soil _ was carved out of Orange County over two centuries ago
by British colonists and thrived for a time as an outpost for
shipbuilders and manufacturers. But most of the county remained
farmland until the Tappan Zee Bridge was built in 1955.
</P>
<P>
   ``The opening of the Tappan Zee changed everything,'' said
Casey, the county historian. ``It changed Rockland from a
semirural, sleepy county to a much larger county.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly two-thirds of the county is now covered with industries,
subdivisions and roads, while much of the rest has been preserved
as parks or open space. In the past fiscal year, those industries
created 3,100 new jobs, mainly in services and sales. This gave
Rockland the second-highest job-growth rate in the state, after
Putnam County.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Rockland's citizens earn a comfortable living; the
median income for a family of four is $82,400 a year, compared with
$56,200 in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite its growing affluence and visibility, Rockland
continues to be dwarfed by its neighbors. The county has 284,022
residents, compared with 7.4 million in New York City, 1.3 million
each in Nassau and Suffolk, and 905,572 in Westchester.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated Rockland residents say their concerns and issues are
routinely ignored by numbers-driven media organizations and
government agencies. ``Let me put it to you this way,'' said Paul
Adler, a real estate agent who is chairman of the county's
Democratic Party. ``One of the biggest thrills in Rockland is when
the Channel 2 weatherman mentions we're going to have rain. Unlike
Westchester or Long Island, the only time we make the news is when
there's a murder or a flood.''
</P>
<P>
   They are still seething, for instance, over being assigned an
845 area code in June while Westchester was allowed to keep the
longstanding 914 prefix. Though Rockland officials protested
loudly, the Public Service Commission in Albany decided that more
people would have been inconvenienced by the area code in
Westchester being changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously the common goal was to minimize any disruptions,''
said David Flanagan, a spokesman for the commission. ``Westchester
had a greater number of businesses and cellular-phone users that
would have been disrupted.''
</P>
<P>
   Rockland loyalists saw this as yet another affront. ``I'm pretty
upset,'' said Ron Javer, a media account executive from Ramapo, who
likened it to being stuck away in a corner all over again. ``Where
is 845?'' he asked. ``Montana?''
</P>
<P>
   Such complaints are nothing new, of course, in a sprawling state
where 62 counties compete for the same resources. And for all its
grumbling, Rockland actually fares better than many other counties
because it is viewed as a swing district in state elections.
Albany's political leaders actively court its voters _ 70,912
enrolled Democrats and 40,900 enrolled Republicans _ because they
are known to stray across party lines.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Thomas Morahan, a Rockland Republican who is running
for re-election this fall, said Gov. George Pataki and other
Republican leaders had been helpful in supporting county projects.
He pointed to $840,000 in state funds this year for refurbishing
downtown areas in the villages of Suffern, Spring Valley and
Haverstraw. ``While we don't get as much as Westchester, we're not
totally abandoned here,'' he said. ``We are not the poor cousin.''
</P>
<P>
   State and county officials say it is nearly impossible to
pinpoint Rockland's total portion of the state budget, because it
receives money under various programs and grants. But federal money
is tracked more easily, and many county leaders contend that they
have been shortchanged in that.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan S. Karben, a Democratic county legislator from Ramapo, said
his research found that Rockland received only 1 percent of the
federal dollars spent annually in New York even though it had 1.5
percent of the state's population.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a need for a much more aggressive style of
leadership,'' he said. ``I think a new generation of leaders are
going to demand that Rockland get better. I'm not content with
crumbs.''
</P>

<P>

</P>
<P>
   One long-running skirmish has been over what county leaders see
as a chronic shortage of bus and train service. After years of
complaints, Rockland legislators passed a resolution in May that
sought state approval to drop out of the MTA, which coordinates
public transportation for New York City and seven downstate
counties.
</P>
<P>
   C. Scott Vanderhoef, the county executive, said that Rockland
contributed $33.6 million in taxes to the authority in 1998 but
received only $11.7 million worth of service and capital
improvements.
</P>
<P>
   ``They pay attention to enormous numbers,'' said Vanderhoef.
``For them, this is a small issue; for us, it's big. If you're
doing bottom-line stuff, Rockland has to fight harder and yell
louder.''
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Boylan, the MTA's deputy executive director, said
Rockland's size had not been a factor in decisions. The MTA has
continued to improve its services, he said, including pledging $41
million over the next five years to expand and refurbish train
service west of the Hudson in Rockland and Orange.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the MTA has contributed $53 million to New Jersey
Transit for a train station in Secaucus that will be used as a
transfer point by Rockland residents commuting to New York City.
``There are periods when member counties may get more than they put
in, and some periods when they may put in more,'' he said. ``When
they put in money, it's for the benefit of the mobility of the
entire region.''
</P>
<P>
   Rockland's citizens have not always defended their local
interests so vigorously, and they say their county has suffered for
that. First, the Tappan Zee Bridge ushered in traffic and
pollution. Then industries created environmental problems.
</P>
<P>
   The federal Environmental Protection Agency has designated four
Superfund sites in Rockland (compared with two in Westchester and
15 in Nassau) over the last two decades. While one of the Rockland
sites has been fully cleaned, the others remain hazardous. At the
newest site in Hillburn, Hudson Technologies spilled 7,500 pounds
of freon last year that made its way into the drinking-water
supply. Four wells had to be closed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I'm at ground zero again,'' said Geoff Welch, a
musician who moved to Ramapo in 1981 to escape the pollution and
crowds of New York City, only to spend his free time researching
Rockland's environmental issues. ``That's why I'm standing my
ground and fighting. I could move further out, but the same thing
would happen all over again.''
</P>
<P>
   Welch and many others have banded together to preserve their way
of life from the dual threats of development and the ambitions of
fellow Rockland citizens.
</P>
<P>
   In the villages of South Nyack and Nyack, many residents are
fighting a proposed expansion of the Tappan Zee Bridge in their
back yard. But elsewhere in the county, others say it would help
alleviate congestion. A state task force appointed by Pataki has
advocated replacing the aging structure with a wider, $4 billion
bridge and rail system to accommodate the growing traffic.
</P>
<P>
   In Ramapo, a dozen community groups are trying to block
construction of two power plants that they say would drain their
water supply and ruin their view of Torne Mountain, a spot
immortalized by the Hudson River School painters. Yet at the same
time, two other power plants proposed for the town of Haverstraw
have received a different welcome. Many residents there say the
plants will generate more jobs and income from taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Such contradictory impulses have divided Rockland's citizens and
perplexed outsiders who do not know what to make of the mixed
signals. Does the county want growth and more transportation links
to New York City? Or does it really want to hold onto the last
vestiges of a rural life that once thrived here? There seems to be
no consensus.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent afternoon, Welch and his neighbors in Ramapo showed
off a billboard warning: ``Stop the power plants. Once it's up,
it's over.'' But several of the neighbors hastened to add that they
were not trying to stop economic growth, just the problems that
come along with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``People zip by on the highway and they don't realize the
history and the wildlife in this county,'' said Welch as he pointed
with pride to the craggy peak of Torne Mountain rising above
low-lying buildings. ``We have a lot of work to do to bring it to
their attention and give it the respect it deserves.''

POLITICAL WRITERS RIP INTO L.A.
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HARRISON SHEPPARD 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ On the eve of the Democratic National Convention,
the barbs sharpened as political writers _ with nothing else to do
_ turned their attention to the event's host city.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't until I left and came back that I realized every
cliche about this place is true,'' former White House press
secretary Dee Dee Myers, an Angeleno herself who worked for former
Mayor Tom Bradley, wrote in Sunday's Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
   ``The weather is great. The culture is superficial. The roads
are as clogged as the bookstores are empty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politically, this town is more of a cash cow than a think
tank, and, truth be told, it's easier to find people who can wax
knowledgeable about Brad (Pitt) and Jennifer (Aniston)'s wedding
than about the pros and cons of privatizing Social Security.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles, it seems, is the city that the rest of the nation
loves to hate.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it's jealousy, but nearly every out-of-town writer who
traveled to Los Angeles this week for the Democratic National
Convention has delighted in repeating every stereotype ever
circulated about ``La-La Land.''
</P>
<P>
   We're superficial. We're all wannabe actors. We're politically
apathetic. Not that they're completely untrue, but it hurts when
others say it.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a sampling:
</P>
<P>
   From The Associated Press: ``As L.A. events go, a political
convention doesn't rate all that high on the local excitement
meter. `It's not the Lakers, you know?' notes one native.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The president is in town. A man who might be next is on his
way. And everyone who's anyone in the Democratic Party is crawling
the city. But at Venice Beach, the hubbub barely rates a blip on
the radar screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's surfing to be done. A handball tournament in progress.
Tanning to get to.
</P>
<P>
   `We just don't care,' aspiring actress J. Lynn Hoffman says as
she drags her surfboard into the waves.''
</P>
<P>
   From APBnews.com, a Web site about public safety issues: ``The
Democrats are coming to the City of Angels, and so are the hookers.
Police have noticed an increase of about 50 percent in the number
of prostitutes offering their wares on two major local streets,
Sunset Boulevard and Santa Monica Boulevard.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the broadcast media, Sunday was a day of preparations,
more Los Angeles psychoanalysis and navel gazing.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimate policy wonks tuned to C-SPAN, which has been
highlighting Los Angeles issues in its own unique style _ hearing
directly from the source, rather than through a reporter's filter.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, last week, Richard Close, chairman of the San Fernando
Valley secession movement got half an hour to explain why Valley
cityhood would be better for the Valley and Los Angeles. County
Supervisor Gloria Molina was on C-SPAN to discuss Latino issues.
</P>
<P>
   And Sunday, Los Angeles Daily News Managing Editor Ron Kaye
answered questions from across the country about Los Angeles and
national politics.
</P>
<P>
   One caller from Sarasota, Fla., a former Angeleno, described Los
Angeles as a ``city that hasn't found itself.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope it does find itself. but I found it's easier to get
directions on how to locate places in Poland than it is in Los
Angeles,'' the caller said.
</P>
<P>
   Kaye agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They blew it,'' he said about the city's political leadership.
``They let it sprawl. Freeways stopped being built by the early
'60s. The congestion on surface streets during most of the day is
nearly impossible. There's no public transportation system that's
effective despite billions and billions of federal dollars that
have really been squandered in the subway to nowhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he added: ``I couldn't think of ever giving it up or
leaving. There's something worth fighting about in L.A., and I
think a lot of people share that now.''
</P>
<P>
   In the ultimate media navel-gazing, C-SPAN turned its camera on
itself, interviewing its own convention director, Gary Ellenwood,
and broadcasting the location of every camera inside Staples
Center.
</P>
<P>
   C-SPAN is serving as the pool camera inside Staples Center,
sending its video feeds to the other broadcast networks, rather
than having thousands of cameras outnumber delegates in the hall.
</P>
<P>
   So it must have been unnerving to viewers when, in the middle of
the report about the network's own cameras, the screen went black.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just lost our signal,'' said in-studio host Susan Swain,
maintaining her composure. ``How 'bout that? Right in the middle of
showing off, we lost our signal. ... Isn't that ironic?''
</P>
<P>
   The signal came back in less than a minute, however _ to the
relief of the crew.
</P>
<P>
   Said Ellenwood: ``I hope it's not a shade of things to come.''

   Fisher pushing Titans to take final step
</P>
<P>
   By JOHN McCLAIN
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. _ When Tennessee entertains St. Louis in a
preseason rematch of Super Bowl XXXIV tonight at Adelphia Coliseum,
it will be the Titans' first appearance on Monday Night Football
since Nov. 21, 1994, when Jeff Fisher made his debut as interim
coach of the Houston Oilers.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher has come a long way since he was elevated from defensive
coordinator to head coach in place of the fired Jack Pardee. His
coaching career began with a 1-5 record and $300,000 salary.
</P>
<P>
   Five years later, the Titans finished 13-3 and reached the Super
Bowl for the first time in franchise history, losing 23-16 to the
Rams. Owner Bud Adams rewarded Fisher with a new $10-million
contract.
</P>
<P>
   In his sixth full season with the franchise, Fisher is trying to
push the team into taking one step more than last season, when
receiver Kevin Dyson came within one yard of forcing the first
overtime in Super Bowl history. The next step would be a Super Bowl
XXXV victory at Tampa, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a better team right now than we were at this time last
season, but the book's closed on last season,'' Fisher said last
week at the Titans' training camp. ``If we start thinking about
Tampa, we're selling ourselves short. This is a step-by-step
process that builds from week to week.''
</P>
<P>
   Coming off a landmark season in which the Titans set a franchise
record for victories, defeated AFC Central champion Jacksonville
three times, made the playoffs as a wild-card entry and went
farther than any team in the 40-year history of the franchise, they
are favored to repeat as AFC champion in many preseason forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher insists with a straight face that the Jaguars should be
favored because they are the defending AFC Central champions and
posted a conference-best 14-2 record. Asked if carrying the
favorite's tag with Indianapolis and Jacksonville, both of whom
were eliminated from the playoffs by Tennessee, provides extra
incentive to his players, Fisher said, ``The way the Super Bowl
ended was a motivating factor to come back and work even harder.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as we lost, we wished the season could start the next
day. (Running back) Eddie (George) was quoted as saying he'd pass
up the Pro Bowl if he could start working immediately on next
season.''
</P>
<P>
   Next season has arrived. Because of changes in the coaching
staff and on the roster, this isn't the same team that provided so
many thrills making the playoffs for the first time since 1993. The
coaches and players believe this can be a better team.
</P>
<P>
   ``That '93 team was real good, but we were hurt by guys having
their own agendas,'' said offensive tackle Brad Hopkins, who was a
rookie on that 12-4 team that lost in the second round. ``We don't
have any prima donnas on this team. That type of attitude helped us
get this far, and it can help us get farther.''
</P>
<P>
   Gone from last season's team are offensive coordinator Les
Steckel, quarterbacks coach Bart Andrus, linebackers coach O'Neill
Gilbert, offensive tackle Jon Runyan, outside linebacker Joe
Bowden, middle linebacker Barron Wortham, cornerback Steve Jackson,
defensive tackle Josh Evans, free safety Anthony Dorsett and tight
end Jackie Harris.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher has brought in offensive coordinator Mike Heimerdinger,
receiver Carl Pickens, middle linebacker Randall Godfrey, offensive
tackle Fred Miller, outside linebacker Keith Bulluck and defensive
tackle Robaire Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally getting to the Super Bowl speaks volumes about where
we are as a team,'' Hopkins said. ``Coming so close at the end has
made us even hungrier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've got to be more consistent and win more
convincingly, leaving no doubt who the best team is. We've got to
be unbeatable at home and steal a few wins on the road.''
</P>
<P>
   Last season, the Titans moved into Adelphia Coliseum and Baptist
Sports Park, a state-of-the-art stadium and practice facility. They
were 8-0 at home and 9-1 in the AFC Central. The only division team
to defeat them was Baltimore (41-14).
</P>
<P>
   The players and coaches are excited about the addition of
Heimerdinger, the former Rice assistant who left Denver, where he
won two Super Bowl rings as the receivers coach.
</P>
<P>
   Although Fisher's philosophy of controlling the ball by
utilizing George as much as possible won't change, Heimerdinger has
added some wrinkles.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants me to throw the ball down the field more,''
quarterback Steve McNair said. ``The receivers are more disciplined
in their routes. They'll be in the same place at the right time. It
helps me to know where everybody's going to be.''
</P>
<P>
   If injury-prone receiver Yancey Thigpen recovers from ankle
surgery and manages to stay healthy for the first time since
signing with the Titans, he would form a dangerous threesome with
Pickens and Dyson.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Yancey's healthy, we could be unstoppable,'' McNair said.
</P>
<P>
   This season, opponents will have extra motivation to prepare for
the Titans. They get down to serious business Sept. 3 when the
Titans visit Buffalo. It will be a Sunday night rematch of the
Music City Miracle, the wild-card playoff game in Nashville that
featured one of the most incredible finishes in league history.
</P>
<P>
   On a trick play with time running out, Dyson scored the winning
touchdown on a kickoff return.
</P>
<P>
   This season, the Titans are hoping they don't have to rely on
gadget plays to win any games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had confident teams in the past, but that confidence turned
out to be unfounded until last season,'' said guard Bruce Matthews,
who is playing in his 18th season. ``In the past, we earned a label
by our performances in the playoffs, and last year, we got rid of
that label.''
</P>
<P>
   For those fans unfamiliar with NFL history, when the Titans were
the Oilers, they were known as the biggest playoff chokers in
history.
</P>
<P>
   No one is sure how good the Titans will be this season. They
finished 13-3 after three consecutive 8-8 records. Backup
quarterback Neil O'Donnell won't make a prediction about their
record, but he believes the Titans have an excellent chance to win
Super Bowl XXXV.
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell turned down an offer from Tampa Bay, another team
favored to reach the Super Bowl, to remain with Tennessee. With the
Buccaneers, he would have earned $2.5 million more in base salary
over two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came here to win a championship more than anything,''
O'Donnell said. ``When you look back, and it's all said and done,
you want to say you played for a championship team. I have two AFC
championship rings. I don't have a Super Bowl ring.''

<P>
   &UR; By Anne Barnard
</P>
<P>
   &LR; GLOBE STAFF
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Roark performed sur-L gery on hundreds of patients in L
Ohio, Michigan, and Canada before supervisors learned his medical
de- gree was bogus.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen applicants for a gastro- enterology fellowship at the
Uni- versity of Pittsburgh falsely L claimed they had published
re-L search papers.
</P>
<P>
   The chief financial officer of L UMass Memorial Health Care was
demoted to vice president last L month when his bachelor's and L
master's degrees were exposed as fictional.
</P>
<P>
   Falsified credentials have be-L come a nagging problem for the L
health care industry, helping to L spur a whole new cadre of back-
ground-checking firms in recent L years to stem the tide.
</P>
<P>
   Although executive search L  &UR; -------------------- &LR;  firms say
resume fibs are at epi- demic levels across professions, the
problem is particularly worrisome in the health care industry,
where lapses in integrity can not only em- barrass a company but
also endan- ger a patient. Roark, for example, has been sued by a
man who says his botched surgery left him with no feeling in one
hand.
</P>
<P>
   Now, UMass Memorial's will-L ingness to keep Michael Greene on
as vice president has some critics calling for more serious
attention to the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Massachusetts, two areas in which we are national leaders,
edu- cation and medicine, are also two areas where qualifications
and per- sonal integrity are paramount,'' L said Nancy Achin
Sullivan, execu- tive director of the state Board of Registration
in Medicine. ``I think we should expect better.''
</P>
<P>
   While Greene never pretended  &UR; &AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP; &LR;  to be a
doctor _ a more severe of- fense in most people's books _ some feel
UMass Memorial set a bad ex- ample by deciding to demote him, not
fire him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am stunned. It is incompre- hensible to me,'' said Peter
George, a headhunter for Management Re- cruiters International who
said he has located 12 new hires for Mass- achusetts General
Hospital in the past year. ``They should demote L him to
unemployed.''
</P>
<P>
   But UMass Memorial trustees and executives have essentially L
pleaded ``no harm, no foul.'' Al-L though Greene's falsified resume
is regrettable, they say, he has been good for the institution.
Greene de- clined to be interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   The brilliant outsider who lacks the right pedigree but bluffs a
way into success is almost as much an American icon as the Horatio
Alger hero who rises from humble origins by following the rules.
Resume-L bluffing is often viewed as a victim-H less crime,
something ``everybody does,'' job recruiters say.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, claiming false credentials or omitting negatives from a
re-L sume can have real, harmful conse- quences, say physicians,
headhunt- ers, and educators. The harm, they say, ranges from the
physical, such as subjecting patients to treatment by phony
doctors, to the intangible, such as devaluing the sacrifices of
people who honestly earn degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan said the Massachusetts medical board disciplined 17
doc- tors between 1995 and 1999 for em- bellishing credentials _
nothing L nearly as extreme as faking a medi- cal degree _ or
failing to disclose disciplinary actions or malpractice lawsuits
against them. The doctors were fined between $2,500 and L $5,000 as
part of the board's mis- sion of ``protecting the public,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Even with non-physician em-L ployees, teaching hospitals,
includ- ing UMass Memorial, which is af- filiated with the
University of L Massachusetts Medical School, L have a special
responsibility to up- hold academic integrity, Sullivan L said.

   Witt/Kieffer, a national execu- tive search firm that
specializes in health care and has Brigham and Women's Hospital
among its cli-L ents, automatically rejects candi-L dates,
physicians or not, who are found to have falsified a resume,
spokeswoman Susan Nalepa said.
</P>
<P>
   Health systems have a ``sacred trust'' to provide care, she
said, and the leader of the system must be ``regarded as having
very high per- sonal integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   Recruiter and vice president L Emanuel D. Berger said applicants
should be straightforward: ``Most executive search consultants are
L willing to look at an unusual candi- date, perhaps without a
degree, if they have other qualifications.''
</P>
<P>
   Greene built his 20-year career partly on claims he had a
bachelor's  &UR; -------------------- &LR;  degree from the University of L
Massachusetts and a master's of L business administration from L
Northeastern University, schools L he attended but from which he
did not graduate.
</P>
<P>
   The fiction helped get him a L two-year stint as top
administrator at Cambridge City Hospital in the 1980s and a
succession of jobs at University of Massachusetts Medi- cal Center,
which he helped shep- herd through a merger with private Memorial
Health Care. Questioned by his bosses last month after the
Worcester Telegram &AMP; Gazette L raised questions, Greene offered L
his resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of accepting it, chief ex- ecutive officer Dr. Arthur
Russo L said Greene was a brilliant adminis- trator who had made a
youthful L mistake, and demoted him to vice president.
</P>
<P>
   John O'Brien, who worked un- der Greene at the Cambridge hos-
pital and is now its CEO, declined to pass judgment on the UMass
deci- sion. ``Every (health care) system has to make a decision
like that on their own,'' he said, adding that L Greene was a
``hard-driving, re-L sults-oriented'' administrator.
</P>
<P>
   That is beside the point, said L Barmak Nessirian, an analyst
with the American Association of Colle- giate Registrars and
Admissions L Officers, which represents 9,300 L higher education
administrators in the United States and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have all the sympathy in the world with people who feel that
L their performance in itself explains their qualificaton,'' he
said. ``It may be that there are plenty of positions that currently
require a degree L that should not. But the college de- gree
represents a significant com- mitment of resources in terms of cost
and in terms of academic ef- fort. People shouldn't simply decide
that ... they can essentially award it to themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, Harvard L Medical School fired a middle man-
ager who was found to have exag- gerated educational credentials L
and prior work experience, said L Don Gibbons, director of communi-
cations. He said the school checks references but does not
routinely verify the college degrees of appli- cants for
non-medical positions.
</P>
<P>
   The physician who finally L caught Roark _ by carrying out a
routine check with an American L Medical Association database when
he applied for a job _ said most phy- sicians would be perturbed if
they had to work under a hospital execu- tive with a faked record.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to think you've affiliated yourself with an
organiza- tion that's not as assiduous as they might be in checking
one's creden- tials or qualifications,'' said Dr. Lin- da Nash,
chief of medicine at L Ingham Regional Medical Center in Lansing,
Mich.
</P>
<P>
   Her experience with Roark has prompted her to lobby for tighter
credential-checking requirements L for hospitals. She is not alone:
L James B. Stewart's 1999 book L  &UR; -------------------- &LR;  ``Blind
Eye'' criticized doctors for failing to police their own in the L
case of Michael Swango, the physi- cian accused of killing patients
in a series of hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Roark practiced medicine for 10 years, although he never
attended medical school and was dropped L from two residency
programs for inadequate performance. In 1998, he was sentenced to
six to 14 years in prison by a judge who compared his conduct to
sexual assault.
</P>
<P>
   Even criminal background L checks have their limitations. Hen-
ry M. Jiminian, a 33-year-old cleri- cal worker at Massachusetts
Gen- eral Hospital, was arraigned last L week on charges of killing
a man in New York eight years ago. The L charges hadn't been filed
in 1995, when he was hired, and the hospi- tal's routine criminal
background L check wouldn't have caught an out- of-state offense.
</P>
<P>
   Companies afraid they could be sued for hiring people with false
L credentials have fueled the growth of an entire industry of
credential- checking firms, Nessirian said. L Thousands of
falsifiers are caught each month through calls to regis- trars'
offices, according to a five- year-old study.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Connors, of Risk Manage- ment Advisors in Stoneham, said
his firm does about 4,500 credential checks a year, half in the
health L care industry, and finds significant misinformation in
about one-fourth of the cases.
</P>
<P>
   If an applicant lies about cre- dentials, he said, ``how can you
be- lieve them when they come to you with information that's
critical to the health of the company?''
</P>
<P>
   Local credential-checking firms have plenty of stories to tell
about bogus health care applicants.
</P>
<P>
   According to Paul Byron, senior vice president of LCF Associates
in Braintree, which charges $500 to $5,000 per search, one
applicant for a senior position claimed he had L been blinded in a
boating accident for 12 years and regained his sight through
surgery. In fact, Byron L said, he'd been in jail.

A BLUESMAN AT THE CROSSROADS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y., S.C.)   By JOHN W. FOUNTAIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The blues flow with his fingers. Pressing skin to
steel strings and wood, the fingers make the city night wail with
the music of the bluesman and his Manhattan blues band.
</P>
<P>
   His name is Eugene Linen. He is both man and band, with a
curious ensemble of guitar, harmonica and recorded backup band
rolled into one, and powered by a car battery. Linen plays at a
cozy spot most summer nights, just off Broadway. He plays the
washboard to boot.
</P>
<P>
   Born in South Carolina, Linen, a chubby-cheeked 63-year-old with
neatly trimmed salt-and-pepper beard, is not anyone blues
enthusiasts would know. He is no less a bluesman. Sometimes a
bricklayer by day, a ``one-man blues band'' by night. His stage is
a slice of curb on the east side of Seventh Avenue, between 49th
and 50th streets, and halfway between the subway music circuit and
the Manhattan club scene.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of musicians like Linen play on the streets on New
York. There is something that gets Linen's juices jangling,
something that has led him each summer over the last four years to
make the nightly drive from Harlem to star in his own Midtown
sideshow. Is it the $20 bill here, the $10 there, or just the
jingle of spare change that patrons dump into Linen's tin can?
</P>
<P>
   Or something else?
</P>
<P>
   When he connects and the licks fall like rain, when his fingers
and the frets are in harmony, and the blues and the man are one, he
sways.
</P>
<P>
   On a mild Thursday night, the bluesman sits in the glare, on a
self-constructed, uncomplicated stage.
</P>
<P>
   It is late. The crowd on the street is a little thin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hardly anybody is out tonight,'' says Linen. ``But you can
never tell, you know?''
</P>
<P>
   The melody rises in the wind at the edge of Times Square, a
bluesy soundtrack to a life's story.
</P>
<P>
   But there are gaps in this life's song. Missing verses and
dissonant chords, between the past and present, places and faces
that a man omits when telling his life to a stranger.
</P>
<P>
   But within his seasons of picking potatoes on Southern
plantations and his days of gambling before becoming a gospel
preacher lies the story of who he is, and the reason he plays the
blues.
</P>
<P>
   The conversation turns to the past.
</P>
<P>
   It was hours before the red sun rose on the white man's
plantation on Wadmalaw Island, S.C. Half asleep, the little boy
ambled toward the field, holding his mother's hand. He was the
fourth of eight children. With his family, he plucked potatoes
until long after sundown.
</P>
<P>
   He was in the fourth grade when full-time work in the fields
beckoned, and he had not yet learned to read. At 13, work made him
a man. Back then, pubescent boys without a whisker suddenly
matriculated to manhood. At week's end, he handed his earnings to
his mother, Annie Linen, a God-fearing Methodist.
</P>
<P>
   By age 14, Linen had joined the migrant worker circuit with his
older siblings, who worked and sent their money back home, his
youngest brother, Leroy Linen, remembered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ever since I was a kid, they were traveling to and fro, trying
to provide for the family,'' Leroy Linen said. ``Jobs were not as
plentiful, so there was a great need.'' Especially after their
father, Ernest Linen, died in 1959.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, Linen moved to New York to work in
construction, the beginning of the trip that led to the music.
</P>
<P>
   It's 10:20 p.m. The music is loud enough to draw attention, low
enough to keep the police from calling it a disturbance.
</P>
<P>
   Linen plays a range of blues, from the Mississippi Delta-born
slow and mournful twang to spicy soul-stirrers reminiscent of
gospel music, along with finger-snapping melodies. He might play
John Lee Hooker. Or B.B. King. Sometimes even a little rock 'n'
roll. But even when Linen is playing to a track of ``Johnny B.
Goode,'' his rendition is slower, less fluid, less like rock, more
like blues.
</P>
<P>
   His playing is not always clean. Sometimes his fingers seem
sticky, sluggish. Sometimes the notes buzz, until Linen warms up
like a car engine on a cold winter morning. Then Sally cries, and
sometimes she talks. At other times, she sings.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, their music has fallen on the ears of neighbors:
the Federal Express deliveryman who stops by occasionally. The
officers who know him as a regular and nod as they walk by. The
roving street vendors with their cases of sunglasses and fake $10
Rolexes, who pause as they pass, if only to steal a peek into his
tin can.
</P>
<P>
   ``For years I've been hearing him,'' says Peter Petrucci, 26, a
manager at the Sweet Factory candy store across the street. ``The
tourists enjoy it. He's pretty good. Sometimes it's good for
business. It makes people happy and they want to buy candy.''
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, Linen's listeners drift in from the crowds that flow up
and down Seventh Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Linen started playing the guitar at 18. How he learned to play
is one story. How he learned to read is another.
</P>
<P>
   He was about 19, and at a Salvation Army center, staring at a
Bible. A woman assumed he was reading and gave him the Bible to
keep. That night, Linen placed it under his pillow. A few hours
later, he says, the Lord roused him from bed and told him to read.
</P>
<P>
   But through the years, whenever Linen had trouble with words,
his friends showed him the light. He committed each word to memory.
He did the same with the lessons he found on the pages of the
guitar and harmonica books.
</P>
<P>
   He says he first played the streets of New York about four years
ago with a friend. Linen eventually took up the solo act.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting now in a coffee shop on a gentrified corner of Harlem,
he laughs and his eyes become slits as he recalls the way his
relatives jump and scream, ``big Gene, big Gene,'' whenever they
see him coming. But the laughter and words disappear inside his
paper cup when his thoughts shift to his divorce, to the life he
has since made with a woman he calls his fiancee, and to his days
as a fire-and-brimstone preacher. It is not clear why he rarely
ever plays gospel anymore, or why he has not been home to South
Carolina in a few years. Half his siblings are dead now, and so is
his mother, who died in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   He looks forward to going to Wadmalaw again soon, to driving up
the road that leads to the house of his youngest brother, Leroy, a
magistrate for the last 20 years who has a street named in his
honor _ ``Judge Linen Lane,'' the bluesman says with pride.
</P>
<P>
   Leroy Linen wishes his brother would come home for good. ``I
always wanted him to be able to come home and enjoy some of the
fruits of his labor,'' he says. ``I always ask him, `When you
coming home?' '' But he never answers. ``It appears he's in love
with the bright lights of the big city.''
</P>
<P>
   Out on Seventh Avenue, an older woman approaches from the south.
``All right now, all right now,'' she says. The woman slows, then
passes by, sashaying, caught up in the rhythm. She turns and walks
back, drops a fistful of coins into Linen's can. ``All right now,''
she says again, smiling, feeling the connection.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, brother,'' she says, smiling.
</P>
<P>
   Linen peeks up from his straw hat, his face spreading in a
smile. ``OK,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The blues flow with his fingers. And Linen starts to sway.

   DONGGUAN, China _ A banner identifies the bustling warren of
streets in this southern Chinese city as the New Garden Village
Meat and Vegetable Market. And, indeed, one can find meat and
produce in many varieties _ fresh or cured, hanging from hooks or
still squawking in cages.
</P>
<P>
   But the red Chinese characters don't begin to explain why almost
all the shoppers are young and female and look as if they, too, are
for sale.
</P>
<P>
   New Garden Village is one of China's most notorious ``concubine
villages.'' Hundreds of mainland Chinese women here live in a dozen
rows of drab, concrete high-rises, kept there as mistresses or
common-law wives of Hong Kong men. On a recent evening they prowled
the market _ incongruously clad in skin-tight black pants and
clingy tops _ buying groceries for dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, a real estate agent hawked cheap apartments on the order
of glorified motel rooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can rent by the month,'' she said, winking at a passer-by
and the woman with him.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the ties that bind Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland,
there may be few more pervasive than sex. The link is not largely
fueled by quick thrills and anonymous encounters, though both are
readily available. Rather, it is based on a remarkably durable web
of relationships that have flowered between relatively poor Chinese
women and more affluent Hong Kong men, whose jobs require them to
spend days or weeks at a time in the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Hong Kong reverted to Chinese rule in 1997, the
border between the two had become increasingly porous. Hong Kong
companies set up scores of factories in cities like Dongguan,
dispatching managers to oversee the assembly lines and truck
drivers to haul goods to and fro.
</P>
<P>
   Whether to soothe their loneliness, stroke their egos or indulge
their fantasies, many of these commuters support mistresses or de
facto second wives. Concubine villages have sprouted up across
Guangdong province.
</P>
<P>
   To some of these Lotharios, having a mistress is a totem of
success _ proof that they can afford to maintain two households.
Granted, the cost of housing in Guangdong is a fraction of that in
Hong Kong. Two-bedroom apartments in New Garden Village rent for as
little as $195 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the affordability of the practice, anthropologists say it
is deeply rooted in Chinese culture: The emperors had their
concubines, Mao was famous for his serial conquests and traders
kept spouses in every port. In Hong Kong, even when it was a
rule-bound British colony, concubines were legal until 1971.
</P>
<P>
   But now the Chinese government is starting to view wholesale
adultery as a social menace, and it is cracking down.
</P>
<P>
   In July, the Guangdong authorities sentenced a Hong Kong man to
10 months in jail for living in ``factual bigamy.'' The man, Choi
Kai-pang, had a wife in Hong Kong but lived with a mainland woman
in the border city of Shenzhen. The couple even had a phony Chinese
marriage certificate.
</P>
<P>
   Men who do not pretend to be married to their mistresses are
only slightly less at risk. Guangdong recently changed its laws to
make long-term cohabitation by unmarried couples a crime. Although
a single act of adultery is not illegal, a man who lives with a
woman to whom he is not married can be sent to a labor camp for two
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government is taking measures to prohibit this behavior
because the affairs have caused family problems and violence,''
said Paulina C.Y. Kwok, a social worker with the charity Caritas
Hong Kong, who counsels the wives of wayward men. ``They say it
goes against Chinese values.''
</P>
<P>
   Women's groups in China contend that the proliferation of
extramarital sex corrodes the Chinese family. Though the problem is
most acute in freewheeling southern China, mass migration and
economic dislocation have made infidelity a problem across the
country. The children who result from these liaisons also make
Beijing's family-planning policies less effective, prompting some
legal experts to call for marriage laws that mandate cohabitation
with one's spouse.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The changes will not come soon enough for Mrs. Lam, a Hong Kong
woman who says her 26-year marriage has been devastated by her
husband's philandering on the mainland. She declined to give her
full name to avoid embarrassment. Four years ago, the couple moved
to a village in Guangdong to start a fish-breeding farm. Her
husband visited karaoke bars, where he met young women from rural
China who worked as prostitutes.
</P>
<P>
   When Mrs. Lam returned to Hong Kong for a lengthy medical
procedure in 1997, her husband secretly took a mistress, she said.
He rented a cozy apartment for the woman in a neighboring town and
lent her his wife's clothes. In addition to rent, her husband paid
the woman several thousand dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``These mainland women have beautiful skin and pretty faces,''
Mrs. Lam said, her face creased with sorrow and bitterness. ``They
know how to please another woman's husband. They do it for economic
stability.''
</P>
<P>
   To save her marriage, Mrs. Lam, 48, demanded that her husband
move back to Hong Kong. But recently she discovered that he had
taken up with yet another woman. She contends that the morals of
Guangdong have corrupted her husband, making him believe that
mistresses are the social norm.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in some ways, the concubine village here seems less a
red-light district than a starter community. Women wheel babies,
stopping to browse for kitchen utensils. Children scamper around a
leafy park.
</P>
<P>
   But there are reminders that New Garden Village is no Mayberry.
Next to the kitchen shop is a beauty salon, where little hair was
being cut. Instead, three heavily made-up young women loitered on a
divan, waiting for customers.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   One Hong Kong factory manager who has commuted to China since
1993 predicts the new laws will not curb the problem. For one
thing, the police will arrest a man on charges of bigamy or illegal
cohabitation only if a complaint is lodged against him here. Hong
Kong and China are separate legal jurisdictions.
</P>
<P>
   A Hong Kong woman who wants to haul her husband into a Chinese
court must also make sure that the state can prove he is living
with a mistress _ not easy to do in the rent-by-the-month world of
concubine villages.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many in Hong Kong are sure to welcome the crackdown. The
territory has watched nervously as its men have sired a generation
of illegitimate children _ 520,000 by one estimate _ with one foot
in the mainland and one in Hong Kong. Last year, a local court
briefly granted those children residency in Hong Kong; the ruling
was overturned by the Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
   ``If men are in danger of going to prison, they may control
their impulses,'' said Kwok, the social worker.
</P>
<P>
   But she added that laws alone would not solve the problem.
China, she said, must improve the status of women, particularly the
young, penniless ones who pour in from the hinterland. ``If these
women can get real jobs, if their status in society improves, they
won't get into this business to begin with,'' Kwok said.

   NEW YORK _
</P>
<P>
   Dear Diary:
</P>
<P>
   I was sitting in the front of one of those new double-length
79th Street crosstown buses heading west when a young woman got on
and sat in the first seat behind the driver. Her cell phone rang.
She answered and then looked to the back of the bus and waved.
Seated across from her, I was privy to the conversation, and this
is what transpired.
</P>
<P>
   The man she had waved at, obviously a friend who knew her
number, was calling her from the far rear of the bus. After
exchanging pleasantries, she explained that she was sitting in the
front because she was going to Park Avenue, and as there was no
stop there, she was getting off at Lexington. Leaving by the front
door was closer for her.
</P>
<P>
   He was also getting off at Lexington, but since he was going to
the Lexington Avenue subway, the back exit was closer for him.
Neither one considered moving seats. As they approached Lexington,
they said their cell-phone goodbyes: The young woman signed off
with ``Next time we're on a bus together, give me a call.''
</P>
<P>
   They both got off and went their separate ways. They had saved a
few steps and missed any personal contact.

   Brooklyn friends define ``nanosecond'' as the amount of time
that lapses between traffic lights turning green and someone
honking his horn.
</P>
<P>
   I had a recent example of that as I was driving down Franklin
Street. The traffic light at the next intersection turned amber and
I slowly came to a stop. There was a single car waiting at the
cross street _ no cars in front or behind. But like Pavlov's dog,
as soon as the light turned green, the driver honked his horn, then
quickly made a left turn and drove away. I wonder if he even
realized what he had done.

   A month before prom time, Bee Johnson spotted a freshwater pearl
necklace, bracelet and earrings that she thought would be a perfect
gift for her 17-year-old granddaughter, Claire Johnson. The letter
she received, after the traditional thanks, went on to say:
</P>
<P>

   Dear Diary:
</P>
<P>
   It was a bright and cool day when I saw a small elderly woman,
somewhat shabby but neat, leaning on a late-model Cadillac, holding
a paper coffee cup. She looked very much like my long-departed
mother and I couldn't help but smile at her. She returned the
smile. My eyes began to fill with impending tears. I dug into my
pocket and gathered about $2 worth of quarters saved for street
telephone use, walked up to her and emptied the coins in her
container.
</P>
<P>
   To my horror _ and hers _ the container was filled with coffee.
She had a few words for me that I know my mother would never have
used. I stood motionless as she opened the car door and drove away,
leaving the spilled container and the coins at my feet. Beware of
bearing unwanted gifts.

   It was one of those very hot days and the Long Island Rail Road
car, still at Pennsylvania Station, was sweltering.
</P>
<P>
   Cadets from the Police Academy, still dressed in their uniforms
and with duffel and garment bags scattered about, were in the car
where I was sitting. They were all basically slumped over,
overheated and exhausted, holding water bottles and barely speaking
to one another.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the train doors were closing, a young, attractive woman
got on. Her hair was pulled up with beautiful ornaments, and she
was wearing a flowered minidress and high-heeled sandals. The heat
seemed not to have affected her.
</P>
<P>
   Her face lit up as she spotted the young men. ``Oh, wow!'' she
exclaimed. ``Are you guys cadets from the Police Academy?''

like wearing polyester,'' he said.

and true to her luck, the man in front of her was about 6 feet 3
inches with a large head and broad back. She spent the first act
weaving back and forth in an effort to keep up with the action.

   At intermission, the man turned to her and asked if she was
having difficulty seeing. When she said she was, the woman he was
with turned around and said, ``I know your problem,'' and insisted
that Gunzenhauser change seats with her. The second act was enjoyed
without stress.

   He asked Schwalb her occupation and she told him she was a

destination, he not only refused her tip but even handed her an
extra dollar and told her to buy something for the children she
tutored. The next time she took her students on an outing, she gave
each of them money for a video game and made sure they knew about
the driver.

HAROLD PIERSON, DANCER AND ACTOR, DIES AT 66
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Pa., N.Y.)  By JENNIFER DUNNING   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Harold Pierson, a dancer, actor and educator, died on Aug. 1 in
Manhattan. He was 66 and lived in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a heart attack, said Joan Myers Brown, the founder
and artistic director of the Philadelphia Dance Company.
</P>
<P>
   Pierson was the former artistic director of the Philadelphia
company, also known as Philadanco; he was a choreographer and
teacher for the troupe.
</P>
<P>
   He directed and helped write the video script for ``On the
Shoulders of Our Ancestors,'' a multimedia work presented by
Philadanco in June at the Joyce Theater in Chelsea.
</P>
<P>
   Pierson trained in dance with Robert Joffrey and Valentina
Pereyaslavec and in acting with Louis Gossett Jr. and Sanford
Meisner.
</P>
<P>
   He played a quiet but important role in the development of many
black modern-dance choreographers' careers from the 1950s on,
performing with the companies of Alvin Ailey, Syvilla Fort,
Geoffrey Holder, Louis Johnson, Matt Mattox, Donald McKayle and
Olatunji. He danced in the premiere of McKayle's classic ``Rainbow
'Round My Shoulder'' in 1959.
</P>
<P>
   Pierson also performed in the Broadway and touring casts of
musicals, including ``Golden Boy,'' ``Sweet Charity,'' ``Cry, the
Beloved Country'' and ``Purlie.''
</P>
<P>
   He was the artistic director for the Black Dance America
Festival presented by the Brooklyn Academy of Music in 1983. He
also held a visiting professorship at Howard University in the
College of Fine Arts and Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   Pierson is survived by his sisters, Dorothy Johnson and Agnes
Hamilton, both of St. Albans, Queens, and his brother, Benjamin.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The man who ignited a fierce gun battle with police
in Brooklyn on Saturday _ a shootout that left four officers
wounded and led to his own death _ lived a reclusive life, sulking
in his parents' home, according to police authorities and some of
his neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Alalouf kept a shabby room in his parent's basement. He
took Xanax, a prescription drug used to calm anxiety. He was known
to swear loudly at his several large dogs. And he stockpiled enough
weapons for a platoon.
</P>
<P>
   Alalouf, 47, also managed to remain so secretive and anti-social
that some of his neighbors in the Gravesend section of Brooklyn did
not realize he still lived among them, until the gunfire rang out
Saturday afternoon and heavily armed police officers began to be
evacuated in ambulances while helicopters thumped overhead.
</P>
<P>
   It was one of the most violent police gun battles of the last
decade, ending only after four officers had been shot and Alalouf
was dead. And apparently, the police said, it was planned _ the
final act of a man who had lived for years as something of a hermit
but who chose to draw the police into a shootout for an extremely
public end.
</P>
<P>
   Milton John, the father of one of the injured officers, called
it ``suicide by cop.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the authorities said, the day before Alalouf opened
fire on a police Emergency Service Unit, he broke from his
seclusion and made a rare trip out of his house. He went to a gun
shop.
</P>
<P>
   Alalouf hardly needed any more weapons. A search of his home
after the police killed him turned up a literal armory of pistols,
rifles and shotguns in his basement and a stack of samurai swords
in a first-floor closet. He also had Bowie knives and daggers, the
police said, and boxes on boxes of small-arms ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   But the authorities said that on Friday, Alalouf bought two new
guns: a pump-action shotgun, mounted on a pistol grip, and a Ruger
Mini-14, a compact assault rifle. He also bought ammunition: 15
buckshot shells for the shotgun, and 120 rounds for the Mini-14.
</P>
<P>
   And then he went home and began to unravel.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities said Alalouf had shown signs of bad intentions
earlier. He had recently asked his mother to buy him gas cans, duct
tape and propane, and said he wanted to burn the house down. She
refused to help him.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday morning, Alalouf, dressed in surplus military
fatigues, frightened his parents from their home, telling them he
would kill the first police officer he saw. His parents hurried to
the 61st Precinct station house and alerted the police.
</P>
<P>
   When the first members of a police Emergency Service Unit
approached the house, he opened fire through the window, striking
Officer Gregory John in the shoulder and knocking him to the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   William H. Allee Jr., the chief of detectives, said the rest of
the unit overwhelmed Alalouf with a heavy volume of gunfire.
Alalouf then fled and found refuge in a yard two houses away. The
police, unaware that he had gone, remained positioned outside
Alalouf's home. Several hours later, they stormed the house and
found it empty. But they soon converged on his hiding place. A
second exchange ensued, and Alalouf ran into a second house and out
the back door, where the officers opened fire again, killing him.
</P>
<P>
   Three other officers struck in the final exchange were Jose
Guerra, 34, ined who remained in an intensive care unit last night;
Joseph Ocasio, 43, who along with Officer John, remained
hospitalized in stable condition, and James McGrath, 33, who was
treated and released.
</P>
<P>
   ``The police officers that subdued him did a wonderful job under
tremendous stress,'' Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said. ``To have
executed this without the loss of innocent human life is
remarkable.''
</P>
<P>
   At home, Alalouf kept many of his neighbors on edge.
</P>
<P>
   One woman said he fashioned a peephole in his fence through
which he sometimes peered out. Another man, Boris Kaminyar, said he
took care to avoid his strange neighbor four years ago, when
Alalouf threw old shoes and feces into his back yard.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the details of Alalouf's life remain sketchy. The city's
Department of Corrections said that he worked as a prison guard at
an adolescent unit on Rikers Island from June 1982 to November
1984, and had been the subject of two complaints alleging that he
had used excessive force. But the complaints were ruled minor
incidents, a law enforcement official said, and neither the inmates
nor him were injured.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said that Alalouf had no known criminal record.

EDITORIAL: THE INDISPENSABLE STATE 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Aug. 14:
</P>
<P>
   Seemingly overnight, California has become for Democrats what
the South once was in national elections _ their indispensable
electoral building block. So it is fitting for them to celebrate in
Los Angeles what they hope will prove a seamless transition from
the Age of Clinton to the Age of Gore.
</P>
<P>
   In no other state has the triumph of Clintonism been greater.
The magnitude of this triumph was evident at the Republican
convention in Philadelphia. Not a single power broker hailed from
the nation's largest state _ a state without which no Republican
presidential candidate won the presidency in the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   Among the throngs of congressional leaders and governors
assembled in Philadelphia, the only statewide Republican
officeholder from California was Secretary of State Bill Jones. And
he had endorsed John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Things have gotten that bad for Republicans in the state of Earl
Warren, Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan _ a state that was
represented on more than half the GOP's postwar presidential
tickets. Lest his party's delegates forget they are reveling in
what was once called Reagan Country, President Clinton may want to
remind his hosts Monday evening that in 1992 he was the first
Democratic presidential candidate since Lyndon Johnson to carry the
state.
</P>
<P>
   The contested center of Californian politics has long been
fiscally conservative and socially liberal, and Clinton helped
break the Republican dominance in the state by catering to these
affinities. Positioning his as the party of balanced budgets and
free trade left Republicans to wallow in the morass of immigration,
abortion and guns.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats may want to pay homage to the special role of Pete
Wilson, the former Republican governor, in the state party's
reversal of fortunes. His anti-immigrant crusade, a political
blunder of epic proportions, may keep the state in the Democratic
column long after the adopted son from Arkansas (this is the
president's 55th trip to California while in office) leaves the
scene.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson fashioned his anti-immigrant pitch in the throes of a
devastating recession early in the 1990s, one made more severe than
elsewhere in the nation by the post-Cold War downsizing of the
state's defense industry. At the time, appealing to disgruntled
middle-class whites seemed like a winning strategy. Indeed, Wilson
was re-elected in 1994 while backing Proposition 187, an initiative
to deprive illegal immigrants of access to education and other
social services.
</P>
<P>
   But the long-term damage to the party proved devastating. Along
with other Republican-backed measures aimed at overturning
bilingual education and affirmative action, Proposition 187 drove a
whole generation of Hispanics into the Democratic fold. Wilson
garnered 44 percent of the Hispanic vote when he first ran for
governor in 1990. By 1998, however, the Republican gubernatorial
candidate, Dan Lungren, received less than 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, the GOP's is a shrinking slice of a rapidly growing pie.
Hispanics make up about a third of the state's population and are
expected to become the majority in the next half-century.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, many of the less-educated, disgruntled Anglos who may
have applauded the state Republican Party's drift to the right have
left the state. The recession triggered a massive migration, well
over a million of them, in the first half of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   To those who remained in California to experience the current
tide of prosperity, the party leadership's view of immigration as
more of a threat than an opportunity seemed bizarrely defeatist.
Where once Ronald Reagan rhapsodized about America being a shining
city on a hill, Pete Wilson now wanted to build a moat around it.
</P>
<P>
   But a word of caution is in order for California Democrats as
they uncork the champagne bottles this week. Independents, not
Democrats, are the only growing category of registered voters.
Recent polls suggest the race could be closer in California than
previously thought, and Vice President Al Gore's choice of Sen.
Joseph Lieberman as his running mate could dampen the enthusiasm of
the party's Hollywood backers.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats would also be foolish to take the votes of Hispanics,
those Americans most likely to still live in a traditional family,
for granted. This is particularly true if Gov. George W. Bush
succeeds in his effort to broaden his party's voting base.
</P>
<P>
   In his book ``Cadillac Desert,'' Marc Reisner called California
a ``beautiful fraud,'' referring to how much of the desert state
was transformed into a verdant mirage. It may yet prove that, to
political analysts too eager to read permanence into the current
political snapshot. Things change, especially in Reagan Country.

 &HT;    CLINTON MUST EMBRACE GORE _ BUT NOT TOO CLOSELY
 &HT;    Eds: Inserts grafs 5-7 with Clinton comments Sunday.
 &HT;    780&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS and JILL VEJNOSKA
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Two years after enmeshing his fellow Democrats in
a scandal that shook the nation, President Clinton is poised to
deliver a triumphant valedictory address Monday night to a party
reborn.
</P>
<P>
   When he speaks to the Democratic National Convention in Los
Angeles, however, Clinton must do more than burnish an imperfect
legacy by touting his role presiding over eight years of peace and
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   He must somehow make Americans believe it couldn't have happened
without Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has to tell them that the last eight years have been the
greatest achievement since sliced bread, and that Al Gore was an
integral part of that success,'' said political scientist Gary
Segura of Claremont Graduate University, Claremont, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton hinted Sunday night that his speech would not be devoid
of partisan overtones.
</P>
<P>
   At a gathering sponsored by four Jewish interest groups at the
Sony Pictures studio in Culver City, Clinton said he ``wanted to
say a few words about the peace process in the Middle East.''
</P>
<P>
   He then quickly added: ``You'll hear enough election rhetoric
elsewhere'' _ and, then, leaning into the podium and grinning,
added, ``and maybe a little from me tomorrow night.''
</P>
<P>
   For months now, at political fund-raisers, campaign speeches and
press conferences, Clinton has labored to give Gore his due,
portraying the vice president as a man of integrity and a full
partner in the policies behind the administration's successes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has made an absolutely incalculable contribution to
whatever good we've accomplished in the White House,'' Clinton said
at a Democratic fund-raiser in Washington in June.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond lip service, helping Gore has always been a complicated
trick for Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The closer Gore stands to the charismatic Clinton, for one
thing, the more vice-presidential he looks.
</P>
<P>
   That's one reason Gore won't be seen at all with Clinton in Los
Angeles. The two will meet instead at a rally Tuesday in Michigan,
where Clinton will charge his No. 2 with the mission of keeping the
keys to the White House in Democratic hands.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard also for Gore to cozy up to Clinton's coattails
without smudging his own attire.
</P>
<P>
   It was two years ago this week that Clinton went before the
nation to confess that he had an ``inappropriate'' relationship
with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky, after publicly
denying it for eight tumultuous months.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton survived a bid to remove him from office. But
Republicans want Gore to pay the price for standing by his boss and
calling Clinton ``a man I believe will be regarded in the history
books as one of our greatest presidents'' on the night the House
voted impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our generation has a chance to reclaim some essential values,
to show we have grown up before we grow old,'' presidential nominee
George W. Bush told the GOP convention. ``But when the moment for
leadership came, this administration did not teach our children, it
disillusioned them.''
</P>
<P>
   Some pundits have suggested that Clinton owes it to Gore to make
clear in his speech that his personal conduct had nothing to do
with his vice president.
</P>
<P>
   But there's nothing in Clinton's past to suggest that he would
turn a celebration of the life and times of the man from Hope into
yet another public confessional, and White House spokesman Joe
Lockhart dismissed such speculation as ``hot air.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is his valedictory speech, his swan song,'' said
government professor Phil Klinkner of Hamilton College in Clinton,
N.Y. ``For him to bring up something that is clearly the low point
of his political career, the low point of his personal life, it's
probably not something he would want to dwell on.''
</P>
<P>
   The odds that Clinton will raise the topic Monday were
diminished by the president's extraordinary confessional last week
before a ministers conference in suburban Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm now in the second year of a process of trying to totally
rebuild my life from a terrible mistake I made,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   And in a bid to distance Gore from the scandal, Clinton said
that his vice president ``doesn't get enough credit for what we did
together that is good, and surely, no fair-minded person would
blame him for any mistake that I made.''
</P>
<P>
   Since arriving in Los Angeles on Friday, Clinton has taken
further steps to accommodate Gore. Amid concerns that his packed
pre-convention schedule would overshadow Gore's campaign message,
the president canceled a round of televised interviews Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Many of his events, including high-dollar fund-raisers with some
of Hollywood's biggest stars, have been closed to the press
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   What Clinton has been stressing in recent speeches is his role
in turning the country around and the importance of avoiding a
U-turn toward the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1992, the country was in trouble,'' Clinton told supporters
at a fund-raising dinner for the U.S. Senate campaign of First Lady
Hillary Rodham Clinton in McLean, Va., last Wednesday night. ``I
mean, our backs were against the wall.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton gets much public credit for the longest and largest
economic expansion in the country's history, even though it began
in March 1991, nearly two years before he took office.
</P>
<P>
   On his watch, though, the economy has generated 22 million new
jobs. Over the past year alone the economy has grown a blistering 6
percent, after adjusting for moderate inflation of just above 2
percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton gets some credit, as well, for the dramatic turnaround
in the federal budget, which was $290 billion in the red in 1992
and is on track to be $211 billion in the black this year. Surely
Clinton will make the case Monday that he has led the charge on
policies that have helped take the budget from record deficit to a
record surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, though, has no plans to step into the shadows. He has
set aside the entire month of September for high-profile battles
with the Republican-led Congress over next year's budget, as well
as banner Democratic issues such as the quest for a so-called
patient's bill of rights, a minimum wage hike and increased gun
controls.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to have a very healthy debate in the month of
September, where the president tries to get these things
accomplished,'' said Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   In his convention speech, he's sure to attack GOP tax cut
proposals _ which the White House projects would amount to nearly
$2 trillion over the coming decade _ saying the changes would risk
throwing the nation back into a cycle of deficits. Under ``the Gore
plan,'' Clinton will likely point out, the country could pay off
its $3.2 trillion worth of publicly held debt by the year 2012.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton isn't likely to leave Los Angeles, though, without
employing his considerable rhetorical gifts to cast his own legacy
in the most favorable light possible. Nor is he likely to resist
taking a jab at those who scoffed at his prospects eight years ago,
when as the governor of Arkansas he appeared at the Democratic
National Convention to embark on his own campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other side kind of referred to me as a governor of a small
Southern state, and I was so naive I thought it was a compliment,''
Clinton told the NAACP last month. ``You know what,'' he asked, ``I
still do.''

   MANHATTAN BEACH, Calif. _ It wasn't a tennis display Serena
Williams will brag about or want to duplicate, but for all her
double faults and unforced errors, she proved something important
Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   When the going gets tough and her famous serve doesn't get
going, Williams still can find a way to win. She battled her way
through three intense and enthralling sets to beat Lindsay
Davenport 4-6, 6-4, 7-6 (1) in the estyle.com Classic final at
Manhattan Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   Williams defended her title with wins over the world's two
top-ranked players in less than 24 hours and improved her chances
at repeating her U.S. Open championship in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't serving well and I still came through with a win,''
said the fifth-seeded Williams, who beat Martina Hingis in
Saturday's semifinal. ``Usually when my serve is that bad, I don't
win.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams correctly assessed the flaws in her game. She got her
first serve in just 44 percent of the time and committed 36
unforced errors, but she showed the constitution of a champion when
it mattered most.
</P>
<P>
   At 5-5 in the third set, Williams could have put enormous
pressure on Davenport by holding serve but instead hit long on the
last two points of the game and trailed 6-5 with Davenport to
serve. But Williams didn't fold. She smashed two winners to start
the game, then watched as Davenport first double-faulted, then hit
a backhand into the net on break point.
</P>
<P>
   The frazzled Davenport didn't recover in the tiebreaker and
dropped 11 of the match's final 12 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're up a break at 6-5 in the third set, it's your
match,'' Davenport said. ``I thought I played well, except for a
couple points.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, never the type to admit to any self-doubt, said she
remained confident despite facing defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``At 5-6, I was thinking, `I have to break, or this is the end,
it's gone, it's done,' and I didn't want that,'' Williams said. ``I
knew I wasn't serving all that well, so I just tried to go for my
shots, and it worked.''
</P>
<P>
   If Williams is unhappy with her serving, Davenport should be
despondent. Usually one of the tour's most consistent servers, she
had nine aces to Williams' eight but also had 13 double faults.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport seemed to serve her worst at the worst times. She went
up a break early in the second set and had three chances togo up
4-2 but double-faulted twice, and Williams put the set back on
serve at 3-3.
</P>
<P>
   It stayed that way until Williams, leading 5-4, broke Davenport
to win the second set, a game typical of Davenport's problem. She
struggled to get her first serve in consistently. When she
didn't,Williams was right there to pounce on her second serve with
sharp returns.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, meanwhile, worked to showcase other nonserve aspects
of her game. She charged the net more and converted on 18 of 19
approaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been a one-dimensional player,'' Williams said.
``If one thing isn't working for me, I can always go to plan B or
C, or even D.''

HAKKINEN PULLS A FAST ONE IN THE FIRST CORNER
</HEADLINE>
  By BRAD SPURGEON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUDAPEST, Hungary _ With his two biggest rivals preoccupied by a
war of nerves, Mika Hakkinen came from behind for the second race
in a row to get through the first corner first at the start of
Sunday's Hungarian Grand Prix. And on the narrow, dusty and twisty
Hungaroring, where it is next to impossible to pass, that is half
the job of winning.
</P>
<P>
   The other half is keeping the car on the track during the
grueling 77 laps of the 2.4-mile circuit. That is exactly what
Hakkinen did to win in 1 hour 45 minutes 33.869 seconds for an
average speed of 108.096 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Schumacher, in a Ferrari, finished second, 7.9 seconds
behind, with David Coulthard, Hakkinen's McLaren teammate, another
half a second behind.
</P>
<P>
   But Hakkinen, a 31-year-old from Finland, did far more than
steal the show from Schumacher and Coulthard. For the first time
this season, Hakkinen took the lead in the Formula One drivers
standings from Schumacher and set himself on course to join Juan
Manuel Fangio as the only drivers to win the title three years in a
row.
</P>
<P>
   Hakkinen, who started the race two points behind Schumacher and
tied with Coulthard, now leads the championship with 64 points.
Schumacher is in second with 62 points, and Coulthard is third with
58. But Hakkinen would not say he was now the favorite to win the
series.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the way through the season people talk about who is going
to win, or who is going to lose, or who has lost motivation, or who
has motivation,'' said Hakkinen, who trailed by 24 points four
races ago. ``I've been keeping my own head all the time and
concentrating on my work and going to the races and trying to win.
I'm not going to think about who is going to win and who is going
to lose. That will be decided at the end of the year when we count
the points.''
</P>
<P>
   The first- and third-place finishes by the McLaren cars carried
the team past Ferrari in the constructors series, 112-111.
</P>
<P>
   It was Hakkinen's third victory this year and his second in a
row in Hungary, which, because of the vast number of Finnish
spectators who fly down for the race, is considered to be the
closest thing to a home race for Hakkinen.
</P>
<P>
   Hakkinen got off to a perfect start from third place on the
grid, taking advantage of the cleaner side of the track _ on the
racing line _ while Coulthard started from second, on the dusty
side.
</P>
<P>
   Hakkinen pulled up beside Schumacher, who was on the pole, and
squeezed between Schumacher and the edge of the track before the
first corner. Schumacher braked late and the two were lined up for
a collision, but Schumacher let Hakkinen through.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had again a fantastic start,'' Hakkinen said. ``It was very
close with Michael in the first corner, but that's what racing
should be. And we came around the corner in one piece.''
</P>
<P>
   Schumacher said he ``was perhaps a bit too careful'' at the
start.
</P>
<P>
   Tension was high on the starting grid; Schumacher was knocked
out of the last two races in tussles at the first corner. In
Germany, Coulthard, who started on the pole, swerved in front of
him. That move was a repayment by Coulthard for a similar move
Schumacher pulled on him at the start of the French Grand Prix in
July.
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, Hakkinen sped past the two of them from fourth place
but later lost the lead and finished second. In Austria, Schumacher
was also knocked off the track at the first corner, by Ricardo
Zonta.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's race was tightest after the second pit stops, when
Coulthard, on Lap 51, returned to the track after his stop just
behind Schumacher, who had already had his stop. For the last 25
laps, Coulthard, in the faster car, pressured Schumacher while less
than a second behind him, trying to force him into an error.
</P>
<P>
   But Schumacher held his nerve.
</P>
<P>
   ``On this sort of circuit you can take it fairly easy,'' he
said. ``You don't have to push to the limit because of the guy
behind you. That's all I was doing, just trying to concentrate and
not push to the limit or the tires would wear out near the end.''
</P>
<P>
   The Finnish fans went wild with cheers and horn honking as
Hakkinen climbed the victory podium. He waved his arms like an
orchestra conductor as the Finnish national anthem played.

EDITORIAL: GYPSIES AND THE HOLOCAUST  

</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Monday, Aug. 14:
</P>
<P>
   Gypsies and Jews were the only two groups that the Nazi regime
sought to exterminate completely. Six million Jews were murdered,
and perhaps half of Europe's 1 million Gypsies. Yet of the $60
billion the German government has paid in reparations since World
War II to Holocaust victims, only a tiny percentage has gone to
Gypsies.
</P>
<P>
   The German government and German companies who employed slave or
forced labor recently set up a $5 billion fund for these workers
and other victims. Gypsies are eligible, and the fund also provides
$12 million for social programs to benefit them. But the fund
administrators must take special care to see that the money reaches
Gypsies, lest this group be slighted again.
</P>
<P>
   Gypsies, who call themselves Roma, were left uncompensated after
World War II largely because of their low social status. After the
war, Chancellor Konrad Adenauer of West Germany invited the
government of the new nation of Israel and leaders of Jewish
organizations worldwide to negotiate for restitution. The
organization they established, the Claims Conference, had political
clout and could find victims and administer payments.
</P>
<P>
   The Gypsies, long the objects of scorn in Europe, had no
organization and no political champions. West German laws
discriminated against them. The German Supreme Court in 1956 even
ruled that Gypsies deported before 1943 were taken because they
were antisocial and so were not entitled to compensation.
</P>
<P>
   The new fund is mainly for those pressed into labor, principally
non-Jews from Eastern and Central Europe. The negotiators are
conscious of the need to reach Gypsies. But the deal contains
problems that may leave many deserving Gypsies out.
</P>
<P>
   One obstacle is infighting in the Gypsy community about who
should represent them. But in addition, no one was present at some
crucial meetings to speak for Gypsy interests. Negotiators decided
to speed the payment process by working through groups that had
already been administering Holocaust claims, which meant the Claims
Conference, and for non-Jews, special partner organizations in
Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, Poland and the Czech Republic. These
groups will have the job of advertising the new fund, finding
victims and setting up the social programs for Gypsies.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these partner organizations have been tainted by
corruption in the past. Moreover, there will be but one Gypsy
leader on the board of directors of the fund, and there may be none
on the staffs of the five partner organizations, which may be
tempted to concentrate on majority ethnic groups. The German
finance ministry, which ultimately will oversee payments, must
ensure that the organizations in the five countries take seriously
the expensive and difficult task of reaching an unpopular minority.

&HT;    CLINTON WILL TRY TO IGNITE A GORE COMEBACK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 (EDS: Fixes reference to GOP convention in 3rd graph) (For use by clients of the New York Times News Service)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.2000 Hearst Newspapers   
<TEXT>
LOS ANGELES _ President Clinton, hoping to ignite a comeback
victory for political heir Al Gore, will launch the Democratic
National Convention Monday night with the claim that he and Gore
transformed the ``terrible economic mess'' they inherited from
Republicans in 1992 into unprecedented promise and prosperity.
<P>
   Clinton's speech, expected to last as long as an hour, is his
last chance to speak to the Democratic Party faithful as president.
He plans to fly back to Washington on Tuesday after stopping in
Michigan to meet Gore and symbolically pass the torch to his
designated political heir.
</P>
<P>
   As Democrats flocked to this summer-hot convention city Sunday
on the eve of their first convention here since 1960, more than
3,000 protesters choked part of downtown Los Angeles to dramatize
opposition to environmental degradation, poverty and the ill
effects of world trade. Riot-equipped police flanked protesters as
they neared the Staples Center, site of the Democratic convention
that opens Monday. Some protesters voiced support for Mumia
Abu-Jamal, on death row in Pennsylvania for killing a Philadelphia
police officer.
</P>
<P>
   In remarks to Democratic activists in beachfront Malibu, Clinton
acknowledged the uphill battle facing Gore, who lags Republican
presidential nominee George W. Bush in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can turn around these polls,'' Clinton told. ``But it's not
the work of a day. It's going to take every day between now and
November.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest nationwide survey showed Gore edging closer to Bush
after Gore chose Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., as his running
mate. Lieberman is the first Jewish American chosen for a national
party ticket.
</P>
<P>
   An NBC-Wall Street Journal poll released Sunday showed Bush
leading Gore by 3 percentage points, 44 percent to 41 percent. The
survey had a margin of error of 3.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The results offered good news to Gore who has trailed Bush by as
much as 14 percentage points in some recent surveys and by 6
percentage points in a comparable NBC News-Wall Street Journal
survey conducted before Bush's GOP convention in Philadelphia
earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Chairman Joe Andrew welcomed signs of Gore gaining
``momentum,'' adding: ``We're in a position where just a decent
convention puts us where we want to be.''
</P>
<P>
   White House chief of staff John Podesta and White House press
secretary Joe Lockhart said Clinton would use his valedictory
address as a symbolic farewell to his supporters before stepping
aside to let Gore seize the political limelight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's his moment to get off the stage and let someone else get
on the stage and do the job,'' Podesta said.
</P>
<P>
   After Clinton leaves the convention, ``politically, the
president will be in the background,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   The presidential aides said Clinton hoped to debunk the claims
that Bush made in a well-received GOP convention address in
Philadelphia on Aug. 3 that the Clinton-Gore team had needlessly
``squandered'' opportunities offered by the longest economic
recovery in American history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Republicans may have had a little amnesia about where
things stood in 1992,'' Podesta said, adding that Clinton ``will be
happy to remind people about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said Clinton will remind the nation that it has been
the Clinton-Gore ``partnership'' and Democrats in Congress who have
been ``reversing a terrible economic mess in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart, who _ like Podesta _ has been working with Clinton on
the speech, said the president would reject Bush's claim that
Clinton and Gore had taken ``an eight-year vacation'' once elected
and that ``everything that happened over the last eight years had
happened by accident.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart emphasized, however, that Clinton had no plans to
apologize during his address for the sexual dalliance with former
White House intern Monica Lewinsky. Clinton was impeached by the
House for obstruction of justice in the aftermath of the affair.
The president was acquitted by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton revived discussion of the sensitive personal issue in an
appearance last week before 4,500 ministers in Chicago en route to
Los Angeles. Clinton, saying that he was still ``trying to totally
rebuild my life from a terrible mistake I made,'' sought to exempt
Gore from criticism leveled at him, saying, ``Surely no fair-minded
person would blame him for any mistake I made.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will leave a rich monetary legacy to his party. He has
raised $100 million for various party entities this year, according
to Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, campaigning Sunday in Cleveland, promised sick children
and their families that he will make expanded federal health
coverage to all children ``a centerpiece'' of his battle with Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's morally wrong in this period of prosperity ... to have
families go through what's been described here,'' Gore told the
families, after hearing their heart rending stories at a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he would be willing to risk criticism as being a
``policy wonk'' in order to load down his address with specific
policy proposals including details of $500 billion in tax breaks to
advance his social priorities.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he would offer America `a positive speech'' that did
not criticize Bush but would underscore ``some of the policy
differences'' he has with the two-term governor of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   In separate comments Sunday, both Gore and Lieberman continued
to subtly distance their ticket from Clinton's shadow. Gore told
reporters in Cleveland that he would ``uphold the oath'' that he
hopes to take as president on Jan. 20, 2001, adding that he had
given his ``whole heart'' to ``every job I have ever had'' and that
he had ``done it according to the highest values and I will
continue to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said that if elected, he might consult with Clinton ``if
there's a subject where he can contribute advice of course _ along
with President Carter'' but ``I don't anticipate that being a
regular occurrence.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, the Democratic vice presidential candidate who was
the first Democratic senator to publicly criticize Clinton's
behavior in September 1998, reminded viewers on NBC News' ``Meet
the Press'' on Sunday that he had favored censuring Clinton for his
personal misbehavior until the day the Senate impeachment trial
ended.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman also ducked an invitation to echo Gore's declaration
that Clinton was ``one of our greatest presidents'' that the vice
president made at a pep rally style gathering on the White House
lawn following the House impeachment vote in December 1998.
</P>
<P>
   As Lieberman put it: ``History will judge... I'm going to leave
the exact words for history.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman said it was ``fine'' with him if Gore had selected him
to join the Democratic ticket in a bid to neutralize GOP criticism
of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans seem to be campaigning mostly against a guy
who's not on the ballot this year, not on his record because the
record is so great but because of his personal mistakes that he
made,'' Lieberman said. ``That's not fair to Al Gore. Nobody who
knows Al Gore can rightly associate him at all with that
behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush spent the day with Sen. John McCain in Arizona before
returning to his Texas ranch.

WINNER HASN'T STOPPED IMPROVING
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; MANHATTAN BEACH, Calif. _ The scary news for the players on the
women's tennis tour is not that Serena Williams defended her title
at the estyle.com Classic on Sunday, nor that she beat two of the
world's top players in the process.
</P>
<P>
   The real scary part is that she thinks she can be better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can do a lot better,'' Williams said. ``I'm just warming up,
basically. I haven't even started hitting my serve really well.''
</P>
<P>
   Usually, Williams' confidence comes off as cockiness, but tennis
followers seem to have reached a consensus that Williams is
correct. Her serve, while one of the biggest in the world, is
inconsistent, and she often talks about needing to improve
mentally.
</P>
<P>
   Even the players _ including Lindsay Davenport, who lost to
Williams on Sunday _ agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have great serves, but Venus is probably just a little
more consistent right now,'' Davenport said of the Williams
sisters. ``I had a million chances (against Serena) and I probably
should have won, but the last time I played Venus, she didn't give
me anything.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Quotable: With the U.S. Open approaching and Serena Williams
never lacking for confidence, reporters tried to get her to
guarantee victory at the Grand Slam event.
</P>
<P>
   Williams declined, sort of.
</P>
<P>
   ``You guys know my prediction, I don't need to say it,''
Williams said. ``You know who it is. The lady in purple.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams wore a purple dress all week, and yes, everybody
already knew who it was.
</P>
<P>
   __ Hot stuff: The court temperature approached 100 degrees
during the singles final, but it didn't seem to be a problem for
either player.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt great,'' Davenport said. ``No injuries, so that's a
good sign going into the Open.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Some consolation: Belgium's Dominique Van Roost, who
controversially lost a second-round singles match, teamed with
countrywoman Els Callens to win the doubles title Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Van Roost and Callens defeated American Kimberly Po and
Anne-Gaelle Sidot of France 6-2, 7-5. Van Roost had protested
earlier in the week when the chair umpire overruled two points late
in her loss to France's Sandrine Testud.

 &HT;    STUDY: INTERNET POLITICS NOT READY FOR PRIME TIME
 &HT;    EDS: Deletes 3rd graf reference to pseudo.com
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Internet sites are scaling back their presence at
the Democratic National Convention amid charges, reflected in a new
Harvard-sponsored study, that their coverage is not ready for prime
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first online convention (held by the Republicans) failed
to live up to the hype that preceded it,'' Michael Cornfield, an
expert on the Internet and politics and a professor at George
Washington University in the nation's capital, said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The receding tide in the political dot-com world was evident in
the sharp drop in hyperlinks. Eight of the 19 media Web sites
Cornfield studied offered a direct link to the Republicans. In Los
Angeles, only one such site, USAToday.com, linked to the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Cornfield, who watched the entire GOP convention proceedings
solely online at the behest of the Shorenstein Center at Harvard's
John F. Kennedy School of Politics, said the poor results should
not be seen as surprising, ``because the convention was not an
exciting news event.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Moreover, he added, ``technical difficulties plagued
convention innovation, the online audience paid only modest
attention and the Republican Party made little effort to
incorporate the Internet in their media strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   PC Data Online, a firm that meters the choices of 120,000 home
Internet users across the country, found a 14 percent dip in online
traffic to the four most popular news sites during the convention
week when compared with the previous week.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of traffic, the top four are MSNBC.com, CNN.com,
NYTimes.com and WashingtonPost.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``The clear implication of (the) data is that there was a drop
in online news attention during the Republican convention.''
</P>
<P>
   Cornfield's findings were sharply criticized Sunday by Gerald
Levin, chief executive of Time Warner and a panelist on a
Shorenstein Center on ``The Impact of Information Technology on
American Democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost everything in that report is mistaken,'' Levin said,
noting that he had read an advance copy that had been sent to him
via e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in a very early stage in a new medium,'' he added. When
dedicated people want to provide 24-hour coverage even though
nothing is happening, we ought to regard that as a breakthrough.''
</P>
<P>
   Levin likened the Internet political experience to having
watched, ``as a youngster, the 1948 national political conventions,
the first ones to be televised.''
</P>
<P>
   Two networks, NBC and DuMont, covered both events, which were
held in Philadelphia, with one camera apiece, feeding their signal
by coaxial cable to several cities from Boston to Richmond, Va.
</P>
<P>
   This year, America Online, which plans to merge with Levin's
Time Warner, was one of two Web sites that bought skyboxes from the
Republicans. AOL's Philadelphia neighbor, pseudopolitics.com _
Pseudo.com's corporate child _ allowed visitors to choose their own
viewing angles from its 12 cameras.

HORSE RACING: UPBEAT PLANS FOR INDUSTRY AT JOCKEY CLUB ROUNDTABLE 
</HEADLINE>
  By JOE DRAPE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. _ It would have been much more
pleasurable to spend a rare sunny morning here in a rocking chair
along Broadway poring over The Daily Racing Form. But an important
part of the Saratoga meet for breeders, owners and racetrack
executives is the Jockey Club roundtable, which takes place
annually and is often a gloomy affair conducted at a comatose pace
in a darkened hotel ballroom.
</P>
<P>
   Yet an upbeat business mood prevailed on Sunday as the
thoroughbred racing industry, with a more or less league office in
place, crisply set out an agenda for horse racing. Like all league
meetings, there was good news: a new televised series of races for
2-year-olds that will not only provide purses of $2.9 million and
potential bonus money of $1.3 million to their owners but also
introduce next year's Triple Crown stars over seven heats to racing
fans.
</P>
<P>
   There was troubling news: substantive recommendations to
strengthen drug testing to weed out cheaters, which one owner,
Stuart S. Janney III, said should be addressed in the open so the
public, as well as trainers, jockeys and owners, know without doubt
that a horse running is doing so honestly. Janney, the owner of the
1998 Travers Stakes winner Coronado's Quest, acknowledged that lax
regulation, new performance-enhancing drugs and unscrupulous
veterinarians and trainers had contributed to a lack of confidence
in racing's integrity in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, in recent weeks, Bob Baffert had a horse in California
test positive for morphine _ though Baffert, a veteran Triple Crown
trainer, contends that the small amount could have come from any
incidental contact. But Janney, who headed a task force on the
subject of drugs, called for more vigilance, with measures like
camera surveillance of competitors on race day, to ensure ``that
cheaters do not win our greatest races, that undeserving horses are
not crowned champions and that all our effort and hard work to
enhance our sport is not destroyed by compromising our standards
and integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps best of all for the racing enthusiasts who wagered a
record $14.4 billion in 1999 on horse races in North America was
that there was plenty of talk about new technology and marketing
plans to make Internet delivery part of winning new fans and
helping existing ones.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most promising initiatives is perhaps one of the most
puzzling. The National Thoroughbred Racing Association, which has
finally consolidated some amount of power, hired IBM Global
Services, which has studied the industry for the past year, to come
up with initiatives to update technologies and advance access to
the sport. Though the consultants initially determined that
thoroughbred racing still does not have enough fans, they saw
enough potential to want to finance future projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would like to negotiate a long-term contract that we
believe would be a win-win situation,'' said Rob Law, a senior
consultant for IBM.
</P>
<P>
   There remain many obstacles for horse racing to return as a
major player in the crowded sports landscape. The conglomerates of
Churchill Downs Inc. and the MI Entertainment Corp., which is led
by the industrialist Frank Stronach, are battling to acquire
racetracks. Smaller, independent track operators have felt squeezed
out. The Internet Gambling Prohibition Act was narrowly defeated
recently in Congress. It needs approval if simulcast betting and
account wagering _ the staples of wagering revenue _ are to
continue.
</P>
<P>
   But as recent developments and the roundtable discussion
demonstrated, the industry is moving, if not always in harmony, in
a productive direction. The Breeders' Cup Championship, now in its
17th year and by far the most successful venture in horse racing in
modern times, has consolidated with the NTRA, and the two entities
will probably merge within three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It made sense to have the championship of our sport under the
umbrella of the league office,'' explained D.G. Van Clief Jr.,
president of the Breeders' Cup, which brings the best horses from
around the world together for a day of competition. ``It means more
money and focus on building up the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Less intramural skirmishing also means that more energy can be
put into arranging a natural marriage between a sport with true
interactive capabilities and a population already doing plenty of
commerce by computer and on the Internet. Skilled handicapping of
horses leads to financial rewards for selecting winners, which are
delivered as horses gallop around an oval to the finish line.
</P>
<P>
   As the drug testing discussion illustrates, the industry has
done well at keeping the performance on the racetrack at a high
standard. Now, it's time for the business plans to do the same. &QL;

CARPENTER: THE DEMOCRAT'S GRANDE DAME &HT;   
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;    By CLAY ROBISON 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Liz Carpenter, self-described ``artifact'' and
``rooting-tooting Democrat,'' arrived here over the weekend to help
spread the gospel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope you're going to vote Democratic,'' she said, ambushing
an unsuspecting couple whose stroll around the hotel pool had
brought them within challenging range of one of Texas' most
colorful and outspoken partisans.
</P>
<P>
   First as a news reporter, then as a White House insider and now
as an author and elder stateswoman, Carpenter has been attending
political conventions for more than half a century.
</P>
<P>
   Scooting around on an electric cart, wearing a red jacket and
brandishing a cane festooned with red, white and blue streamers,
the white-haired Austinite still offers a commanding presence.
</P>
<P>
   And although an ailing leg has physically slowed her at 79, her
enthusiasm remains as strong as ever for her party and her
delegate's role at this week's Democratic National Convention. It
is matched only by her disdain for the enemy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was 21 before I saw my first Republican, and it was a
terrifying experience. They still scare me,'' she quipped.
</P>
<P>
   And she was unapologetic for breaking ranks with most of her
fellow Texans and opposing Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican
presidential nominee who is expected to overwhelmingly carry Texas
over Democrat Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter said Bush was ``very likable,'' but she ridiculed his
campaign theme.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think compassionate conservative is about as inconsistent as
virgin hooker,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The sixth generation Texan, who first came to national
prominence as Lady Bird Johnson's press secretary during President
Johnson's administration, will be one of the oldest delegates at
the Democratic meeting, which begins today.
</P>
<P>
   She looks forward to nominating Gore and running-mate Joseph
Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter grew up in an era when Republicans were virtually
nonexistent in Texas. And although the state's political landscape
has changed drastically during her lifetime, she hasn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only trouble with Republicans is they just don't like
people,`` she said, echoing the late, legendary Democrat, Sam
Rayburn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just happen to believe that government's role in a democracy
can contribute to how civilized our society is, and I think the
Democratic Party has that more in mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter, who was a Washington-based reporter, attended her
first national political conventions in 1948, when the Democrats,
the Republicans and the Progressive Party all gathered in
Philadelphia. They chose the same city, she said, to accommodate a
new invention called television.
</P>
<P>
   She also recalled that Rayburn, the longtime speaker of the U.S.
House who also presided over the Democratic National Convention
that year, was ``dive-bombed'' during one of the Democratic
sessions by pigeons, who were apparently confused by TV lights.
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter continued covering conventions as a reporter through
1960, when Democrats, meeting in Los Angeles, nominated the John F.
Kennedy-Lyndon B. Johnson ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter's fourth book, ``Start With a Laugh: An Insider's
Guide to Roasts, Toasts, Eulogies and Other Speeches,'' will be out
Sept. 1, on her 80th birthday. The book draws from her extensive
political experiences, including speechwriting for Lady Bird
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter was a delegate to a Democratic convention for the
first time in 1972, when George McGovern was nominated. She was a
Bill Clinton delegate at the 1992 and 1996 conventions. This year,
her daughter, Christy Carpenter, also is a Democratic delegate _
from California.
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter readily points out that the face of the Democratic
Party has undergone major changes in her lifetime, in large part
because of civil rights legislation enacted during the Johnson
administration.
</P>
<P>
   What was once a party dominated by white men who discriminated
against blacks and Hispanics is now much more diverse, and
Carpenter feels right at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of heart, and we have a record of caring'' for
the underprivileged, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter is a strong supporter of abortion rights and the Equal
Rights Amendment, and she doesn't think very highly of former
Democrats who became Republicans when the GOP began to grow in
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any use for people who leave the Democratic
Party,'' she said. ``I love the Democratic Party. That's who I am,
and I know who I am.''

FORD SAYS FIRESTONE KNEW OF FLAW IN TIRES BY 1997 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating for all needing)   (12:01 a.m. ET EMBARGO for electronic media.)  
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Ford Motor Co. released documents Sunday showing that
in 1997 Bridgestone/Firestone Inc. began receiving numerous
complaints of injuries and property damage involving certain
Firestone tires that were not recalled until last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the recalled tires have rates of injury and personal
damage claims up to 100 times greater than those for tires not
recalled, Ford disclosed Sunday. Many of those claims were sent to
Bridgestone by vehicle owners from 1997 to 1999, but the tire maker
did not tell Ford, whose new automobiles, particularly Ford
Explorer sport utility vehicles, are equipped with two-thirds of
the recalled tires.
</P>
<P>
   The automaker said it learned of the high rate of claims only a
week ago, when it performed its own computer analysis of
Bridgestone's data. Bridgestone had resisted Ford's disclosure of
the information, said a person briefed on the automaker's work on
the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Ford said that Bridgestone's factory in Decatur, Ill., had been
the main source of the problem tires, and that the factory had
experienced its biggest quality problems from 1994 to 1996. Those
were the years when the factory was operated mainly by replacement
workers because of a labor dispute between Bridgestone and its
union, although Ford made no mention of that fact Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Bridgestone officials did not dispute Ford's data but said that
the problem had not caught their attention until Ford began
reviewing Bridgestone's files two weeks ago. The overall rate of
complaints on tires from all Bridgestone factories had not been
unusually high, and Bridgestone did not conduct the detailed review
of tire quality by factory that Ford undertook, said Bob Wyant,
Bridgestone's vice president of quality assurance.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Karbowiak, a Bridgestone spokeswoman, said that there was
no evidence that the labor dispute had affected quality in Decatur.
She was also quick to point out during a conference call with
reporters Sunday afternoon that Ford itself had given the Decatur
factory a quality award.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies' mutual sniping was the clearest sign yet of
strain in one of corporate America's oldest relationships.
Firestone, which was bought by Bridgestone in 1988, has been
supplying tires to Ford since 1906, when Henry Ford was still
designing the first Model T.
</P>
<P>
   Ford and Bridgestone had presented a mostly united front since
last Wednesday's recall of 6.5 million Firestone tires, which in
addition to being sold on new Ford vehicles were sold as
replacement tires for several manufacturers' sport utility vehicles
and pickup trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Ford dealers have been flooded with customers seeking
replacement tires, including replacements for Firestone tires not
covered by the recall, while buyers have been leery of buying new
Ford Explorers equipped with Firestone tires.
</P>
<P>
   Ford released the data Sunday partly in the hope of reassuring
customers that Firestone tires not covered by the recall were safe,
notably Wilderness AT tires made at factories other than the one in
Decatur. But the data is unlikely to appease plaintiff lawyers and
safety groups, who scheduled a press conference for Monday in
Washington to call for Bridgestone to expand the recall to include
far more Wilderness brand tires.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Hoar, the founder of Safetyforum.com, a consulting firm
that is coordinating many of the lawsuits against Bridgestone and
Ford, said Ford was trying to put all the blame on Bridgestone to
draw attention from what he described as design defects in the Ford
Explorer's suspension that put strain on the tires. Ford officials
have repeatedly denied this.
</P>
<P>
   The automaker has recalled Explorers in four foreign countries,
equipped with a larger size of Wilderness tires than those recalled
in the United States. Ford said the overseas recall reflected
driving conditions seldom found in the United States, so a broader
recall was unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   People who have been briefed on Ford's work on the tire problem
said the automaker had been deeply disturbed to learn two weeks ago
that Bridgestone had done little work to analyze the reliability of
its tires in the United States despite growing complaints and a
federal investigation that began in May.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Vines, a Ford spokesman, took pains on Sunday to mention
that Ford had used very sophisticated programs and equipment to
analyze the Bridgestone data, including a Cray supercomputer. But
another person briefed on Ford's work said that the company's
analysis was ``not rocket science'' and represented standard
practice for automakers that try to identify quality problems.
</P>
<P>
   Ford faxed a 12-page summary of the data to reporters Sunday
afternoon and then held a conference call during which its
officials discussed the material. Ford initially scheduled the call
only for its own executives, but Karbowiak and Wyant decided to
participate as well. They were mostly silent as Vines explained how
Ford had asked for and received Firestone's data on injury and
property damage claims, and quickly discovered problems.
</P>
<P>
   Vines said Ford officials obtained the data on July 28 and spent
eight days entering it into Ford's computers. Within several days,
Ford had concluded that there was a problem with all Firestone ATX
and ATX II tires of the P235/75R15 size, and with Firestone
Wilderness AT tires of the same size that were produced in Decatur
only. Firestone and Ford then decided on a recall.
</P>
<P>
   The federal investigation that began in May includes 300
complaints about Firestone tires, involving 46 deaths.
</P>
<P>
   The Ford data released Sunday showed that there had been just
one to six tread-separation claims per million Wilderness AT tires
from factories other than Decatur. Wilderness tires from other
factories are being used to replace the Decatur-made Wilderness
tires that are being recalled and various ATX tires being recalled.
</P>
<P>
   For Wilderness AT tires from Decatur, the rate of injury and
property damage claims was more than 50 per million tires produced
in 1996 and close to that level for tires produced in 1997. While
there have been few claims for Decatur-made Wilderness tires
produced since 1998, these have not been on the road long enough
for many claims to have been received, Vines said.
</P>
<P>
   The claims rate was far higher for ATX tires, all of which are
being recalled in the P235/75R15 size regardless of where they were
produced. For factories other than the Decatur plant, the rate
approached 100 claims per million tires for tires produced from
1993 to 1995.
</P>
<P>
   At the Decatur plant itself, the claims rate soared to between
350 and 650 claims per million ATX tires produced in 1994, 1995 and
1996.

</P>
<P>
   Thomas F. Dasse, a Phoenix lawyer handling several lawsuits
against Bridgestone, said in an interview on Friday that his
litigation depended partly on testimony from former Bridgestone
employees who had worked at the Decatur factory until 1996 and who
had described quality problems there.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Post reported Sunday that some of the lawsuits
against Bridgestone included testimony from former workers in
Decatur who described manually piercing blisters in the rubber of
flawed tires and sending them to a warehouse for sale, instead of
scrapping them.
</P>
<P>
   Karbowiak described these comments as the views of ``disgruntled
workers,'' and said that Bridgestone disagreed with them. She said
Bridgestone believed that all of the replacement workers had
performed their jobs as well as the union workers had before them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We strongly believe there is no connection based on what we
know of our training and operating procedures,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Decatur factory makes tires of various sizes for other
automakers, and Ford has not analyzed the claims rates for these
tires. Wyant said that Bridgestone did not believe these tires had
problems.
</P>
<P>
   The United Steelworkers of America went on strike against
Bridgestone in Decatur in July 1994. After 10 months, the union
ordered its workers to return to their jobs without a contract, but
the company only hired them when job openings occurred, while
continuing to operate the factory with replacement workers.
</P>
<P>
   The company and the union did not reach an agreement until
November 1996, when the remaining union workers went back to their
jobs with the exception of those who had committed acts during the
strike that the company deemed unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   The claims rate for Wilderness tires made in Decatur began to
fall in 1997 and it is now virtually equal to the claims rate for
Wilderness tires made elsewhere, Ford's Vines said. But Bridgestone
is recalling all Wilderness tires made in Decatur since 1996 as a
precaution.

INSULATION CALLED A `SUBSTANTIAL HEALTH RISK' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANDREW SCHNEIDER  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Asbestos-contaminated vermiculite insulation in millions of
homes across the country poses a ``substantial health risk'' to
anyone who works in the houses' attics, an assistant U.S. surgeon
general has warned.
</P>
<P>
   The insulation comes from the now-closed vermiculite mine in
Libby, Mont., operated for decades by W.R. Grace &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``Internal company documentation and recent testing of
residential insulation material reveals that even minimal handling
by workers or residents poses a substantial health risk,'' Dr. Hugh
Sloan of the U.S. Public Health Service wrote last week in a
request for help from other federal health experts.
</P>
<P>
   Among the documents to which Sloan referred is a risk assessment
conducted by Grace health experts while the mine was still open.
The company experts estimated 30,000 additional lung cancers would
result from exposure to asbestos by those ``involved in the
application of our products.''
</P>
<P>
   Grace, asked for comment about the memo on Friday, did not
respond.
</P>
<P>
   The brownish-pink vermiculite from Libby was sold for use in
garden products, fireproofing, cement mixtures and a score of other
consumer products. But the vast majority of the ore was
heat-treated until it expanded like popcorn. Then, marketed as
Zonolite insulation, it was stuffed between rafters and inside
walls in millions of homes from coast to coast.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody is sure how many homes contain Zonolite. Estimates range
between 2.5 million and 16 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sold like mad,'' said Stephen Sheeran, who was a salesman
for Grace in Michigan and eventually a sales manager for the
company. ``Millions of bags of that stuff from Libby was sold in
Michigan as attic fill insulation,'' Sheeran said. ``They couldn't
get it fast enough. Most of the homes in Flint are filled with
it.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington state alone there are at least 53,505 homes with
Zonolite, according to lawyers who have filed a class-action suit
seeking to order Grace to warn homeowners of the dangers.
</P>
<P>
   In his letter to Linda Rosenstock, the director of the National
Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, Sloan said recent
investigations documented that even casual handling of the
insulation can generate airborne exposures up to 150 times the
level considered safe by OSHA for workers.
</P>
<P>
   Sloan asked NIOSH to examine the risk to nursery, construction,
insulation and other workers who use vermiculite end-products and
to issue a nationwide warning, a ``hazard alert,'' cautioning
workers of the potential dangers of these products. He also asked
NIOSH to update earlier studies on the asbestos-tainted vermiculite
to examine the progression of asbestos-related disease, and to
determine whether tremolite, the predominant type of asbestos found
in the ore, is more toxic then earlier believed.
</P>
<P>
   Last November, the Post-Intelligencer reported that hundreds of
miners and members of their families were killed or sickened by
asbestos contamination from the now-closed Grace mine in the tiny
northwestern Montana town.
</P>
<P>
   In December, the newspaper reported that Grace shipped millions
of pounds of the tainted ore to 60 processing plants throughout the
United States and Canada, causing workers at many of those plants
to become ill and die of asbestosis, lung cancer and mesothelioma.
</P>
<P>
   Further investigation showed the number of plants processing or
selling the ore was more than 250.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that millions of homes may be filled with Zonolite has
Sloan and the other health experts concerned.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, old insulation has to be replaced. Remodeling,
rewiring and a score of other home renovations could disturb the
old Zonolite. Tests have shown that even installing a light fixture
or ceiling fan through an attic floor insulated with Zonolite can
generate dangerous levels of airborne asbestos.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Henry Anderson, the chief medical officer and epidemiologist
for the state of Wisconsin, said Friday that he agrees the public
must be warned.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to safeguard public health, it is essential that
homeowners with Zonolite insulation, and those contractors who may
be called upon to work on it, be warned about the presence of
asbestos in the product,'' said Anderson, who has been studying the
health impact of asbestos for more than 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   Grace has always insisted that there was nothing hazardous in
the insulation. As the P-I reported earlier this year, the printing
on the Zonolite bags said: ``Contains no harmful chemicals'' and
``masks, gloves or special (safety) equipment'' were not needed.
</P>
<P>
   But thousands of pages of Grace correspondence, memos and
reports obtained by the P-I show the company was well aware of the
asbestos in the insulation and the health hazards it presented.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the '70s, there were repeated discussions between
Grace's lawyers and its sales and marketing managers over the need
for, and the impact of, warning customers about the asbestos in the
products.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that a decision to affix asbestos warning labels to
our products would result in substantial sales losses,'' Grace
Executive Vice President E.S. Wood wrote May 24, 1977. He added,
``The risk of liability to customers is heightened by the decision
not to label our products.''
</P>
<P>
   Grace made the decision not to label products, taking the
position that tremolite fibers that contaminated the vermiculite
could go unnoticed.
</P>
<P>
   Only through the use of ``elaborate techniques not commonly
recognized or employed in the scientific community for detection of
asbestos'' in their potting soils and fireproofing could the
tremolite asbestos fibers be detected, another 1977 memo reported.
</P>
<P>
   ``For this reason, we are taking the position with all but
authorized government authorities that our mixed products are
`non-asbestos' products.''
</P>
<P>
   Wood anticipated that the Consumer Product Safety Commission
would take action to protect the public. He predicted ``a high risk
that our products will be banned in several significant uses,'' and
cited the Zonolite attic insulation and horticultural vermiculite.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the safety commission took no actions against Grace products
then, nor has it since.
</P>
<P>
   Grace documents reveal that the company felt it could defend
itself by showing that even the high exposures its own testing
found were within the limits that the Occupational Safety and
Health Administration set for workers. That may have been true at
the time, but those exposures and the levels found after testing
contaminated homes this year are 150 times greater than OSHA's
present worker-exposure level, court papers show.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the thousands of studies done on the health effects of
asbestos exposure centered on the worker being exposed hundreds of
times a years for dozens of years. But studies by NIOSH, the
Environmental Protection Agency and private medical investigators
in the '70s and '80s cautioned that ``single bursts'' and ``peak
episodic'' exposures to humans can cause cancer and asbestosis.
</P>
<P>
   Grace documents from 1977 showed that the company was aware of
reports that ``even brief exposures, presumably at high levels, can
later produce mesothelioma,'' a fast-killing cancer attributed only
to asbestos exposure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hazards of these (high, short-term) exposures is
aggravated and worsened when the release or disturbance occurs in
an enclosed space such as an attic,'' Anderson added.
</P>
<P>
   Even though OSHA was made aware that thousands of workers where
handling the contaminated vermiculite at factories and work sites
throughout the country, there is no indication in public records
that it ever weighed in on the asbestos hazard contained in some
vermiculite.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, William Corcoran, Grace's vice president of corporate
affairs, said the company still maintains that the attic insulation
and other vermiculite-based products presents no health risk to
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Late Friday, Grace distributed a statement about some of the
products it manufactured during the '70s and '80s.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was well known to regulatory agencies and many of our
customers that minute quantities of naturally occurring asbestos
were in our products. We are making this announcement to make sure
that everyone hears the facts from Grace,'' said Paul Norris, the
company's chairman, president and CEO.
</P>
<P>
   But the statement addressed only spray-on fireproofing sold by
Grace and didn't discuss the insulation at all.
</P>
<P>
   While EPA headquarters, OSHA and CPSC have done nothing to
publicly address the asbestos hazards from the insulation, which is
apparently contaminating millions of homes, class-action suits have
been filed across the country to order Grace to notify home owners
of the potential dangers.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Black of Spokane is one of 19 lawyers from six law firms
who have filed suit in five states.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is fairly clear-cut,'' Black says. ``We have shown the
court that asbestos-contaminated Zonolite is dangerous, that Grace
knew that and concealed it and that people throughout the country
are being exposed to potentially lethal levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are asking the court to require that Grace warn people who
may not know of the dangers.''
</P>
<P>
   A hearing is scheduled next month in Spokane.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the balance are the lives and property of thousands of
class members who are currently unaware of the substantial risks
which Grace has heretofore concealed,'' the suit said.

KINGS SIGN SCHNEIDER

<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ Mathieu Schneider, the former New York Islanders
captain and top defensive scorer last season with the New York
Rangers, agreed Sunday to a one-year, $2.1 million contract with
the Kings.
</P>
<P>
   With the loss of Garry Galley and Sean O'Donnell during the
offseason, the Kings made defense a priority this summer.
Schneider, 31, is expected to team with Kings captain Rob Blake on
the first unit, with Mattias Norstrom moving back to play with
either Aki Berg, Jere Karalahti or one of several young defensemen
drafted or acquired through free agency.
</P>
<P>
   Although Schneider, who also holds an option for the 2001-2002
season, played with Kings top winger Ziggy Palffy on the Islanders,
it was his relationship with Blake that helped close the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had been coming out to L.A. the past few years to work out
with (Blake) at Gold's Gym in Venice Beach, so there was a really
good feeling coming in,'' Schneider said by phone from his New York
City home. ``There is a good chance for a lot of ice time and work
on the power play.''
</P>
<P>
   Schneider led Rangers defensemen last season with 30 points (10
goals, 20 assists) and 78 penalty minutes.

OHALETE BACK IN SAFETY PICTURE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVINE, Calif. _ For USC's entire training camp, senior Ife
Ohalete has nearly been a forgotten man, relegated to practicing
with the second team after starting last season at free safety.
</P>
<P>
   Even during Saturday's scrimmage, converted tailback Frank
Strong played with the first unit while Ohalete remained with the
reserves.
</P>
<P>
   But after recording six tackles in the scrimmage, Ohalete has
resurfaced and is a starter once again, despite Strong's attempt to
win the position.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been concentrating and his experience and knowledge are
invaluable, and he's been really steady,'' secondary-coach Dennis
Thurman said.
</P>
<P>
   With Ohalete back as a starter, there are a few positions left
where a player could come out of nowhere to win the top job.
</P>
<P>
   Strong still is expected to play this season. The Trojans will
rotate players at nearly every secondary spot.
</P>
<P>
   Another player who keeps raising his stock is freshman strong
safety Matt Grootegoed, who has solidified his grip on the No. 2
strong safety spot during the scrimmage and could be challenging
for a starting spot soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Matt really made a move,'' Thurman said. ``The lights came on
and he performed. He reminds me of Daylon McCutcheon, Brian Kelly
and Antuan Simmons when they were freshmen.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Scrimmage stars: After viewing a tape of Saturday's
scrimmage, coach Paul Hackett said defensive end Matt Childers and
Grootegoed stood out. He also was pleased with the running backs
and cornerbacks.
</P>
<P>
   As for quarterback Carson Palmer, Hackett was mostly positive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carson looked good. He was a little bit off on one pass but
otherwise pretty good,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Penalty problems? The Trojans had 12 penalties in Saturday's
84-play scrimmage, but more troublesome for Hackett were the six
false starts, which was reminiscent of last season.
</P>
<P>
   __ Stevenson returns: After being bothered by a sore hamstring
all week, sophomore wide receiver Steve Stevenson finally practiced
Sunday. He will have his first contact workout today.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, tight end Gregg Guenther of Taft, who caught a
touchdown pass in the scrimmage, has a sore back and will miss a
couple of days of practice.
</P>
<P>
   __ Kicking change: Last week, Hackett said he would narrow the
kicking battle from three to two before choosing a starter. But
Sunday he said he would continue to let junior David Newbury,
senior David Bell and freshman John Wall of Birmingham High battle
through at least midweek.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, David Newbury has the edge,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett wants to give all three kickers as much as experience as
possible before making any decisions.
</P>
<P>
   One place there is not a kicking problem is at punter: Junior
Mike MacGillivray averaged 53 yards in five attempts Saturday.

   &QL; 
 &UR; TECH21 (COLUMN) _ &LR;  Little did I know, when I observed in last
week's column that there's a disagreement about computers'
contribution to our power problems, that I was wandering into a
nasty little debate involving not only technical and methodological
issues, but also political and even philosophical ones.
</P>
<P>
   The crux of the debate is the contention that computers and
peripherals today consume about 13 percent of the nation's
available power, including 8 percent specifically for Internet use.
I first noticed these numbers in an Associated Press report from an
``energy summit'' held in Redwood City in June, but it turns out
they've been cited in just about every major publication in the
country over the last year.  &UR; COLUMN BY HENRY &LR; 
 &UR; NORR &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; BIOSCOPE (COLUMN) _  &LR; As visiting lawmakers filed off the bus at
Alza Corp. in Mountain View, Calif., last week, they walked past a
sign that read: ``Welcome to 10 percent of the U.S. Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   The sign was a bit exaggerated. Several no-shows brought the
delegation down to three dozen lawmakers, all Democrats, who raced
through the region to gawk at the New Economy on their way to their
party's convention in Los Angeles.  &UR; COLUMN BY TOM ABATE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; EDOVERVIEW _  &LR;  (Opening story of a 10-story package about
Technology and Education. Other nine stories, by various authors,
will be CHEAT, HOMEWORK, PARENTS, LAPTOPS, DESKTOPS, APPLY,
SCHOLARS, SOFTWARE, DISTANCE.)
</P>
<P>
   The specifics keep changing, but the promise hasn't: For two
decades, technology has been touted as a panacea for America's
troubled educational system.
</P>
<P>
   First, the idea was that learning keyboarding, word processing
and Logo programming would prepare kids for jobs in the information
economy.
</P>
<P>
   Then came ``kill and drill'' software titles that tried to
inspire enthusiasm about arithmetic and spelling exercises by
adding goofy characters and funny noises. In the 1990s, with the
popularization of CD-ROMs, electronic encyclopedias and multimedia
were added to the mix.  &UR; OPENING STORY BY HENRY NORR &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; CHEAT _ &LR;  Call it high-tech cheating.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since graphical calculators started popping up in the
classroom, quick studies have found ways to program them with
complex formulas, hard-to-remember vocabulary words and other hints
to gain an edge during tests.
</P>
<P>
   Rebecca, who asked that her last name not be used, said she and
her high school classmates in Los Angeles cheated all the time
using TI-85 calculators, especially in chemistry and calculus about
five years ago. Eventually, proctors for the Advanced Placement
tests got wise and started walking down the aisles, checking to
make sure all the students cleared their calculator's memory.  &UR; BY
TODD WALLACK &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; HOMEWORK _ &LR;  Curtis Santee, a 10th-grader from San Francisco,
prefers to do schoolwork from the comfort of home rather than going
to the library. So when doing a report about Algeria recently, he
logged on to his family's computer and, faster than a lesson on the
Dewey Decimal System, found information about the North African
country's gross domestic product and cultures in an online
encyclopedia.  &UR; BY VERNE KOPYTOFF &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; PARENTS _  &LR;  At the tender age of 10, Jake Schlackman enjoys his
role as his family's computer tutor.
</P>
<P>
   ``You feel like you get to be the boss, for once,'' Jake said.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to computers, kids are often in charge, as
technophobic parents struggle to keep up.
</P>
<P>
   Often it's a blessing when a child like Jake can teach his dad
how to use Adobe Photoshop, or fix his grandmother's iMac so she
can access the Internet.  &UR; BY DAN FOST &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; LAPTOPS _ &LR;  For the high school or college-bound student, portable
computers do double duty. They travel readily between home and
school, as well as save space in crowded dorm rooms. (Imagine
toting a desktop home for Christmas break.)
</P>
<P>
   They cost a little more than the equivalent power in a desktop
model, but the benefits are legion. How else can one hang out in
the neighborhood coffee shop writing papers while kibitzing with
friends? It's a lifestyle thing.  &UR; BY BECKY WARING &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; DESKTOPS _ &LR;  A home computer has become an absolute necessity for
school-age children. Fortunately, prices have fallen so far that
most families should be able to afford one. Whether for homework,
Web cruising, e-mail or game-playing, the computer will likely
become the focal point of many home activities. Here's how to
choose one with the right features and the right price.  &UR; BY BECKY &LR; 
 &UR; WARING &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; APPLY _  &LR;  Kids today have it so easy.
</P>
<P>
   If you're a college graduate of practically any age, you
probably had to choose between typing college application forms and
filling them out in pen. The first option was a disaster _ the
form's tiny blanks were impossible to aim at, and after 15 tries
your application would be so heavy with Wite-Out, it would require
extra postage. As for using pen, if your handwriting wasn't neat,
you were doomed.  &UR; BY CARRIE KIRBY &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; SCHOLARS _ &LR;  If you care to do research on the North American loon,
you could land a $3,000 education grant.
</P>
<P>
   If birds aren't your thing, the makers of Calgon bath and body
lotions have up to $2,500 in scholarship money ready for students
who can stomach answering fragrant queries like this one in 450
words or less:
</P>
<P>
   ``Calgon flavors like Sparkling Raspberries, In the Rain and
Moon Petal Musk are truly inspired! Which teacher inspired you most
and how?''  &UR; BY BENNY EVANGELISTA &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; SOFTWARE _ &LR;  OK, so I went about the SATs all wrong.
</P>
<P>
   At least that's what I learned after experimenting with some of
the software titles designed to help raise scores on the dreaded
Scholastic Achievement Test _ one of the rights of passage for most
college-bound students.
</P>
<P>
   Way back in 1989 when I took the SATs, my math and English
teachers stressed memorizing endless geometry formulas and
vocabulary lists. In other words, they advocated doing every
problem and analogy the long _ or right _ way.  &UR; BY KELLY ZITO &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; DISTANCE _ &LR;  For college student Jaxon Louie, taking an online
course has several advantages.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can go to school ... without leaving home,'' said the
University of California at Berkeley student. ``I remember waking
up one minute before a class session, turning on the computer and
in a matter of moments I was there.''
</P>
<P>
   And, he added, there are no crowded classrooms and ``you won't
get bored because you could be doing other things at the same time
_ like watch TV,'' Louie said.  &UR; BY BENNY EVANGELISTA &LR;

 DESKTOPS OFFER STUDENTS VERSATILITY  &HT;     By BECKY WARING 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A home computer has become an absolute necessity
for school-age children. Fortunately, prices have fallen so far
that most families should be able to afford one. Whether for
homework, Web cruising, e-mail or game-playing, the computer will
likely become the focal point of many home activities. Here's how
to choose one with the right features and the right price.
</P>
<P>
   We have chosen three PCs for varying budgets, plus an Apple iMac
model. All have everything your child needs for school activities.
Some go a lot further, such as adding multimedia playback
capabilities and even the ability to make your own music CDs.
Buying the best you can afford provides some measure of protection
against premature obsolescence, always a consideration with
computer purchases. You will also likely get a much more versatile
and expandable machine.
</P>
<P>
   As for buying the computer, we recommend scouting out the
build-to-order options on most every vendor's Web site (Apple,
Compaq, Dell, Gateway, Hewlett-Packard and Sony all have extensive
online stores, among others). This lets you save money by tailoring
a system to your exact needs.
</P>
<P>
   Features to Look For:
</P>
<P>
   -- Processor/RAM. Budget-conscious desktop buyers looking for
deals for less than $1,000 should consider models with Intel
Celeron and AMD K6-2 processors. Clock speeds around 500 MHz are
just fine for most schoolwork and game playing. You will compromise
on things like 3-D and video horsepower. For serious multimedia
capabilities, look to the Intel Pentium III line and clock speeds
in the 600 to 700 MHz range. Don't overspend on the clock speed
however. A couple hundred extra bucks is probably better allocated
to more memory (get at least 64 MB, or 128 MB for multimedia) and
add-ons such as a CD recorder.
</P>
<P>
   -- Software/Operating System. We recommend Windows 98 over
Windows 2000 for both portables and desktops due to ease-of-use and
compatibility issues. Windows Millennium Edition is coming soon,
however, and may even be shipping by the time you get around to
buying. At the least, ask your salesperson if you can get a coupon
for an upgrade to Window ME when you buy your new computer.
</P>
<P>
   All our recommended systems (except the iMac) include Microsoft
Word and virus-scanning utilities. Most also include an array of
home and educational software. If you are buying a first computer,
online build-to-order vendors like Dell and Gateway also offer
special add-on software value packs that are inexpensive ways to
start building your library.
</P>
<P>
   -- Storage. It's a general rule that however much hard-disk
space you buy, you will quickly fill it up, especially in these
days of huge digital-camera picture files and MP3 music downloads.
We have therefore ``specced out'' our recommended systems with
hefty hard disks, typically 20 to 30 MB. On the higher-end systems,
we also recommend a DVD-ROM drive. You will likely want to add it
on in the near future, and it's cheaper and easier to get it built
in. Another popular extra is a CD-recorder, which is included in
the Sony multimedia-oriented system in our chart. You can add it on
to most build-to-order models.
</P>
<P>
   -- Expansion. All the PC desktops in our chart have plenty of
expansion capability, being tower models. The compact iMac is an
exception. The PCs have varying numbers of USB ports (the new
standard for attaching peripherals like printers and scanners),
serial and parallel ports, and miscellaneous audio and video
connections. They also have extra PCI slots and drive bays for
internal expansion. Because there are so many different home
networking schemes, we didn't price the systems with Ethernet, but
add about $50 for a network card if you need one.
</P>
<P>
   -- Monitor. All our choices include a monitor in the price;
there are two 15-inch models, and two 17-inchers. The extra $100 or
so for a 17-inch monitor is well worth the price. There's more
screen real estate for viewing Web sites and working with multiple
applications, or you can use the extra space to increase pixel size
and ease eyestrain. The 15-inch screens are usually viewed at
800x600 or 1024x768, 17-inchers at 1024x768 or 1280x1024. A given
resolution, for example 1024x768, that looks cramped at 15 inches
will be easy to read at 17 inches.
</P>
<P>
   If you really want to splurge, you might also consider a
flat-screen LCD monitor. These are a lot more expensive than
traditional CRT monitors, but look great and save space.
</P>
<P>
   -- Warranty and Technical Support. Of the four vendors shown
here, Dell has the most generous warranty and tech support
features. Other vendors tend to limit the amount of time you can
make calls related to software issues, although all have one-year
hardware warranty and tech support. All four vendors have excellent
online tech support areas, which are the first place to turn when
you have a problem or need a software driver.
</P>
<P>
   The Budget Saver:
</P>
<P>
   -- Dell Dimension L566cx. Dell is sort of the Wal-Mart of
computing: It has all the most popular products at the lowest
prices possible, backed by good quality and service. The Dimension
line goes all the way to the high end, but we chose the entry-level
model as a paragon of price and performance. The L566cx has all the
basics for home and education, just lacking bells and whistles such
as DVD drives and superfast processors. Keep in mind that you can
customize any Dell with various add-ons, so be careful not to run
up the bill when you start shopping.
</P>
<P>
   The Mid-Priced Speedster:
</P>
<P>
   -- HP Pavilion. HP's Pavilion line is squarely aimed at the home
user and offers excellent value for the money. Rather than going
for one of the off-the-shelf models, we specced out a machine with
a 17-inch screen, 733 MHz Pentium III, top-notch video card,
DVD-ROM drive, 128 MB of RAM and 15 GB hard disk for just $1,271.
It also comes with all the right consumer software in a
well-designed case. What more can you ask? Well, maybe a
CD-rewritable drive or inkjet printer, two bases that HP has
covered in spades, being a market leader in each. Just add them to
your build-to-order list.
</P>
<P>
   The Multimedia Maven:
</P>
<P>
   -- Sony PCV-R553DS VAIO Digital Studio. If you want to go beyond
the basics to get a real multimedia powerhouse, Sony's Digital
Studio lives up to its name. It has an almost dizzying array of
software for editing digital images and movies, even creating Web
video, and has built-in i.LINK (IEEE 1394) ports for DV camcorders.
</P>
<P>
   Even better, it has dual DVD-ROM and CD-RW drives. This lets you
copy files easily from one to the other, for backup purposes or for
making custom CD-audio mix discs. The 17-inch flat Trinitron screen
is also much higher quality than the run-of-the-mill models you
will find in most consumer systems.
</P>
<P>
   The Mac Alternative:
</P>
<P>
   -- Apple iMac DV+. Apple rolled out its new iMac line a couple
weeks ago. As usual, the focus is on multimedia. If you have seen
Apple's TV commercials, you have already guessed that the iMac DV
is the cheapest and easiest way to get into editing video with your
DV camcorder. We recommend the iMac DV+ for its 30 GB hard disk,
DVD-ROM drive and 450 MHz PowerPC G3 processor, which outperforms
Pentium IIIs with much higher clock speeds.
</P>
<P>
   The iMac DV+ is also a great multimedia playback machine, with
its Harman-Kardon speakers, fast video card with 3-D acceleration
and special theater-screen mode, which increases brightness while
playing movies. In a dorm room, it can double as an entertainment
center for CDs and DVD movies.

machine for each. For the cost conscious, there's our budget saver
choice; for the kid who has everything, there's the full-featured
model that rivals desktop functionality; and for those who take
things everywhere, an ultralight model. Finally, we've also made a
selection for Mac users.
</P>
<P>
   Note that your total computer budget should also include a
printer, padded carrying case, and possibly a scanner. These can be
had for an extra $250 or so. Inexpensive inkjet printers are just
fine for schoolwork.
</P>
<P>
   Features to Look For:
</P>
<P>
   -- Display. Portable displays have come a long way recently.
Almost all are now bright active-matrix varieties, with full 24-bit
color. A few under-$1,000 portables still have passive-matrix DSTN
screens _ steer clear of these. For most student use, a 12.1-inch
800x600 SVGA screen is fine. If the portable will be the student's
only machine and will be used heavily, consider a 14.1-inch
``desktop replacement'' size screen. These are much more expensive
but worth it if you've got the bucks.
</P>
<P>
   -- Processor/RAM. If all your scholar will be doing is word
processing, Web surfing and e-mail, there's no need to spring for
the latest processor. The processor and screen are the two most
costly components of any portable. Consider Intel's Celeron line,
or the AMD K6-2 as lower-cost alternatives to the Pentium III. And
if you do decide on a PIII, don't get the very fastest version. A
650-MHz model costs hundreds more than a 500 MHz, for little
appreciable improvement in most tasks. As for RAM, get at least 64
MB. All our choices have that much RAM, although 96 MB is even
better. Serious Web research benefits greatly from added RAM.
</P>
<P>
   -- Storage. All our choices have at least a 6-GB hard disk.
Multimedia files like pictures and music take up a lot of space and
are staples of student life. All the portables except the Sony also
have a built-in CD-ROM or DVD drive. The Sony is an ultralight,
where you have to buy an external CD or DVD drive. Only the Apple
iBook lacks a floppy, which is an $89 option. Consider buying an
external CD recorder if your student wants to make audio and
picture CDs or backup the hard disk.
</P>
<P>
   -- Expansion. All the PC models have the requisite USB, serial,
parallel and external VGA monitor ports, as well as PC card slots
and 56K modems. Other useful connections to look for are Ethernet
ports for networking at school (a built-in port saves filling up a
PC Card slot) and an IEEE 1394 (FireWire) port for connecting
digital camcorders.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, some portables have special connectors for docking
stations, which let you plug into peripherals such as printers,
monitors, external drives, full-size keyboards and mice more easily
(using just one plug instead of many).
</P>
<P>
   -- Battery life. Battery life on most portables is pretty poor,
typically one to three hours. The iBook is the standout here, with
four to six hours of life. We recommend getting an extra battery
for long sessions in the coffee shop or park. (The library, on the
other hand, should have plugs!)
</P>
<P>
   -- Software/operating system. For home/student use, definitely
go with Windows 98, rather than Windows 2000 Professional. It's
easier to use, and has more support for popular applications and
games. Do look for free upgrades to this summer's Windows ME
(Millennium Edition), however. Also look for Microsoft Word (best
for exchanging files with others) and valuable extras such as virus
protection software, encyclopedias and photo editing software.
</P>
<P>
   -- Warranty and technical support. Pretty much all vendors offer
a one-year basic warranty. Also look into extended warranties for
portables, which are very prone to problems. Just be forewarned
that if the screen gets broken because it was shoved into a
backpack, it's not covered.
</P>
<P>
   For tech support, look for 24-hour, seven-days a week, toll-free
access. Compaq shines here. Sony and Apple have skimpy 90-day
rules, although you can buy more with extended warranties. Also
look for good Web-based support sites, which all three companies
have.
</P>
<P>
   The Budget Saver:
</P>
<P>
   -- Compaq Presario 1200-XL118. Compaq's Presario line is
especially designed for home and school, and sports a full range of
models from $1,000 on up. We looked at nearly a dozen other vendors
but ended up choosing two Compaqs to fill the budget and desktop
replacement slots.
</P>
<P>
   The 1200-XL is just $1,199 but is stacked with features that
will appeal directly to most students. The screen is not the
biggest, nor the processor the fastest, but it's got a full
complement of ports and slots for expansion (including USB) and has
a built-in floppy drive, CD-ROM drive and 56K modem. It also
bundles Microsoft's Works 2000 suite, with Word and the Encarta
encyclopedia, two educational essentials.
</P>
<P>
   On the fun side, it's got 3-D video acceleration for game
playing and MPEG video playback capabilities, as well as great
audio features. It sports JBL Pro Audio speakers with Bass Reflex
and special audio CD player function keys and a volume control
button.
</P>
<P>
   There are also special Internet buttons that take you directly
to common Web functions like search.
</P>
<P>
   The Desktop Replacement:
</P>
<P>
   -- Compaq Presario 1800. The Presario 1800 we looked at on
Compaq's build-to-order Web site weighs no more than the 1200-XL
but packs in the power. It's got all the above features, plus a
14.1-inch screen, big enough to watch movies on, and a DVD drive to
play them.
</P>
<P>
   It's also got a superfast 600 MHz Pentium III processor and a
video out port so you can connect it to a TV monitor for showing
those DVDs. Integrated Ethernet lets students hook up to the
network outlets in classrooms and dorms, and a docking port
connector adds versatility. When you buy on the Web site, you also
get a Compaq inkjet printer for $1 and a coupon for a free upgrade
to Windows ME when it ships.
</P>
<P>
   The Ultralight:
</P>
<P>
   -- Sony PCG-Z505JE VAIO SuperSlim Pro. Sony's VAIO line combines
light weight (3.75 pounds), super multimedia features and
expandability. While it may be a little on the expensive side, if
you want an ultralight, it's a great choice with features that will
appeal to students.
</P>
<P>
   It's got a Memory Stick port for data exchange with certain
digital cameras and MP3 players, an IEEE 1394 port for connecting
DV camcorders, as well as a full suite of photo and movie editing
tools. It comes with an external USB floppy drive _ add a DVD drive
and you've got a real multimedia workhorse. A port replicator is
also included for easy desktop connections.
</P>
<P>
   The Mac Alternative:
</P>
<P>
   -- Apple iBook. Whether you choose blueberry or tangerine, the
iBook tastes great. It's designed with students in mind and has a
rugged case that can withstand backpack abuse.
</P>
<P>
   It also has a crisp 12.1-inch screen and a nice $1,599 price tag
(for $1,799 you can also get the 366 MHz Graphite Special Edition
model). The iBook has built-in Ethernet and an AirPort wireless
networking slot covering the connectivity bases. It lacks a
built-in floppy, like all of Apple's recent Macs, but you can
attach one to the USB port. All in all, it's a top-notch student
machine.

 TECH-SAVVY STUDENTS NO LONGER NEED CHEAT SHEETS TO TRICK TEACHERS  &HT;     By TODD WALLACK 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Call it high-tech cheating.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since graphical calculators started popping up in the
classroom, quick studies have found ways to program them with
complex formulas, hard-to-remember vocabulary words and other hints
to gain an edge during tests.
</P>
<P>
   Rebecca, who asked that her last name not be used, said she and
her high school classmates in Los Angeles cheated all the time
using TI-85 calculators, especially in chemistry and calculus about
five years ago. Eventually, proctors for the Advanced Placement
tests got wise and started walking down the aisles, checking to
make sure all the students cleared their calculator's memory.
</P>
<P>
   But the students found a new trick: They programmed the gadgets
to display ``memory cleared'' when they pressed a button right next
to the actual key for erasing programs. ``The proctors never knew
the difference,'' said Rebecca, who now lives in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Experts easily cite other examples of how students are
increasingly employing their computers and other electronics to
gain an unfair edge. Some students use laser printers and tiny
fonts to squeeze more data onto crib sheets. Others swap answers by
sending short text messages with pagers and cell phones. Some
students have been caught hacking into school computers to change
their grades. And countless more have copied term papers and essays
posted online.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just too easy,'' said Don McCabe, a Rutgers University
management professor who has studied cheating for the past decade.
In a survey last fall, nearly 10 percent of college students
confessed to stealing papers from the Internet. ``There's no
question that the level of cheating is disturbingly high.''
</P>
<P>
   Other examples of high-tech cheating:
</P>
<P>
   - Thirty engineering students at Northeastern University were
caught earlier this year exploiting a bug in the school's computer
program that allowed them to copy each others' homework
assignments, which were stored online.
</P>
<P>
   -- University of California at Berkeley professors caught 150
students plagiarizing papers in two classes after the students were
told to upload the papers to a Web site run by Plagiarism.org, an
Oakland company that scans the Internet and a database of
previously uploaded papers to check for duplicates.
</P>
<P>
   -- Berkeley High School refused to graduate 29 seniors this year
after discovering they paid a classmate to break into a school
computer and raise their grades.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy-eight students at Dartmouth College were charged with
copying the answers to a homework assignment that were posted
online, although the case was dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, cheaters have long predated computers. And, although
there has been a rise in cheating since the '60s, McCabe says there
is little hard research to show a meteoric rise. McCabe suspects
that the same people who peered over their neighbors' exams years
ago or scribbled answers on their shoes are now using calculators
and online term-paper mills.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question it's attracted new people, but it's not a
wild increase,'' McCabe said.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Zuidema, an administrator at UC Berkeley, said he has
seen no indications of an increase in cheating during the past few
years, though more people are getting caught copying information
from the Internet. Four years ago, the school even caught a student
trying to break into the school's computer system to change his
grades.
</P>
<P>
   Some stories are even more outlandish. McCabe, for instance,
loves to talk about the time a campus security guard spotted a van
slowly circling a high school in New Jersey. The first few times
seemed odd. Finally, when it came around a fourth time, the guard
stopped the van and checked inside.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from an anxious driver, he spotted someone seated at a
desk, text books fanned out in front of him. As it turned out, the
man was frantically figuring out the answers to an exam and
radioing them to a student inside the building. (One student had
sneaked out just after the test began to slip him a copy of the
exam.)
</P>
<P>
   Most examples of cheating are far more mundane. Students
routinely plug keywords for their homework assignments into an
Internet search engine, find some relevant text, then copy and
paste.
</P>
<P>
   Some go further, though, and grab entire essays. Dozens of sites
with names like Cheater.com, Net Essays and BigNerds.com provide
ready access to thousands of papers, often for free.
</P>
<P>
   The founder of Schoolsucks.com says 10,000 people a day visit
his site, which offers 4,500 free papers in 120 languages,
including Yiddish and Swahili. The 4-year-old Web site features the
word ``Homework'' with a red slash across it and an ``A+'' at the
bottom of a wrinkled sheet of notepaper.
</P>
<P>
   Founder Kenny Sahr brags that teachers are his best marketing
tool. He says instructors routinely warn students to steer clear of
the site, prompting the students to hop online to find out what all
the fuss is about.
</P>
<P>
   But even Sahr, 28, says ``it's stupid to plagiarize'' papers
from the site because many are poorly written. None of the papers
are graded, so some students aren't sure what they are downloading.
Plus, many teachers know about the site anyway, Sahr adds.
</P>
<P>
   McCabe, though, says it is common for younger students to grab
papers, even of relatively low quality, rather than spend time
doing homework. In focus groups, he said, kids say it is easy to
find information online and the ``teachers are clueless.''
</P>
<P>
   But McCabe said college students say it is harder to fool
professors because they demand higher quality and generally know
their particular field well.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not deterring cheaters from trying. John Barrie, a
recent UC Berkeley graduate who helped start Plagiarism.org a
little more than a year ago, said 15 percent of the college papers
uploaded into his system set off alarms _ meaning a similar paper
is already online or has been uploaded before. Barrie suspects that
most professors who don't use the software and often rely on
teaching assistants to check papers usually don't catch the
plagiarism.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is a lot worse than anyone knows,'' he said.
``Students have been getting away with it in a bold-faced way.''
</P>
<P>
   Barrie says instructors at 125 campuses now use the tool, but
few use it campuswide. (UC Berkeley hopes to make it available to
every department starting this fall.)
</P>
<P>
   And both McCabe and Barrie say relatively few teachers bother to
go through the trouble of trying to catch cheaters or go through
the cumbersome disciplinary process to prove them guilty.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, Barrie argues, if a prestigious college uses the service
campuswide and finds thousands of plagiarists, what would it mean
for the school's reputation?
</P>
<P>
   ``Do they really want to turn over the rock?'' he asked. ``There
is not a lot of incentive for certain universities to do anything
about the problem.''

 KIDS' KNOWLEDGE OF TECHNOLOGY CAN BE HUMBLING FOR THEIR PARENTS  &HT;     By DAN FOST 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ At the tender age of 10, Jake Schlackman enjoys
his role as his family's computer tutor.
</P>
<P>
   ``You feel like you get to be the boss, for once,'' Jake said.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to computers, kids are often in charge, as
technophobic parents struggle to keep up.
</P>
<P>
   Often it's a blessing when a child like Jake can teach his dad
how to use Adobe Photoshop, or fix his grandmother's iMac so she
can access the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But it's also a challenge for many parents who came of age in a
generation that didn't have computers and still want to take an
active role in their children's education.
</P>
<P>
   Have no fear. There are resources available. Librarians are
often willing to teach the basics of Net navigating. And teachers
can show parents the computer lab and discuss what kind of
instruction the kids are getting.
</P>
<P>
   Ambitious parents can even take classes at community colleges,
which offer affordable instruction in the basics of computers.
</P>
<P>
   And, echoing a common theme, one expert suggests the best
teacher of all.
</P>
<P>
   ``If all else fails, you go find a 17-year-old. They know it
all,'' said Warren Buckleitner, editor of Children's Software
Revue, a bimonthly magazine ( &LR; www.childrenssoftware.com &LR; ) published
in Flemington, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the experts say, when your child is more technically
adept than you are, don't fear it _ embrace it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell parents this is your biggest opportunity to let your
kids be the teacher,'' said Robin Raskin, editor in chief of
FamilyPC magazine. ``When you're going on vacation, let the wired
kid plan it. Have the wired kid research buying the car.''
</P>
<P>
   Anne Bubnic, who runs Custom Computers for Kids, a consultant
service in Novato, suggests volunteering in the schools. Parents
can lend a helping hand in the computer lab and learn at the same
time.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon Robertson, who teaches computers at McAteer High School
in San Francisco, is willing to help show parents around the
computer lab, but he says most of the parents he sees are
overwhelmed by the technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``They really appreciate that their kids are learning how to use
equipment that guarantees them at least a foothold in the job
market,'' Robertson said.
</P>
<P>
   Parents with computers at home, however, need to be involved
when their children are using the computer. Bubnic advises keeping
the computer in a central, high-traffic area of the house, so you
can keep a watchful eye on how it is used.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not necessary for a parent to know everything, but it is
necessary for a parent to understand what a child is doing at the
computer,'' Bubnic said.
</P>
<P>
   Parents may often have to step in to set limhow long a
child may be online. ``Parents say the phone rings constantly _ and
it's always calls from kids who are already talking to their child
online,'' Bubnic said. When they're playing online games, for
instance, ``They'll call each other to say, `Did I just hit you, or
did you get me?'''
</P>
<P>
   Even the most computer-illiterate parents bring something to the
table when it comes to technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``You as a parent bring a moral framework and life experience
and set of attitudes,'' Raskin said. ``With issues like Napster and
plagiarism and pornography and hate sites, you as a parent can be
really effective. Those are issues that kids will face online, and
you'd better bring your parenting skills whether you understand
technology or not. But you'd better try to understand as much of
the technology as you can.''
</P>
<P>
   Dory Schramm of Alamo is one of those parents who fear the
Internet. She tried to set up her three young sons with restricted
Internet access, but the oldest boy was able to rig the machine so
he could send instant messages and cruise the Net freely.
</P>
<P>
   Schramm gave up and let him do it, and gave her other boys
complete Net access as well. ``There's a trust thing you have to
have with your kids,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, parents who find computers intimidating need to
remain calm.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, said Stephen Gass, group president of Sesame Workshop,
which produces  &LR; www.sesamestreet.com &LR; , ``It wasn't so long ago
people were dubious about cash machines and voice mail. It will get
easier. It always does.''

MORE UNIVERSITIES TO OFFER CLASSES, DEGREE PROGRAMS VIA
THE  INTERNET
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By BENNY EVANGELISTA 
 &HT;     c.2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
SAN FRANCISCO _ For college student Jaxon Louie, taking an online
course has several advantages.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can go to school ... without leaving home,'' said the
University of California at Berkeley student. ``I remember waking
up one minute before a class session, turning on the computer and
in a matter of moments I was there.''
</P>
<P>
   And, he added, there are no crowded classrooms and ``you won't
get bored because you could be doing other things at the same time
_ like watch TV,'' Louie said.
</P>
<P>
   Louie is one of business Professor George Cluff's class of
``Space Bears,'' a dozen students enrolled in a unique 12-week
course designed to be the school's first fully online undergraduate
class.
</P>
<P>
   The business course, ``Strategic Planning for a Global
Economy,'' is taught through a Web site that features an online
lecture room, a tutorial room, links to research material and a
chat room.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the first bears in cyberspace,'' said Cluff, drawing the
name from the nickname of Cal's sports teams, the Golden Bears.
``The intent is to reach students anywhere in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   They are not alone in cyberspace. The Internet is quietly but
quickly transforming distance education, with august institutions
such as Stanford University, Cornell University and Temple
University offering continuing education classes and degrees
online.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's any school anywhere where distance
learning is not on their agenda,'' said Mike Rouan, manager of
Stanford Online, which offers a master's degree in electrical
engineering.
</P>
<P>
   Distance learning itself is not new. Mail-order correspondence
schools have been around for a century, and more recently, students
have ``attended'' classes brought to them by television or CD-ROM.
But the Internet is proving to be a faster and more comprehensive
method of delivering education away from the traditional classroom.
</P>
<P>
   According to the education research firm Market Data Retrieval,
72 percent of 1,028 colleges surveyed said they offered distance
learning programs last year, 34 percent of them offering an
accredited degree. That was a jump from the year before, when only
48 percent offered distance learning programs, and only 15 percent
offered degrees.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 700,000 people took online courses last year, and
that number is expected to balloon to 2.2 million by 2002, said
Terry Hartle, senior vice president of the American Council on
Education, a trade group representing 1,800 two- and four-year
colleges.
</P>
<P>
   One example is the online program run by the University of
Maryland University College _ the biggest in the world _ where
enrollment in classes has exploded from 10,000 just two years ago
to 40,000 this year, Hartle said.
</P>
<P>
   And the University of Phoenix, which has become the largest
private university in the country, offers online bachelor's degrees
in business and information technology for its 12,000 registered
online students.
</P>
<P>
   By far, most of the online courses available are related to
business, finance, accounting or electronics, ``which are going to
trump humanities, social sciences and fine arts for the time
being,'' Hartle said.
</P>
<P>
   The courses offered online mainly cater to the needs of working
professionals who have a hard time making it to a classroom once or
twice a week, but seek some post-degree education to improve their
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Students are taking the courses whenever it suits them,''
Hartle said. ``If they want to take the course at three in the
morning dressed in their bathrobes, it's up to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanford Online, part of the Engineering School's Center for
Professional Development, is an outgrowth of curriculum offered by
the Stanford Instructional Television Network for the past 31
years. Geared toward Silicon Valley professionals who already have
bachelor's degrees, the school has delivered continuing education
classes through closed-circuit television and videotape.
</P>
<P>
   But with the Internet, class lectures on subjects like computer
programming or accounting can be streamed live and archived for
later viewing, giving students a ``hybrid'' clicks-and-mortar
classroom experience, Rouan said.
</P>
<P>
   On the Stanford Online Web site, a demonstration of a virtual
class shows video from a professor's lecture on molecular biology
streamed on one side of the screen, with slides from the
accompanying PowerPoint presentation on the other. Other links call
up the course description, class assignments, grades and chat rooms
to contact other students.
</P>
<P>
   Some regular students are using the online courses to review
lectures they attended in person or to be able to take two courses
scheduled at the same time. Some are even using them to forgo
sitting sleepily through an 8 a.m. class in favor of a 10 p.m.
replay.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the biggest number of hits to online courses come
between 10 p.m. and 2 a.m., Rouan said.
</P>
<P>
   Cluff's class at UC Berkeley was designed to give students the
option of staying completely online _ interacting directly with
Cluff by e-mail or chat rooms _ or combining that with
person-to-person visits with the professor. Most opted for the
face-to-face visits.
</P>
<P>
   The class was designed for 42 students, but had only 12 this
summer because of some ``administrative glitches.'' Cluff hopes to
get the full complement next summer.
</P>
<P>
   Cluff said he believes more reliance on online education
programs will become one major solution to the problem faced by the
state's university system, which won't be able to build enough
classrooms to handle a spike in enrollment expected during the next
three to five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to use existing bricks and mortar more
intelligently,'' Cluff said.
</P>
<P>
   Online education is not without controversy. Critics still
question whether students can get the same quality education
through an impersonal computer as they can with face-to-face
interaction with teachers and other students.
</P>
<P>
   Critics also say the rise in distance learning is turning
education into a commercial commodity that might distract colleges
from their traditional purpose: expanding students' minds.
</P>
<P>
   But Hartle said online education continues to grow. Some
education experts estimate distance learning will become a
$250-billion-a-year market. Web sites like HungryMinds.com,
DigitalThink.com, WebCT.com and Blackboard.com have sprung up to
position themselves as portals to online learning. And universities
such as Stanford, Carnegie Mellon and Columbia have signed deals
with UNext.com, an Illinois company that is creating a virtual
college.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a period of very rapid change in post-secondary
education,'' Hartle said. ``We're in the middle of a revolution,
and it's hard to tell where it's going to go. It's an era of
enormous promise and an era of enormous questions.''

 BIOSCOPE: PRESCRIPTION PRICES VEXING CONGRESS  &HT;     By TOM ABATE  
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
SAN FRANCISCO _ As visiting lawmakers filed off the bus at Alza
Corp. in Mountain View, Calif., last week, they walked past a sign
that read: ``Welcome to 10 percent of the U.S. Congress.''
<P>
   The sign was a bit exaggerated. Several no-shows brought the
delegation down to three dozen lawmakers, all Democrats, who raced
through the region to gawk at the New Economy on their way to their
party's convention in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the sentiment was valid. The Alza tour, which was
organized by Rep. Anna Eshoo, D-Atherton, Calif., and Rep. Nancy
Pelosi, D-San Francisco, is arguably the largest congressional
junket to ever view the region's biotech industry.
</P>
<P>
   The visit came at a time when Congress is wrestling with how to
add prescription drug benefits to Medicare without bankrupting a
system that is already on the financial ropes.
</P>
<P>
   Prescriptions have never been covered by basic Medicare. That
puts the payment burden on seniors whose prescription bills can run
thousands of dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the bipartisan desire to please the potent senior lobby,
election-year politics worked against change. Republicans wanted to
solve the problem by encouraging seniors to join Medicare HMOs.
Democrats said that wasn't a solution because HMOs are pulling out
of some locales, especially rural areas. Democrats proposed having
Medicare pay for prescriptions directly but that ran into
Republican objections to a new government-funded entitlement.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, both parties decided they'd get more mileage out of
blaming each other for failure than they could have by sharing
credit for a successful compromise.
</P>
<P>
   But when the new Congress convenes next year, the Medicare drug
issue will remain at the top of the agenda _ along with the
question of how to pay for a benefit that will cost tens of
billions of dollars. And the big fear in industry circles is that
lawmakers will be tempted to enact some form of price control to
cap the overall cost.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, none of this was discussed openly during the two-hour
congressional stopover at Alza. This event was a soft sell, a
chance to show off the developments pouring out of Bay Area biotech
labs, with the subtle subtext being not to kill the goose that lays
the golden egg.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn Kailian, chief executive of Cor Therapeutics, talked
about his company's new drug, Integrilin, which unclogs blocked
arteries. ``We think we've prevented 10,000 heart attacks, which
makes us pretty proud,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ajit Gil, chief executive of Inhale Therapeutics, showed off a
new device that dispenses a powdery form of insulin. If Inhale wins
government approval next year, it will provide diabetics with the
option of inhaling their daily insulin dose instead of taking
injections.
</P>
<P>
   The closest the discussion ever came to Medicare was during a
presentation by Michael Coffee, president of Elan Pharmaceuticals
in South San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Elan is beginning human trials of a drug that shows great
promise for preventing and treating Alzheimer's disease. Coffee,
together with Elan chief scientist Dale Schenk, explained how it
has taken 10 years and tens of millions of dollars just to bring
their drug to Phase I clinical trials _ where it still stands only
a 30 percent chance of getting approved to sell.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're relying on investor confidence and the kind of
(financial) environment we have here in America,'' Coffee said in
polite political code.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, I asked Coffee to spell out his concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Price controls,'' he said without hesitation. Without the
unfettered ability to charge whatever the market will bear for hit
drugs, the industry could never afford to pay for its many
failures.
</P>
<P>
   Coffee said price controls have already undermined the drug
industries of Europe. It is an open secret in pharmaceutical
circles that every developed country, with the exception of the
United States, has some form of government price controls on drugs.
Coffee said these controls have driven firms like his _ Elan is an
Irish company _ to American shores.
</P>
<P>
   ``There used to be a lot of drug development in the United
Kingdom and France and Germany but now much of it takes place
here,'' said Coffee, because the free market permits a higher
potential return on investment.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the absence of price controls also means Americans
pay more for prescription drugs than, say, Europeans or Japanese.
Whenever I question industry lobbyists about this, they say that
America's free-wheeling system benefits the whole world. American
venture capitalists take the biggest risks and support the
companies that produce the most innovative drugs, in part because
they know they can get the biggest rewards here. If Congress
changes that risk-reward ratio, it risks slowing down the pace of
medical development for the entire world.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps. Or perhaps medical science would quit chasing riches
and focus on public health measures that, while not as profitable
as a new patented remedy, might yield more health benefit than
costly wonder drugs.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, when Congress takes up the Medicare drug issue
next year, the cost of the program is sure to spawn debate about
prices. ``They (industry leaders) know if we provide a benefit, we
have a duty to control the costs,'' said Rep. Pete Stark,
D-Hayward, Calif., one of the ranking leaders in the House
hierarchy on health issues.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, drug industry leaders should at least thank
Americans for subsidizing drug development through their
prescription payments. I'm thinking of TV spots along the lines of
the old Chevron spiel: ``Do Americans really pay more for
prescriptions so that drug companies can be rewarded for developing
remedies for the whole world? Americans do.''

WEB-SURF YOUR WAY TO COLLEGE BY RESEARCHING GRANTS,
SCHOLARSHIPS  ONLINE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By BENNY EVANGELISTA 
 &HT;     c.2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
SAN FRANCISCO _ If you care to do research on the North American
loon, you could land a $3,000 education grant.
</P>
<P>
   If birds aren't your thing, the makers of Calgon bath and body
lotions have up to $2,500 in scholarship money ready for students
who can stomach answering fragrant queries like this one in 450
words or less:
</P>
<P>
   ``Calgon flavors like Sparkling Raspberries, In the Rain and
Moon Petal Musk are truly inspired! Which teacher inspired you most
and how?''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the Web, it's easier than ever to find these and
thousands of well-known-to-obscure scholarships and grants to help
pay your way through college. But be prepared to spend a little
time answering questions and sifting through dozens of pages of
information.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, don't fall for scams that ask you to pay any money
to search for scholarships because the information is already there
online for free, said Tim McDonough, public affairs director for
the American Council on Education.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get very nervous when we find out about a service that asks
people to send in $200 or $300 to have them do a scholarship
search,'' McDonough said.
</P>
<P>
   Students and parents may want to first peruse the Federal Trade
Commission's Web site on how to avoid scholarship scams,
www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/edcams/scholarship/sixsigns.htm.
</P>
<P>
   Next, there's the U.S. Department of Education's Student
Financial Assistance Web site at
www.ed.gov/offices/OSFAP/Students/, where you can learn about a
program that provides more than $40 billion a year in grants,
loans, and work-study assistance. You can also apply online.
</P>
<P>
   Your school of choice may even have online financial aid
information. The University of California at Berkeley, for example,
is developing a Scholarship Connection Web site with online and
off-line resources. The site, at http://scholarships.berkeley.edu,
will soon have a searchable database.
</P>
<P>
   Another place to start an online scholarship search is
www.collegeispossible.org, a Web site that is part of a pro-college
campaign sponsored by the Council on Education and numerous
organizations like the National Association for Student Financial
Aid Administrators and the College Board.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site has links to five free online search services
operated by Fastweb.com, the College Board, SRN Express, College
Net and Sallie Mae.
</P>
<P>
   According to the site, 95 percent of scholarships come from the
federal or state governments or individual colleges and
universities, covering bigger portions of tuitions or educational
fees. The remaining 5 percent come from private loans and
scholarships, where the awards of $500 or less are still good
enough to pay for books or other incidental expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Commercial college-help Web sites like San Francisco's
Embark.com also use databases like Sallie Mae's WiredScholar.com
service, which you can also access directly.
</P>
<P>
   I searched several different sites on behalf of my son, who is a
high school senior and is thinking about a career in medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Some sites, like www.scholarships.com, require you to enter more
than two dozen fields of detailed information to help narrow the
scholarship search. These include the student's PSAT, SAT and ACT
scores, college choices, hobbies, religion, household income and
date of birth.
</P>
<P>
   McDonough said parents and students should carefully consider
whether they want to divulge such information or data like a Social
Security number.
</P>
<P>
   The searches turned up several pages worth of scholarship
possibilities that would be otherwise hard to gather from just
reading the bulletin boards outside a high school guidance
counselor's office.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson's CollegeQuest.com, for example, dug up the $100 to
$3,000 grants from the North American Loon Fund for ``research,
management and education projects'' on that bird _ presumably a
grant for upper division or grad students, not college freshmen.
</P>
<P>
   More on the mark, CollegeQuest.com came back with information on
the California Student Aid Commission, which last year awarded
educational grants worth $1,410 to $9,422.
</P>
<P>
   Fastweb.com, which according to San Francisco online monitoring
service Media Metrix Inc. was the busiest online scholarship site
in June, returned 18 possible scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   One was from the National Society of the Sons of the American
Revolution Inc., which was giving as many as three awards worth up
$7,500 to students who submit the best 500- to 750-word essays on
``The U.S. Constitution: Does it stand the test of time?''
</P>
<P>
   And the Texas Sheep and Goat Raiser's Auxiliary and the American
Land Foundation are awarding $100 to $1,000 to junior and senior
high school students who submit the best entries in a
letter-writing contest answering the burning question, ``Should
private property rights be an issue in the 2000 election
campaign?''
</P>
<P>
   Scholarships.com turned up 56 givers, from the Northern
California Scholarship Foundation to the National Italian American
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   The College Board's search program wasn't nearly as intrusive
because it didn't ask for specific personal details like name or
household income.
</P>
<P>
   But it still turned up 28 possible scholarships and grants from
sponsors such as Tylenol, Target, Prudential and the National
Association of Secondary School Principals.

SAT PREPARATION PROGRAMS OFFER GOOD TEST-TAKING TACTICS  

</HEADLINE>
   By KELLY ZITO  
 c.2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OK, so I went about the SATs all wrong.
</P>
<P>
   At least that's what I learned after experimenting with some of
the software titles designed to help raise scores on the dreaded
Scholastic Achievement Test _ one of the rights of passage for most
college-bound students.
</P>
<P>
   Way back in 1989 when I took the SATs, my math and English
teachers stressed memorizing endless geometry formulas and
vocabulary lists. In other words, they advocated doing every
problem and analogy the long _ or right _ way.
</P>
<P>
   While I did relatively well (don't bother skipping ahead, I
won't tell you my score), I'll bet I would have done much better if
I had used some of the techniques outlined in some of the leading
SAT preparation software titles.
</P>
<P>
   The three products I reviewed _ the Princeton Review Inside the
SAT, ACT and PSAT (2000 edition); Kaplan SAT &AMP; PSAT (2001 edition);
and Compton's Learning Score Builder for the SAT, PSAT &AMP; ACT _
varied in graphics quality and ease of use. But all three
emphasized working around the SAT questions. That is, when unsure
of the correct answer, eliminate possible wrong answers and avoid
thinking like the test writers. (I reviewed only Windows versions
and focused on the SAT portion because it was a common denominator
among all three programs.)
</P>
<P>
   In fact, all three programs took decidedly irreverent approaches
to the SAT.
</P>
<P>
   When I loaded the discs into my computer, I envisioned screen
after screen of questions right out of the SAT test booklets.
Rather, the programs seemed to undermine the SAT process
altogether. For example, the writers at Educational Testing
Services _ the New Jersey firm that makes the SAT _ were described
alternately as ``chumps'' and ``wacky.''
</P>
<P>
   The first product I tried, The Princeton Review SAT software,
published by the Learning Co., even went so far as calling the ETS
staffers ``evil.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the name calling, I liked this program a lot,
particularly the ``General Strategies'' section. It provided a
great overview of the test, told users how to spot ``trap answers''
and offered some important tips, such as the fact that both math
and verbal questions are divided into three sections in order:
easy, medium and difficult (the other programs mention these
concepts as well).
</P>
<P>
   The program's ``tutors'' were live-action Gen X types with
untucked flannel shirts and backward baseball caps, the kind of
guides who would keep teenagers interested without patronizing
them.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of SOFTWARE (28582 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  The main menu is an easy-to-navigate hallway, divided into
``General Strategies,'' ``Verbal,'' ``Math'' and a few others,
including the ``Counselor's Room,'' where users can peruse a
college applications road map or the average SAT scores for
hundreds of schools.
</P>
<P>
   Once inside the Verbal or Math ``rooms,'' users proceed through
various lessons. At any point, the user can click on an ``index''
button and skip questions or continue ahead within each section,
such as the ``Critical Reading'' portion.
</P>
<P>
   This lesson, which focuses a specific set of questions in the
Verbal section, emphasized that test takers shouldn't spend too
much time reading or memorizing the test's passages. It advised
users to get a general idea of what the passage is about, then move
as quickly as possible to the questions _ which include usually
only one about the passage's overall meaning.
</P>
<P>
   One of my only criticisms about this product is that Web access
_ which links to important sites on financial aid and virtual
campus tours _ was buried in the ``Counselor's Room.'' I think it
should have been one of the main doors off the hallway.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, this preparation course was well organized, the
interface was well designed and it was humorous without being
annoying.
</P>
<P>
   Not so with the next piece of software I tried, Kaplan SAT &AMP;
PSAT, published by Kaplan, the same company that runs training
centers around the country.
</P>
<P>
   This program offered many of the hints about test taking the
other programs offered. But the introduction was long, and some of
the bells and whistles were more irritating than helpful.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, when you choose a wrong answer, the sound effect
was of glass breaking. After getting many of the math questions
wrong (calculus was many years ago), I was very tired of the
shattering sound.
</P>
<P>
   The animations _ such as a cartoon contrasting the successful
and unsuccessful SAT test taker _ were more stylized than those of
the Princeton Review program. But some seemed a bit childish _
aimed more at elementary rather than high school students.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the technology didn't seem as advanced. A few
times, the program wouldn't let me type in an answer where
required, and the main ``guide'' through the program was jerky or
was cut off midsentence.
</P>
<P>
   That brings us to the third program I tried, Compton's Learning
Score Builder for the SAT, PSAT &AMP; ACT, also published by the
Learning Co. This program was decent but was lacking on the visual
side.
</P>
<P>
   Again, it stressed some of the tactics outlined above. In
addition, it let users fashion their own lesson plan and pace. But
the interface in this case proved very unengaging.
</P>
<P>
   The main guide through the program is a computer, with a British
accent, named Hallie. Though she sounded pleasant enough, staring
at my computer screen at another computer screen was not conducive
to learning. Also, some of the colors were so dark that I had a
difficult time making out some text.
</P>
<P>
   I liked the drills that popped up after each lesson. My favorite
part was the ``Word Rally'' vocabulary builder/video game. The user
drives a virtual car down a straight road. Word definitions pop up
on a small screen on the dashboard, and the user must honk the horn
at the correct word, which flies toward you on the road. If you
pick the right one, the word splats on your windshield.
</P>
<P>
   The concept was a little hokey and the graphics crude, but I had
fun and found myself learning some new words along the way.
</P>
<P>
   In sum, these SAT programs might help average test takers bump
up their scores without spending hundreds of dollars on an SAT prep
course. All three provided behind-the-scenes clues about how the
SATs are structured, how to save time and how to avoid common
fumbles.
</P>
<P>
   For my money, though, I thought the Princeton Review SAT
software was the best, in part because it seemed the most well
thought out and easy to use.

 INTERNET EASES THE TRAUMA OF FILLING OUT COLLEGE APPLICATIONS  &HT;     By CARRIE KIRBY 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Kids today have it so easy.
</P>
<P>
   If you're a college graduate of practically any age, you
probably had to choose between typing college application forms and
filling them out in pen. The first option was a disaster _ the
form's tiny blanks were impossible to aim at, and after 15 tries
your application would be so heavy with Wite-Out, it would require
extra postage. As for using pen, if your handwriting wasn't neat,
you were doomed.
</P>
<P>
   But for today's high school graduates, applying to college is as
simple as logging on to a Web site, accessing an online version of
a school's application, filling it out, adding a credit-card number
for the application fee and hitting Send.
</P>
<P>
   Fully 65 percent of schools accepted online applications in
1999, according to a survey by consulting firm Education Now and
online application service ApplyYourself. Some schools, such as the
University of California system, offer applications on their own
Web sites, while others let outside companies such as Embark.com or
CollegeLink create applications for them.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet makes it easier for students to figure out which
colleges to apply to as well. Many of the services that provide
online applications also help kids pick a school by asking them
questions and searching databases of college profiles for
institutions that match their interests, grades and budget. Some of
these Web sites help students interact with their prospective
schools by e-mailing in questions or suggesting themselves to
college recruiters.
</P>
<P>
   There's no doubt that the PC is an easier route to admission
than the traditional process of reading brochures, visiting the
school counselor, touring the campus and filling out paperwork. But
is it a better route?
</P>
<P>
   First of all, online search and application services stress that
they are not out to replace school counselors. In fact, San
Francisco's Embark.com has a version of its college search product
designed for counselors, called the Educational and Career
Opportunities System.
</P>
<P>
   But in California public schools, there are more than 1,000
students for each counselor, far exceeding the national standard of
250 to 1, a goal set by the American School Counselor Association.
In many schools, a college-bound senior may not have many
opportunities to meet with a counselor one-on-one. So it makes
sense for students to use the Internet to explore college choices
on their own, and come to counseling sessions prepared.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives you an idea, from the counselor's point of view, of
what the kid is interested in,'' said Mission High School principal
Marigrace Cohen, whose school has used Embark's system for two
years.
</P>
<P>
   While online pictures and text can't substitute for a real
college visit, the Internet is making it easier for students to
learn about schools outside their geographic area. Acknowledging
that, the National Association of College and Admissions Counseling
is augmenting its real-life college fairs with online events for
the first time this year.
</P>
<P>
   Physical NACAC college fairs take place in convention centers in
36 U.S. cities, where a representative from each school sets up a
booth and speaks with prospective students. Because of travel
costs, schools usually send only one or two employees to college
fairs. But in the online version _ the first of which takes place
October 19 at  &LR; www.onlinecollegefair.com &LR;  _ high school students
will be able to chat with a college's current students and
financial aid counselors.
</P>
<P>
   Admissions counselors say applying online does not help or hurt
students' chances of getting accepted. However, some say
applications submitted online are more likely to have missing
information or errors, and essays sent via the Internet are usually
shorter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Proofreading is key,'' said Paul Marthers, director of
admissions at Ohio's Oberlin College. ``Don't hit the Send command
until you are sure you have finished the application and filled it
out correctly.''
</P>
<P>
   And much like paper applications that get lost in the mail,
electronic forms sometimes get lost somewhere in the pipeline, some
counselors report.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tell our kids, if you're doing online applications, follow
up with a paper application,'' said Mission High principal Cohen.
However, not all colleges agree with that advice; some instruct
students not to send duplicate applications.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason for caution is that many of the companies that
create and run online applications are money-losing dot-coms
fighting for market share in a highly competitive business. If one
or more close their doors, who knows what would happen to the
college applications filed through them?
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, electronic college applications have become as
popular as paper ones with students. A poll conducted by education
market research firm Art &AMP; Science and sponsored by Embark showed
that 43 percent of students preferred applying online, while 44
percent preferred using paper.
</P>
<P>
   The survey also found that 35 percent of the graduates in the
class of 2000 submitted at least one online application. The
telephone survey found that almost all prospective college students
had access to the Internet either at home, at school or _ most
commonly _ both places.
</P>
<P>
   However, just having Internet access does not automatically make
it possible to apply online. Most services require a credit-card
number, something many of her students did not have access to,
Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   Online applications are bound to become more common, since many
colleges encourage the practice. In fact, at least two schools,
West Virginia Wesleyan College and the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology's Sloan School of Management, now accept only online
applications. Schools expect to save on data-entry costs and they
hope to process applications more quickly when the entire procedure
is computerized.

<P>
   So those coveted acceptance letters might arrive a little
sooner. Since going electronic, the University of California at
Berkeley is sending out letters two days earlier. But don't expect
today's teens to be impressed with gains like that: For a
generation raised on automated teller machines, one-hour photo
developing and online instant messaging, anything short of instant
acceptance won't be fast enough.

 &HT;    CONVENTION FILM TO HONOR CARTER
 &HT;    By MELANIE EVERSLEY
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The big news tonight at the Democratic National
Convention will be President Clinton's farewell speech.
</P>
<P>
   But another Democratic chief executive, former president Jimmy
Carter, will also have a moment in the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   A five minute-film will pay tribute to Carter.
</P>
<P>
   The former president said he has been told the tribute will
focus largely on his work during his presidency from 1976 to 1980.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reports say it's very good,'' Carter said, smiling during
an interview in his hotel room Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   The genesis of Monday night's film, Carter explained, came about
earlier this year when he, former President Gerald Ford and Henry
Kissinger visited the White House to pore over the details of
granting permanent normal trade relations status to China.
</P>
<P>
   Gore pulled Carter aside and asked him if he would consider
speaking at the Democratic convention, Carter recalled. Carter said
that he did not want to get involved in the typical convention
competition jostling for prime speaking time.
</P>
<P>
   After seeing the film tribute to Ford during the Republican
National Convention in Philadelphia two weeks ago, Gore thought a
film tribute would be another way to recognize Carter's work yet
still respect Carter's desire to stay away from the political
limelight.
</P>
<P>
   During the interview, Carter applauded Gore's selection of Sen.
Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., as his running mate. He said Gore has
been wise to separate himself from the moral shortcomings of the
Clinton White House, and he admires the fact that Lieberman was
among the first Democratic critics of Clinton's affair with White
House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, there are parallels for this ticket and what
Carter has experienced. When the former president took office, a
previously sheltered American public seemed enthralled and curious
about a president who was not only a Southern Baptist, but a devout
one as well.
</P>
<P>
   Carter remembered reporters asking him if he was a born-again
Christian and he replied yes, explaining his faith was ``like
breathing'' for him. ``The members of the press thought it was a
radical and mysterious and cult thing,'' Carter recalled with a
laugh.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, the public has devoted similar attention and
curiosity to Lieberman's devotion to his Judaism. Carter said he
feels this is a positive sign that the American public continues to
become more tolerant of diversity.
</P>
<P>
   Tolerance also is a key word of a different kind when it comes
to the Gore-Lieberman ticket in Carter's mind. It has been no
secret that Carter and the Clinton White House have shared a
strained relationship. Published reports have indicated that the
White House has not been happy when Carter has stepped in to help
alleviate tensions around the world, although Carter has said he
has always kept the White House informed of his doings.
</P>
<P>
   But Monday night's tribute, Carter said, also serves as a
welcome sign that he will enjoy a good relationship if Al Gore
makes it all the way to the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I'm looking forward to,'' Carter said with a warm
smile. ``In this administration, Al Gore is the one who has been my
friend. I'm not criticizing anyone else. Whenever I have had access
to the White House, it has been through al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   Some convention attendees considered the tribute a just dessert
for Carter, who has logged success after success in steering
political negotiations with world leaders, but whose presidency has
been subject to criticism.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., who is a delegate at the convention,
said Sunday that Democrats were happy to have a chance to recognize
Carter for his human rights work, which has included overseeing
potentially troubled elections around the world. Carter and his
wife, Rosalynn, are also active with Habitat for Humanity, a
national, non-profit organization that constructs housing for the
poor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's fitting and appropriate that this party pays
tribute to Jimmy Carter. He is a man who tried to do his best to
bring integrity to government,'' Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since he left the White House, he's been looking to help
people home and abroad,'' Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   The tribute also is a sign that someone still recognizes the
record and work of Southern Democrats, said Tom Eisenhauer,
communications director for Rep. Martin Frost, D-Texas, who also is
chair of the House Democratic Caucus. Pundits seem to forget people
such as Sen. Zell Miller, D-Ga., Sen. Max Cleland, D-Ga., Carter
and others, Eisenhauer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a reminder of the Democrats' strength in the South,'' he
said.

CONSERVATION IS QUESTION OF VALUES _ COLUMN HEATS UP DEBATE  &HT;    
</HEADLINE>
   By HENRY NORR  
 c.2000 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Little did I know, when I observed in last week's column that
there's a disagreement about computers' contribution to our power
problems, that I was wandering into a nasty little debate involving
not only technical and methodological issues, but also political
and even philosophical ones.
<P>
   The crux of the debate is the contention that computers and
peripherals today consume about 13 percent of the nation's
available power, including 8 percent specifically for Internet use.
I first noticed these numbers in an Associated Press report from an
``energy summit'' held in Redwood City, Calif., in June, but it
turns out they've been cited in just about every major publication
in the country over the last year.
</P>
<P>
   It also turns out that the ultimate source, direct or indirect,
for these estimates is a 1999 study called ``The Internet Begins
with Coal,'' written by Mark P. Mills and published by the Greening
Earth Society of Arlington, Va. The figures entered mainstream
discussion through an article by Mills and Peter W. Huber that
appeared in the May 31, 1999, issue of Forbes Magazine under the
title ``Dig more coal _ the PCs are coming.''
</P>
<P>
   What the self-styled ``capitalist tool'' didn't bother to tell
its readers is that Mills, who worked in the White House Science
Office during the Reagan years and now runs a Washington, D.C.,
consulting company, is tightly tied to the energy industry.
According to his biography on the Greening Earth society's Web site
( &LR; www.greeningearthsociety.org &LR; ), he has worked with more than 80
utilities.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did Forbes mention the Greening Earth Society, much less
explain what it &LR;   &LR; is. In fact, it's a nonprofit organization
created by the Western Fuels Association Inc., a cooperative that
mines and buys coal and supplies it to rural electric cooperatives
and municipal utilities ( &LR; www.westernfuels.org &LR; ).
</P>
<P>
   According to the greening group's executive director, Chris
Paynter, Western Fuels set it up in 1998 to defend carbon dioxide
against the EPA's efforts to regulate it as a pollutant and, more
broadly, to promote the virtues of fossil fuels, ``one of the
Creator's greatest gifts to humankind.'' (In addition to its main
Web site,  &LR; www.greeningearthsociety.org &LR; , the group also runs
 &LR; www.fossilfuels.org &LR; .)
</P>
<P>
   In the society's view, ``Nature is growing stronger, bigger,
greener and more resilient as a result of what we humans are doing
to promote our own growth'' _ including in particular our
increasing consumption of fossil fuels and the resulting increases
in atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide. The group doesn't
deny the greenhouse effect _ it argues that it's a good thing,
because, ``Our use of fossil fuels is helping give plants the extra
CO2 they need to grow more lush and green worldwide.''
</P>
<P>
   So how does all this relate to Mills' study of high technology
and power consumption?
</P>
<P>
   Judging not only by the Forbes article but also by other
writings of his posted online, it appears that he is trying to
polish up the somewhat tattered image of the industry he works for
(he admits it's ``widely thought to be in senescent decline'') by
linking it with the wonders of high technology. He even argues in
Forbes _ without providing any supporting evidence _ that it takes
a pound of coal to ``create, package, store and move 2 megabytes of
data.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, none of this proves his numbers are wrong, but
there's plenty of evidence that they are. His calculations start
from the contention that a ``typical PC and its peripherals require
about 1,000 watts of power.'' That figure caught my eye
immediately, because it's six or seven times higher than the
numbers I got last week from the EPA and Dell.
</P>
<P>
   That's only one of many places where Mills' assumptions about
electrical consumption differ dramatically from other sources.
Jonathan Koomey, staff scientist in the Energy Analysis Department
of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory _ a group that
conducts detailed measurements of specific devices' power
consumption, as well as macro-level analyses of electricity usage,
often on contract to the EPA _ pointed me to a critique his group
did of Mills' work and to its own recent study of ``Electricity
Used by Office Equipment and Network Equipment in the U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   I won't go into all the details here _ if you're interested, you
can find a dispassionate overview of the debate and links to all
the main papers at  &LR; enduse.lbl.gov/Projects/InfoTech.html &LR; . The
bottom line is that the Berkeley scientists conclude that office
equipment, including home computers and peripherals, plus network
equipment, accounted for about 74 terawatt hours (74 billion
kilowatt hours) in 1999. That's a mere 2 percent of total
electricity use in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Of those 74 terawatt hours, more than 70 percent go to power
office equipment in commercial settings (offices, basically), while
residential and industrial office machines each soak up about 12
percent, and network equipment takes 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Even when you factor in the power used in the manufacture of the
equipment _ including semiconductors _ you still come out to no
more than 3.2 percent of total U.S. consumption _ less than a
quarter of Mills' widely repeated estimate.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, even in the ``New Economy'' computers are pretty
small potatoes in the larger energy picture. In that light, is it
even worth worrying about power-saving settings or shutting down at
night?
</P>
<P>
   Many readers, I'm sure, will say no. In fact, most already have,
implicitly: Field audits the Berkeley group has conducted show that
only about 25 percent of desktop computers have power management
features in use and operating properly.
</P>
<P>
   But in the aggregate the stakes aren't trivial. Even with the
limited support power management now gets from office-equipment
users, it saves 23 terawatt hours a year, the Berkeley group
estimates _ roughly a quarter of what this equipment would
otherwise consume. With ``complete saturation of power management''
_ if such capabilities were built into all equipment, properly
configured and activated _ an additional 17 terawatt hours a year
could be saved.
</P>
<P>
   And shutting down all office equipment except mainframes,
minicomputers, servers and faxes would save an additional 7
terawatt hours per year. (Office-equipment power consumption in
1999 was 15 percent higher than the Berkeley group had projected
back in 1995. One reason, according to Koomey, is that monitors are
consuming more power in active use than expected, but the main
problem is that more PCs and laser printers than anticipated are
left on at might.)
</P>
<P>
   Whether such savings justify investing a few minutes to set up
power-management software and waiting for a sleeping system to wake
up is really a question of values. I've already said where I stand,
and I won't do any more preaching here.
</P>
<P>
   But I do want to address some more down-to-earth objections and
questions readers raised after last week's column.
</P>
<P>
   -- Backup. A couple of readers noted that their employers forbid
them to shut down their computers because their data is backed up
or network-management software pushes out software updates over the
network at night. In that case, no argument _ leave your PC on.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't extend to your monitor _ neither backups nor
updates require that the screen be on. And remember that displays,
on average, use twice as much power as a PC when left on. Setting
your display to sleep when idle saves most of that juice, but
hitting the off button does even more _ and it takes only a second.
</P>
<P>
   -- Confusion. This one comes from The Chronicle's own
information technology staff, which told me the main reason it
disables power management in the standard software setup here is
that users get confused when they find a black screen _ too many
assume their PC has crashed, or that someone has shut it down, and
they proceed to hit the power button, intending to start the system
back up but actually shutting it down. The result: unsaved work is
lost, and sometimes disk directories get corrupted _ a major
problem.
</P>
<P>
   Those are real concerns, but it seems to me that some concerted
user education could go a long way toward alleviating them. PC
manufacturers could also help by putting unmistakable indicators
for sleep mode on the front of their systems. Apple has set a good
example here: New Macs have LEDs that pulse slowly, like a
heartbeat, when the machine is sleeping.
</P>
<P>
   -- Power spikes. Several readers wrote in to ask about the
argument that it takes more power to restart a PC and monitor than
you save by turning them off. This one has been around for
generations, but as far as I can determine, there's nothing at all
to it. That's what both Lawrence Berkeley's Koomey and Brian
Zucker, technology evangelist at Dell, told me. Zucker said it
takes hardly any more power to start a PC up than to keep it
running.
</P>
<P>
   -- Wear and tear. The last argument against shutting down your
PC regularly is that starts and stops increase wear and tear on
your system and could thus shorten the life of key components.
There's clearly some truth to this: As Dell's Zucker put it,
``Turning on a system causes more harm than letting it run for
several hours due to the electric stress presented. Signals will
jump to voltage levels higher than normal before settling to their
normal levels when power is applied.''
</P>
<P>
   Others note a related issue: thermal expansion. When your system
starts up, internal temperatures rise, and components expand
accordingly; when it's shut down, it cools, and the same parts
contract. Repeated often enough, this process can cause failure.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, let's keep this in perspective: Modern PC
components are designed to survive thousands of starts and stops.
Odds are, the system on your desk will become obsolete, relative to
the software of the day, long before it suffers electrical or
mechanical failure.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, as I mentioned last week, I've found that leaving
Windows on too long invites a crash. If that's the case, you're
going to suffer the stop/start wear-and-tear anyway _ you might as
well get some power savings out of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Putting all these considerations together, here's my advice in
summary: Look for power-management software on your system, and
when you find it, set it to put your PC and monitor to sleep after
10 or 15 minutes of inactivity, so it won't kick in every time you
stop to chat with a colleague or get embroiled in a phone call, but
will reduce your power when you head for lunch or a meeting. If you
don't have power-management software or can't get it to work right,
just switch off your monitor when you leave your desk for long. At
the end of your work shift, shut both your PC and your monitor down
unless your employer tells you not to; in that case, just shut down
the monitor.
</P>
<P>
   It may not do a whole lot to reduce electrical consumption, but
it's the right thing to do, and it's pretty painless.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
THE LATEST FROM REDMOND: A good part of Microsoft's success stems
from its persistence in improving its products, including some that
were mediocre at best when first released. I was reminded of this
pattern last week when I installed the latest version of
Microsoft's reference and research package, Encarta Reference Suite
2001.
</P>
<P>
   When the first Encarta encyclopedia appeared in 1993, it was a
competent but undistinguished entry in a crowded field. But the new
package is, frankly, awesome. It includes new versions of not only
the encyclopedia, but also the gorgeous Encarta Interactive World
Atlas and the Encarta World English Dictionary, together with a new
thesaurus, an almanac, an expanded book of quotations, a computer
and Internet dictionary, and other goodies.
</P>
<P>
   I was especially pleased with some of the new components in this
year's version: the third edition of Encarta Africana, an excellent
resource on black history and culture, which until now hasn't had
the distribution it deserves because it was sold separately and at
a relatively high price; a new Web Center, which enables users to
search either a selected set of high-quality Web sites or the
entire Web without leaving the Encarta environment; and Researcher,
an application that makes it easy to assemble text and graphics
copied _ complete with source citations _ from Encarta, the Web or
anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   The whole package goes for $74.95 before a $10 rebate, and in my
book it's well worth the money, especially for families with kids
in school.
</P>
<P>
   One caveat, though: The suite fills seven CD-ROM discs, and
every time you switch among its components _ say, from Africana to
the atlas _ you have to swap out the CD, just like in the bad old
days of floppy disks. But if your PC has a DVD-ROM drive, you can
avoid that hassle by waiting until next month, when Microsoft plans
to release a DVD version at the same price. I haven't seen that
version yet, but Microsoft says that in addition to easier
integration, it will deliver more multimedia, including full-screen
versions of video clips that only fill a window in the CD version.

TEPID RESULTS HAVEN'T STOPPED PUSH FOR TECH IN SCHOOLS 
</HEADLINE>
   By HENRY NORR 
 &HT;     c.2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The specifics keep changing, but the promise hasn't: For two
decades, technology has been touted as a panacea for America's
troubled educational system.
</P>
<P>
   First, the idea was that learning keyboarding, word processing
and Logo programming would prepare kids for jobs in the information
economy.
</P>
<P>
   Then came ``kill and drill'' software titles that tried to
inspire enthusiasm about arithmetic and spelling exercises by
adding goofy characters and funny noises. In the 1990s, with the
popularization of CD-ROMs, electronic encyclopedias and multimedia
were added to the mix.
</P>
<P>
   Now, overshadowing everything that came before, is the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   So far, none of these applications of technology to education
has delivered fully on its promises. Though billions have been
spent on hardware and software for classrooms and students' homes,
there is scant evidence of a breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   But that hasn't stopped the industry from hyping _ or parents
and teachers from hoping. Today, almost two-thirds of American
families with at least one child between ages 2 and 17 have a
computer at home, and the figure for families is undoubtedly even
higher in the Bay Area, where one recent study found that 72
percent of all households have a computer. There are, of course,
many reasons families buy home computers, but parents continue to
cite their children's educations as the most common justification
for buying a home PC and the main use for it, according to a recent
report of the National School Boards Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Educators and policymakers have also bought the argument for
high tech, especially since the rise of the Internet. Once limited
to labs and libraries, computers are now deployed in
ever-increasing numbers in the classroom _ more than half of U.S.
classrooms now have at least one machine.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the most recent year for which the U.S. Department of
Education has complete data, the average U.S. public school had 75
computers, and 79 percent of public-school students in grades one
through eight were using them to some extent _ a percentage that,
surprisingly, exceeded that for secondary-school students and
college undergraduates. And all indications are that the
percentages have continued to increase during the past three years.
</P>
<P>
   These computers are no longer islands unto themselves, either. A
poll conducted last fall by the National Center for Education
Statistics found that virtually all public schools in the United
States are connected to the Internet, and the number of classroom
hookups has increased twentyfold since 1994. Another recent study
found that 66 percent of public-school teachers are using computers
or the Internet for instruction during class time.
</P>
<P>
   As in the past, a small but insistent chorus of critics contends
that these expenditures are misguided _ that school districts would
be better advised to spend their money on smaller classes, teacher
training and books, and that kids need parental time and attention
far more than technology at home.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, school districts that have filled their
classrooms with technology and trained their teachers how to use it
can point to compelling examples of creative teaching that clearly
would not have been possible in the pre-Internet era.
</P>
<P>
   But education researcher Peter Grunwald of San Mateo's Grunwald
Associates said the truth lies somewhere in between. Early
advocates of technology in the schools often engaged in what he
called ``technohedonism, making unsupported claims that raised
people's expectations.'' When the reality didn't live up to the
promise, he said, the inevitable result was disappointment and
skepticism.
</P>
<P>
   A big part of the problem, he said, is that administrators often
plunked hardware down in their schools without recognizing that
teachers wouldn't be able to take full advantage of it without ``a
fair amount of professional development _ teacher training and
curriculum development.''
</P>
<P>
   That remains a problem, but more school districts and other
funding sources recognize it, according to Grunwald, and they have
shifted their budgeting priorities to address it.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the explosive growth of the World Wide Web has
changed the nature of computing in schools, just like everywhere
else. The drill programs, the encyclopedias and all the rest
remain, but now they are increasingly integrated with the Web. And
thousands of sites have sprung up to offer education-related
information and services to children, parents and teachers _
everything from help with homework to locating scholarship
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   It's no secret that these online resources have created new
ethical dilemmas _ cheating has never been easier _ not to mention
new ways to waste time. But there's little doubt that they also
provide unprecedented possibilities for finding, evaluating,
utilizing and sharing information.
</P>
<P>
   Taking advantage of all these resources, of course, still
requires hardware. The precipitous price cuts of the late 1990s
have slowed, but the performance and storage capacity of PCs (and
Macs) have continued to increase. And the cost of PC notebooks has
at last come down enough so some families can afford to consider
this option, at least for older students.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the real educational benefits of computers, there's no
question that most kids enjoy using them. According to a report in
American Demographics magazine, a recent Kaiser Family Foundation
survey asked children ages 8 to 18 to choose which media they would
prefer to bring to a desert island.
</P>
<P>
   ``A computer with Internet access'' was the first choice of 33
percent of the kids surveyed, putting it at the top of the list.
``CDs, tapes or radio'' ranked second, with 24 percent, while
television and video games were tied for the next two positions
with 13 percent each.
</P>
<P>
   ``Books or magazines'' came in fifth at 8 percent.

SAT PREPARATION PROGRAMS OFFER GOOD TEST-TAKING TACTICS  

</HEADLINE>
   By KELLY ZITO  
 c.2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OK, so I went about the SATs all wrong.
</P>
<P>
   At least that's what I learned after experimenting with some of
the software titles designed to help raise scores on the dreaded
Scholastic Achievement Test _ one of the rights of passage for most
college-bound students.
</P>
<P>
   Way back in 1989 when I took the SATs, my math and English
teachers stressed memorizing endless geometry formulas and
vocabulary lists. In other words, they advocated doing every
problem and analogy the long _ or right _ way.
</P>
<P>
   While I did relatively well (don't bother skipping ahead, I
won't tell you my score), I'll bet I would have done much better if
I had used some of the techniques outlined in some of the leading
SAT preparation software titles.
</P>
<P>
   The three products I reviewed _ the Princeton Review Inside the
SAT, ACT and PSAT (2000 edition); Kaplan SAT &AMP; PSAT (2001 edition);
and Compton's Learning Score Builder for the SAT, PSAT &AMP; ACT _
varied in graphics quality and ease of use. But all three
emphasized working around the SAT questions. That is, when unsure
of the correct answer, eliminate possible wrong answers and avoid
thinking like the test writers. (I reviewed only Windows versions
and focused on the SAT portion because it was a common denominator
among all three programs.)
</P>
<P>
   In fact, all three programs took decidedly irreverent approaches
to the SAT.
</P>
<P>
   When I loaded the discs into my computer, I envisioned screen
after screen of questions right out of the SAT test booklets.
Rather, the programs seemed to undermine the SAT process
altogether. For example, the writers at Educational Testing
Services _ the New Jersey firm that makes the SAT _ were described
alternately as ``chumps'' and ``wacky.''
</P>
<P>
   The first product I tried, The Princeton Review SAT software,
published by the Learning Co., even went so far as calling the ETS
staffers ``evil.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the name calling, I liked this program a lot,
particularly the ``General Strategies'' section. It provided a
great overview of the test, told users how to spot ``trap answers''
and offered some important tips, such as the fact that both math
and verbal questions are divided into three sections in order:
easy, medium and difficult (the other programs mention these
concepts as well).
</P>
<P>
   The program's ``tutors'' were live-action Gen X types with
untucked flannel shirts and backward baseball caps, the kind of
guides who would keep teenagers interested without patronizing
them.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of SOFTWARE (28582 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  The main menu is an easy-to-navigate hallway, divided into
``General Strategies,'' ``Verbal,'' ``Math'' and a few others,
including the ``Counselor's Room,'' where users can peruse a
college applications road map or the average SAT scores for
hundreds of schools.
</P>
<P>
   Once inside the Verbal or Math ``rooms,'' users proceed through
various lessons. At any point, the user can click on an ``index''
button and skip questions or continue ahead within each section,
such as the ``Critical Reading'' portion.
</P>
<P>
   This lesson, which focuses a specific set of questions in the
Verbal section, emphasized that test takers shouldn't spend too
much time reading or memorizing the test's passages. It advised
users to get a general idea of what the passage is about, then move
as quickly as possible to the questions _ which include usually
only one about the passage's overall meaning.
</P>
<P>
   One of my only criticisms about this product is that Web access
_ which links to important sites on financial aid and virtual
campus tours _ was buried in the ``Counselor's Room.'' I think it
should have been one of the main doors off the hallway.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, this preparation course was well organized, the
interface was well designed and it was humorous without being
annoying.
</P>
<P>
   Not so with the next piece of software I tried, Kaplan SAT &AMP;
PSAT, published by Kaplan, the same company that runs training
centers around the country.
</P>
<P>
   This program offered many of the hints about test taking the
other programs offered. But the introduction was long, and some of
the bells and whistles were more irritating than helpful.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, when you choose a wrong answer, the sound effect
was of glass breaking. After getting many of the math questions
wrong (calculus was many years ago), I was very tired of the
shattering sound.
</P>
<P>
   The animations _ such as a cartoon contrasting the successful
and unsuccessful SAT test taker _ were more stylized than those of
the Princeton Review program. But some seemed a bit childish _
aimed more at elementary rather than high school students.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the technology didn't seem as advanced. A few
times, the program wouldn't let me type in an answer where
required, and the main ``guide'' through the program was jerky or
was cut off midsentence.
</P>
<P>
   That brings us to the third program I tried, Compton's Learning
Score Builder for the SAT, PSAT &AMP; ACT, also published by the
Learning Co. This program was decent but was lacking on the visual
side.
</P>
<P>
   Again, it stressed some of the tactics outlined above. In
addition, it let users fashion their own lesson plan and pace. But
the interface in this case proved very unengaging.
</P>
<P>
   The main guide through the program is a computer, with a British
accent, named Hallie. Though she sounded pleasant enough, staring
at my computer screen at another computer screen was not conducive
to learning. Also, some of the colors were so dark that I had a
difficult time making out some text.
</P>
<P>
   I liked the drills that popped up after each lesson. My favorite
part was the ``Word Rally'' vocabulary builder/video game. The user
drives a virtual car down a straight road. Word definitions pop up
on a small screen on the dashboard, and the user must honk the horn
at the correct word, which flies toward you on the road. If you
pick the right one, the word splats on your windshield.
</P>
<P>
   The concept was a little hokey and the graphics crude, but I had
fun and found myself learning some new words along the way.
</P>
<P>
   In sum, these SAT programs might help average test takers bump
up their scores without spending hundreds of dollars on an SAT prep
course. All three provided behind-the-scenes clues about how the
SATs are structured, how to save time and how to avoid common
fumbles.
</P>
<P>
   For my money, though, I thought the Princeton Review SAT
software was the best, in part because it seemed the most well
thought out and easy to use.

 TECH 21: conSERVATION IS QUESTION OF VALUES _ COLUMN HEATS By HENRY NORR  
 c.2000 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Little did I know, when I observed in last week's column that
there's a disagreement about computers' contribution to our power
problems, that I was wandering into a nasty little debate involving
not only technical and methodological issues, but also political
and even philosophical ones.
<P>
   The crux of the debate is the contention that computers and
peripherals today consume about 13 percent of the nation's
available power, including 8 percent specifically for Internet use.
I first noticed these numbers in an Associated Press report from an
``energy summit'' held in Redwood City, Calif., in June, but it
turns out they've been cited in just about every major publication
in the country over the last year.
</P>
<P>
   It also turns out that the ultimate source, direct or indirect,
for these estimates is a 1999 study called ``The Internet Begins
with Coal,'' written by Mark P. Mills and published by the Greening
Earth Society of Arlington, Va. The figures entered mainstream
discussion through an article by Mills and Peter W. Huber that
appeared in the May 31, 1999, issue of Forbes Magazine under the
title ``Dig more coal _ the PCs are coming.''
</P>
<P>
   What the self-styled ``capitalist tool'' didn't bother to tell
its readers is that Mills, who worked in the White House Science
Office during the Reagan years and now runs a Washington, D.C.,
consulting company, is tightly tied to the energy industry.
According to his biography on the Greening Earth society's Web site
( &LR; www.greeningearthsociety.org &LR; ), he has worked with more than 80
utilities.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did Forbes mention the Greening Earth Society, much less
explain what it &LR;   &LR; is. In fact, it's a nonprofit organization
created by the Western Fuels Association Inc., a cooperative that
mines and buys coal and supplies it to rural electric cooperatives
and municipal utilities ( &LR; www.westernfuels.org &LR; ).
</P>
<P>
   According to the greening group's executive director, Chris
Paynter, Western Fuels set it up in 1998 to defend carbon dioxide
against the EPA's efforts to regulate it as a pollutant and, more
broadly, to promote the virtues of fossil fuels, ``one of the
Creator's greatest gifts to humankind.'' (In addition to its main
Web site,  &LR; www.greeningearthsociety.org &LR; , the group also runs
 &LR; www.fossilfuels.org &LR; .)
</P>
<P>
   In the society's view, ``Nature is growing stronger, bigger,
greener and more resilient as a result of what we humans are doing
to promote our own growth'' _ including in particular our
increasing consumption of fossil fuels and the resulting increases
in atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide. The group doesn't
deny the greenhouse effect _ it argues that it's a good thing,
because, ``Our use of fossil fuels is helping give plants the extra
CO2 they need to grow more lush and green worldwide.''
</P>
<P>
   So how does all this relate to Mills' study of high technology
and power consumption?
</P>
<P>
   Judging not only by the Forbes article but also by other
writings of his posted online, it appears that he is trying to
polish up the somewhat tattered image of the industry he works for
(he admits it's ``widely thought to be in senescent decline'') by
linking it with the wonders of high technology. He even argues in
Forbes _ without providing any supporting evidence _ that it takes
a pound of coal to ``create, package, store and move 2 megabytes of
data.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, none of this proves his numbers are wrong, but
there's plenty of evidence that they are. His calculations start
from the contention that a ``typical PC and its peripherals require
about 1,000 watts of power.'' That figure caught my eye
immediately, because it's six or seven times higher than the
numbers I got last week from the EPA and Dell.
</P>
<P>
   That's only one of many places where Mills' assumptions about
electrical consumption differ dramatically from other sources.
Jonathan Koomey, staff scientist in the Energy Analysis Department
of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory _ a group that
conducts detailed measurements of specific devices' power
consumption, as well as macro-level analyses of electricity usage,
often on contract to the EPA _ pointed me to a critique his group
did of Mills' work and to its own recent study of ``Electricity
Used by Office Equipment and Network Equipment in the U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   I won't go into all the details here _ if you're interested, you
can find a dispassionate overview of the debate and links to all
the main papers at  &LR; enduse.lbl.gov/Projects/InfoTech.html &LR; . The
bottom line is that the Berkeley scientists conclude that office
equipment, including home computers and peripherals, plus network
equipment, accounted for about 74 terawatt hours (74 billion
kilowatt hours) in 1999. That's a mere 2 percent of total
electricity use in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Of those 74 terawatt hours, more than 70 percent go to power
office equipment in commercial settings (offices, basically), while
residential and industrial office machines each soak up about 12
percent, and network equipment takes 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Even when you factor in the power used in the manufacture of the
equipment _ including semiconductors _ you still come out to no
more than 3.2 percent of total U.S. consumption _ less than a
quarter of Mills' widely repeated estimate.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, even in the ``New Economy'' computers are pretty
small potatoes in the larger energy picture. In that light, is it
even worth worrying about power-saving settings or shutting down at
night?
</P>
<P>
   Many readers, I'm sure, will say no. In fact, most already have,
implicitly: Field audits the Berkeley group has conducted show that
only about 25 percent of desktop computers have power management
features in use and operating properly.
</P>
<P>
   But in the aggregate the stakes aren't trivial. Even with the
limited support power management now gets from office-equipment
users, it saves 23 terawatt hours a year, the Berkeley group
estimates _ roughly a quarter of what this equipment would
otherwise consume. With ``complete saturation of power management''
_ if such capabilities were built into all equipment, properly
configured and activated _ an additional 17 terawatt hours a year
could be saved.
</P>
<P>
   And shutting down all office equipment except mainframes,
minicomputers, servers and faxes would save an additional 7
terawatt hours per year. (Office-equipment power consumption in
1999 was 15 percent higher than the Berkeley group had projected
back in 1995. One reason, according to Koomey, is that monitors are
consuming more power in active use than expected, but the main
problem is that more PCs and laser printers than anticipated are
left on at might.)
</P>
<P>
   Whether such savings justify investing a few minutes to set up
power-management software and waiting for a sleeping system to wake
up is really a question of values. I've already said where I stand,
and I won't do any more preaching here.
</P>
<P>
   But I do want to address some more down-to-earth objections and
questions readers raised after last week's column.
</P>
<P>
   -- Backup. A couple of readers noted that their employers forbid
them to shut down their computers because their data is backed up
or network-management software pushes out software updates over the
network at night. In that case, no argument _ leave your PC on.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't extend to your monitor _ neither backups nor
updates require that the screen be on. And remember that displays,
on average, use twice as much power as a PC when left on. Setting
your display to sleep when idle saves most of that juice, but
hitting the off button does even more _ and it takes only a second.
</P>
<P>
   -- Confusion. This one comes from The Chronicle's own
information technology staff, which told me the main reason it
disables power management in the standard software setup here is
that users get confused when they find a black screen _ too many
assume their PC has crashed, or that someone has shut it down, and
they proceed to hit the power button, intending to start the system
back up but actually shutting it down. The result: unsaved work is
lost, and sometimes disk directories get corrupted _ a major
problem.
</P>
<P>
   Those are real concerns, but it seems to me that some concerted
user education could go a long way toward alleviating them. PC
manufacturers could also help by putting unmistakable indicators
for sleep mode on the front of their systems. Apple has set a good
example here: New Macs have LEDs that pulse slowly, like a
heartbeat, when the machine is sleeping.
</P>
<P>
   -- Power spikes. Several readers wrote in to ask about the
argument that it takes more power to restart a PC and monitor than
you save by turning them off. This one has been around for
generations, but as far as I can determine, there's nothing at all
to it. That's what both Lawrence Berkeley's Koomey and Brian
Zucker, technology evangelist at Dell, told me. Zucker said it
takes hardly any more power to start a PC up than to keep it
running.
</P>
<P>
   -- Wear and tear. The last argument against shutting down your
PC regularly is that starts and stops increase wear and tear on
your system and could thus shorten the life of key components.
There's clearly some truth to this: As Dell's Zucker put it,
``Turning on a system causes more harm than letting it run for
several hours due to the electric stress presented. Signals will
jump to voltage levels higher than normal before settling to their
normal levels when power is applied.''
</P>
<P>
   Others note a related issue: thermal expansion. When your system
starts up, internal temperatures rise, and components expand
accordingly; when it's shut down, it cools, and the same parts
contract. Repeated often enough, this process can cause failure.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, let's keep this in perspective: Modern PC
components are designed to survive thousands of starts and stops.
Odds are, the system on your desk will become obsolete, relative to
the software of the day, long before it suffers electrical or
mechanical failure.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, as I mentioned last week, I've found that leaving
Windows on too long invites a crash. If that's the case, you're
going to suffer the stop/start wear-and-tear anyway _ you might as
well get some power savings out of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Putting all these considerations together, here's my advice in
summary: Look for power-management software on your system, and
when you find it, set it to put your PC and monitor to sleep after
10 or 15 minutes of inactivity, so it won't kick in every time you
stop to chat with a colleague or get embroiled in a phone call, but
will reduce your power when you head for lunch or a meeting. If you
don't have power-management software or can't get it to work right,
just switch off your monitor when you leave your desk for long. At
the end of your work shift, shut both your PC and your monitor down
unless your employer tells you not to; in that case, just shut down
the monitor.
</P>
<P>
   It may not do a whole lot to reduce electrical consumption, but
it's the right thing to do, and it's pretty painless.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
THE LATEST FROM REDMOND: A good part of Microsoft's success stems
from its persistence in improving its products, including some that
were mediocre at best when first released. I was reminded of this
pattern last week when I installed the latest version of
Microsoft's reference and research package, Encarta Reference Suite
2001.
</P>
<P>
   When the first Encarta encyclopedia appeared in 1993, it was a
competent but undistinguished entry in a crowded field. But the new
package is, frankly, awesome. It includes new versions of not only
the encyclopedia, but also the gorgeous Encarta Interactive World
Atlas and the Encarta World English Dictionary, together with a new
thesaurus, an almanac, an expanded book of quotations, a computer
and Internet dictionary, and other goodies.
</P>
<P>
   I was especially pleased with some of the new components in this
year's version: the third edition of Encarta Africana, an excellent
resource on black history and culture, which until now hasn't had
the distribution it deserves because it was sold separately and at
a relatively high price; a new Web Center, which enables users to
search either a selected set of high-quality Web sites or the
entire Web without leaving the Encarta environment; and Researcher,
an application that makes it easy to assemble text and graphics
copied _ complete with source citations _ from Encarta, the Web or
anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   The whole package goes for $74.95 before a $10 rebate, and in my
book it's well worth the money, especially for families with kids
in school.
</P>
<P>
   One caveat, though: The suite fills seven CD-ROM discs, and
every time you switch among its components _ say, from Africana to
the atlas _ you have to swap out the CD, just like in the bad old
days of floppy disks. But if your PC has a DVD-ROM drive, you can
avoid that hassle by waiting until next month, when Microsoft plans
to release a DVD version at the same price. I haven't seen that
version yet, but Microsoft says that in addition to easier
integration, it will deliver more multimedia, including full-screen
versions of video clips that only fill a window in the CD version.

TEPID RESULTS HAVEN'T STOPPED PUSH FOR TECH IN SCHOOLS  

</HEADLINE>
   By HENRY NORR 
 &HT;     c.2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The specifics keep changing, but the promise hasn't: For two
decades, technology has been touted as a panacea for America's
troubled educational system.
</P>
<P>
   First, the idea was that learning keyboarding, word processing
and Logo programming would prepare kids for jobs in the information
economy.
</P>
<P>
   Then came ``kill and drill'' software titles that tried to
inspire enthusiasm about arithmetic and spelling exercises by
adding goofy characters and funny noises. In the 1990s, with the
popularization of CD-ROMs, electronic encyclopedias and multimedia
were added to the mix.
</P>
<P>
   Now, overshadowing everything that came before, is the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   So far, none of these applications of technology to education
has delivered fully on its promises. Though billions have been
spent on hardware and software for classrooms and students' homes,
there is scant evidence of a breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   But that hasn't stopped the industry from hyping _ or parents
and teachers from hoping. Today, almost two-thirds of American
families with at least one child between ages 2 and 17 have a
computer at home, and the figure for families is undoubtedly even
higher in the Bay Area, where one recent study found that 72
percent of all households have a computer. There are, of course,
many reasons families buy home computers, but parents continue to
cite their children's educations as the most common justification
for buying a home PC and the main use for it, according to a recent
report of the National School Boards Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Educators and policymakers have also bought the argument for
high tech, especially since the rise of the Internet. Once limited
to labs and libraries, computers are now deployed in
ever-increasing numbers in the classroom _ more than half of U.S.
classrooms now have at least one machine.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the most recent year for which the U.S. Department of
Education has complete data, the average U.S. public school had 75
computers, and 79 percent of public-school students in grades one
through eight were using them to some extent _ a percentage that,
surprisingly, exceeded that for secondary-school students and
college undergraduates. And all indications are that the
percentages have continued to increase during the past three years.
</P>
<P>
   These computers are no longer islands unto themselves, either. A
poll conducted last fall by the National Center for Education
Statistics found that virtually all public schools in the United
States are connected to the Internet, and the number of classroom
hookups has increased twentyfold since 1994. Another recent study
found that 66 percent of public-school teachers are using computers
or the Internet for instruction during class time.
</P>
<P>
   As in the past, a small but insistent chorus of critics contends
that these expenditures are misguided _ that school districts would
be better advised to spend their money on smaller classes, teacher
training and books, and that kids need parental time and attention
far more than technology at home.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, school districts that have filled their
classrooms with technology and trained their teachers how to use it
can point to compelling examples of creative teaching that clearly
would not have been possible in the pre-Internet era.
</P>
<P>
   But education researcher Peter Grunwald of San Mateo's Grunwald
Associates said the truth lies somewhere in between. Early
advocates of technology in the schools often engaged in what he
called ``technohedonism, making unsupported claims that raised
people's expectations.'' When the reality didn't live up to the
promise, he said, the inevitable result was disappointment and
skepticism.
</P>
<P>
   A big part of the problem, he said, is that administrators often
plunked hardware down in their schools without recognizing that
teachers wouldn't be able to take full advantage of it without ``a
fair amount of professional development _ teacher training and
curriculum development.''
</P>
<P>
   That remains a problem, but more school districts and other
funding sources recognize it, according to Grunwald, and they have
shifted their budgeting priorities to address it.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the explosive growth of the World Wide Web has
changed the nature of computing in schools, just like everywhere
else. The drill programs, the encyclopedias and all the rest
remain, but now they are increasingly integrated with the Web. And
thousands of sites have sprung up to offer education-related
information and services to children, parents and teachers _
everything from help with homework to locating scholarship
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   It's no secret that these online resources have created new
ethical dilemmas _ cheating has never been easier _ not to mention
new ways to waste time. But there's little doubt that they also
provide unprecedented possibilities for finding, evaluating,
utilizing and sharing information.
</P>
<P>
   Taking advantage of all these resources, of course, still
requires hardware. The precipitous price cuts of the late 1990s
have slowed, but the performance and storage capacity of PCs (and
Macs) have continued to increase. And the cost of PC notebooks has
at last come down enough so some families can afford to consider
this option, at least for older students.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the real educational benefits of computers, there's no
question that most kids enjoy using them. According to a report in
American Demographics magazine, a recent Kaiser Family Foundation
survey asked children ages 8 to 18 to choose which media they would
prefer to bring to a desert island.
</P>
<P>
   ``A computer with Internet access'' was the first choice of 33
percent of the kids surveyed, putting it at the top of the list.
``CDs, tapes or radio'' ranked second, with 24 percent, while
television and video games were tied for the next two positions
with 13 percent each.
</P>
<P>
   ``Books or magazines'' came in fifth at 8 percent.

 NOWADAYS, STUDENTS GO TO THE LIBRARY BY GOING ONLINE  &HT;     By VERNE KOPYTOFF 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Curtis Santee, a 10th-grader from San Francisco,
prefers to do schoolwork from the comfort of home rather than going
to the library. So when doing a report about Algeria recently, he
logged on to his family's computer and, faster than a lesson on the
Dewey Decimal System, found information about the North African
country's gross domestic product and cultures in an online
encyclopedia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get on the Internet every single day when I have big
projects and research papers to do,'' said Santee, who attends
Gateway High School. ``You don't have to go anywhere, you just have
to sit in your seat.''
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to homework in the online era.
</P>
<P>
   Students no longer need to visit libraries to search long rows
of bookshelves. Anyone with an Internet connection has access to
one of the world's largest collections of knowledge, eliminating
the excuse used by generations of students that the books they were
looking for were already checked out.
</P>
<P>
   The Web offers students help at every grade level and in nearly
every subject. Children can find online tutoring from topics as
diverse as basic math and geography, English and physics.
</P>
<P>
   Many teachers, in fact, encourage students to do research on the
Internet and even show them how to use Web search engines. At some
schools, students do as much as 90 percent of their research
online, teachers said.
</P>
<P>
   Marnie Studva, a fifth-grade teacher at Jack London Elementary
School in Antioch, Calif., praised the Internet for providing
students with timely information that is too recent to be mentioned
in some of her school's textbooks. That is particularly important
in geography, she said, because new countries are created all the
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the maps in our books show the Soviet Union,'' Studva
complained.
</P>
<P>
   Students are generally happy to do research on the Internet
instead of from books and magazines, she said. As a consequence,
she no longer needs to photocopy as many magazine articles to hand
out in class as when she began her career eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something more exciting for children about going on a
computer and looking information up, even though it's the same as
what they could find in a book,'' Studva said.
</P>
<P>
   Older students at the Emerson School, a private institution for
grades one through eight in Palo Alto, do virtually all of their
research online. But with so much dubious information on the
Internet, teachers there tell students which Web sites are more
reliable.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the challenges is to give kids a sense of what is good
information and what sites are credible,'' said Michael Strong, the
school's director. ``We teach them about the brand names _ the
university sites are better than the sites run by the ideological
groups.''
</P>
<P>
   Many educators applaud the Internet because it allows students
to interact more while learning than with a traditional workbook.
Some Web sites offer games in which students must give correct
answers to move to higher levels.
</P>
<P>
   But like many educators, Nurje Williams, executive director of
Back on Track, a nonprofit student tutoring program in San
Francisco, had a few words of caution. She said that the Web makes
it easier for students to plagiarize and look busy when they are
really goofing off.
</P>
<P>
   ``They certainly need to be monitored,'' Williams said. ``I
don't think you can depend all the time on these blocking systems
so kids can't wander off to other sites.''

LIEBERMAN PRAISES, AND PARTS WAYS WITH, GORE ON EVE OF CONVENTION
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for new 18th and 19th grafs starting The president and Mrs.
Clinton, etc., to update with new quotes from the president) By JAMES DAO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As Democrats prepared to kick off their national
convention here on Monday, Sen. Joseph Lieberman, the party's
choice for vice president, sought to minimize his differences with
Vice President Al Gore on some of the leading issues of the
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But in the process he revealed a new and potentially contentious
one, saying proposals to raise the retirement age for Social
Security and Medicare should be ``kept on the table'' for further
discussion.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking on five different news shows, Lieberman acknowledged
that he had held different positions from Gore on a variety of
issues, from affirmative action to school vouchers to legal reform.
But he scoffed at assertions that his views were closer to the
Republicans than to Gore's, and he praised the vice president for
having had the confidence to select a running mate who differs with
him on important subjects.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is again a mark of Al Gore's strength of leadership that he
didn't look for somebody who had 100 percent agreement with him,''
Lieberman said ``Meet the Press.'' ``We've argued, we've debated,
and I think that's what progress comes from, particularly the
willingness to look at new ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, in explaining how he has come to agree with Gore on a
core issue of the campaign _ whether to allow taxpayers to invest
some of their Social Security payroll taxes in the markets _
Lieberman exposed another rift in their views. While Gore has
insisted that he would not consider raising the retirement age for
Social Security or Medicare, Lieberman said Sunday that any debate
on keeping the system solvent should include that idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should keep it on the table for the good reason that people
are living longer,'' Lieberman said, also on NBC's ``Meet the
Press.'' Later, on CNN's ``Late Edition,'' Lieberman said, ``There
is very little you take off the table if you want to be an honest
public official.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sunday interviews capped a remarkable week for Lieberman,
whose selection by Gore infused many Democrats with a new sense of
optimism about the race. But the ability of television interviewers
to throw Lieberman repeatedly onto the defensive Sunday, over his
differences with Gore and his past criticisms of President Clinton,
suggested a line of attack that the Republicans are likely to
pursue.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has denounced the idea of raising the retirement age for
Social Security, and the party's platform is unequivocal on the
issue. Moreover, the Gore campaign has repeatedly hammered the
Republican candidate, Gov. George W. Bush, for even considering the
notion.
</P>
<P>
   But Sunday, Gore's aides sought to play down the differences,
saying that Lieberman supports Gore's broad plan to keep Social
Security solvent through 2055 by using general tax revenues instead
of raising the retirement age, cutting benefits or increasing
taxes. The current retirement age is already scheduled to rise to
67 over the next several decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Lieberman was suggesting that at some future point,
perhaps after 2055, that it might need to be considered,'' said
Doug Hattaway, a spokesman for Gore. ``But not now.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for Bush, sought to exploit the
apparent conflict, saying, ``Al Gore should resolve his internal
differences with Sen. Lieberman so the American people know where
they stand on this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid the back-and-forth over Lieberman's views, Gore spent the
day campaigning in Ohio and Missouri, making his way west for a
Wednesday arrival in Los Angeles and a Thursday evening coronation
as the party's standard bearer.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats are looking to their convention to cast Gore in a
warmer, more appealing light, hoping to close what has been a
double-digit lead for Bush in many polls. Many delegates spent the
day fanning out across this sprawling city performing good deeds,
from picking up litter on beaches to preparing meals for the poor
to planting trees.
</P>
<P>
   Though the four-day extravaganza has been carefully
choreographed to help Gore step out of President Clinton's shadow,
the president and Hillary Rodham Clinton have already been in town
for two days, raising money, visiting supporters, soaking up media
attention _ and causing some grumbling within the Gore camp.
</P>
<P>
   (Gore himself did little to build a sense of separation from the
president Sunday when he told the Associate Press that he would
continue to seek Clinton's counsel after he left the White House.)
</P>
<P>
   Asked on Fox News whether he was worried that Clinton, who is
scheduled to address the convention in prime time on Monday night,
might dominate the convention spotlight this week, William Daley,
Gore's campaign chairman, said no.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's totally appropriate for him to be here to thank
the Democrats, because the Democratic Party stood with him during
good times and difficult times over the last eight years,'' Daley
said. ``But after tomorrow night's speech _ which is an important
speech for the president, for the campaign, and for Democrats _
this is Al Gore's convention.''
</P>
<P>
   The president and Mrs. Clinton appeared on Sunday night at a
reception organized by four Jewish groups on a set at Sony Studios
in Culver City. Mr. and Mrs. Clinton spoke warmly of Gore and
Lieberman, but the president also used the opportunity to recount a
so-far-unsuccessful effort at Camp David to forge a peace agreement
between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton offered a defense on a subject that Gore had been
ridiculed for: his suggestion that he deserved credit for inventing
the Internet. ``Mr. Gore did sponsor the legislation'' that led to
creating the Internet, Clinton said. ``Part of my job, since I'm
not running is to correct the record here.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats are also counting on the convention to demonstrate
that they are every bit as unified as the Republicans. But already,
some liberals have begun warning that Gore and Lieberman's centrist
positions on important issues may have dampened enthusiasm for the
ticket among vital parts of the party's base, including union
members and black voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only option is Al Gore,'' Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr., an
Illinois Democrat, said at a forum at the University of Southern
California on Saturday. ``But if there was another campaign that
was speaking to our issues that had the possibility and
plausibility of winning, we should support that campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   In his television appearances Sunday, Lieberman repeatedly tried
to put to rest concerns that he differed significantly from Gore on
major issues. He said, for instance, that although he had voted for
a pilot program for school vouchers, he would also increase federal
spending on public schools. And he said that while he had raised
concerns about affirmative action, he did not support efforts to
ban it.
</P>
<P>
   He added that Gore had encouraged him to argue his views
vigorously _ in private. But in public, Lieberman said, a Gore
administration would be firmly united. ``When he makes a decision,
I know what the administration policy will be, his,'' Lieberman
said on Fox News.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, who was the first Democrat to chastise President
Clinton from the Senate floor about his affair with a White House
intern, praised Clinton Sunday for seeking repentance at an
Illinois church last week for his adultery. But when asked whether
he would place Clinton among the pantheon of great presidents, as
Gore has, Lieberman demurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, I'm going to leave the exact words for history,''
Lieberman said on ``Meet the Press.'' ``But I think he has done
some great things as president, which makes the personal mistakes
that he made even sadder.''

EVEN WHEN IMAGE FAILS TO MATCH REALITY, IT RETAINS SUPREMACY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; LOS ANGELES _ It's really no wonder Los Angeles is home to
that dream factory called Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   After all, this is where Spanish missionaries say they saw
angels, and where schemers and dreamers imagined a lush playground
in a semidesert plagued by earthquakes, droughts, wildfires,
mudslides and floods.
</P>
<P>
   L.A. is all about imagination _ and image _ a concept not lost
on Democratic leaders who pushed Rep. Loretta Sanchez to move her
Latino fund-raiser from the Playboy Mansion because it would've
sent the wrong message.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think an event at the Playboy Mansion is not the right
image and does not represent the values of our party. It doesn't
represent the values of working Americans that Al Gore and Joe
Lieberman are fighting for,'' said Joe Andrew, national chairman of
the Democratic National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Spoken like an Angeleno, the right image _ not reality _ is
everything.
</P>
<P>
   As the late, great L.A. crime novelist Raymond Chandler once
said, ``Hollywood is wonderful. Anyone who doesn't like it is
either crazy or sober.''
</P>
<P>
   Few cities captivate the imagination as does L.A. This is, after
all, where the American dream is manufactured _ and sold.
</P>
<P>
   But if you don't buy into the myth, you'll find an irritating,
scary, dirty and sometimes kind of dim metropolis _ without a
logical center.
</P>
<P>
   ``The image the country has of L.A. is nonsense,'' says longtime
talk-radio host Joe Crummey, who lives in the Studio City
neighborhood on the northern slope of the Hollywood Hills and will
debut a syndicated show in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``You live here, and it's a lot more normal than people realize.
You begin to see that the entertainment industry moves in
completely different circles than most people do,'' he said. ``I
look out at the (San Fernando) Valley, and it's really like any
other suburb _ maybe a little slicker _ but it's a suburban bedroom
community. Life here is not `Baywatch.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, despite the vastness of ostentatious wealth, most people
live lives little different than they would in Keokuk or Peoria _
though L.A.'s climate that allows year-round backyard barbecues and
its culture tolerant of almost anything are far different.
</P>
<P>
   Really, aside from the fact the San Andreas Fault comes within
35 miles of downtown, most L.A. residents lead regular humdrum
lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I moved here 11 years ago from New York thinking everyone
lives at the beach _ and it turns out the people who live here
never go to the beach,'' Crummey said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they're lucky, they swim in their own pool in their back
yard on the weekends. This image of movie stars and the beach and
Beverly Hills exists, but in the context of everyone else out here,
the reality is, most people just don't live like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Ordinary folks breathe the same air as the stars and can refer
to the hip chefs of the day as if they were neighbors and on the
``A'' list. And often they hold out hope that lightning will strike
and they will find their star, like Lana Turner being discovered at
Schwab's drugstore, the ultimate L.A. myth of overnight stardom.
</P>
<P>
   L.A. is the second act in so many lives playing themselves out
under the big orange sun. The possibilities of self-discovery and
reinvention are endless.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask sex symbol and actress Pamela Anderson, who once
detailed her time-tested recipe for fame: ``Move to Los Angeles, do
a couple of Playboy covers, audition, get a part in a TV series,
marry a rock star.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, it's easy to forget you are visiting the home of Hollywood.
As you look out the window of your car, the guy or gal next to you
could just as easily be an engineer at Litton Industries or
Northrup Grumman or an executive at Occidental Petroleum as a movie
actor or screenwriter _ or just one of a million wannabes with the
right image.
</P>
<P>
   Madonna's take on L.A.: ``There are so many famous people
everyone cancels everyone else out.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the City of Angels is a place of contrasts between
image and reality.
</P>
<P>
   L.A. is the home of the greedy me-me-me generation, yet its
remarkably diverse populace casually unifies in response to the
frequent and inevitable natural disasters that befall the place.
</P>
<P>
   ``L.A. historically is a place where people sense they can come
and start a new life, do something different, be something
different and achieve the American dream,'' said Jennifer Wolch,
professor of geography at the University of Southern California and
co-director of the USC Sustainable Cities program.
</P>
<P>
   ``The region comes with great opportunity and great challenges
in the form of natural hazards, pollution, related health risks and
a whole variety of other problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``In addition, depending on your social position and position in
the labor market, you may or may not be able to gain the upward
mobility you might have expected when you arrived. The economy has
become more polarized so the gap between rich and poor has
widened.''
</P>
<P>
   (Second take to come)
</P>
<P>
   Because of its grossly inadequate public transit system, L.A. is
a bear of a city to get around. The tangle of freeways and
sprawling suburbs goes on for endless miles, and anyone without a
car is considered socially impaired.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife and I could live anywhere in the world and we elect to
live in L.A.,'' said Robert Barrett, vice president of domestic
marketing at the L.A. Convention &AMP; Visitors Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something magical here and often it's intangible _
like the spirit of adventure about the future. I mean, look at the
fact that the No. 1 product of L.A. is imagination, that people
come from all over the world and mix their ethnic heritage with
technology and cutting-edge concepts to make the culture and
commerce of the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like everyone comes to reinvent themselves. In L.A., it's
fine to fail; tomorrow you might be on top. It's wonderfully
refreshing here and it's all done in a T-shirt in the sunshine.
</P>
<P>
   ``In New York, they hustle. In L.A., we glide.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether it's the home of the electric glide or the disco hustle,
the Big Orange (L.A.) is regularly lambasted in the East for having
less art than other places. Still, the Getty Center in the Santa
Monica Mountains is respected worldwide for its European and
photography collections.
</P>
<P>
   And L.A. frequently gets a bad rap for ignoring and even
gleefully paving over its past to make way for the future. Yet, if
you drive east through the smog near the San Gabriel Mountains to
the oak-lined avenues of Pasadena, you'll find turn-of-the-century
homes of every persuasion, from mission-style stucco to
column-laden mansions _ even stately Wayne Manor from the
``Batman'' TV series.
</P>
<P>
   The historic 14-block district known as Old Town Pasadena
underwent a major face lift about 10 years ago but still feels
historic.
</P>
<P>
   But it's the movie industry that everyone thinks of when L.A. is
discussed. Surprisingly, though, it didn't start here.
</P>
<P>
   ``The film industry moved West for several reasons _ one being
there's sunlight 99 percent of the year with hardly any
interruptions of bad weather,'' said film and Hollywood historian
Marc Wanamaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a major consideration. In the earliest days, when
movies were shot back East and much of the film output was Westerns
and adventure films, bad weather always posed problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Few understand the connect between reality and image, even
fantasy, as well as Playboy magazine founder Hugh Hefner, a
lifelong Democrat who found himself in the middle of the morality
flap over Sanchez's party plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I'm disappointed by certain individuals in the party,''
said Hefner. ``These are the same people asking me for money.
Unfortunately, hypocrisy and politics is the name of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   In characteristic L.A. fashion, however, Hefner realizes the
value of publicity, good or bad.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the intraparty rift might somehow hurt the
magazine, he smiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to make us a great many friends.''

COMMUNITY RALLIES AGAINST HATE ON ANNIVERSARY OF SHOOTING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ORITH GOLDBERG 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ On the eve of the Democratic National Convention,
hundreds of people gathered Sunday at Los Angeles Pierce College to
demonstrate that intolerance and hate victimize the entire
community.
</P>
<P>
   A little more than a year after mail carrier Joseph Santos Ileto
was slain in suburban Chatsworth and five people were shot at the
North Valley Jewish Community Center, about 400 people rallied at
the community college for the Unity Over Hate rally.
</P>
<P>
   ``A man came to our community for the purpose of pulling it
apart, and he did some real damage to the victims and their
families,'' said Congressman Brad Sherman, D-Woodland Hills.
</P>
<P>
   ``But a year later, we're here, we're still here, even more
determined to keep this society together and to celebrate our unity
over hatred.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, the families victimized by last year's
shootings have been picking up the pieces and joining the fight
against intolerance, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Ileto's brother Ismael, 37, of Chino Hills, Calif., said he was
sad about what happened but also grateful for events such as the
rally which promote awareness and encourage others to report hate
crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many underreported hate crimes, and we need to
educate people that it's not an attack on an individual, but the
whole community,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For Joseph Ileto's sister Raquel, 30, of Monterey Park, Calif.,
the tears still come swiftly at the mention of her brother's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just hard for me to talk about it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Buford O'Neal Furrow Jr. was arrested after Ileto's death and
charged with all the shootings. He could face the death penalty if
convicted; his trial is scheduled to start in February.
</P>
<P>
   According to officials, Furrow admitted targeting the Jewish
community center and also targeted Ileto because the letter carrier
was a federal employee who was not white.
</P>
<P>
   Those injured at the community center included receptionist
Isabelle Shamoleth; then 16-year-old Mindy Finkelstein, a
counselor; James Zidell and Joshua Stepakoff, then 6; and then
5-year-old Benjamin Kadish.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles County District Attorney Gil Garcetti pointed out at
the rally that there has been a 25 percent increase in reported
hate crimes in the San Fernando Valley since last year.
</P>
<P>
   County Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky said there must be zero
tolerance for hate crimes in the community.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't take for granted that people who are vulnerable or
different are going to be safe from being persecuted, picked on or
discriminated against,'' Yaroslavsky said.
</P>
<P>
   As LAPD Police Chief Bernard C. Parks stood at the Pierce
College rally, a number of people approached and thanked him for
the compassion he showed the victims of the Aug. 10, 1999,
shootings.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Kadish, the father of now 6-year-old Benjamin Kadish, who
was shot at the JCC and still favors his left leg, hugged Parks and
told him he was an inspiration while he was in the hospital's
waiting room, worried about his son.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chief Parks came in and said a couple of words to help us,''
Kadish said.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Rouss, the former director of the JCC, also complimented
Parks for his kind words to the victims of the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came by and visited with children in the camp and visited
the wounded children. ... There's a character to the man that
transcends any politics,'' Rouss said.
</P>
<P>
   The elected officials at the rally made a point to mention the
legislation that has been proposed as a result of the shootings.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation includes Assembly Bill 2000, proposing the
formation of a Human Relations Commission statewide to promote
unity and find solutions to hate-related incidents throughout the
state.
</P>
<P>
   Another is AB 1785, proposing to create system for reporting
hate crimes in school.
</P>
<P>
   Both bills emerged as a result of a meeting called by Antonio
Villaraigosa, speaker emeritus of the Assembly, with a group of
civil rights leaders, clergy and human relations experts following
the shootings.
</P>
<P>
   Villaraigosa said both bills are currently in the state Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Sherman also took an opportunity to urge support for a federal
hate crimes prevention act to make sure that hate crimes are
federal crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing the community, state Attorney General Bill Lockyer
praised Garcetti for more than a 100 percent increase in the
prosecution of hate crimes in one year.
</P>
<P>
   ``In California, there are six hate crimes reported to the
police every day,'' he said. ``Two-thirds are violent and
two-thirds are directed at people like Joseph because of their
race.''
</P>
<P>
   Other families affected by hate crimes also spoke about their
devastation and thanked the community for coming out and honoring
the victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been an incredible year, but we're OK again,'' said Dave
Finkelstein, the father of Mindy Finkelstein, now 17, who was a
camp counselor when she was shot twice in her right leg.
</P>
<P>
   She said people thought the shooting would either drive her to
become more or less of a Jew. But, in fact, the shooting didn't
affect her in that sense, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still the same I was before,'' she said, adding that it's
important for people to know that it's not just an individual act,
it's an act that affects the community. ``It needs to stop.''

   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ With each game, the Los Angeles Sparks look
more like a team that could win the WNBA championship.
</P>
<P>
   They were at their best again Sunday afternoon at the Forum.
They shot 56 percent from the field and eliminated the Phoenix
Mercury from the first round of the playoffs with a 101-76 victory
in front of an excited crowd of 9,811, the second-largest of the
season.

Cooper claims she is, scoring a game-high 29 points on 12-of-17
shooting with eight rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am honored to coach this young lady, because she, in my
eyes, is the MVP of the league this year simply for the fact that
she's made the rest of the team so much better,'' Cooper said.
</P>
<P>
   Mwadi Mabika made four of the team's nine 3-pointers, Tamecka
Dixon scored 14 points and had seven assists, DeLisha Milton had 11
points, and reserve Clarisse Machanguana had 10 points.
</P>
<P>
   Next is the Western Conference finals, which begin Thursday on
the road, against either three-time defending champion Houston or
Sacramento. Houston leads the series 1-0 and hosts the Monarchs
tonight at 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came out and established everything that we wanted to do,''
Cooper said. ``You have to tip your hat to the Mercury. They gave
us everything they had and you have to respect them for that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks scored three consecutive 3-pointers _ one each by
Dixon, Mabika and Ukari Figgs _ to go ahead 17-12 and never looked
back.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just wanted to come out aggressive,'' Mabika said. ``We
knew that they wanted to be the aggressor, but we kept our poise.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks pushed the lead to 30-16 on a Mabika outside shot
with 10:14 to play in the first half. Phoenix cut the deficit to
42-36 at the break, but midway through the second half, the Sparks
mounted another attack to put the game out of reach.
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks were just 1 of 5 from the free-throw line in the
first half but made 23 of 28 in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have so many weapons, you have to pick your poison,''
Phoenix coach Cheryl Miller said. ``I thought we played well. The
first seven minutes, we were right with them. We just ran out of
gas.''
</P>
<P>
   Mercury's 36-year-old Jennifer Gillom, who promised she is
coming back next season, and Lisa Harrison scored 16 points apiece.
The Sparks limited Brandy Reed to 11 points, eight under her
average.
</P>
<P>
   Leslie injured her right knee in the first half but returned
with five minutes to play in the half.
</P>
<P>
   __ No miracle for Miracle: Merlakia Jones and rookie Helen
Darling scored 15 points each as the host Cleveland Rockers beat
the Orlando Miracle 63-54 to tie their best-of-three Eastern
Conference playoff series.

BRUINS SEEK SPOT FOR HARRIS

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Bob Toledo refers to Akil Harris as his secret
weapon. The problem is he might continue to be a secret this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Harris, a redshirt freshman tailback, got a long look this
spring when an injury slowed starter DeShaun Foster. But even
though Harris impressed the coaches, getting him the ball won't be
so easy when he stands behind Foster and dependable senior Jermaine
Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, Harris, who ran for 4,697 yards his last two
seasons at Monrovia High, probably will return kicks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to find a way to get him on the field,'' running
backs coach Kelly Skipper said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Injury report: Starting guard Oscar Cabrera is listed as day
to day after suffering a high right-ankle sprain when he tripped
during a running drill Saturday afternoon. Toledo doesn't expect
the injury to keep Cabrera out of the season-opener Sept. 2 against
Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   Two other linemen who are coming off knee surgery, center Troy
Danoff and guard Brian Polak, are being limited to one practice per
day.
</P>
<P>
   __ Boys will be boys: Testosterone, the midday sun and two-a-day
practices proved combustible Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Near the end the morning practice, a pair of redshirt freshmen _
guard Shane Lehman and defensive tackle Rodney Leisle (cq) _ got
into a wrestling match. Senior defensive end Kenyon Coleman then
asserted himself as the alpha male by jumping in, throwing Lehman
to the ground and ripping his helmet off.
</P>
<P>
   __ Most expensive scholarship: It didn't take long for the
coaches to notice the leg strength of freshman punter Chris Kluwe.
In the first two days of drills for freshmen last week, Kluwe
punted two balls over the a 60-foot screen at the end of the
practice field and onto the roof at Pauley Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach Toledo said he was going to start charging me for
those,'' said Kluwe, who could supplant sophomore Nate Fikse.
</P>
<P>
   __ Recruits: Spencer Havner, a linebacker from Nevada City Grass
Valley High, has watched practice the past two days.

EXPERIENCE OPENS WOMAN'S EYES TO PLIGHT OF MEXICAN STREET

 EYES-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STACY DOWNS  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, MO. _ Martha Roberts thought life would change
dramatically for 15-year-old Manuel Burboa.
</P>
<P>
   After spending most of his life on the streets of Juarez,
Mexico, ostracized by his family and mocked by his peers, Manuel
was brought to the United States, where an Overland Park, Kan.,
doctor corrected his crossed eyes.
</P>
<P>
   When Manuel returned home, his life would be much better,
thought Roberts, who had spent many days with Manuel in Overland
Park as his interpreter.
</P>
<P>
   But when Roberts visited Manuel this summer, she found no
fairy-tale ending.
</P>
<P>
   ``He isn't teased anymore, but everything else is still the
same,'' Roberts said.
</P>
<P>
   What she found was Manuel sleeping in the back of an old yellow
pickup truck or on the dirt floor of the home of a family for whom
he worked.
</P>
<P>
   She saw him standing near a bridge and singing to earn a little
money.
</P>
<P>
   Saddest of all, perhaps, she found that Manuel had sold the
eyeglasses he had received after his surgery so that he could buy
food.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the most heartbreaking experience of my life,'' Roberts
said. ``I cried every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of giving up, however, she determined to do something
for Manuel and other street children in Juarez.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts and others recently formed Compassion Foundation of
Kansas City, with the goal of raising money to provide shelter and
a tutor for Manuel, who cannot read or write. He has no education
beyond kindergarten. A teacher once said she could not educate
someone with his vision problems.
</P>
<P>
   Any additional money would go to adopt a school in Juarez, where
public education stops after the sixth grade and most people can't
afford to send their children to private schools, Roberts said.
Public schools usually don't have libraries, cafeterias or sports,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts first met Manuel in May, when he was in Overland Park
for his surgery.
</P>
<P>
   A group of St. Thomas Aquinas High School students had
befriended Manuel last year during a spring-break mission in
Juarez, where they painted a school and a library.
</P>
<P>
   The students told a teacher of Manuel's laughter and generosity.
One student spoke about how Manuel recycled soda bottles to pay for
food but used some of that money to buy the student a small gift.
</P>
<P>
   Inspired, the teacher helped bring Manuel to Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   A woman from Johnson County donated money to fly Manuel and his
mother, Sara Menchaca, to Kansas City. Trudi Grin, a pediatric
ophthalmologist, performed the surgery for free.
</P>
<P>
   The surgery corrected the appearance of Manuel's eyes and
improved his peripheral vision, but it could not help the sight in
his right eye.
</P>
<P>
   So Manuel was given glasses to wear to protect his good eye from
injury.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts, who grew up in Colombia and Venezuela, has served as
interpreter for hundreds of people in hospitals, courtrooms and at
Johnson County Community College.
</P>
<P>
   But she was especially touched by Manuel.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts accompanied Manuel to an Overland Park store, where he
was able to get some things he needed after a Girl Scout troop
donated money. He replaced the size 2 shoes he had been wearing
with a size 6.
</P>
<P>
   Manuel also bought a bike, which had been his lifelong dream.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts saw how Manuel loved being around others, often dancing
and playing soccer.
</P>
<P>
   But she also noticed the palms of Manuel's hands were yellowed
and lined with scars. Menchaca, Manuel's mother, tearfully
confessed she put his hands on a hot stove as a way to punish him.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was so painful to me,'' Roberts said. ``He has such a
gentle spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   After the boy returned to Mexico, Roberts wondered about how his
life had changed. So she took the opportunity to accompany a TV
crew to Juarez. A 30-minute program about Manuel aired recently on
KMBC, Channel 9.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts found herself overwhelmed by Manuel's situation and by
the extreme poverty that surrounded him in Juarez, a desert city
across the border from El Paso, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Manuel's mother lived in a one-room home of cardboard walls.
Manuel sometimes visited her when his stepfather _ who had banished
Manuel, then only 5, because of his crossed eyes _ wasn't around.
The room has no running water, and a hole dug in the ground serves
as a toilet.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts said she could only contrast her comfortable life with
Manuel's poverty. She felt helpless when she saw other children
living like Manuel.
</P>
<P>
   Bringing Manuel to live permanently in the United States wasn't
an option, Roberts said. Manuel had longed to be back in Mexico
each day he was in Overland Park, and he would miss his family,
even though he had spent most of his life apart from them.
</P>
<P>
   So plans for the Compassion Foundation for Kansas City were
born.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts plans to keep up with Manuel through Jorge Mata, an
Evangelical Presbyterian pastor in Juarez who helps street
children. Roberts said she hopes to return this fall to give Manuel
any money that is raised and form long-term plans to help him and
to adopt a school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Education is magic,'' Roberts said. ``I don't see any other
way to help. We need to change this system.''
</P>
<P>
   And another pair of glasses was sent to Manuel when Roberts
visited. Before she left, Manuel promised he would not sell this
pair.

   &UR; DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION _ (Moved in ``p'' category) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   DEM-PLATFORM (Los Angeles) _ Far from stamping a distinctive
Gore imprint on the Democratic Party, the platform the delegates
will approve on Tuesday warmly embraces the centrist policies of
the Clinton administration and lavishly credits them for the
prosperity of the last seven years. By James Dao.
</P>
<P>
   (ART ADV: Graphic has been sent to NYT graphics clients.)
</P>
<P>
   DEM-DELEGATES (Los Angeles) _ The Democratic delegates arriving
here to nominate Vice President Al Gore for president think of
themselves as moderates, but their views on issues from affirmative
action to an activist federal government are more liberal than
those of the public or even Democratic voters generally, a New York
Times/CBS News Poll shows. By Adam Clymer.

</P>
<P>
   DEM-SCRIPT (Los Angeles) _ A look at the way the Democrats plan
to control the message. From the sea of see-through IMAC computers
on the convention floor to a center-stage program of prominent
officials engaged in issue ``dialogues'' with ordinary people, the
Democratic National Convention is intended to be, in look and feel,
a brainier and meatier antidote to the Republicans' feel-good
Philadelphia spectacle. By Peter Marks.
</P>
<P>
   (Story has moved in ``p'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   DEM-PLAYBOY (Los Angeles) _ By most measures, Hugh Hefner and
his daughter, Christie, are hardly the largest donors to the
Democratic Party. But, this week, as a controversy swirled around
the use of the Playboy Mansion for a Hispanic fund-raiser, they
became, for a moment, among the most visible. By Leslie Wayne.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-REAGAN (Los Angeles) _ When you watch President Clinton
at the Democratic convention, it may look like he is stealing
President Ronald Reagan's script from 1988. As Reagan did then,
Clinton plans to officially bless his No. 2 on Monday evening. And
as Reagan did then, Clinton is expected to implore Americans to
build on the triumphs of the current administration. By Richard L.

</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-PUTIN (Moscow) _ Since becoming president of Russia,
Vladimir Putin has capitalized on a voter mandate and high poll
ratings to begin putting Russia back in order after a decade of
wild economic and political swings. But along the way, he is
breaking a lot of china, indulging some of the anti-democratic
instincts, his critics say, that came with his KGB training. By
Patrick E. Tyler.
</P>
<P>
   AFRICA-AIDS-TEACHERS (Bazra-Nattis, Ivory Coast) _ Six teachers
a week in this nation of 15 million people die of AIDS, a 1998
government study found, and officials believe the number has only
gone up since then. The elite status afforded by their education
makes teachers, nearly all of them men, particularly susceptible
when, young and single, they enter remote villages for their first
teaching jobs: young village women compete for their attention. The
result is multiple sexual relationships, made riskier because the
men are unlikely to use condoms. By Norimitsu Onishi.

   MIDEAST-TALKS (Washington) _ U.S. officials are talking about
the possibility of reviving the Palestinian-Israeli talks, saying
the time is short, that Egypt appears ready to be helpful and that
they see some signs of willingness on both sides. By Jane Perlez.
</P>
<P>
   INDONESIA-POLITICS (Jakarta, Indonesia) _ The streets of Jakarta
were mostly quiet as parliament met this past week _ an indication,
perhaps, that despite its daunting problems and continuing disarray
there is hope in Indonesia for a more ordered and cohesive future.
``It's not over yet,'' cautioned a local journalist. But with
another week to go, this has been the first major political event
since former President Suharto was driven from office two and a
half years ago that has not been riven by chaos and bloodshed. By
Seth Mydans.

<P>
   (ART ADV: Locator map has been sent to NYT graphics clients.)

<P>
   CHINA-POLICE (Shanghai) _ Police activity has increased in
several parts of China as the country undergoes a tightening of
social controls ahead of the October 1st National Day holiday.
While the summer sweep of discos and karaoke bars and detentions of
people voicing political dissent is an annual event, the crackdown
appears unusually harsh this year. By Craig S. Smith.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-CONCUBINES (Dongguan, China) _ Of all the ties that bind
Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland, few may be more pervasive than
sex. But it is not fueled by quick thrills and anonymous
encounters. It is based on a remarkably durable web of
relationships that have flowered between relatively poor Chinese
women and more affluent Hong Kong men, whose jobs require them to
spend days or weeks at a time in the mainland. Many of these
commuters support mistresses or de facto second wives, and
concubine villages have sprouted up across Guangdong Province. But
now the Chinese government is starting to view wholesale adultery
as a social menace, and it is cracking down. By Mark Landler.

   WELFARELESS-COUNTY (Rushville, Ill.) _ Welfare has completely
disappeared from Schuyler County, Ill. For more than a year, there
have been no new cases, no old cases, no one on the rolls. This
results not just from a strong economy, but also from hard work by
local welfare officials, who give lots of personal attention to
each case _ and have many lessons to teach the rest of the country.
By Robert Pear.

   FLA-BEACH (Destin, Fla.) _ Destin, the Florida Panhandle village
that had long been regarded as one of the last, little jewels of

<P>
   MURDOCH-MEDIA (Undated) _ Media analysts and network executives
said over the weekend that the sale of TV stations owned by
Chris-Craft Industries to the owner of the Fox television network,
News Corp., is likely to create a host of opportunities for News
Corp. _ and raise almost as many questions. The questions will
affect both News Corp. and Viacom, which until last Friday had been
bidding to acquire the Chris-Craft stations itself. By Bill Carter
and Geraldine Fabrikant.
</P>
<P>
   STOSSEL-TVNEWS-MEDIA (Undated) _ Reviled in some quarters as an
ideologue and crusader, admired in others for his fresh, contrarian
approach, John Stossel is an anomaly in TV journalism. Reporters
are generally forced to keep their ideologies to themselves.
Stossel is allowed to make his views known. And that he does. An
unabashed libertarian, he has argued that greed is good for the
economy; that environmentalists are ``scaremongers'' with vastly
overblown fears of global warming and pollution; and, even, that
seat belts in school buses are a waste of money. His views have put
him under intense scrutiny in the hothouse world of environmental
and consumer politics. By Jim Rutenberg and Felicity Barringer.

   FANCIFUL-AD-COLUMN (New York) _ Visitors to www.goblertoys.com
can find cartoon versions of the toy inventions of Ira Gobler like
Gobler's Wobblers, Rodeo Rover and Senor and Senorita Sandwich. The
site also offers a scrapbook of the career of Gobler, president and
founder of Gobler Toys, and links to animated commercials. But
anyone doing research into the toy business will soon find there is
no Gobler Toys and no toy maker named Ira Gobler. Rather,
www.goblertoys.com is an example of an increasingly popular trend
in marketing: fictional or fanciful Web sites. By Allison Fass.
</P>
<P>
   NEW-ECON-COLUMN (Tokyo) _ The New Economy column: In Japan this
year, the number of people with Internet access is expected to
surpass the number of Internet users in the United States. But
because most Japanese are getting their access via wireless
devices, with relatively slow connection speeds, the Japanese
experience of the Internet is vastly different from the typical
American's experience. Does this suggest yet another type of
digital divide? By John Markoff.

   E-COMMERCE-COLUMN (Undated) _ The E-Commerce column: A changing

   MUSIC-SATELLITES (Undated) _ Delivering simultaneous streams of
music to thousands or millions of listeners over an increasingly
clogged Internet has become increasingly frustrating. If the audio
stream hits too many traffic jams, the listener may find his
Internet radio program stuttering or stopping halfway through a
song. One promising remedy involves sending the stream up to a
space satellite, hopping over most of the jam-ups on the ground and
landing the music stream at a network hub closer to the listener.
