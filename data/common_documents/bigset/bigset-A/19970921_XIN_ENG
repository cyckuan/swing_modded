<HEADLINE> Removal of Trade Barriers Between Zimbabwe, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 20 (Xinhua) -- There is need for both
Zimbabwe and Mozambique to remove barriers to trade and
investment if the proposed development of the Beira corridor is
to economically benefit countries in the southern Africa region.
</P>
<P>
Managing Director of the Beira Corridor Group (BCG) David
Zausmer today said the development corridor, one formalized
toward the end of this year, would provide a mechanism which
encouraged an increase in trade and investment throughout the
corridor.
</P>
<P>
But to achieve success, he said, there is need to remove
factors which hamper the free movement of people, trade and
investment between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Zausmer cited visa requirements for travellers, high tarrifs
along the corridor and lengthy procedures in approval of cross
border investment.
</P>
<P>
He said one of the first tasks of the committees established
as part of the development corridor would be to look at the
barriers to trade and investment between the two countries and
recommend appropriate steps to remove them.
</P>
<P>
''The time is now ripe for both governments and the business
sectors to further accelerate their efforts in developing the
corridor, lest we surrender the opportunity to more powerful
economies in the region,'' Zausmer said in apparent reference to
South Africa currently investing along the corridor.
</P>
<P>
The current Beira corridor is a railway and road network
running between the Zimbabwean eastern border town of Murare to
the Mozambican port city of Beira.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Liberian President
Charles Taylor will arrive in South Africa tonight for a private
visit, Foreign Ministry spokesman Marco Boni confirmed this
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here from Liberia's capital
Monrovia, Taylor's Information Minister Joe Mulbah has said
Taylor would see President Nelson Mandela during the five-day
visit.
</P>
<P>
But Mandela's spokesman Parks Mankahlana said today that he
was not aware of any such plans.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's Home Affairs Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi
represented Mandela on August 23 at the inauguration in Monrovia
of Taylor as president.
</P>
<P>
The inauguration followed multi-party elections in Liberia in
July in which Taylor received a 75 percent majority.
</P>
<P>
Liberia had before the poll been racked by a six-and-half
years of civil war.
</P>
<P>
South Africa and Liberia enjoy diplomatic relations but do not
have residential missions in each other's capitals.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Youths Sexually Misbehaving: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Family planning research in
Zimbabwe shows that more than 60 percent of the country's four
million youths do not take precautions when engaging in sexual
activity.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed by Mines, Environment and Tourism Minister
Simon Moyo, when he officially launched the Zimbabwe National Family
Planning Council promotion of youth responsibility campaign in
Matabeleland South province today.
</P>
<P>
''While half of young men and one quarter of women aged between 15
to 24 years were sexually active, only 39 percent males and 29
percent females took precautions against sexually transmitted
infections and unwanted pregnancies,'' said Moyo.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the irresponsibility to lack of information which he
hoped would be corrected by the six-month campaign being carried out
all over the country.
</P>
<P>
''Among adolescents aged 15 to 19, nearly half of all births
are unintended. Data from the National AIDS Coordination Program
indicates that 36 percent of reported AIDS cases were from people
infected during adolescent years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
The campaign aims to increase awareness and knowledge of
reproductive health issues including associated illnesses, reduce
high risk sexual behavior, reduce pregnancy rates among women
between 10 and 24 years and increase support from policy makers.
</P>
<P>
Moyo called on health personnel, teachers and parents to
complement each other in the effort to educate the youth in
responsible sexual behavior.

<P>
HARARE, September 20 (Xinhua) -- The opposition Zimbabwe
People's Democratic Party today lashed out at the government's
"care-free attitude" toward the welfare of health personnel at a
time when the country's services are crumbling.
</P>
<P>
"This care-free attitude to matters only serves to prompt more
trained or qualified medical personnel to other countries in
search of employment from which they will get better
remuneration," said party leader Isabel Madangure.
</P>
<P>
Madangure said in a statement that the government should move
swiftly and arrest the loss of qualified personnel to other
countries by awarding attractive remunerations.
</P>
<P>
Health and Child Welfare Minister Timothy Stamps told
parliament recently that the government had since approved
establishment of a health review commission to probe the
country's ailing health delivery service.
</P>
<P>
The minister also bemoaned the loss of skilled personnel from
his ministry to the private sector and international
organizations, saying this was affecting "efficiency" at the top.

<HEADLINE> Bulgarian Press Reports on CPC Congress Conclusion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Bulgarian news media today
reported the conclusion of the 15th National Congress of the
Communist Party of China (CPC) with extensive coverage.
</P>
<P>
A lengthy report by a senior writer of the official Bulgarian
Telegraph Agency (BTA) hailed the CPC congress, which was ended in
Beijing on Friday, as an event of "very great significance."
</P>
<P>
The report, by Pavel Pachev, chief of the BTA's economic
information division and once a Beijing-based correspondent, was
carried by the Bulgarian daily Kontinent.
</P>
<P>
The CPC congress charted the way for the next five years, and
Jiang Zemin's re-election as the CPC Central Committee's general
secretary enabled him to focus on economic reforms, Pachev wrote.
</P>
<P>
In foreign relations, he said, Beijing has made it clear that
it will adhere to the principle of peaceful co-existence, expand
friendship with other countries and respect their sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
China, whose gross domestic product (GDP) is predicted to be
over that of the United States sometime between 2010 and 2020, has
also pledged not to seek hegemonism as its economy booms, he said.
</P>
<P>
To show its sincerity for peace, the CPC congress proposed
further reducing China's armed forces by 500,000, his report
added.

<P>
MOSCOW, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Major Russian newspapers today
covered the 15th National Congress of the Communist Party of China
(CPC) and praised its resolution to further economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Newspaper, the organ of the Russian government,
expressed the belief in an editorial that the new CPC leaders
elected at the Congress will guide China into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
China's economic reform will focus on the public sector in next
five years, and the CPC leaders have formulated a careful policy
for political reform to avoid domestic turmoils, said the article.
</P>
<P>
"The establishment of socialist democracy is a historical
procedure that should be carried out step by step," it said.
</P>
<P>
China's planned disarmament of 500,000 troops in the next three
years, announced by CPC General Secretary Jiang Zemin, is a
positive move to make better use of national resources, it said.
</P>
<P>
Another popular Russian newspaper Izvestiya, or News, today
continued its coverage on the CPC congress in Beijing, hailing
that China "has embarked on the road to a new century."
</P>
<P>
"In the turn of the century, China is to undergo its most
fundamental changes after beginning the reform process 20 years
ago," the newspaper's correspondents reported from Beijing.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Editor Sentenced for Anti-State Propaganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 20 (Xinhua) -- An Iranian court sentenced
today Faraj Sarkouhi, chief editor of the Persian Weekly Adineh,
to one year in prison on alleged charges of involvement in
anti-state propaganda.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Revolution Court said that the Iranian editor was
found guilty of having secret contacts with some European
nationals.
</P>
<P>
The trial was held behind closed doors at Sarkouhi's request,
according a statement released by the court.
</P>
<P>
The editor was arrested in February along with his brother and
two other smugglers while attempting to make an illegal exit in
Bushehr, a port city in southern Iran.
</P>
<P>
European countries, specially Germany, intervened the
case. German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said recently that the
trial of Sarkouhi will create obstacle to the return of the
European ambassadors to Iran and to the Bonn-Tehran relations.
</P>
<P>
All ambassadors of the European Union (EU) member nations have
been recalled from Tehran since April in a protest against the
alleged involvement of Iranian leaders in murdering Kurdish
dissidents in Germany.
</P>
<P>
Iran has protested against German intervention in the arrest
of Sarkouhi, who seeks political asylum in Sweden and Germany.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi termed the statements
of Kinkel as "amazing." He said that it is very surprising for
the German foreign minister who well knows the international
regulations to make such statements "because the trial of a
citizen in a country is an affair within the jurisdiction of that
country."

<HEADLINE> Somali Faction Team Visits Breakaway Somaliland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Hussein Mohamed Aidid sent
his deputy president, Abdurahman Ahmed Ali Tuur, to visit
Hargeisa for the first time in four years today, for talks with
the breakaway Republic of Somaliland about a federal system.
</P>
<P>
The delegation with more than 100 people including several of
Hussein Aidid's cabinet ministers were welcomed by a cheering crowd
in Hargeisa, capital of Somaliland.
</P>
<P>
According to sources in Hargeisa, Tuur and his delegation will
open talks with self proclaimed president of Somaliland, Mohamed
Hagi Ibtahim Egal about their political views later today.
</P>
<P>
During their talks, Tuur is expected to raise and lobby for a
federal system for the country, an issue less likely to be
accepted by Egal and his supporters.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is of great importance and it has
been sympathized by communities in Somaliland and the supporters
of Hussein Aidid here in Mogadishu with each side looking forward
to hearing from the outcome of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Six parliament members from the self-appointed government of
Egal have already expressed their support to the federal system
raised by Tuur.
</P>
<P>
The idea is also supported by the majority of the Garhajis
subclan which Tuur belongs to.
</P>
<P>
The meeting between the two men was proposed by the sultan of
the Garhajis subclan and it was largely welcomed by the Habar
Awal subclan of Egal.
</P>
<P>
Tuur, the first president of Somaliland who announced the
secession of the northwestern regions of Somalia from the rest of
the country during his incumbency in Somaliland in May 1991, took
up arms after the communities of Somaliland elected Egal as
their president.
</P>
<P>
More than 500 people were believed to have died in the bitter
armed confrontations between the two sides in the main towns of
Hargeisa, Buro and many other villages from late 1994 till early
1996.
</P>
<P>
The crowd that welcomed Tuur and his delegation in Hargeisa
today were also divided in two groups, one calling Tuur to join
the administration of Egal for a lasting peace in Somaliland and
the other wishing him success in his federalism endeavors.
</P>
<P>
The two men last met in May 1993. They both belong to the
Issak tribe, one of the four major tribes of Somalia.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Iran today launched the first
flight between Iranian capital Tehran and Jeddah, a port city in
Western Saudi Arabia, since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
</P>
<P>
Hussein Shafti, Managing Director of Iran's National Flag
Carrier Homa, said that the air service is running weekly
between Iran and Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
He described the opening of the new air route between Tehran
and Jeddah as a means of further expansion of commercial
relations between the two Muslim countries.
</P>
<P>
The opening of the air route should be considered as one of
the suitable means through which Iranian and Saudi Arabian
businessmen can expand their cooperation, he said.
</P>
<P>
The regular flights on Saturdays would provide an easy way
for Iranian businessmen and those who collect visa directly from
the Saudi Embassy to travel to Saudi Arabia for pilgrimage to
the holy sanctuaries or for meeting their relatives.
</P>
<P>
Based on a protocol signed between the two countries in March,
the Saudi airlines will launch a weekly flight to Tehran according
to a timetable to be announced soon, Shafti said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that with the increase in the number of
these flights Homa would be able to increase its flights to
different cities in Saudi Arabia.

YAOUNDE, September 20 (Xinhua) -- A senior government official
of Cameroun has called on public and private press to safeguard
the interest of the country by reporting objectively.
</P>
<P>
Augustin Kontchou Kouomegni, government spokesman and the
Minister of State in charge of Communication, made the statement
to the press on Friday afternoon at the nation's Television
Production Center in Yaounde.
</P>
<P>
The minister reviewed that Cameroun has been a target of a
smearing campaign aimed at disturbing and tarnishing the image of
the country.
</P>
<P>
He blasted some foreign media organizations, claiming that
some foreign radios, televisions and print media agencies are
encouraging hatred and war in Cameroun.
</P>
<P>
The minister also blamed the Amnesty International on
attacking Cameroun's human rights records unjustly.
</P>
<P>
The minister accused Cameroun's three opposition parties, the
Social Democratic Front, the National Union for Democracy and
Progress and the Cameroun Democratic Union of calling for
violence.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that their reasons for calling for a boycott of
the upcoming presidential election and violence were weak and
dishonest.
</P>
<P>
Election cannot be postponed as requested by the opposition in
parliament, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The minister emphasized the government's commitment to
democratization process.

<HEADLINE> Greece Sends Fresh Warning to Turkey over Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Greece today once again warned
Turkey that Athens would support Cyprus in the event of any
aggressive action by Turkey against the island.
</P>
<P>
"Greece will come to Cyprus' aid in the event of any aggressive
action by Ankara," Prime Minister Costas Simitis told the ruling
socialist Pasok party central committee today.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Greece and Turkey could not be normalized
without a just solution to the Cyprus problem, he said, adding
that Cyprus' entry into the European Union (EU) was "a matter of
top priority for Greece."
</P>
<P>
He said that the Madrid communique signed by the two countries
in July fully responded to the conditions outlined by Greece
regarding Greek-Turkish relations, but he stressed that its
reconfirmation needed acts.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Simitis warned Turkey that any change of
the existing status quo in Cyprus by Turkey would mean war for
Athens.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops invaded
and occupied the northern third of the island in the wake of a
pro- Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the southern part of the island, the Cyprus
Republic, has been ruled by the Greek-Cypriots while the northern
part by the Turkish-Cypriots which declared in 1983 a breakaway
state "the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" recognized only by
Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Cameroun's Parties Gear Up for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YAOUNDE, September 20 (Xinhua) -- With 27 days to go for the
October 12 presidential election in Cameroun, various political
parties have geared up for the contest.
</P>
<P>
Feverish political meetings, rallies and consultations are
being held across the nation to sensitize militants and garner
support for the election.
</P>
<P>
So far, 16 candidates have deposited their files for the
upcoming presidential election to the Ministry of Territorial
Administration for screening, including incumbent President Paul
Biya who represents the ruling Cameroun People's Democratic
Movement (CPDM) party.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Territorial Administration started screening
application files on September 18. Ten files have been received
by the ministry and the other six files were said to be
incomplete.
</P>
<P>
Cameroun now has about 140 political parties. They are all
preparing for the upcoming election. Some parties presented their
own candidates while some plan to boycott the election.
</P>
<P>
There are still some political organizations that have decided
not to present their own candidates, but have already declared
support for President Biya's candidature.
</P>
<P>
These include the National Alliance for Democracy and Progress
(NADP), the National Union for the Total Independence of Cameroun
(UNITOC), the Cameroun National Party (NPA) and the Union for the
Republic (UPR) which comprises 15 political parties.
</P>
<P>
The Cameroun People's Union (UPC-Kodock Faction) has also
resolved to give full support to President Biya's candidature to
the presidency. But the UPC-N Faction has nominated Hogbe Nblend
as its presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
Still within the context of the October 12 presidential
election, Samuel Eboua, one of the candidates and leader of the
Movement for Democracy and Progress (MDP) representing a
coalition of 12 political parties, also held a press conference
two days ago to drum up support for his candidature.
</P>
<P>
However, the three major opposition political parties -- the
Social Democratic Front (SDF), the National Union for Democracy
and Progress (NUDP) and the Cameroun Democratic Union (CDU) --
announced their boycott of the upcoming presidential election.
</P>
<P>
They held press conferences and signed a joint declaration,
urging all political parties in the country to fight for what
they called "genuine change and freedom."
</P>
<P>
They also called on the international community to show their
concern and support them in the struggle.
</P>
<P>
Anxiety is mounting among various political parties as well as
their nominees as they are waiting for the publication of the
final list of qualified candidates.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the provisions of the law, the final list
of qualified candidates should be made known on September 22, 20
days before the polling day.
</P>
<P>
Although the 15-day campaigns for the election will officially
begin on September 27, various political parties are continuing
their efforts to realize their ambitions, no matter to win or to
boycott the election.

(TRC) to look into the possibility of using the southern
Congolese port of Baraka to disembark the returnees to meet the
challenge of the mounting pressure for repatriating the bulk of
22,000 Congolese refugees who have volunteered to go home.
</P>
<P>
The head of the UNHCR sub-office at Uvira in Congo (K),
Micheal Phelps, was quoted as saying that the U.N. refugees
agency would like to utilize the Baraka port on Lake Tanganyika
because 80 percent of the Congolese returnees are from Fizi
district which has Baraka as its nearest anchoring place.
</P>
<P>
Refugees returning to Fizi district are at the moment
disembarking at Kalundu port in Uvira and then transported in
trucks on a pot-holed road to the southern villages for up to a
six-hour drive, according to Phelps.
</P>
<P>
Phelps said that his agency has contacted the marine
department of the TRC in Kigoma to go to Baraka port to inspect
the harboring facility with the intention to build a docketing
facility to enable Tanzanian passenger ships to disembark the
Congolese refugees.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian marine officials are expected to arrive at Baraka
next week to start inspection and make recommendations on
improving the port to the Congolese government and UNHCR.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR has repatriated 1,666 out of 22,000 Congolese refugees
who have opted to return home from camps in Kigoma Region of
western Tanzania since the start of the repatriation exercise
early this months.
</P>
<P>
The number of refugees to be repatriated is expected to
increase by the end of this month from 600 a week to 3,000 once
UNHCR gets a second leased boat from the TRC to ferry the
returnees three or four times a week, according to the acting
head of the UNHCR sub-office in Kigoma, Luc Stevens.

<HEADLINE> Food Shortage Warned in N. Ghana </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Non-governmental organizations
and the National Disaster Management Organization of Ghana have
warned about an imminent food shortage in the Northern and Upper
East regions of the country due to erratic rainfall.
</P>
<P>
Their warning given at Tamale in northern Ghana is based on a
survey on food security carried out in the two regions in May and
August, according to a Ghana News Agency report reaching here
today.
</P>
<P>
"The report painted a gloomy picture of the food security
situation and said the two regions will need about 2,000 tons of
grains to support the worst affected home," the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report noted that the prolonged drought has had serious
repercussions on the performance of early millet in the upper
east region.
</P>
<P>
The early millet usually blunts the acute food shortage until
the main staples mature, it said.
</P>
<P>
The report cited the case at Adaboya in the Upper East Region
where the villagers have started having raw millet for breakfast
and lunch while others feed on green shea nuts and baobab fruits.
</P>
<P>
"These are all abnormal situations, giving definite
indications of an approaching famine in the area," the report
said.
</P>
<P>
The Northern Regional Coordinating Council has constituted a
committee to work out strategies to respond to the looming
crisis.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Cancels Water Deal With UK Firm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 20 (Xinhua) -- The authorities of the Federal
Capital Territory (FCT), where the Nigerian capital Abuja is
located, have decided not to hand over the management of the
newly created Abuja Water Company to Bi-water, a British company.
</P>
<P>
The contract was terminated in compliance with a directive
from the federal government, which said the move was fraught with
a lot of dangers for the country, the News Agency of Nigeria
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Abuja Water Company, set up in July, is mandated to handle
the treatment and distribution of water in the capital in
addition to the collection of water bills.
</P>
<P>
It is also asked to take over the management of all the water
treatment plants owned by the FCT Water Board.
</P>
<P>
A source at the board was quoted by the report as saying today
that the federal government issued the directive for the
revocation of the contract following complaints from some
Nigerians that allowing a foreign firm to handle such simple job
was not in the interest of the country.
</P>
<P>
The federal government also felt convinced that the move, if
not cancelled, would lead to job losses as the FCT Water Board
would be scrapped and its workers laid-off, the source said.
</P>
<P>
According to the official news agency, some labor unions were
among those that petitioned the presidency over the controversial
contract whose details were yet to be made public.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Protesters Clash with Police in East </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian protesters
clashed with Israeli police today during a demonstration in the
disputed Ras Al-Amud neighborhood in East Jerusalem to
protest the Jewish presence there.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of Palestinian protesters blocked the road to the Arab
neighborhood with stones and cabbage containers. They threw
stones at Israeli police who fired rubber bullets to disperse
them. But no casualties were reported.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, another group of Palestinian protesters held a
peaceful demonstration in Ras Al-Amud, where 15 Jews occupied two
houses last Sunday sparking a crisis in the already tense
situation between Israel and the Palestinians. The demonstrators
held banners calling on Jews to leave the neighborhood to save
the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Under a compromise agreement Thursday between the Israeli
government and American billionaire businessman Irving Moscowitz,
who purchased the houses in Ras Al-Amud in an attempt to build a
Jewish settlement, the 15 settlers would leave the houses to be
replaced by a religious seminar.
</P>
<P>
But the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) has blasted the
agreement as a "trick" to legalize the Jewish presence in the Arab
neighborhood and demanded all Jews leave there.
</P>
<P>
Israeli major opposition parties and peace activists all
criticized the government's agreement with the settlers and asked
the settlers to evacuate the houses in order to avoid an outbreak
of violence.
</P>
<P>
Jerusalem has been at the center of the Israeli-Palestinian
dispute and under the Oslo accords, its final status should be
settled through the final-status talks. Israel has claimed the
whole holy city as its eternal and indivisible capital, while
the PNA hopes to create a Palestinian state with the occupied
East Jerusalem as its capital.

<HEADLINE> Team Canada to Visit Latin America in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Prime Minister Jean
Chretien said today he will lead the fourth Team Canada mission to
four Latin American countries from January 11 to 23 next year.
</P>
<P>
The mission to Mexico, Brazil, Argentina and Chile will
generate new business for Canadian companies, which are expected
to complete and sign numerous contracts and agreements, according
to a news release from Chretien's office.
</P>
<P>
Chretien will be joined by provincial premiers and territorial
leaders on the mission, his second to the region, as well as by a
delegation of several hundred of business people.
</P>
<P>
"Keeping up our momentum in these dynamic, growing economies of
Latin America will have economic benefits for all regions of
Canada," Chretien said.
</P>
<P>
It is vitally important to consolidate Canada's impressive
gains in this region, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"Canadian companies already benefit from our free trade
agreements with Mexico and Chile, and Canada is discussing closer
links with the nations of the Mercosur trade group, which includes
Brazil and Argentina," he added.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Chretien will discuss how to forge closer
economic and political ties with the region in the months
preceding the Summit of the Americas in Santiago, Chile, where
participants plan to launch negotiations on the Free Trade Area of
the Americas.
</P>
<P>
Team Canada is expected to focus on nine priority sectors,
including telecommunications and information technology,
transportation, specialized services, the environment, energy and
natural resources, according to the release.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, two-way merchandise trade between Canada and the four
Latin American countries totaled 11.0 billion dollars (7.9
billion USD), up 62 percent over the 1993 figure.
</P>
<P>
Total Canadian foreign direct investment in the four countries
now exceeds 14 billion dollars (10 billion USD).
</P>
<P>
Since 1994, Chretien has led three Team Canada missions abroad.
</P>
<P>
These missions have led to business deals estimated at over 20
billion dollars (14.4 billion USD), and have opened doors for
Canadian businesses to important contacts and opportunities.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Stresses Test Standards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 20 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill
Clinton Saturday said he would veto any Republican legislation
that does not include standards for testing reading and
mathematics skills.
</P>
<P>
"I'll have to give it the failing grade it deserves, and I'll
veto it," Clinton said in his weekly radio address. "We all know
we have to do more to improve the quality of public education."
</P>
<P>
Republicans fired back. "I think the president is telling
parents and teachers, `I don't trust you,'" Republican Senator
Slade Gorton said in the Republican radio response. "Apparently,
he prefers a system that has Washington, D.C., deciding what's
best for school children in Chehalis, Washington, New York City
and every place in between."
</P>
<P>
Clinton is scheduled to announce 40 million dollars in grants
for charter schools during a visit to the San Carlos Learning
Center in California, one of the country's first such schools.
Education Secretary Richard Riley said more than 420 charter
schools nationwide receive federal support.
</P>
<P>
"Charter schools are established by educators with less red
tape, but higher expectations," Clinton said. "This is an
innovation we cannot afford to lose."
</P>
<P>
Charter schools -- public schools run under contract by
teachers, parents or community leaders -- are a part of Clinton's
education strategy.
</P>
<P>
The president's education plan also establishes testing
standards for fourth-grade reading and eighth-grade math.
Conservatives oppose the idea, arguing that it creates an avenue
for federal control of local schools.
</P>
<P>
In his address, Clinton described testing standards as a way to
"ensure that no child leaves our schools without mastering the
basics."
</P>
<P>
He said he would veto if Congress passes "partisan legislation
that denies our children high national standards or weakens our
national commitment to stronger schools."
</P>
<P>
The House rejected such testing earlier this week in voting
down spending bills to carry the Education, Labor and Health and
Human Services departments through the 1998 budget year. The
Senate approved its version of the spending bills last week, after
attaching Gorton's amendment to convert many education programs
into block grants to states.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Opposes Convocation of Doha Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 20 (Xinhua) -- In a clear-cut language perhaps
for the first time, a senior Egyptian official today expressed
opposition to the convocation of the Middle East and North Africa
Economic (MENA) Conference due to be held in Qatari capital Doha.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt does not wish the conference would be held in a sisterly
Arab country like Qatar and then fail," Osama el-Baz, presidential
advisor for political affairs, told reporters here.
</P>
<P>
It will be "detrimental rather than beneficial" to convene
the conference under current circumstances, he said, adding that
the optimism over peace that prevailed the MENA conference held
in Cairo last November is now regrettably missing in the region.
</P>
<P>
As a direct spinoff of the Mideast peace process, the annual
MENA conference had been held in Casablanca, Morocco; Amman,
Jordan; and Cairo, Egypt since 1994. But peace prospects have been
largely deteriorated since then.
</P>
<P>
Most Arab countries have threatened to boycott the Doha
conference due to Israel's participation, while Qatar insists on
going ahead as scheduled in November.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia and Syria flatly rejected the conference to
protest Israel's policies against the peace process, while Egypt
has said that its participation hinges on progress on the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Emerging from a meeting held on the sidelines of the 108th
session of the Arab League foregin ministers council which opened
here today, Qatari Foreign Minister Sheikh Hamad Ben Jassem Al-Thani
painted a bleak picture for the economic forum.
</P>
<P>
He said it can not be "as successful as expected" unless Israel
changes its current policy and the peace process makes tangible
progress.
</P>
<P>
"The Israeli practice proved that it has failed to implement
its obligations and commitments to the peace process," he said,
adding that Qatar will keep up consultations with other Arab
countries on the peace development.

<P>
Jiang's comments on the primary stage of socialism have also
received a good response from people in the Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region, according to the Regional Power Administration
officials. They concluded that the primary stage of socialism
reflects the real conditions of the region, which is rich in coal
and water resources, but lacks funds and technology.
</P>
<P>
Inner Mongolia should improve its power industry based on the
principle of "Three Favorables" and the market, they said.
</P>
<P>
In better-developed areas like the city of Shanghai and Jiangsu
Province, economic affairs officials said they will break down all
barriers in stepping up reforms and opening wider to the outside
world.
</P>
<P>
"We cadres in charge of economic administration should
emancipate our minds further and support any kinds of public
ownership," said Xu Zhiyi, director of the Shanghai Municipal
Economic Commission.
</P>
<P>
The decision of the Congress to advance enterprise
restructuring has greatly encouraged officials in charge of
restructuring and those working in state companies.
</P>
<P>
Liu Zhixiang, deputy director of the Regional Commission for
Economic Restructuring of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region,
said that the Congress's decision has made them more confident
about invigorating state-owned enterprises in the region.
</P>
<P>
Most of these are small and Xinjiang should make improving them
an important part of local economic reforms through ideological
emancipation, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
Guo Yuhui, deputy chief economist of Beijing's Yanshan
Petrochemical Industry Group Co. Ltd., said that Jiang's report
has provided clear guidelines for the restructuring of state-owned
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Deng Tong, a displaced factory worker in Guiyang, the capital
of Guizhou Province, explains that she learned to use computers
after being laid off from the factory and has found a new job, and
concluded, "We should try to improve our own quality, so as to
meet the requirements of the market economy."

<P>
BEIJING, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The 15th National Congress of
the Communist Party of China (CPC) ended on September 18, and the
Chinese have expressed their determination to implement the
policies that came out of it.
</P>
<P>
They share the same view about stepping up reforms, opening up
wider, and scoring sustained, healthy economic development based
on China's national conditions and the principle of the "Three
Favorables".
</P>
<P>
"The 15th Party Congress's emphasis on the theory of the
primary stage of socialism shows that the Party has a clear
understanding of the country's national conditons and its historic
mission," commented Hu Zhide, the former president of Lanzhou
University in the capital of Gansu province.
</P>
<P>
Gansu is an underdeveloped area, and such poor areas need
ideological emancipation and boldness in intensifying the reforms,
he told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
In a discussion in Yunnan province in southwest China, Liu
Shusheng, chairman of the Provincial Committee of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference, said that since the
beginning of China's reforms and opening-up in 1979, Yunnan has
developed on the basis of its own conditions, and has become a
major tobacco, sugar, tea and rubber producer in China.
</P>
<P>
In Changchun, the capital of Jilin Province, Huang Zhenshan,
chairman of the Changchun Changling Group, a state-owned machine
manufacturer, told Xinhua about the company's achievements since
it began issuing stocks in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The restructuring has allowed workers to participate in
managing the enterprise, he said.

<HEADLINE> Barak Conditions on Joining Unity Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Israeli opposition Labor
Party leader Ehud Barak today put forward his condition of joining
a national unity government on dramatic policy change by Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
After discussing with Public Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani
and lawmaker Yehuda Harel on the issue, Barak said that he would
be willing to consider joining a unity government if Netanyahu
were to shift his policy concerning the Middle East peace process
by 180 degrees.
</P>
<P>
"It is clear that if Netanyahu changes his policy... perhaps
there will be something to discuss," Barak told Army Radio.
</P>
<P>
Both Kahalani and Harel are from the Third Way Party, which
joins the coalition government led by the Likud.
</P>
<P>
Kahalani, who is initiating a new campaign to support setting
up a unity government, said there is basis to continue the
discussion and that he intends to propose the idea to the Likud
coalition.
</P>
<P>
The idea of creating a broad-based unity government was first
put forward after Netanyahu's victory in last year's elections and
has been resurrected in the wake of the recent terror attacks in
Jerusalem, which pushed the peace process into deep crisis.
</P>
<P>
During a television speech following the September 4 suicide
bombings in Jerusalem, Harel said a unity government was
"inevitable", and that the only question is whether it will be
formed before or after "the next disaster."
</P>
<P>
The initiative of the Third Way Party for a unity government
has prompted a flurry of reactions. Likud's Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai said today he does not think that the government
has reached the point necessitating the creation of a national
unity government.
</P>
<P>
But Justice Minister Tzahi Hanegbi, one of Netanyahu's close
supporters, noted in an interview with Israel Radio Saturday night
that Netanyahu and Barak could reach agreement on major issues
about the peace process and that they have ways to discuss the
establishment of a unity government even before an official
invitation for such a move is issued.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said that a Labor-Likud coalition now appears
more possible than it seemed immediately following Netanyahu's
rise to power in June last year, considering that Netanyahu has
since then dealt with the Palestinian National Authority and its
president Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Netanyahu's talk this year of an "Allon-Plus" deal
on a permanent settlement between Israel and the Palestinians
signaled a break from traditional Likud dogma on territorial
compromise, and brought him at least theoretically closer to
Barak's views.
</P>
<P>
Peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians collapsed in
March when Israel broke ground for a Jewish settlement in Arab
East Jerusalem. The crisis deepened following two terror attacks
in July and September and the latest dispute over Jewish presence
in the Ras Al-Amud Arab neighborhood in East Jerusalem, which the
Palestinians want as the capital of a future state.

<HEADLINE> Shell Tops World's Transnational Companies: UN Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The Royal Dutch/Shell group
topped the list of the 100 biggest transnational corporations
(TNCs) for the fifth running year, the United Nations reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The company, merged by the Royal Dutch and the Shell in 1907
and has two separate headquarters in Britain and the Netherlands,
owns almost 80 billion U.S. dollars of foreign assets in 1995,
leading the world's multinational firms, the U.N. Conference on
Trade and Development (UNCTAD) said today in its 1997 edition of
the world investment report.
</P>
<P>
The second to tenth biggest conglomerates are the Ford Motor
Company, the General Electric Company, the Exxon Corporation,
General Motors, Volkswagen AG, IBM, the Toyota Motor Corporation,
Nestle SA and the Mitsubishi Corporation.
</P>
<P>
The 100 multinational giants has 1.7 trillion dollars of assets
in their foreign affiliates, representing about a fifth of the
world's total foreign assets, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Their foreign sales amounted to 2 trillion dollars and their
employment totalled 6 million persons.
</P>
<P>
The European Union, the United States and Japan are home to 87
of the 100 leading TNCs and controlled 88 percent of their foreign
assets. In 1996, the triad accounted for around 90 percent of both
inflows and outflows of developed countries.
</P>
<P>
Australia, Canada and Switzerland have also emerged as
significant overseas investors and investment recipients, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
Only two companies from developing countries came into the top
100 list, the Daewoo Corporation and Petroleos de Venezuela SA,
ranking respectively 52nd and 88th. It is the first time
developing countries' companies have entered the list.
</P>
<P>
There are about 44,000 TNCs with about 280,000 overseas
affiliates in the world, the report said. The top 100 companies
mainly invested in construction, food and beverages, chemicals and
pharmaceuticals, petroleum and mining, electronics, automotive,
and metals.

<HEADLINE> Round-Up: IMF's Interim Committee Meeting Fruitful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Philippe Maystadt, chairman
of the Interim Committee of the Board of Governors of the
International Monetary Fund (IMF), said today the one-day meeting
of his committee was successful and fruitful.
</P>
<P>
Experts here also said that the closed-door meeting is
important in outlining topics for the upcoming annual meetings of
the World Bank and IMF scheduled for September 23-25 in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference later, Maystadt said the
committee "welcomed the agreement reached by the Executive Board
of the IMF" on the quota issue and urged it to "submit before the
end of this year a proposed resolution for the approval of the
Board of Governors to effect the agreed increases in quotas."
</P>
<P>
The present total of IMF quotas would be increased by 45
percent, according to a communique issued at the end of the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
It said 75 percent of the overall increase would be distributed
in proportion to present quotas, 15 percent distributed in
proportion to members' shares in calculated quotas (based on 1994
data) and the remaining 10 percent distributed among those members
whose present quotas are out of line with their positions in the
world economy.
</P>
<P>
The last 10 percent of the overall increase includes the one
percent that would be distributed among five members whose current
quotas are far out of line with their relative economic positions,
and which are in a position to contribute to the IMF's liquidity
over the medium term, the communique said.
</P>
<P>
Maystadt told reporters that the committee also "welcomed the
agreement reached by the Executive Board on an amendment of the
IMF's Articles to provide all members with an equitable share of
cumulative SDR (Special Drawing Rights) allocations through a
special one-time SDR allocation amounting to SDR 21.4 billion,
which will double the amount of SDRs already allocated."
</P>
<P>
According to the communique, the committee has recommended the
adoption by the Board of Governors of a proposed resolution
concerning the issue.
</P>
<P>
The committee "welcomed the recent progress made in the
implementation of the HIPC (Heavily Indebted Poor Countries)
Initiative, including the decision of the Executive Boards of the
IMF and the World Bank to provide assistance" to several
countries, Maystadt said.
</P>
<P>
He said recent disturbances in Asian financial markets had
again underscored the importance for policy makers in all
countries to ensure the internal consistency of macroeconomic
policies, strengthen financial systems, and avoid excessive
external deficits and reliance on short-term foreign borrowing.
</P>
<P>
As to the lessons to be drawn from the financial disturbances,
the committee stressed the importance of openness and
accountability of economic policy making and of improvements in
financial systems.
</P>
<P>
"Private capital flows have become much more important to the
international monetary system," it said, stressing the need to
make further efforts to "establish a multilateral and
nondiscriminatory system for promoting the liberalization of
capital movements."
</P>
<P>
According to participants at the meeting, the committee, while
noting the generally favorable prospects for the continued
expansion of world output and trade, also stressed that there are
risks confronting individual countries and affecting the world
economy.
</P>
<P>
"In the advanced economies as a group, growth with low
inflation is projected to continue. However, sustained fiscal
consolidation remains a challenge for many countries, requiring
resolute policies over the near and medium term," the communique
said.
</P>
<P>
"The growth performance and prospects of developing countries
as a group have strengthened in recent years. However, further
improvements are needed in many cases to achieve significant
reduction in poverty," it pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The communique said that in some emerging market economies,
large external imbalances and fragile banking systems have
adversely affected investor confidence and exacerbated the risks
emanating from volatile capital movements.
</P>
<P>
In the transition countries, growth has resumed following good
progress, in most cases, with macroeconomic stabilization and
structural reforms, the communique said. "To safeguard and build
upon the achievements thus far, inflation will in most cases need
to be lowered further through disciplined macroeconomic policies."

VIENNA, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Jacques Villeneuve of Canada,
driving a Williams-Renault, edged out scotland's David Coulthard
in a McLaren to win the Austrian Grand Prix in Zeltweg, Austria on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
It was Villeneuve's sixth win of the season.
</P>
<P>
Ferrari's Michael Schumacher still leads the drivers'
championship after coming in sixth to snatch the single point
which keeps him just ahead of the Canadian in the championship
standings with three races remaining.
</P>
<P>
Villeneuve, who started on pole for the eighth time this
season, led from around the half-way mark after choosing his
moment to move past early pace-setter Jarno Trulli of Italy in a
Prost.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian finally came in 2.9 seconds clear to gain the 10
points which would have seen him go level with two-time world
champion Schumacher had the German not just edged reigning
champion Damon Hill of Arrows to take the sixth spot and score a
vital point at the end.
</P>
<P>
Villeneuve's triumph allowed his Williams team to overtake
Schumacher's Ferrari team in the constructors' standings.
</P>
<P>
Villeneuve's teammate Heinz-Harald Frentzen was third for the
third race in succession, four seconds off the pace.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Round-up: Zimbabwe-World Bank Relations at </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank has recently
decided to postpone the disbursement of 720 million Zimbabwe
Dollars (62.5 million U.S. Dollars) balance of payments support
to Zimbabwe, bringing once again bilateral relations to a
deadlock.
</P>
<P>
The bank is holding back the money because there has been no
satisfactory resolution so far to Zimbabwe's war veterans
payments, according to David Cook, resident representative of the
World Bank in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
The move comes hardly a month after it informed the Zimbabwean
government that on the basis of good fiscal management
performance in the 1996/97 financial year which saw the out-turn
for the budget deficit dropping to a surprise 7.1 percent of the
Gross Domestic Product (GDP), it would release the balance of
payments support held up since 1995.
</P>
<P>
The 720 million pending balance of payments support was first
suspended in 1995 after Zimbabwe was accused of missing agreed
economic targets under first phase of reforms (1991-95). The
World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and other donors
wanted Zimbabwe to cut its budget deficit to at least five
percent of its GDP.
</P>
<P>
Late last month, the Zimbabwean government gave in to pressure
from former freedom fighters to resolve their plight and
announced that all the ex-combatants would get a tax-free 50,000
Zimbabwe Dollars (4,300 U.S. Dollars) lump sum pension to be
followed up by a monthly payment of 2,000 Zimbabwe Dollars (173
U.S. Dollars).
</P>
<P>
President Robert Mugabe announced that the 50,000 dollars
would be paid before the end of this year while the 2,000 dollars
monthly payments would start in January next year.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 21 (Xinhua) -- However, the compensation
payments to an estimated 70,000 ex-fighters meant that
substantial additional expenditures were likely to be incurred.
Such expenditures had not been provided for in the 1997/98 budget
submitted to parliament last July.
</P>
<P>
Economists estimated that the payments could drain up over
three billion Zimbabwe Dollars a year, which in essence,
represents over five percent of the government's total annual
expenditure. This would push up the budget deficit from around
8.9 percent anticipated for the period to December 1998 to over
12 percent.
</P>
<P>
"It's serious matter because the amounts involved are quite
large and the issue needs to be resolved speedily," Cook said.
</P>
<P>
After the World Bank's decision was announced, most Zimbabwean
people expressed shock and disappointment.
</P>
<P>
Jane Mutssa, President of Indigenous Business Women's
Organisation noted that the World Bank had expressed its wish to
assist Zimbabwe. But now "the bank is punishing the country."
She charged that the bank wanted to cause friction between the
government and its people.
</P>
<P>
Ben Mucheche, President of the Business Development Centre,
strongly suspected that the World Bank wanted to see conflict
between the government and the combatants, adding the bank should
understand the imperative of maintaining political stability for
future economic progress.
</P>
<P>
Affirmative Action Group President Phillip Chiyangwa said,
"The bank should have been sensitive that the Zimbabwean
government's handling of the war veterans' issue was only to
avoid civil disorder and plunging the state into anarchy."
</P>
<P>
In the past months, the ex-fighters had held demonstrations
which at times turned violent against the government demanding
paying their pensions.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean Minister of Industry and Commerce Nathan
Shamuyarira said Saturday the bank had sought clarification on
how Zimbabwe intended to finance the recently announced pensions
for ex-combatants.

</P>
<P>
The turning point came in the fifth set when Furlan served up a
string of double faults in the third to lose the set to love
before quickly finding himself 5-2 behind in the fourth. And
although he rallied to 5-4 he had left himself too much to do as
the 3,500 home crowd roared Bjorkman home.
</P>
<P>
Sweden will now face either the United States or Australia in
the final. The United States were leading 2-1 going into the final
day's play in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Thomas Enqvist was to face Omar Camporese in the final dead
rubber of Sweden's match later Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Automobile Sales Chain Opens In China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 21 (Xinhua) -- China's first automobile
sales chain opened recently in Changzhou, an industrial city in
Jiangsu province, meaning an interesting development in a country
where chainstores are still relatively new.
</P>
<P>
The outlet in the Changzhou Department Store belongs to
Beijing's Yafei Automobile Chain, which plans to open 22 outlets
nationwide within two months.
</P>
<P>
They will have unified management, creating a unique company,
says Guo Jiyuan, Yafei's president. He says the company has
agreements with 14 auto manufacturers, including Shanghai's
Volkswagen, and he believes that it will get a big market share by
providing various kinds of competitively-priced cars, as well as
good service.
</P>
<P>
It is a breakthrough in car marketing in China, says Xu
Huazhong, director of the Market Circulation Department of the
State Economic and Trade Commission.
</P>
<P>
This form of management started in China in mid-1980s, and saw
rapid growth. It is now being used in retail sales, the fast food
business, and other service sectors.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese are showing great interest in private cars. A study
of Beijing's Municipal Statistics Bureau shows that 7,500 cars
were sold in the Asian Games Village auto market, the city's
largest, in the first quarter of this year, 82 percent of which
were purchased by individuals.
</P>
<P>
The auto industry grew rapidly over the past few
years. Statistics show that China produced 1.5 million cars in
1995, and 1.8 million last year, including nearly 400,000
sedans. Zhao Fengwu, director of the Market Supervision Department
of the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, predicts
that with the economic growth, China will become one of the
biggest private car markets in the world.

<P>
JERUSALEM, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister's
office today denied that Israel has informed Syria that it is
willing to discuss all bilateral issues like Israeli withdrawal to
the border before the 1967 Middle East War.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on a report of the Hebrew newspaper Ha'aretz, the
office said what Israel has conveyed to Syria is that each side is
free to reiterate its position during negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The office said that Israel's stand on Syria remains the same
that each side can bring up issues for discussion without
preconditions and that neither side should force the other to
accept its positions.
</P>
<P>
The Ha'aretz reported today that Israel has recently informed
Syria that it is ready to discuss all issues with Damascus,
including Israeli withdrawal of troops to the June 4, 1967 border
as demanded by Syria.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in an interview with Israeli Hebrew paper Ma'ariv
on Saturday, Chief of Israeli Northern Command Amiram Levine
addressed a prospect of war with Syria, saying that Syrian troops
deployment along the border indicates they are preparing for a
war.

<HEADLINE> Arab CNN-Style TV Station to be Launched </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September (Xinhua) -- A London-based satellite TV
channel called the Arab News Network (ANN), which is to be styled
on U.S. Cable News Network (CNN)'s format of news reporting, is
due to be launched next month.
</P>
<P>
The ANN will have hourly bulletins covering breaking news,
current affairs, business, sport and culture, as well as
live talk shows, documentaries and fashion programs, local
newspaper the Daily Star reported today.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the paper published today, Samar Assad,
27, nephew of Syrian President Hafez al-Assad, and chairman of the
ANN, said that ANN will fill the large niche that exists in the
Arabic-language TV market for a fully independent news channel to
serve the 250 million Arabs.
</P>
<P>
"We are independent, both financially and editorially," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Assad noted that "there is huge potential for a neutral TV
channel. We are going to be showing both sides of every story,
even the Arab-Israel story."
</P>
<P>
He said that news from the Arab world will represent about 80
percent of the news coverage, with 20 percent given to
international events.
</P>
<P>
The news will be gathered by correspondents based in
Beirut, Cairo, Amman and Jerusalem as well as roving reporters
in other parts of the region.
</P>
<P>
The station's funding has come from "private investors" based
in Lebanon and the Gulf, Assad said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he denied that there is any involvement of his
uncle in the ANN.

<HEADLINE> Round-up: Zimbabwe-World Bank Relations at </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank has recently
decided to postpone the disbursement of 720 million Zimbabwe
Dollars (62.5 million U.S. Dollars) balance of payments support
to Zimbabwe, bringing once again bilateral relations to a
deadlock.
</P>
<P>
The bank is holding back the money because there has been no
satisfactory resolution so far to Zimbabwe's war veterans
payments, according to David Cook, resident representative of the
World Bank in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
The move comes hardly a month after it informed the Zimbabwean
government that on the basis of good fiscal management
performance in the 1996/97 financial year which saw the out-turn
for the budget deficit dropping to a surprise 7.1 percent of the
Gross Domestic Product (GDP), it would release the balance of
payments support held up since 1995.
</P>
<P>
The 720 million pending balance of payments support was first
suspended in 1995 after Zimbabwe was accused of missing agreed
economic targets under first phase of reforms (1991-95). The
World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and other donors
wanted Zimbabwe to cut its budget deficit to at least five
percent of its GDP.
</P>
<P>
Late last month, the Zimbabwean government gave in to pressure
from former freedom fighters to resolve their plight and
announced that all the ex-combatants would get a tax-free 50,000
Zimbabwe Dollars (4,300 U.S. Dollars) lump sum pension to be
followed up by a monthly payment of 2,000 Zimbabwe Dollars (173
U.S. Dollars).
</P>
<P>
President Robert Mugabe announced that the 50,000 dollars
would be paid before the end of this year while the 2,000 dollars
monthly payments would start in January next year.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 21 (Xinhua) -- However, the compensation
payments to an estimated 70,000 ex-fighters meant that
substantial additional expenditures were likely to be incurred.
Such expenditures had not been provided for in the 1997/98 budget
submitted to parliament last July.
</P>
<P>
Economists estimated that the payments could drain up over
three billion Zimbabwe Dollars a year, which in essence,
represents over five percent of the government's total annual
expenditure. This would push up the budget deficit from around
8.9 percent anticipated for the period to December 1998 to over
12 percent.
</P>
<P>
"It's serious matter because the amounts involved are quite
large and the issue needs to be resolved speedily," Cook said.
</P>
<P>
After the World Bank's decision was announced, most Zimbabwean
people expressed shock and disappointment.
</P>
<P>
Jane Mutssa, President of Indigenous Business Women's
Organisation noted that the World Bank had expressed its wish to
assist Zimbabwe. But now "the bank is punishing the country."
She charged that the bank wanted to cause friction between the
government and its people.
</P>
<P>
Ben Mucheche, President of the Business Development Centre,
strongly suspected that the World Bank wanted to see conflict
between the government and the combatants, adding the bank should
understand the imperative of maintaining political stability for
future economic progress.
</P>
<P>
Affirmative Action Group President Phillip Chiyangwa said,
"The bank should have been sensitive that the Zimbabwean
government's handling of the war veterans' issue was only to
avoid civil disorder and plunging the state into anarchy."
</P>
<P>
In the past months, the ex-fighters had held demonstrations
which at times turned violent against the government demanding
paying their pensions.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean Minister of Industry and Commerce Nathan
Shamuyarira said Saturday the bank had sought clarification on
how Zimbabwe intended to finance the recently announced pensions
for ex-combatants.

<HEADLINE> IMF Calls for Liberalization of Capital Flow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hong Kong, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) stressed here today that an open and liberal system
governing capital movements will enhance economic welfare and
prosperity worldwide.
</P>
<P>
The IMF's decision-making body, the Interim Committee, said in
a communique issued at the end of a one-day closed-door meeting
that it has adopted the statement on "The Liberalization of
Capital Movements Under an Amendment of the Fund's Articles."
</P>
<P>
"An amendment of the Fund's Articles will provide the most
effective means of promoting an orderly liberalization of capital
movements consistent with the Fund's role in the international
monetary system," the communique said.
</P>
<P>
Considering that a number of developing countries may come
under speculative attacks after opening their capital account, the
committee stressed that the liberalization must be supported by
sound macroeconomic policies and strong financial systems in
member countries.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference after the meeting, Philippe Maystadt,
chairman of the Interim Committee, also said the liberalization of
capital movements should proceed in an orderly, step-by-step way.
</P>
<P>
The Interim Committee has asked the Executive Board of the IMF
to give high priority to completing its work on the liberalization
of capital movements and submitting a report and a proposed draft
amendment to the Board of Governors, according to the communique.

KATHMANDU, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The Technical Committee on

</P>
<P>
Twenty high-level officials in charge of women development

</P>
<P>
At the 11th summit, the SAARC leaders resolved to raise

<HEADLINE> UAE Warns GCC Against Hike in Imports Tariffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates
(UAE) has warned its partners in the Gulf Cooperation Council
(GCC) against hiking tariffs on imports as required in a proposed
regional customs union.
</P>
<P>
UAE Higher Customs Council Chairman Obaid Buset said his
country has presented a memorandum outlining its views towards
the proposed single tariff system for the six-member GCC, said the
latest issue of UAE business weekly Emirates Today.
</P>
<P>
"The UAE has presented a memorandum (to GCC) saying that
raising the tariff would increase prices of goods and this will
hurt consumers," Buset said in an exclusive interview with the
magazine.
</P>
<P>
He also said a four-year transitional period proposed by the
GCC for adopting a common customs tariff is not sufficient. But
UAE will respect the measure if enforced, he added.
</P>
<P>
The GCC states, which are Bahrain, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, the
UAE, Qatar and Oman, have been discussing the joint customs tariff
for years in effort to create a common Gulf market.
</P>
<P>
The customs project has been hampered by differences on the
level of the tariff as some members are opposed to high duties.
</P>
<P>
GCC officials have finished classification of most products to
be taxed and a decision on the proposed tariff is awaiting
approval by the GCC heads of state. They have spoken of a
compromise on a common tariff of between eight and 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
The UAE imposes the lowest tariffs in the 16-year-old Gulf
alliance although it has quadrupled duties on most imports to
four percent. Bahrain, which has little oil, says low duties
would hit its economy as most of its income comes from
import tariffs and taxes.
</P>
<P>
A common GCC market could create one of the biggest markets in
the world, with annual imports of more than 50 billion
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The bloc is also the dominant oil power, controlling nearly
45 percent of the global proven crude reserves and producing
around one fifth of world oil output.

But things have changed recently, spurred by the Mexican
financial crisis which also affected the region and by the Thai
currency crisis which is right in the middle of the region, he
told hundreds of economists, business executives and officials
from around the world who are here to attend the World Bank/IMF
annual meetings to be held on September 23-25.
</P>
<P>
People must bear in mind two points when adopting an approach
towards Asian monetary cooperation, he said.
</P>
<P>
First is that Asian monetary cooperation must be considered
within the context of global monetary cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"In other words, we should not, and I believe we are not trying
to, build Fortress Asia" which is not in the best interests of
Asia, Yam said.
</P>
<P>
The second point is that given the great diversity of the
economies in the region, being at very different stages of
financial development, "Asian monetary cooperation should proceed
with flexibility and at a pace comfortable to those wishing to
take part in it," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Realistically, Asian monetary cooperation should be pursued
under "a multi-currency environment", compared with the single
currency monetary union adopted by Europe, Yam pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that monetary cooperation be built and links be
established "first at the bilateral level" between those who are
ready and willing. These bilateral linkages would serve to set
targets and standards for others in the region who are not quite
ready.
</P>
<P>
When the majority of the bilateral linkages have been
established eventually, "we would then have a network, an Asian
monetary network, of considerable strength, which would hopefully
enable Asian monetary problems to be tackled effectively," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"It should also be a network that is capable of being linked up
with monetary systems outside the region, with a view to building
the global monetary framework," Yam said.
</P>
<P>
He listed five areas for Asian monetary cooperation --
information exchange, resource provision, market infrastructure
development, banking supervision and financial regulation, and
policy consultations.
</P>
<P>
"In the Asian pragmatic and patient way, and using the wise
words of the late (Chinese leader) Deng Xiaoping, we cross the
river by groping the stones," Yam said. He said he was confident a
robust and efficient Asian monetary network would be built to
contribute to the financial stability and economic prosperity in
Asia and the world at large.
</P>
<P>
Turning to Hong Kong, Yam said: "as you can see for yourself,
with goodwill and cooperation, the prosperity of Hong Kong has
been ensured" both before and after the handover.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong will continue to play its role as an international
financial center, and will work hand in hand with all central
banks around the world to build a safer and more robust
international monetary system, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Per Jacobsson Foundation was created in 1964 in honor of
Per Jacobsson, the third Managing Director of the International
Monetary Fund (IMF). It is the first time for the lecture to be
held in Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> IMF's Interim Committee Agrees to Quota Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The Interim Committee of
the Board of Governors of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
said today that it has agreed to an overall increase in quotas and
an amendment to the articles to provide all members with an
equitable share of cumulative Special Drawing Rights (SDR)
allocations.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference here tonight, Committee Chairman
Philippe Maystadt said his body "welcomes the agreement reached by
 the Executive Board of the IMF" on the quota issue and asked it
to "submit before the end of this year a proposed resolution for
the approval of the Board of Governors to effect the agreed
increases in quotas."
</P>
<P>
The present total of IMF quotas would be increased by 45
percent, according to a communique issued at the end of a meeting
of the committee.
</P>
<P>
It said 75 percent of the overall increase would be distributed
 in proportion to present quotas, 15 percent distributed in
proportion to members' shares in calculated quotas (based on 1994
data), and the remaining 10 percent distributed among those
members whose present quotas are out of line with their positions
in the world.

<HEADLINE> PLA Personnel Asked To Study CPC Congress Documents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The General Political
Department of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) Saturday called
on PLA personnel and People's Armed Police (PAP) personnel to
conscientiously study the documents of the 15th National Congress
of the Communist Party of China.
</P>
<P>
In a circular distributed nationwide, the department said the
congress was a historic meeting held at a crucial time in the
country's reforms, opening up, and modernization drive, and was a
milestone in Party history.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Zemin's report to the congress, which was a historical
summary, outlines the plan for the future and makes a layout of the
country's development, and a political declaration and guiding
principle for the Party to lead the people into the new century,
the circular noted.
</P>
<P>
It said that designating the Deng Xiaoping Theory as the
Party's guiding ideology and its inclusion in the Party
Constitution by the congress is the will of the Party and the
aspiration of the people.
</P>
<P>
It emphasized that the new central leadership with Jiang Zemin
at the core will provide a strong organizational guarantee for
carrying China's cause from victory to victory.
</P>
<P>
The circular stressed that it is of paramount significance for
PLA and PAP personnel to conscientiously study the congress'
documents, because it will encourage them to hold the banner of
Deng Xiaoping Theory high, to unite around the Party central
leadership with Jiang Zemin at the core, and to reach a new level
of revolutionary military achievements, modernization and
standardization.
</P>
<P>
They are being asked to understand that the Party's third
generation of leaders with Jiang at the core are the faithful,
reliable, hard-working, and able inheritors of the cause of
building socialism with Chinese characteristics initiated by Deng
Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
The circular called on the armed forces to more conscientiously
adhere to CPC leadership and be firmly in line with the Party
Central Committee ideologically, politically and in deed.

<HEADLINE> Missiles to be Deployed in Cyprus: Russian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Russian Ambassador to Cyprus
has said that his country will ensure the Russian-made
surface-to-air missile system S-300, purchased by the Cyprus
government, be deployed in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
In an interview published here today in Greek Daily
Fileleftheros, Georgi Mouratov dismissed Turkish threats to attack
the island if the S-300 missiles are installed.
</P>
<P>
Mouratov said the contract signed between the government and
Russia for the purchase of the S-300 " concerns our bilateral
relations with the Republic of Cyprus".
</P>
<P>
"Nobody can intervene and violate international law,
threatening with the use of violence, or imposing views relating
to Russia's relations with third countries," he added.
</P>
<P>
Mouratov said Russia will ensure that the system be
deployed and dismissed Turkish threats to attack the island as
"more of a war of nerves, made to impress".
</P>
<P>
He clarified that the S-300, ordered by the Cyprus
government, is mainly a radar that will enable the Republic to
control flights within its air space.
</P>
<P>
"Statements that Cyprus will be able to attack Turkish
planes over Turkish territory are ridiculous," Mouratov stressed.
</P>
<P>
He also said that only a small number of Russian people
will need to come to Cyprus for a short period in order to
install the anti-aircraft system.
</P>
<P>
The Russian diplomat said his country wants to have close
the friendly relations with Turkey, but said it must be
understood Russia does not allow any country to intervene in its
internal issues.
</P>
<P>
Mouratov's statement came following Turkish Prime Minister
Mesut Yilmaz's threats of possible military measures to counter
the arrival in Cyprus of the S-300 missile system.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz was quoted as saying that deployment of the missiles
"directly threatens Turkey's security". Turkey could not "remain
indifferent in the face of this possibility", he added.
</P>
<P>
Greek Premier Costas Simitis has denounced Yilmaz's statement,
saying Greece would honor its joint defense pact with Cyprus
and would not allow Turkish threats to become reality.
</P>
<P>
But no Cypriot government official has so far come out
for comment on the Yilmaz's statement.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus and Greece signed a joint defense pact in 1993,
under which Greece pledges to join Cyprus in resisting any
possible military attack.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus announced in January this year its plan to buy S-300
missiles from Russia and their delivery will be made by mid-1998.
</P>
<P>
This eastern Mediterranean island has remained divided since
1974 when Turkish troops landed and took over 37 percent of
the island in the wake of a failed Greek Cypriot coup
seeking union with Greece.

<HEADLINE> Charter Changes After 1998 Elections: Ramos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel
Ramos said today that changes in the country's constitution will
take place only after the 1998 elections by the way of a
constitutional convention.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Ramos said delegates to the
convention must be elected simultaneously during the May 11, 1998,
national elections.
</P>
<P>
Ramos made the final decision to shelve plans for charter
changes after receiving the results of wide-ranging consultation
recently conducted by some of his cabinet members across the
country.
</P>
<P>
The results of the consultation, he said, was that perhaps a
most expeditious way to change the charter after 1998 is a
constitutional convention.
</P>
<P>
"The main issues that have to be discussed were not so much the
constitutional issues but the socio-economic condition of our
country because people (consulted) are involved and interested in
many things starting with their daily lives," Ramos said.
</P>
<P>
Ramos announced unexpectedly on Saturday that he will not run
for re-election and that the national and local elections would be
held in 1998 as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
"I say to you that, as the outgoing president, I will see to it
that there will be an orderly transfer of the presidency and all
its powers to my elected successor -- whoever he or she is," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Ramos' turnaround on the charter change, which was called for
by his supporters in an effort to extend his term, turned a
massive protest rally attended by hundreds of thousands of people
today into a peaceful thanks-giving gathering in which he was
praised for his new stance.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Defends Position on S. Leone Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's leadership position
in west Africa, as well as African tradition of being "our
brothers keeper", was the main factor that led to its
intervention in the Sierra Leonean crisis, President General Sani
Abacha said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"It is the only way we will effectively meet the domestic and
external demands as a leader in the sub-continent," Abacha told
the 44 regular course of the Nigeria Defense Academy in Kaduna,
northern Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
For this reason, he said, Nigeria has for the past few years
been undertaking significant re-organization of the armed forces
in order to create a cost effective, compact and mobile armed
forces that will be recognized for high professionalism and
combat readiness at all times.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian troops have played a key role in the west African
peacekeeping force known as ECOMOG which successfully brought
peace back to Liberia.
</P>
<P>
The force is now also involved in the resolution of the crisis
in Sierra Leone, where coupists overthrew the legitimate
government in May this year.
</P>
<P>
"There is no disputing the fact that the successful
performance of our troops in ECOMOG owed a great deal to their
glorious exploits and exemplary performance," Abacha noted.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that his administration places a high premium
not only on defense, sovereignty and territorial integrity of the
country, but also on national security.
</P>
<P>
National security is a prerequisite for the enthronement of
democracy in Nigeria, he said, adding that the government has put
in place measures to lay a solid foundation for a viable and
sustainable democratic rule next year.
</P>
<P>
According to the military government's transition plan, the
current administration will be handed over to an elected
government on October 1, 1998.
</P>
<P>
On the diplomatic front, Abacha said "While we have maintained
and will continue to maintain an open-door policy in relations
with our traditional allies, it has become imperative for us to
explore and open up new frontiers of positive and interactive
diplomacy."

<HEADLINE> Indian PM to Visit Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister Inder
Kumar Gujral will visit Uganda on October 4 to 5, at the
invitation of Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni in a bid to lure
foreign investment, local daily The Monitor reported today.
</P>
<P>
Uganda will be the second African country after Tanzania to be
visited by the Indian prime minister. After Uganda, Gujiral will
proceed to South Africa at the invitation of President Nelson
Mandela.
</P>
<P>
Gujral will be accompanied by a delegation of businessmen and
industrialists who will visit local factories.
</P>
<P>
Uganda and India have a long trade and social relationship. In
1972, however, the former Ugandan President Idi Amin expelled
more than 80,000 Asians, mostly Indians who controlled the core
investments in the country and gave their property to Africans.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, this policy of putting the economy in the hands
of Africans bungled and Uganda's once envied economy in the
region went down the drain, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
When Museveni came into power in 1986, he launched a campaign
to lure back the expelled and dispossessed Asians to Uganda. Many
of them have regained their property and the decaying factories
have been revived.
</P>
<P>
Now there are a number of heavy and light industrial factories
all over the country which are built by the new surge of Indian
investors.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Refuses to Identify Egypt's Decision on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Less than two months before the
controversial Fourth Middle East and North Africa Economic (MENA)
Conference is convened, President Hosni Mubarak still refused to
say whether Egypt will attend it or not.
</P>
<P>
Some Arab countries such as Saudi Arabia, the United Arab
Emirates, Lebanon and Syria have decided to boycott the conference
scheduled for November in the Qatari capital of Doha, to which
Israel is expected to be invited.
</P>
<P>
"I spoke about this matter before and I would only be repeating
myself if I talked about it now," Mubarak told reporters today
after inaugurating the second stage of the Cairo underground metro
second line.
</P>
<P>
The peace process is backtracking, he said, adding that Egypt is
waiting to see what will happen in Ras al-Amud, an Arab
neighborhood in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak's statement comes after Israeli-Palestinian relations
deteriorated further last Sunday when Israeli settlers moved into
two houses in Ras al-Amud.
</P>
<P>
He said Palestinian National Authority President Yasser Arafat
has described what is happening there and the Israeli announcement
of a settlement for this problem as a maneuver.
</P>
<P>
"We will just wait and see whether it is really a maneuver or
not," he added.
</P>
<P>
Although the Israelis withdrew under a compromise with Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the buildings remain under Israeli
control, further infuriating the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
In his earlier statements, Mubarak said Egypt's participation
in the regional economic forum involving Israel hinges on progress
in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
However, in a more clear-cut language perhaps for the first
time, a senior Egyptian official Saturday expressed opposition to
the convocation of the MENA conference.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt does not wish the conference would be held in a sisterly
Arab country like Qatar and then fail," Osama el-Baz, presidential
advisor for political affairs, told reporters here.
</P>
<P>
It will be "detrimental rather than beneficial" to convene the
conference under current circumstances, he said, adding that the
optimism over peace that prevailed the third MENA conference held
in Cairo last November is now regrettably missing in the region.
</P>
<P>
As a direct spinoff of the Mideast peace process, the annual
MENA conference had been held in Casablanca, Morocco; Amman,
Jordan; and Cairo, Egypt since 1994.
</P>
<P>
Most Arab countries have threatened to boycott it due to
Israel's participation. Qatar had been insisting on going ahead as
planned, refusing to link the summit with the peace process. But
emerging from a meeting held to forge a unified Arab stance
towards the MENA conference Saturday, Qatari Foreign Minister
Sheikh Hamad Ben Jassem Ben Jaber Al-Thani said his country also
believed that the conference would not secure the aspired success
unless a "tangible progress was made to the peace process and
Israel changes its current policy".
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministers of Syria, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Arab League
Secretary General Esmat Abdul-Meguid also attended the meeting on
the sidelines of the 108th session of the Arab League foregin
ministers council, which began on Saturday.

HANGZHOU, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Scholars from Japan, the
Republic of Korea and all over China attended the '97 China
Seminar on Dunhuang Studies recently in Hangzhou, the capital of
Zhejiang province.
</P>
<P>
They discussed classification and systematization of documents,
and the history, geography, religion, folk customs, science,
technology, literature, and art of Dunhuang and presented 40
research papers.
</P>
<P>
More than 60,000 ancient books and a large number of historical
relics were discovered in 1900 in the Mogao Caves in Dunhuang
Grottoes in northwest China's Gansu province, and they have had a
tremendous impact on archeology everywhere, since then.
</P>
<P>
Many of the relics were removed from China before New China was
founded in 1949, leading some scholars to note that "Dunhuang
studies are in foreign countries". But China has made progress in
Dunhuang studies in recent years, according to Ji Xianlin, a
famous expert on Dunhuang, who shares this view.
</P>
<P>
The academics also discussed how to celebrate the 100th

<P>
BEIRUT, September 21 (Xinhua) -- A man was killed and three
others injuried today as Lebanese interior forces tried to shut
down unlicensed radio and television stations in north Lebanon, a
radio report said.
</P>
<P>
The forces last night blockaded the building in the northern
port city of Tripoli of al-Helail TV and Voice of Rights Radio
stations, both associated with the Islamic Unity Group (IUG).
</P>
<P>
This morning the forces raided the building and confiscated
audio-visual equipment after parliament members and ministers
failed to ease the tensions between the forces and IUG supporters
who gathered outside the building to protest.
</P>
<P>
The raid led to clashes in which one IUG member was shot dead
and three others wounded after they threw stones toward the forces.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement issued by the interior forces, some 74
IUG members were arrested, including the son of the group's
leader.
</P>
<P>
Since the government decided on the closure of unlicensed radio
and television stations in July this year, more than 30 such
stations had been shut down.
</P>
<P>
But a handful of stations in the country's eastern and
northern provinces continue to operate in defiance of the ban,
including a number of pro-Hezbollah radio stations.

<HEADLINE> ECOMOG Bombs Freetown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Planes of the west African
peacekeeping force known as ECOMOG air shelled the Sierra Leonean
capital Freetown again on Saturday, dropping at least five bombs
on the harbor area.
</P>
<P>
No casualty was reported after the bombardment, the Sunday
Tribune said today.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG is mandated by west African leaders to impose an
economic embargo on Sierra Leone to press the ruling junta to
restore the civilian government it ousted in a coup in May this
year.
</P>
<P>
The force has launched several air raids to stop vessels
accused of unloading arms and ammunition at the port since the
embargo was enforced after west African leaders made the decision
at a summit last month.
</P>
<P>
The embargo is reported to have led to split in Sierra Leone's
ruling armed forces revolutionary council, whose 30 out of 40
members moved for the reinstatement of ousted President Ahmed
Tejan Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
Captain S. A. Musa, chief secretary of the Sierra Leonean
military government who moved the motion, reportedly cautioned at
a council meeting over the weekend that "we cannot run a country
when both local and international community are against us".
</P>
<P>
In addition to the emerging spread of diseases and food
shortage, the embargo has led to worsening economy in the
troubled country.
</P>
<P>
Latest report quoted Finance Ministry official as saying that
Sierra Leone continued to register a negative economic growth
since the coup in May, with a deficit of over 8.5 million U.S.
Dollars as of September 3 this year.
</P>
<P>
At peace time, the government generated 70 percent of its
revenue from customs. But customs operation has been grounded as
a result of non arrival of vessels after the coup, the official
said.
</P>
<P>
The closure of banks and other businesses worsened the
situation.

<HEADLINE> Greek Cypriots Pledged Goodwill to Enter Dialogue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot President Glafcos
Clerides said today that the Greek Cypriot side will enter a
dialog on security issues with the Turkish Cypriot side with good
will.
</P>
<P>
Clerides was referring to an agreed meeting between the Greek
and Turkish Cypriots, announced last Monday by U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright during a stop over here on her way back
to Washington after her Middle East tour.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to reporters, President Clerides expressed hope
the Turkish Cypriot side will also show good will.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot president called security as "one of the
fundamental issues" of the Cyprus problem and said he expects an
initiative for an overall settlement after the presidential
elections in Cyprus in February 1998.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that his ultimate aim is "the reunification of
the island, the removal of Turkish troops occupying 37 percent of
its territory since they invaded in 1974, the safeguarding of
human rights and the peaceful coexistence of all communities".
</P>
<P>
Clerides expressed optimism that a peaceful settlement of the
Cyprus problem will be reached, with the help of Greece and a
joint defense pact between the two countries signed in 1993, as
well as the efforts of overseas Hellenes and foreign countries and
personalities.
</P>
<P>
Two rounds of U.N.-led direct peace talks between Clerides and
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash, held in the U.S. and
Switzerland in July and August, ended in failure as Denktash
refused to further negotiate a settlement unless the European
Union freezes its scheduled accession talks with Cyprus early 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus problem has remained unresolved since 1974 when
Turkish troops landed on the island and took over the northern
third in the wake of a failed pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. and international community have been trying for
decades to reunite the island as a bi-communal, bi-zonal
federation through peace talks, but so far no tangible results
have been achieved.

<HEADLINE> Thai Official Says Stock Market Restriction Necessary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Imposing some restrictions
on foreign capital flowing into Thailand's stock market is
necessary at the present stage, a Thai official said here today.
</P>
<P>
While proper use of foreign capital is helpful to domestic
economic development, it is also important to retain some control
measures "if you are facing a financial crisis", said Prasarn
Trairatvorakul, deputy secretary general of the Thai Securities
and Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at a seminar on Asian stock markets, which
was part of a series of related events prior to the annual
meetings of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund to
be held on September 23-25.
</P>
<P>
Describing liberalization of capital flows on stock markets as
a "long-term trend", Prasarn said restrictions will eventually be
removed so as to ensure higher capital efficiency.
</P>
<P>
But many Asian stock markets including the Thai market are
still vulnerable to unexpected changes, and they have to
experience a transition period, he said.
</P>
<P>
Some sectors in Asian countries are fragile and they need
"certain level of protection" in order to keep "social harmony",
he said.
</P>
<P>
"In such a transition period, some restrictions have to be
retained," he said, adding that the problem is how to manage the
transition.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government now imposes a maximum 49 percent on foreign
shareholding. In some sectors such as banking and finance, the
limit is 25 percent.

<HEADLINE> Indian Government, Suzuki Fail to Settle Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government and
Japan's Suzuki Motor Corporation on Saturday failed to resolve
their dispute over the appointment of a new managing director for
their car-making joint venture, Maruti Udyog Limited, the local
press said today.
</P>
<P>
After three-and-half hours of talks on the suggestion of the
Delhi High Court, both sides sticked to their hardline position.
</P>
<P>
The dispute flared up on August 27 when the board of Maruti
Udyog Limited decided to appoint RSSLN Bhaskarudu, an Indian
government nominee, as new managing director of the 50:50
Indian-Japanese joint venture.
</P>
<P>
Strongly opposing the appointment of Bhaskarudu, Suzuki
contended that as per its agreement with the Indian government,
the appointment of managing director could be made only on
obtaining concurrence from the Japanese side.
</P>
<P>
Suzuki filed a petition in the Delhi High Court in a bid to
stay the appointment of Bhaskarudu as managing director of the
joint venture.
</P>
<P>
At a hearing on Friday, the court reserved its order on the
Suzuki plea till Monday this week and suggested that the parties
concerned resolve their dispute through talks.
</P>
<P>
During the talks on Saturday, the Indian Industry Ministry
representatives made it clear that there was no question of
reconsideration of Bhaskarudu's appointment while the Japanese
side persisted with its demand for appointing a
mutually-acceptable government nominee.
</P>
<P>
Failing to settle their dispute, both sides said they would
report to the Delhi High Court which will resume hearing of the
case tomorrow.

CAIRO, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National

reports that President Yasser Arafat was suffering from bad health.
</P>
<P>
After seeing Arafat off at Cairo Airport, Kedra told reporters
that the Palestinian leader was in good health.
</P>
<P>
"Claims about his deteriorating health condition were mere
Israeli rumors," he said, adding that "Arafat was discharging his
many duties regularly and accurately."
</P>
<P>
Israeli media have claimed that Arafat was no longer able to
handle his duties because of failing health and the selection of a
successor to him has been prompted.
</P>
<P>
Rumors here also had it that doctors were called in to attend
to Arafat after he suffered an illness on his visit here.
</P>
<P>
Arafat left here this morning for Gaza at the close of a
three-day visit to Egypt, where he delivered a speech at the
inaugural session of the 108th Arab League Foreign Ministers
Council meeting.
</P>
<P>
In the speech, he called for a united Arab stand to suspend
improving relations with Israel and urged the United States to
play a more active role in pressuring the Netanyahu government to
stop provocative and unilateral acts that jeopardize the peace
process.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Urges Governments to Guard against Banking Risks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Senior Vice-President and
Chief Economist of the World Bank Joseph Stiglitz today warned
governments against risks from underregulating the banking sector.
</P>
<P>
"Although the dangers of overregulation are substantial, we
also must avoid the other extreme of underregulating banks," he
said in a key-note speech to a World Bank seminar on Building
Better Banking here today.
</P>
<P>
He said that in particular, governments must pay more attention
to designing better incentives and legal systems including
auditing standards that encourage bank owners, bank managers, and
their clients to take an active part in self-monitoring and
self-regulating.
</P>
<P>
Developing countries in particular are prone to economy-wide
shocks because their production is less diverse, their policy more
volatile, and their terms of trade subject to greater shocks, he
said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, developing countries have fewer
risk-absorbing institutions and less risk absorption capacity
within risk management institutions.
</P>
<P>
"In combination with a fragile financial system, this can send
these economies into a vicious circle in which the initial shock
triggers banking problems which in turn exacerbate the shock," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"For developing countries it may be necessary to have higher
capital requirements," he said, adding that different situations
should be taken into account in all areas of policy-making.
</P>
<P>
He said the stability of the banking system is an important
goal, but it is not the only objective.
</P>
<P>
The nature of the regulatory structure needs to be tuned to
capacities of countries as well as the nature of the risks being
faced, he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that governments must play an essential role in the
regulation of the financial system.
</P>
<P>
Understanding and promoting the necessary reforms will be one
of the World Bank's most vital jobs over the next decade, Stiglitz
said.

<HEADLINE> IMF Lending to Low Income Countries Fruitful: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Developments in the 36
low-income countries supported by the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) through the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF)
in the last one or two years are very encouraging, according to an
IMF report here today.
</P>
<P>
The report, entitled "IMF Lending to Low-Income Countries -- 10
Years Experience," said that the countries undertaking programs of
adjustment and reform have brought their economies a long way from
the doldrums of the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Real per-capita output growth among non-transition ESAF users
has, on average, caught up with that in other developing
countries, it said.
</P>
<P>
The social indicators in most of these countries have improved,
budget deficits have been trimmed and instances of very high
inflation almost eliminated.
</P>
<P>
The improving trend has also helped narrow the gap between
growth in ESAF users and other developing countries, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
For instance, in the early 1980s, annual average per-capita
growth in non-ESAF developing countries exceeded that in
non-transition ESAF countries by around 2.2 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
But this differential had been more than halved to 0.9 points
by 1995, it said.
</P>
<P>
The 36 low-income nations, or ESAF users include 30
non-transition countries -- 22 in Africa, four in Asia, four in
South America -- and six transition economies.
</P>
<P>
The non-transition countries in the CFA Franc zone have
succeeded in maintaining inflation consistently in the low single
digit range since the mid-1980s, it said.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the report also admitted that on average, only
half of the targeted reduction in primary budget deficits was
achieved.
</P>
<P>
The report suggested that the ESAF countries adopt an
adjustment strategy to raise saving rates, secure macro-economic
stability, liberalize and open economies to foreign trade, reduce
government intervention and promote well-functioning markets.

<HEADLINE> World Bank's IFC Eager to Work with New Clients </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The International Finance
Corporation (IFC), a member of the World Bank Group, is eager to
reach new countries, develop new products and work with new
clients, a senior IFC official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference, IFC Executive Vice-President
Jannik Lindbaek said that the 1997 fiscal year was a year of
innovation and change for the corporation with its activities in
more countries and development of more products than ever before.
</P>
<P>
"We are crossing new frontiers, diversifying our product mix,
and shifting our focus away from the countries where we are less
relevant to those where we are more needed," Lindbaek said.
</P>
<P>
The IFC's strategy is to "reach new countries, develop new
products, and work with new clients," he said.
</P>
<P>
The IFC, he said, was ready to center its future efforts on the
spheres of infrastructure, environment, technical assistance and
advisory services, privatization, extending IFC's reach, capital
markets, increased coverage of stock markets and support for micro
finance.
</P>
<P>
To finance its lending program, the IFC borrowed a total of
approximately four billion U.S. dollars in the 1997 fiscal year,
almost all of which was accessed through the international capital
market, and approved investments in most major infrastructure
subsectors including transport service, utilities, power, and
telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
The IFC is the private sector arm of the World Bank Group and
the largest multilateral source of equity and loan financing for
private sector projects in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Since its establishment just over 41 years ago, the IFC's
syndication program has placed participation of nearly 14 billion
U.S. dollars with some 380 financial institutions.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Two Egyptians were hanged
this morning in Kuwaiti Central Prison after being found guilty of
murdering a Kuwaiti citizen in 1996.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by Kuwaiti Interior Ministry said the two
Egyptians Hamdi Abdel Azim and Hassan Abdel Haditwo were found
guilty of killing Bader Al-Walaan, a Kuwaiti citizen, in 1996 and
disposing of his body in a deserted mosque.
</P>
<P>
In Kuwait, death punishment must obtain ratification from the
Amir of the country.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the death sentence against the two men was
ratified by the Amir Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah after the two
were sentenced to death by the Criminal Court and the Court of
Cassation, the highest judicial authority in the country.
</P>
<P>
Today's executions bring to eight the number of capital
punishment sentences carried out in Kuwait since the country's

killing a Kuwaiti border guard while resisting arrest, was
carried out in May 1993.
</P>
<P>
The previous execution was carried out in September 1996 when a
Kuwaiti interior ministry officer Bader Abdel Karim Sultan

<HEADLINE> Likud Calls for Forming National Unity Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Justice Minister
Tzahi Hanegbi has publicly voiced his support to forming a
national unity government to solve the current crisis facing the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Israel Radio Saturday night, Hanegebi said
such a unity government was "a necessity." He said that Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and opposition Labor Party leader Ehud
Barak have ways to discuss this issue even before an official
invitation for such a move is actually issued.
</P>
<P>
Hanegbi, who forms Netanyahu's hard-core support within the
Cabinet together with Health Minister Yehoshua Matza and Science
Minister Michael Eitan, added that he believed Netanyahu and
Barak could reach agreement on major issues in this regard.
</P>
<P>
The idea of a broad government was first explored jointly by
National Infrastructure Minister Ariel Sharon and Labor's former
Prime Minister Shimon Peres following Netanyahu's election
victory last year.
</P>
<P>
The initiative was dismissed at that time across the political
spectrum as a last-ditch attempt by both to salvage their personal
political fortunes. However, it re-surfaced in the wake of the
recent wave of terror attacks in Jerusalem that worsened the peace
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on television following the September 4 suicide
bombings, lawmaker Yehuda Harel of the coalition party The Third
Way said a unity government was "inevitable," adding that the only
question was whether it would be formed before or after "the next
disaster."
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said that a Labor-Likud coalition now appears
more possible than it seemed immediately after Netanyahu's rise to
power last June, considering that Netanyahu has since dealt openly
with the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) and its president,
Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Netanyahu's talk this year of an "Allon-Plus" deal
on a permanent settlement between Israel and the PNA signaled a
break from traditional Likud dogma on territorial compromise, and
brought him at least theoretically closer to Barak's views.
</P>
<P>
Within Labor, Barak's major ally Uzi Baram last week softened
his previously uncompromising opposition to a national unity
government, saying there may be circumstances under which he would
espouse the idea.
</P>
<P>
The Middle East peace process has been mired in crisis since
Israel began building the Har Homa settlement in Arab East
Jerusalem in March. The recent terrorist attacks against Israel
and the dispute over Ras Al-Amud Jewish settlement project
deepened the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Peres, however, publicly denied the possibility of forming a
unity government in a speech Saturday night to the Foreign Press
Association in Jerusalem. He blasted Netanyahu for trying to make
peace without any price, warning that a war would be a more
expensive price to pay for Israel.
</P>
<P>
Till now, Barak has also ruled out joining a unity government.
The former Army Chief of Staff has said that his only aim was to
topple and replace the Likud government.

<HEADLINE> Former Philippine President: No Way for Charter Change </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Former Philippine President
Corazon Aquino today called for every effort to stop Charter
change moves seeking to extend the term of President Fidel Ramos.
</P>
<P>
Addressing to participants of a massive protest rally against
Charter changes in Luneta Park, Manila, she said she would tell
the people who wants to stay in power by martial law or Charter
changes "no way and never again".
</P>
<P>
The former president praised Ramos for his efforts in
establishing political stability, achieving economic prosperity
and restoring the confidence of the country throughout the world.
But meanwhile, she urged him to step down as his term ends next
year.
</P>
<P>
"Trust the good people of the our country to continue your good
work. I trusted you when my term was over, trust in the
Filipinos," she said.
</P>
<P>
Catholic Church leader Cardinal Jaime Sin said the Charter
change moves, causing divisiveness in the country, are "immoral"
and will benefit only some individuals. He urged Ramos to turn
over his power peacefully in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The rally, attended by Cardinal Sin, Vice President Joseph
Estrada, congressmen, local government leaders and some one
million people, was held peacefully despite warnings that it would
be bombed by saboteurs and the efforts the government made to
prepare for the worst.
</P>
<P>
Protest rallies against Charter changes were also held
peacefully in other parts of the country on the same day.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the rally, Ramos said on Saturday that he would step
down next year and "would not run for re-election," stunning many
people who believe he would seek a second term through Charter
changes.
</P>
<P>
"I am fully satisfied with having served as your president for
one six-year term as mandated in the constitution," Ramos said.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Buy Saudi Arabian Oil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 21 (Xinhua) -- South Africa is
expecting to sell arms to Saudi Arabia in exchange for oil from
the gulf state, local daily Sunday Tribune reported today.
</P>
<P>
Pretoria has offered to buy oil from Saudi Arabia as a
counter-trade arrangement in the seven billion Rand (148 million
U.S. Dollars) arms deal which is about to be finalized with
Riyadh, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Local observers believe that the move to import oil from Saudi
Arabia is an indication that the South African government wants
to reduce its reliance on Iran, which currently provides more
than two-thirds of this country's fuel imports.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia's Second Deputy Premier, Defense and Aviation
Minister Abdul-Aziz al Saud arrived in Cape Town on Wednesday for
a six-day state visit, during which he was expected to meet
President Nelson Mandela and Deputy President Thabo Mbeki.
</P>
<P>
He is also scheduled to meet South African Defense Minister
Joe Modise and Minister of Mineral and Energy Affairs Penuell
Maduna.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the Saudis were negotiating to buy G-6
mobile artillery pieces and anti-aircraft missiles from South
Africa in what will be the biggest deal in the history of the
defense history of this country.
</P>
<P>
Mandela is scheduled to visit Saudi Arabia in November, which
will be his third visit to the kingdom since his release from
jail in 1990.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The endorsement at 15th
National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party of the "Deng
Xiaoping Theory" as the nation's guiding ideology for the next
five years is most significant, local English-language newspaper
"the Jerusalem Post" said today.
</P>
<P>
In its editorial entitled "China's Power and People," the paper
said, "President Jiang Zemin has frequently been underestimated in
the West but last week he put in place a considerable economic
powerhouse around him."
</P>
<P>
Commenting on China's political system, the paper said, "no one
any longer has a definitive answer to the right systems for
diverse developing nations. No single stiff collar fits all
necks."
</P>
<P>
China is carrying out a fascinating economic experiment and
deserves all good will for that, it said, adding that Jiang's
outline plans to dismantle and reform China's ancient industries,
such as mergers, downsizing, stock floatations, all under Communist
Party guidance.
</P>
<P>
"China has been as good as its word on Hong Kong. The world
should give Jiang a chance and real encouragement on his economic
reform too," it added.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Calls for National Unity Before Opposition Rally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel
Ramos today called for national unity about two hours before a
massive protest rally against Charter change moves starts in Metro
Manila.
</P>
<P>
In an arrival statement from a four-nation visit, Ramos said
the Philippines could become a more powerful economy by the 21st
century if the Filipinos do not allow their economic gains to be
eroded by politically-inspired divisiveness and factionalism.
</P>
<P>
"The past five years have shown that we can achieve the destiny
that Jose Rizal and our other great heroes, including Ninoy
Aquino, had envisioned for all of us, if we work together, and not
against each other; If we speak with reason, and not anger; If we
have faith in one another, and not mistrust," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ramos hoped today's scheduled rally would go on peacefully so
that the people can all go back to work and strive together harder
than ever for "a better future for the country and the people."
</P>
<P>
Analysts said charter change moves seeking to extend the term
of Ramos is causing divisiveness and political uncertainty in the
country, prompting church leaders to call for the protest rally.
</P>
<P>
In the past few months, Ramos had kept everyone guessing
whether he would stay in power or step down when his term ends in
June next year. The Constitution allows him to serve only a
six-year single term.
</P>
<P>
Although he promised Friday that he would not run for a second
term and has urged the stopping of charter change moves, he failed
to stop anti-charter change people from taking to the streets
today.

<HEADLINE> Zambia to Rehabilitate Two Main Airports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government is
looking for 51 million U.S. Dollars to rehabilitate the
Livingstone and Ndola airports to internationally accepted
standards, Sunday Times of Zambia reported today.
</P>
<P>
The two airports have been identified for rehabilitation
because of a growing potential and an anticipated tourism boom.
</P>
<P>
The runway in use at Livingstone Airport built in the early
1950s has a restricted load bearing capacity and the length for a
Boeing 737.
</P>
<P>
The airport in the south of Zambia has no hangars nor terminal
buildings and taxiway while Ndola airport in the north needs
expansion for the provision of more cargo warehouses, offices and
hangars.
</P>
<P>
Livingstone alone needs 36 million dollars and Ndola needs 15
million dollars for their rehabilitation, according to Jimmy
Zulu, assistant secretary for air in the Ministry of
Communication and Transport.
</P>
<P>
"The improvements are necessary for us to compete favorably
with our Zimbabwean counterparts to support the tourism industry
in the region," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ndola needs expansion as indications are showing an increase
in traffic because of the on-going privatization of Zambia
Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM), Zulu said.
</P>
<P>
The rehabilitation work will take 36 months to compete
for Livingstone and 24 months for Ndola airport when funds are
available.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait to Start Hunting Illegal Migrants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait is to start a
nationwide campaign to hunt foreign nationals illegally living in
the country ahead of the December Gulf Cooperation Council summit.
</P>
<P>
Informed official sources said today that a meeting was held by
senior Interior Ministry officials over the weekend to discuss
security preparations for the summit and instruct security forces
to launch a search campaign against illegal expatriates.
</P>
<P>
They said security officers were asked to comb various areas
for suspected infiltrators and illegals until the GCC summit is
held.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the sources said, the Ministry of Interior has
instructed directors of the immigration departments of Kuwait's
five governorates to adopt strict measures in granting visas to
nationals of Arab countries which sided with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Large number of foreign nationals, mainly from neighboring
countries, flocked into Kuwait to seek jobs. Constant search for
illegal Arab and Asian laborers have been conducted in the country
which hosts 1.25 million foreigners.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait's Interior Ministry arrested 416 infiltrators who
illegally entered the country during the first half of 1997,
official figures showed.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait courts traditionally jail illegal migrants for six
months before they are deported at their own expense out of the
country.
</P>
<P>
This campaign coincided with increased efforts to crack down on
illegal migrants in other Gulf Arab countries such as Saudi Arabia
and the United Arab Emirates.
</P>
<P>
The UAE will start searching for illegal migrants after a
five-month amnesty allowing them to leave ends late this month.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia started raids on illegal migrants this month in
order to drive out 100,000 illegal aliens from the kingdom.

<HEADLINE> New Frontier of Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Asian businessmen find that
Africa, increasingly referred to as the new frontier of global
investment, has brought them with ample opportunities along with
some difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Conrad Strauss, moderator of a World Bank seminar on
Opportunities for Asian Investors in Africa, said today that
Africa may be small in global perspective, but it is neither small
in geographic and demographic term, nor small in economic
potential.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank estimates that private investment, which rose
from less than one billion US dollars in the early 1990s to 11.7
billion US dollars in 1996, now accounts for about 45 percent of
the total capital flow into Africa.
</P>
<P>
Cha Chi Ming, a Hong Kong textile industrialist, shared his
30-year experience of business expansion in Africa with
participants at the seminar, held prior to the annual meetings of
the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) scheduled
for September 23-25 in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"I represent people who learned their trade in Asia and
deployed their lessons in Africa," said Cha, whose family company
built first textile plant in Nigeria in 1964, and ever since, has
expanded factories to Ghana and Togo and been profitable in each
of the 33 years.
</P>
<P>
"It is best to assist by investing in their local industries,
thereby creating a thriving economy rather than providing aid from
time to time," he said.
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that there is a need to nourish and protect
growing economies since most African countries do not have a big
enough local market.
</P>
<P>
"These fences will not be a permanent feature and will come
down when the local economies and industries are strong enough to
stand on their own," said the businessman, who won the Grand
Bauhinia Medal, the highest award in the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR).
</P>
<P>
Joseph Gondobintoro, chairman of a Singapore-based company
which has recently been active in Africa, summed up his experience
by saying that there are ample opportunities in African countries,
yet potential investors should take time to make in-depth studies
of viable markets.
</P>
<P>
Problems do arise, he said, from differences in cultures and
lifestyles between Africa and Asia, such as local people's
suspicion of foreigners and rampant lower-level bureaucratic
interference.
</P>
<P>
Gondobintoro mentioned two factors critical to the success of
investment -- seeking a reliable local partner and understanding
local government operation.
</P>
<P>
Other speakers at the discussion agreed that abundant natural
resources, coupled with the recent deregulation and privatization
process, make Africa an attractive market to investors.
</P>
<P>
But much has to be done to achieve a broad-based economic
growth. Governments need to build adequate infrastructure, develop
financial sectors, and maintain social and political stability,
they said.

<HEADLINE> Croatia Condemns Mostar Car Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Croatian Foreign Minister Mate
Granic today strongly condemned Thursday's car bombing in Mostar,
describing it as a form of the most ruthless terrorist activity
launched against the consolidation and peace process of Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The terrorists are trying to hamper the implementation of the
agreements signed last month in Split, a coastal city of Croatia,
between Croat President Franjo Tudjman and President of the
Bosnian Presidency Alija Izetbegovic, said Granic.
</P>
<P>
A powerful explosion, which went off near the police station in
the Croat-controlled western Mostar, injured 50 people.
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred shortly after the signing of the
agreements which adopted complaints of the Bosnian Croat political
leadership and the local elections in Bosnia, particularly in
Mostar.
</P>
<P>
Croat Defense Minister Gojko Susak, Co-president of the Bosnian
Council of Ministers Neven Tomic and Bosnian Foreign Minister
Jadranko Prlic today also issued a statement, calling the
terrorist attack "another attempt aimed at destablizing the peace
process in Bosnia-Herzegovina."

<HEADLINE> MIGA Issues Record Guarantee Contracts in Fiscal 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hong Kong, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The Multilateral Investment
Guarantee Agency (MIGA) said here today that it issued a record 70
guarantee contracts for 614 million U.S. dollars in new coverage
for projects in 25 developing countries in fiscal 1997 that ended
on June 30.
</P>
<P>
The 293 guarantee contracts issued by MIGA, a member of the
World Bank Group, have benefited 52 developing and transition
countries so far, MIGA said in its Annual Report available today.
</P>
<P>
Estimates of the developmental impact of the MIGA's fiscal 1997
projects include the creation of about 4,000 jobs and facilitation
of approximately 4.7 billion U.S. dollars in foreign direct
investments in the developing countries where they were located,
the document said.
</P>
<P>
Since its founding in April 1988, MIGA has facilitated an
estimated 20 billion U.S. dollars in foreign direct investments
and has helped to generate approximately 40,000 new jobs in the 52
host countries where the projects are located.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference here today, Akira Iida, executive
vice-president of MIGA, said that the Agency is optimistic about
chances of increasing operations in China, especially in China's
coastal provinces.
</P>
<P>
The objective of MIGA is to encourage the flow of investments
for productive purposes among member countries, in particular to
developing countries, by issuing guarantees against non-commercial
risks for foreign direct investments.

<HEADLINE> Experts Call for Diversification in Banking Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 21 (Xinhua) -- A number of international
banking experts today urged banks to diversify their risks in
financial business in order to avoid possible shocks.
</P>
<P>
Experts attending a seminar on "Building Better Banking" here
today agreed that the issue of banking system fragility has moved
to the top of the international agenda and diversification will
play an important role in preventing systematic problems in the
banking sector.
</P>
<P>
The seminar, attended by more than 200 senior officials,
bankers and researchers, was part of a series of seminars prior to
the annual meetings of the World Bank and International Monetary
Fund (IMF) scheduled for September 23-25 in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Analyzing the current currency upheavals in Southeast Asia,
Gerard Caprio, a World Bank economist, and Berry Wilson, senior
economist at the U.S. Federal Communications Commission, pointed
out that lack of diversification is part of the causes leading to
the Thai Baht crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Thai financial sector may consequently be vulnerable to
further economic shocks following the Baht devaluation, the two
experts said.
</P>
<P>
Although insufficient diversification is not the only reason
for bank failure, it will be safer for banks to lend in a
diversified pattern, instead of in a concentrated way, they said.
</P>
<P>
"If authorities focus on what they can do to ensure that
bankers are motivated to diversify their risks, and indeed that
they devote significant attention to planning for various shocks
to their balance sheets, then the next 15 years should see far
fewer banking crises than have been experienced in the preceding
ones," the experts said.

<HEADLINE> Reform Papers to Be Distributed to Kenya's Envoys </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government will
distribute to its diplomatic missions worldwide the reform
package recommended by the Inter-Parties Parliamentary Group
(IPPG), the Sunday Nation reported today.
</P>
<P>
The weekly paper quoted Kenyan Foreign Minister Kalonzo
Musyoka as saying Friday that the move was aimed at helping make
Kenya's trading partners understand fully the reform progress
being made by the government.
</P>
<P>
He said that mass actions including the Saba Saba (July 7) and
Nane Nane (August 8) organized by the opposition lobby group the
National Convention Executive Council (NCEC) had given the
country a bad image abroad.
</P>
<P>
Musyoka made the remarks when he received copies of the
proposals presented by IPPG Secretary George Anyona who is the
Chairman of the opposition Kenya Social Congress.
</P>
<P>
The minister pointed out that Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
fully supported the IPPG initiatives on reforms, adding that the
government was open and ready to hold discussions with those with
divergent views for the sake of a united nation.
</P>
<P>
Anyona noted that the IPPG recommendations had created a lot
of interest locally and abroad with foreign missions and tour
operators requesting copies of the reform proposals.

<HEADLINE> SADC not Splitting: Zimbabwean Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Nathan Shamuyarira,
Zimbabwean Minister of Industry and Commerce Saturday brushed
aside rumours of a split in the Southern African Development
Community (SADC) as being unfounded.
</P>
<P>
He told the Sunday Mail that Zimbabwe would be strengthening
its position in the region, ready to take advantage of present
initiatives to achieve greater regional economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Following the SADC meeting in Blantyre, Malawi where member
countries agreed to ratify the trade protocol, Zimbabwe had had
the protocol approved by cabinet and it will now be taken to the
parliament next week for ratification. Ratification of the
protocol by all member states would be a sign that all nations
are committed to stronger and freer trade among themselves.
</P>
<P>
"SADC is getting strong. This is shown by the fact that we
had two members joining at the Blantyre meeting -- the Democratic
Republic of Congo and the Seychelles-- while a third, Madagascar,
has applied and will be considered at the next summit", said the
minister.
</P>
<P>
Reports of a split in SADC emerged after the Blantyre summit
where Zimbabwe and South Africa differed on the role of a SADC
organ on defense and politics. South Africa was reported to be
pushing for the organ to be swallowed up by SADC while Zimbabwe
preferred that it continued to hold its own meetings.
</P>
<P>
"The general feeling is that it should be kept separate and
parallel with SADC because there are a number of issues
pertaining to defense and politics that can't be handled by an
economic body like SADC," said Shamuyarira.

<HEADLINE> South Asia's Continued Growth Calls for Further Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Speakers at seminars prior
to the annual meetings of the World Bank and International
Monetary Fund here, today took pride in South Asia's relatively
high growth rate in recent years, but urged further reforms and
infrastructure development.
</P>
<P>
During the past decade, South Asia has been the second fastest
growing region in the world after East Asia, with an average
annual growth of over five percent thanks to sweeping economic
reforms across the region, they noted.
</P>
<P>
India, the giant in the region, has seen a seven percent growth
for the third year in a row.
</P>
<P>
At today's session entitled "South Asia: The Next Miracle?",
speakers reviewed the crucial factors that lie behind the
remarkable rates of growth in East Asia to see what South Asia can
learn from its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
John Williamson, chief economist at the World Bank, summarized
seven key factors as contributing to East Asia's success,
including macro-economic stability, high domestic savings,
export-led growth, universal education and high foreign investment
inflows.
</P>
<P>
His views were shared by Surjit Bhalla, president of India's
Oxus Research and Investment, and Lal Jayawardena, advisor to the
president and deputy chairman of Sri Lanka's National Development
Council.
</P>
<P>
Jayawardena also laid emphasis on two priorities high on the
agenda of South Asian countries -- labor market reform and
agriculture reform -- to ensure continued growth.
</P>
<P>
At a session Saturday, the first day of four days of seminars
organized by the World Bank and the IMF, Deputy President Kenji
Yoshizawa of the Bank of Tokyo urged India to accelerate
infrastructure development.
</P>
<P>
Japanese investment in India since 1991 has been a mere 1.5
billion US dollars, in sharp contrast with the 23 billion US
dollars pouring into China, Yoshizawa noted. The Japanese's main
concern lies in India's poor physical infrastructure, he said.
</P>
<P>
Richard Fisher, chairman of the executive committee at the
international investment bank Morgan Stanley, commented that it is
necessary for India to further improve its financial market
infrastructure so as to attract foreign investors.

<HEADLINE> "El Nino" to Last Until March of 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, September 20 (Xinhua) -- This year's "El Nino" climate
phenomenon with intense characteristics will last until March
of 1998, Peru's National Agrarian University (UNA) said today.
</P>
<P>
The university said that the "El Nino" 1997 phenomenon was not
detected on time because the anomaly in the temperature of the
Pacific Ocean waters off the Peruvian coast occurred first under
the surface at a depth between 80 and 250 meters.
</P>
<P>
No evident temperature increases were noticed at the surface
during the first few months of the year until May.
</P>
<P>
The sudden changes in the ocean temperature caused a variation
in the areas of distribution of most marine species.
</P>
<P>
The UNA considered that the phenomenon will acquire full
maturity and bring rains to South America in October and November.
</P>
<P>
El Nino appeared in the Equatorial Pacific, near South America,
because the winds, which normally blow from east to west, changed
direction, bringing warmer waters from the west to South American
coasts.
</P>
<P>
Previous experiences show that the water gets warmer below the
surface and later the warming extends upward to lesser depths.
</P>
<P>
A similar mechanism occurs during the phenomenon recession,
because deep waters cool first and some days later, because of new
upward movements, the cooling reaches shallower waters.
</P>
<P>
Because of the thermal inertia of the water, its temperature
does not change rapidly, so the anomaly in the temperature tend to
persist during several months.

<HEADLINE> New Maize Varieties to Boost Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Agriculture Minister
Darius Mbela has released eight new maize varieties which will
bring the hope for farmers in arid and semi-arid areas of the
country to produce food for their needs.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Standard today quoted the minister as saying Friday
that farmers from the dry parts of the country would have an
opportunity to produce maize to satisfy domestic needs.
</P>
<P>
The new Dryland Hybrid DH01 and DH02 is suitable for low
altitude, has better tolerance for drought and better
standability, and has 15 to 20 percent higher yield than ordinary
variety.
</P>
<P>
Pan 5195 variety suitable for medium altitude is
drought-tolerant and resistant to maize streak virus while Cagril
C 5222 variety suitable for medium altitude has good yields and
good standability with low ear placement.
</P>
<P>
The new maize varieties have been developed by four Kenyan
companies, that is, Kenya Seeds Company Ltd., Oil Crop
Development, Cargil and Pioneer.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that seed industry had been fully
liberalized by the government and any seed company, whether local
or foreign, was free to undertake seed research, breeding,
multiplication and marketing.
</P>
<P>
Following the liberalization of the seed industry, the Kenyan
government has set up Kenya Plant Health Inspectorate Service
which is in charge of all seed quality in the country two thirds
of which is arid and semi-arid land.

<HEADLINE> Tamil Parties Urge President to Carry on Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's Tamil political
parties have reaffirmed their support to the government's peace
process and urged President Chandrika Kumaratunga to ignore the
extremists' attempts to disrupt the peace initiatives, local press
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The reports quoted Tamil United Liberation Front (TULF)
President Murugesu Sivasithamparam as saying that whenever there
was a healthy approach to the ethnic issue, the extremist forces
were all out to destroy it.
</P>
<P>
"Past events remain a good lesson for the present generation of
politicians to take meaningful steps in solving the ethnic crisis.
We earnestly urge the president to stand by her peace initiatives
to end the ethnic conflict," the party leader said.
</P>
<P>
He was commenting on an interim report of the Sinhala
Commission published on Wednesday, which rekindled a political
controversy across the nation by opposing the devolution proposals
of the government.
</P>
<P>
Under the proposals, more autonomy would be given to the
northern and eastern provinces, where the Tamil rebels have been
fighting a guerrilla war for a separate state since 1983.
</P>
<P>
Savumyamoorthy Thondaman, leader of the Ceylon Workers
Congress, said that the extremist forces spoilt the peace attempts
whenever they surfaced in the political arena. He urged the
president to go ahead with the government's peace moves and ignore
the extremists.
</P>
<P>
D. Sitharthan of the People's Liberation Organization of Tamil
Eelam said the current peace package is the only hope for the
Tamils.
</P>
<P>
He added that the report of the Sinhala Commission, a political
organization headed by former Supreme Court Judge S. W. Walpita,
will definitely harm the genuine peace efforts. He expressed the
hope that the president will overcome such obstacles.
</P>
<P>
Some other politicians also voiced their support to the
devolution proposals of the president and criticized the interim
report.

<HEADLINE> Iran Arrests an Editor-in-Chief on Spying Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The editor-in-chief of local
English language daily Iran News has been arrested on charges of
spying for Iran's arch enemy, the United States, the Kayhan Havaia
weekly reported today.
</P>
<P>
The weekly, believed to have good connection with Iranian
intelligence, said that Morteza Firoozi had been arrested by
Iranian security officers a few weeks ago - no exact date was
given.
</P>
<P>
The chief of the editing board of the three-year-old daily,
widely-believed a "liberal" newspaper, had also been advisor to a
top government official, said the report, without specifying.
</P>
<P>
However, there is no official information about the arrest.
</P>
<P>
S. Bozorgmehr, one of the executive editors of daily, told
Xinhua on telephone that it was the first time for him to hear of
the news.
</P>
<P>
He was informed that Firoozi had gone to Britain for study,
Bozorgmehr added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kayhan Havaia noted that Iran News had failed to
observe obvious national interests. One of the daily's executive
editors also represents America's Cable News Networks (CNN) in
Iran.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Faraj Sarkouhi, a liberal editor of the Persian
Weekly Adineh, was sentenced to one year in prison.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Revolution Court said here today that Sarkouhi was
found guilty of having secret contacts with some European
nationals and of involvement in anti-Iran propaganda campaigns.
</P>
<P>
He was arrested along with his brother and two smugglers while
attempting to flee the country from Bushehr, a port city in
southern Iran, in February.

IMF of a number of Southeast Asian countries, U.S. Secretary of
Treasury Robert Rubin said here today.
</P>
<P>
"This will reflect better these countries' importance in the
world economy and their capacity to undertake additional
responsibilities, as evidenced by their provision of bilateral
assistance during the recent (currency) crisis (in Southeast
Asia)," Rubin told a meeting of the IMF Interim Committee.
</P>
<P>
He said a quota increase will provide a welcome opportunity to
align member's quota shares in the IMF more closely with their
roles in the world economy.
</P>
<P>
The IMF Executive Board Saturday agreed to a 45 percent
increase in members' quotas worth a total of 88.4 billion U.S.
dollars. The Board also reached agreement on a special, one-time
allocation of 21.4 billion special drawing rights (SDR) that would
raise total SDR allocations to 42.9 billion SDRs.
</P>
<P>
"We also welcome the agreement on an amendment of the Articles
of Agreement to provide a special one-time allocation of SDRs
which will enable all members, and especially new IMF members, to
participate fully in the SDR arrangement," Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that an adequately funded IMF must also stand ready
to play a larger role in responding to financial crises.

<HEADLINE> CPC Congress Sets Prospective Direction: S. Korean Papers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The 15th National Congress of
the Communist Party of China (CPC), which has elected many young
cadres into the central leadership, shows a prospect of social
stability and rapid development for China in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
An editorial published today in the newspaper "Joong-Ilbo" said
that the supreme leadership of China elected during the 15th
congress included many young cadres from various government
departments. To hold such a historic congress at the turning of
centuries demonstrated the will of China's most excellent
political leaders, it added.
</P>
<P>
The editorial of "Chosun Ilbo" said the 15th CPC congress has
set a political and economic framework for future China, which is
designed to strengthen the country through "socialism with Chinese
characteristics." The newly-elected Political Bureau headed by
Jiang Zemin will guarantee the political stability needed for this
goal.
</P>
<P>
"Hankook Ilbo" said in its editorial that the 15th congress
ended after determining the forward direction for the 21st century
and electing the Political Bureau headed Jiang Zemin. It hoped

effective reforming and opening-up to the outside world.

<HEADLINE> Paris Club Calls for Promoting Financial Stability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The finance ministers and
central bank governors of the Paris Club today stressed the need
of working out a concerted strategy to promote financial stability
in emerging market economies.
</P>
<P>
The participants "welcomed the broad endorsement given to the
concerted strategy to promote financial stability in emerging
market economies that have been developed in collaboration with
representatives of these economies," said a communique issued at
the end of a meeting of the G-10, also known as the Paris Club
composed of creditor nations.
</P>
<P>
They also paid attention to the stability of the international
monetary system and focused on such questions as crisis prevention
and crisis management, the communique said.
</P>
<P>
Given the financial market turmoil in Southeast Asia, which has
many of its roots in weak financial systems, the participants
stressed the importance of concrete and comprehensive
implementation of the concerted strategy, which focuses on actions
in three main areas:
</P>
<P>
-- Creating a macroeconomic and institutional setting favorable
to sound credit cultures and the efficient and continued operation
of markets;
</P>
<P>
-- Promoting effective stakeholder oversight and good
governance of financial institutions;
</P>
<P>
-- And Instituting sound regulatory and supervisory
arrangements that support and complement market discipline.
</P>
<P>
The participants, in this context, stressed the need for the
Paris Club to continue its efforts to promote implementation of
the concerted strategy in cooperation with representatives of
emerging market economies, the communique said.
</P>
<P>
They also welcomed the greater focus of the IMF's surveillance
on the financial sector and the emphasis given to strengthening
financial systems of the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, British Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon
Brown was elected chairman of the Club for the coming year.

<P>
KATHMANDU, September 21 (Xinhua) -- After a hard first
4700-kilometer journey, 84 of the 99 vintage cars taking part in
the second Beijing to Paris classic car rally reached this capital
city of Nepal on Saturday evening.
</P>
<P>
These cars and their drivers will have a three-day break in
Kathmandu, doing necessary maintenance and patchup work.
</P>
<P>
Since the Beijing to Paris Motor Challenge took a
trans-Himalaya route to Nepal for the first time, these motorists
had to drive through the 17,000-foot-high Tanggu Pass, the highest
road in the world.
</P>
<P>
About 200 motorists from 22 countries are participating in the
16,000-kilometer-long rally, which started from Beijing on
September 5.
</P>
<P>
They will drive through 11 countries including India, Pakistan,
Iran, Turkey, Greece, Italy, Switzerland and Germany, and arrive
in Paris on October 18.
</P>
<P>
As the Visit Nepal Year '98 nears, Nepal pays much attention to
the rally.
</P>
<P>
This Himalayan kingdom plans to hold a vintage cars exhibition
and a reception for the participants on September 23.
</P>
<P>
Cars parked at Nepal's Birendra International Convention Center
range from a 1907 La France to Rolls Royce, Bentley, Mercedes,
Austin Martin, BMW, Porsche, Rover and Jaguar.
</P>
<P>
The rally is being organized by the Britain-based Classic Rally

<HEADLINE> UNCTAD: Global FDI Reached $349 Billion in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The total amount of the global
foreign direct investment (FDI) reached 349 billion U.S. dollars
in 1996, a 10 percent rise over 1995, said a United Nations report
published today.
</P>
<P>
Of the total, 208 billion dollars went into developed countries
and 129 billion dollars into developing countries, the United
Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) said in its
1997 World Investment Report.
</P>
<P>
The UNCTAD said that although the flows of FDI into the
developed countries continued to far exceed those into the
developing countries, the gap has been narrowing.
</P>
<P>
The record inflows of 129 billion dollars into the developing
countries were 34 percent up, compared to that of 1995, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, outflows from the developed countries were partly
up, at 295 billion dollars while those from the developing
countries accounted for 15 percent of the total FDI, or 51 billion
dollars, it added.
</P>
<P>
China is still the second largest FDI recipient in the world,
absorbing 42 billion dollars, which accounted for over 50 percent
of the total amount of the FDI inflows into Asia last year, the
report noted.
</P>
<P>
UNCTAD believed that China's large and growing market, ongoing
economic reforms, successful economic "soft landing", and measures
to promote inward investment have combined to yield that result.
</P>
<P>
The United States remained to be the largest FDI recipient by
attracting 85 billion dollars in 1996, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Investment flows into the Latin American and Caribbean
countries reached 39 billion dollars, rising by 52 percent last
year. The increase is the highest of any developing region,
accounting for 30 percent of the total inflows to the developing
countries, it said.
</P>
<P>
About 105 billion dollars of the FDI inflows has gone into West
Europe while those into Central and East Europe has fallen to 12
billion dollars from 14 billion dollars in 1995, the report said.
</P>
<P>
FDI inflows remained very little for the 48 least developed
countries, only accounting for two percent of the total, it
added.

percent) and raw silk (4 percent).

On China's future co-operation with the World Bank, Li said
that his country, still a developing country with low per-capita
income, is imbalanced in its economic growth. There are still a
large number of the needy people in the country, and the tasks of
both reform and development are arduous, he added.

<P>
"Therefore, we hope to continue conducting mutually-beneficial
co-operation with the World Bank in a fairly long period of time
to come, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Wolfensohn said that the World Bank has maintained its friendly
relations of co-operation with China on the basis of mutual trust

Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC), saying that the
congress serves as a link that inherits the past and charges ahead
into the future. China will continue to carry on its reform and
opening-up, and to keep public ownership as the mainstay while
advancing the economies of various other forms, Li noted.
</P>
<P>
Wolfensohn extended his congratulations on the outcome of the

forward to cooperating with the Chinese side in accordance with

TOKYO, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Monica Seles of the United
States scored her third title of the year winning over Arantxa
Sanchez Vicario of Spain in the final of the 450,000-U.S.-Dollar
Princess Cup tennis tournament here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav-born American, who ended her 11-month title
draught last month by taking back-to-back victories at Los Angeles
and Toronto, was taken to a tie break in the third set before
scoring a narrow 6-1, 3-6, 7-6 (7-5) victory.
</P>
<P>
Sanchez Vicario outplayed a game mixed with effective drop
shots and looping top spin, and, after being routed by Seles in
the first set, began to charge the net to pressure the top seed.
Sanchez Vicario forced Seles into a forehand error for a third
break and held for the set to level the contest.
</P>
<P>
In the decider, Seles had to recover after dropping the third
game to level at 3-3 after six deuces. She then missed a match
point at 30-40 in the 10th game, but made no mistake when the game
went to a tie-break.
</P>
<P>
With the victory, Seles collected a 14-1 record against Sanchez
Vicario, with the only defeat coming in the 1992 Canadian Open
final.
</P>

Seles received the winner's check of 79,000 U.S. dollars with
Sanchez Vicario taking 36,000 as runner-up.

Amid environmental concerns, organisers have rejected the idea

But FIS president Marc Hodler insisted that the federation may

The FIS hopes to raise the start point from 1,680 meters above

<HEADLINE> India to Launch Hotline Service for AIDS Counseling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 21 (Xinhua) -- A 24-hour hotline service
for AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) counseling is being
launched in India from October 1, the local press said today.
</P>
<P>
The hot-line service is part of the Indian government's new
drive to improve its AIDS control program which has suffered a
severe setback.
</P>
<P>
With the help of such a service, officials feel that they would
be able to help those who need help, but are hesitant to seek it.
The calls will be free of charge.
</P>
<P>
The hot-line service, which is to be allotted a three-digit
number, will give information on HIV (human immuno-deficiency
virus) and AIDS as well as help provide AIDS counseling to
individual cases.
</P>
<P>
A pre-recorded computerized service will guide the caller
through his queries. If it is unable to answer a question, the
caller will be given a query number and asked to get back after
some hours.
</P>
<P>
Later the caller will be required to punch in the query number
for seeking the answer to his call. If the caller wants a personal
counseling session then he would be given appointment over the
phone.
</P>
<P>
The AIDS control program sponsored by the government since 1987
has shown little success so far with the cases of HIV infection
growing several times.
</P>
<P>
There are already over 66,000 people in the country who are
infected with the virus. Of these, almost 5,000 are suffering from
full-blown AIDS.

TOKYO, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Japanese news media, while
giving marked reports on the closing of the 15th Congress of the
Communist Party of China (CPC), spoke highly of the achievements
made at the week-long meeting.
</P>
<P>
Describing pragmatic economic development as the theme of the

Japanese newspapers also notably reported Jiang's keynote
report to the conference and the amendments to the CPC
Constitution that upheld Deng Xiaoping Theory as a development of
Marxism and Mao Zedong Thought.
</P>
<P>
Jiang's report has laid the groundwork for China's political,
economic and cultural development in the next five years, they
said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Camdessus Upbeat About Prospects of Thai Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Michel Camdessus, managing
director of the International Monetary Fund, today expressed
confidence in the prospects of the Thai economy despite the
current financial turmoil that has swept Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
"There should be confidence that Thailand will gradually return
to the impressive growth trend observed in the past," Camdessus
said in a statement to the IMF Interim Committee here this
morning.
</P>
<P>
The Thai authorities have committed themselves to a strong
adjustment program and improved data reportings, he said, noting
that adjustments and reform are well under way.
</P>
<P>
The international community has given its substantial
endorsement and support to the measures taken by the Thai
authorities, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Provided the necessary policy adjustments are implemented
without delay, the currency turbulence should eventually wane,"
Camdessus said.
</P>
<P>
For other countries with pegged exchange rate regimes to reduce
financial risks, Camdessus recommended that they introduce greater
flexibility in the management of their exchange rates.
</P>
<P>
Greater exchange rate flexibility can make it easier to deal
with external shocks that require domestic policy adjustments,
although it obviously cannot be a substitute for appropriate
macroeconomic policies, he said.
</P>
<P>
"It can also help deter speculative capital inflows and convey
a more realistic perception of risks to both domestic and foreign
investors," he said.
</P>
<P>
The managing director also emphasized the need to enhance the
transparency of government budgets and the quality and timeliness
of economic data to help reduce the risk of disruptive changes in

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Bharatiya Janata Party
(BJP) leader Kalyan Singh will take over as chief minister of
India's Uttar Pradesh today following the resignation of Chief
Minister Miss Mayawati on Saturday night, the local press said
today.
</P>
<P>
The smooth change of guard in India's most populous state was
the result of an unusual power-sharing arrangement between BJP and
Miss Mayawati's Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP).
</P>
<P>
With the emergence of a hung state assembly from the elections
held early this year, BJP and BSP have agreed to run a coalition
government in the state on a six month rotation.
</P>
<P>
On completion of a six-month term, Miss Mayawati submitted her
resignation to State Governor Romesh Bhandari on Saturday night,
requesting the governor to invite Singh for the formation of a new
state government.
</P>
<P>
Governor Bhandari asked Miss Mmayawati to continue as chief
minister till Kalyan Singh is sworn in along with his council of
ministers on Sunday afternoon in the Uttar Pradesh capital of
Lucknow.
</P>
<P>
The governor also made it clear that Kalyan Singh would not be
required to seek a vote of confidence in the state assembly.

II. Work of the Past Five Years
</P>
<P>
The five years since Deng Xiaoping gave talks during his visit
to the South and the Party held its Fourteenth National Congress
in 1992 have been no ordinary years. In the five years, our Party
has led the people of all nationalities in our country in standing
the severe tests of political disturbances at home and abroad in
the late 1980s and early 1990s and continuing to take big strides
on the road to socialism with Chinese characteristics. In the five
years, we have further emancipated our minds and made pioneering
efforts, bringing the reform, opening up and the modernization
drive to a new stage of development. In the five years, we have,
in the course of profound changes in establishing a socialist
market economy, balanced reform, development and stability and
scored great achievements in various fields. In the five years,
China's international standing has risen notably in the midst of
radical changes in the pattern of the world.
</P>
<P>
The Fourteenth Congress made three policy decisions of
far-reaching significance. One, seize opportunities to speed up
development; two, define the establishment of a socialist market
economy as the goal of economic restructuring in China; and three,
establish the guiding position of Deng Xiaoping's theory of
building socialism with Chinese characteristics in the whole
Party. Acting in the spirit of the Fourteenth Congress, the
Central Committee convened seven plenary sessions to adopt
programs and plans regarding a series of major issues which have a
vital bearing on the overall situation, such as the establishment
of a socialist market economy, the strengthening of Party
building, the formulation of the Outline of the Ninth Five-Year
Plan for National Economic and Social Development and the
Long-Range Objectives Through the Year 2010, and the development
of socialist culture and ethics. Over the past five years, the
work of the whole Party has been highlighted in the all-round
implementation of the Party's basic theory and basic line, the
conscientious enforcement of the important policy decisions of the
Fourteenth Congress, the formulation of and adherence to the basic
principle of "seizing the current opportunity to deepen the reform
and open China wider to the outside world, promoting development
and maintaining stability", and the fostering of both material
progress and cultural and ethical progress. China's productive
forces, overall national strength and living standards reached a
new level.
</P>
<P>
Marked successes were attained in economic development over the
past five years. From 1992 through 1996, the gross domestic
product rose by 12.1 percent a year on the average. Rapid economic
growth was registered while inflation was brought under effective
control, and thus drastic fluctuation was avoided. Notable headway
was made in economic restructuring. Greater attention was paid to
agriculture and the output of grain and other farm produce
increased steadily. Infrastructure including water conservancy,
transport and telecommunications and basic industries such as iron
and steel and energy industries expanded swiftly. Rapid economic
growth was witnessed in the eastern part of the country and the
pace of economic development was speeded up in the central and
western parts as well. The Eighth Five-Year Plan was crowned with
success, and a good beginning has been recorded in the
implementation of the Ninth Five-Year Plan.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian President Endorses Members of Assembly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto
has endorsed the entire lineup of 1,000 people for the People's
Consultative Assembly (MPR) which will meet to elect the country's
next president and vice president in March, sources of the Home
Affairs Ministry said here today.
</P>
<P>
The assembly consists of all 500 members of the House of
Representatives and another 500 members chosen from various walks
of life.
</P>
<P>
The sources did not say the exact time the president endorsed
the assembly members.
</P>
<P>
The new members will be sworn in on October 1.
</P>
<P>
Most politicians and analysts here say MPR is likely to reelect
the incumbent 76-year-old president Soeharto for a seventh
five-year term in March. There has been speculation, however,
about the vice presidential post.
</P>
<P>
The assembly will be strongly dominated by the ruling party
Golkar, with 488 members, the powerful armed forces (ABRI) faction
will have 113 members, the United Development Party (PPP) 134, and
the Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI) 16.
</P>
<P>
The faction of regional representatives will have 149 members.
</P>
<P>
The remaining 100 members will be representatives of various
groups, mostly mass organization and professional association.
They will not have a faction of their own, as they traditionally
join Golkar during the assembly meeting.
</P>
<P>
The list of MPR members published by the government Saturday
included all members of the present cabinet.
</P>
<P>
State Minister of Special Assignments Harmoko heads the list
and his position as Golkar chairman makes his the front-runner for
the job of new speaker of the house and chairman of MPR, analysts
said.

<HEADLINE> Colombia's Domestic Coffee Price Drops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, September 20 (Xinhua) -- The domestic price
of Colombian coffee, to be in force starting today until next
Friday, will be down about 3 percent to 336,125 pesos (about 329.7
U.S. dollars) per "carga", or 125 kilograms, the National Coffee
Growers Federation said.
</P>
<P>
The drop was the result of an agreement reached by coffee
growers and government representatives in the National Coffee
Growers Committee, to establish a system of automatic adjustments
to the internal purchase price of the grain.
</P>
<P>
The Colombian coffee market prices in the past 10 days was
taken as a reference, which was 2 dollars a pound.
</P>
<P>
The coffee authorities have not made a decision on the matter,
despite the coffee growers' repeated request to change the system
to affix a domestic price to coffee.
</P>
<P>
However, it is estimated that the National Committee will study
another formula to determine the purchase price of coffee, since
the current mechanism does not completely satisfy coffee growers,
because it takes the lowest quotation of the last 10 days in the
New York Stock Market as a reference.

VI. Reforming the Political Structure and Strengthening
Democracy and the Legal System
</P>
<P>
The deepening of the reform of the economic structure and the
cross-century development of the socialist modernization drive
require that, under the precondition of adhering to the Four
Cardinal Principles, we should continue to press ahead with the
reform of the political structure, further extend the scope of
socialist democracy and improve the socialist legal system,
governing the country according to law and making it a socialist
country ruled by law.
</P>
<P>
It is our Party's persistent goal to develop socialist
democracy. Without democracy there would be no socialism or
socialist modernization. The essence of socialist democracy is
that the people are the masters of the country. All power of the
state belongs to the people. China's state system featuring
people's democratic dictatorship and its system of government
featuring people's congresses are the result of the struggles
waged by the people and the choice of history. It is imperative
that we should uphold and improve this fundamental political
system, instead of copying any western models. This is of decisive
importance in upholding leadership by the Party and the socialist
system and realizing people's democracy.
</P>
<P>
Developing democracy must go hand in hand with the efforts to
improve the legal system so that the country is ruled by law.
Ruling the country by law means that the broad masses of the
people, under the leadership of the Party and in accordance with
the Constitution and other laws, participate in one way or another
and through all possible channels in managing state affairs,
economic and cultural undertakings and social affairs, and see to
it that all work of the state proceeds in keeping with law, and
that socialist democracy is gradually institutionalized and
codified so that such institutions and laws will not change with
changes in the leadership or changes in the views or focus of
attention of any leader. Ruling the country by law is the basic
strategy employed by the Party in leading the people in running
the country. It is the objective demand of a socialist market
economy, an important hallmark of social and cultural progress,
and a vital guarantee for lasting political stability of the
country. The Party has led the people in drawing up the
Constitution and other laws, to which it confines its activities.
In ruling the country by law, we can unify the adherence to Party
leadership, development of people's democracy and doing things in
strict accordance with the law, thus ensuring, institutionally and
legally, that the Party's basic line and basic policies are
carried out without fail, and that the Party plays the role of the
core of leadership at all times, commanding the whole situation
and coordinating the efforts of all quarters.

<P>
Political restructuring must help enhance the vitality of the
Party and the state, demonstrate the features and advantages of
the socialist system, safeguard national unification, ethnic unity
and social stability, give full scope to the initiative of the
people, and stimulate the development of the productive forces and
social progress. The main tasks of political restructuring for the
present and a period of time to come are to develop democracy,
strengthen the legal system, separate government functions from
enterprise management, streamline government organs, improve the
democratic supervision system, and maintain stability and unity.
</P>
<P>
(1) Improve the systems of democracy. As a ruling party, the
Communist Party leads and supports the people in exercising the
power of running the state, holding democratic elections, making
policy decisions in a democratic manner, instituting democratic
management and supervision, ensuring that the people enjoy
extensive rights and freedom endowed by law, and respecting and
guaranteeing human rights. In developing socialist democracy,
institutions are of fundamental, overall, stabilizing and lasting
importance. We shall uphold and improve the system of people's
congresses, ensuring that the people's congresses and their
standing committees exercise the functions of the organs of state
power according to law, strengthen their legislative and
supervisory work, and establish closer ties between deputies and
the people they represent. While making major policy decisions
concerning reform and development, we must enact corresponding
laws. We shall gradually establish a mechanism that will help the
decision-makers to go deep among the people to see their
condition, adequately reflect their will and pool their wisdom so
that decision-making will be more scientific, democratic and
efficient and will reach a higher level. We shall uphold and
improve the system of multi-party cooperation and political
consultation led by the Communist Party. Upholding the principle
of "long-term coexistence, mutual supervision, treating each other
with all sincerity and sharing weal or woe", we shall strengthen
our cooperation with the democratic parties and consolidate our
alliance with non-Party people. We shall continue to help the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference to standardize
and institutionalize its political consultation, democratic
supervision, participation in and deliberation of state affairs,
turning it into an important channel for the Party to unite with
the people of all circles. We shall consolidate and develop the
broad patriotic united front. We shall implement in an all-round
way the Party's policies toward ethnic minorities, uphold and
improve regional autonomy for them, reinforce our work concerning
ethnic groups and consolidate and enhance socialist ethnic
relations of equality, solidarity and mutual assistance, promoting
common prosperity and progress for all our nationalities. We shall
implement in real earnest the Party's policies concerning
religions and overseas Chinese affairs. Trade unions, the
Communist Youth League, women's federations and other mass
organizations should play their roles of democratic participation
and supervision in managing state and social affairs, and serve as
a bridge or linkage between the Party and the people.

<TEXT>
<P>
We shall extend the scope of democracy at the grassroots level
to make sure that people directly exercise their democratic
rights, manage their own affairs according to law and create a
happy life for themselves. This is a practice of socialist
democracy on the most extensive scale. The grassroots organs of
power and self-governing mass organizations in both urban and
rural areas should establish a sound system of democratic
elections, and keep the public informed of their administrative
work and financial affairs so as to enable the people to take part
in the discussion and decision-making concerning local public
affairs and welfare undertakings, and exercise democratic
supervision over the cadres. We should uphold and improve the
democratic management system of enterprises and institutions with
workers' conferences as its basic form so that workers can
participate in reform and management and protect their legitimate
rights and interests. We must resolutely correct such erroneous
acts as suppressing democracy and resorting to coercion and
commandism.
</P>
<P>
(2) Improve the legal system. The smooth progress of the
undertakings of the Party and the state inevitably requires that
there must be laws to go by, that the laws must be observed and
strictly enforced, and that law-breakers must be prosecuted. We
shall strengthen legislation, improve the quality of laws and form
a socialist legal system with Chinese characteristics by the year
2010. We must safeguard the dignity of the Constitution and other
laws; we must see to it that all people are equal before the law
and that no individuals or organizations have the privilege to
overstep it. All government organs must perform their official
duties according to law, guarantee in real earnest the citizens'
rights and implement the system of responsibility for law
enforcement and the system of assessment and examination in this
regard. We shall promote the reform in judicial affairs, ensure
institutionally that the judicial organs are in a position to
exercise adjudicative and procuratorial powers independently and
fairly according to law, and establish a system for investigating
and prosecuting anyone who is held responsible for unjust or
misjudged cases. We shall improve the ranks of law-enforcing and
judicial personnel. We shall educate the populace about the law to
make them more aware of the importance of abiding by it. In
particular, we shall enhance the leading cadres' awareness of the
importance of the legal system and their ability to perform their
duties according to law. We must closely integrate the improvement
of the legal system with the promotion of cultural and ethical
progress and make sure that they advance synchronously.

<P>
(3) Promote the restructuring of government institutions.
Unwieldy organization, overstaffing, failure to separate the
functions of the government from those of enterprises and serious
bureaucracy directly hamper the deepening of the reform and
economic development and impair the relationship between the Party
and the masses. This problem calling for an urgent solution must
be studied from an overall point of view and special personnel
should be organized to work out plans promptly to solve it. In
accordance with the requirements of a socialist market economy, we
need to alter the functions of the government and separate them
from those of enterprises so that enterprises will be truly given
the power with regard to production, operation and management.
Following the principle of simplification, uniformity and
efficiency in the reform, we shall establish a highly efficient,
well coordinated and standardized administrative system, with a
view to improving their service for the people. The departments in
charge of comprehensive economic administration should be
converted into departments for macroeconomic control, and
specialized economic departments should be reorganized or reduced.
We shall strengthen the departments supervising law enforcement
and cultivate and expand social intermediary organizations. We
shall deepen the reform of the administrative system, statutorily
delimiting the structures, functions, sizes and working procedures
of the state organs and ensuring that their sizes are kept within
authorized limits and their redundant personnel are reduced. We
shall also deepen the reform of the personnel system by
introducing a competitive and incentive mechanism and improving
the system of public servants to build up a contingent of
administrators who are highly competent and professionally
specialized.
</P>
<P>
(4) Improve the system of democratic supervision. Our power is
given to us by the people and all cadres are their servants who
must be subjected to supervision by the people and the law. We
should deepen the reform in this connection, improve the legal
system of supervision, and establish and improve a mechanism
ensuring that our cadres exercise their authority within the
framework of law. The departments handling affairs of immediate
concern to the people should carry out an open administrative
system to make sure what they do is fair, just and open. We shall
integrate the supervision within the Party with that by the law
and the masses and give scope to the role of supervision by public
opinion. We shall strengthen the supervision over the enforcement
of the Constitution and other laws to safeguard the uniformity of
the legal system of the state as well as the supervision over the
implementation of general and specific policies of the Party and
the state to see to it that they are truly carried out. We shall
strengthen the supervision over cadres at all levels and
especially leading cadres to prevent them from abusing their
powers. We must severely punish those in charge of law enforcement
who break the law or those who accept bribes.

<P>
(5) Maintain stability and unity. With the deepening of the
reform and opening up and the readjustment of economic relations,
many changes have taken place in the various contradictions in the
economic and social life and, in particular, some contradictions
concerning the people's immediate interests are rather
conspicuous. The Party committees and governments at all levels
must work conscientiously, responsibly and enthusiastically to
solve the people's practical problems in their life and work. With
regard to contradictions among the people, we should go deep into
the realities, carry out investigation and study and do
ideological and political work well. As the circumstances may
differ, we should properly use economic, administrative or legal
means to tackle the contradictions and prevent them from becoming
more acute.
</P>
<P>
Sound public security is of prime importance for the safety of
people's lives and property as well as the reform, development and
stability. We should improve the work of the procuratorial,
judicial and public security departments. We must crack down on
all kinds of crimes according to law and eradicate social evils
such as pornography, gambling, and drug abuse and trafficking. In
our efforts to improve all facets of public security, we need to
combine punishment with prevention and lay more stress on the
latter. We should intensify education and management, reinforce
the responsibility system and bring about a sound environment of
public security. Building socialist democracy is a gradual
historical process, so it should be advanced under the leadership
of the Party, in light of China's conditions, step by step, and in
an orderly way. The more developed socialism is, the more
developed democracy will be. We should continue to promote the
Chinese-style socialist democracy by exploring the law of its
development in practice, and enable it to display greater vitality
in the 21st century.

VII. Developing Socialist Culture with Chinese Characteristics
</P>
<P>
Socialist culture with Chinese characteristics, as far as its
substance is concerned, is identical to socialist ideological and
ethical progress we have been promoting since we introduced the
reform and opening up. Culture is relative to the economy and
politics, while ideological and ethical progress is relative to
material progress. Only when economic development and political
and cultural advances are well coordinated and only if there are
both material progress and cultural and ideological progress can
there be socialism with Chinese characteristics.
</P>
<P>
Socialist modernization requires both a prosperous economy and
a flourishing culture. The process of the modernization drive is
largely dependent on the enhancement of the quality of the entire
population and the exploitation of intellectual resources. In view
of the rapid scientific and technological development, the keen
competition in overall national strength, the worldwide
interaction of different ideologies and cultures as well as the
increasing cultural needs of our people leading a fairly
comfortable life, the whole Party must fully understand that
cultural advancement is essential and urgent because it plays a
great role in developing the cause of socialism and rejuvenating
the nation.
</P>
<P>
Socialist culture with Chinese characteristics is a major force
uniting and inspiring the people of all our nationalities, and an
important indicator of our overall national strength. This culture
originated from the 5,000-year-old civilization of the Chinese
nation and is deeply rooted in our endeavor to build socialism
with Chinese characteristics. It has distinctive features of the
times, representing the basic features of our socialist economy
and politics and playing a great role in promoting their
development. In building socialism with Chinese characteristics,
we must redouble our efforts to raise the ideological and ethical
standards and scientific and educational levels of the whole
nation and provide a powerful ideological driving force and strong
intellectual support for economic development and all-round social
progress. We must nurture citizens one generation after another
who have high ideals, moral integrity, a good education and a
strong sense of discipline, meeting the requirements of the
socialist modernization drive. This is a long-term arduous task in
our cultural advancement.

<P>
Fostering common ideals and aspirations in the whole society is
the basic objective of our cultural advancement with Chinese
characteristics. We should make unremitting efforts to educate
cadres and the masses in Deng Xiaoping Theory. We should
persistently conduct education in socialist ethics with emphasis
on serving the people and on the principle of collectivism and
strengthen education in democracy, legality and discipline so as
to guide our people to foster correct outlooks on the world and
life and correct values. We shall make great efforts to promote
patriotism, collectivism, socialism and the hardworking and
enterprising spirit. We shall advocate communist ideology and
ethics and, combining progressiveness with extensiveness, we shall
encourage all ideologies and ethics that are conducive to national
unification, ethnic unity, economic development and social
progress. We shall carry forward socialist humanitarianism. Young
people are the future of the motherland and hope of the nation, so
we should pay great attention to their ideological and ethical
progress.
</P>
<P>
The progress of education and science is the foundation of our
cultural advancement. Training hundreds of millions of qualified
laborers and tens of millions of professional personnel to meet
the needs of the modernization drive and exploiting the advantage
of our vast human resources have a direct bearing on the cause of
socialism in the 21st century. We must see to it that education is
given a strategic priority. We should respect teachers, value
education and strengthen the ranks of teachers. Bringing the
initiative of all quarters of society into full play, we shall
spare no efforts to make the nine-year compulsory education
universal, eliminate illiteracy among young and middle-aged
people, expand vocational and adult education of different types
and steadily develop higher education. We shall optimize the
educational structure, speed up the reform of the management
system of higher education, and judiciously allocate resources for
education so as to enhance the quality of instruction and raise
the overall efficiency of schools. We should implement the Party's
educational policy with emphasis on improving the quality of
students and train builders of and successors to the cause of
socialism, who are developed morally, intellectually and
physically in an all-round way. Great efforts should be made to
raise the scientific and technological level, popularize science
and technology, guide people to take a scientific approach and
master scientific methods, and encourage them to be creative and
inventive. We should eliminate ignorance and combat feudal and
superstitious activities. We shall develop philosophy and other
social sciences, which is of great importance to retaining the
guiding position of Marxism in the ideological sphere of our
country, to studying the laws governing the development of
socialism with Chinese characteristics, and to improving our
ability to understand the world and change it.

<P>
The development of the cultural undertakings, including
literature and art, the press and publishing, radio, film and
television, is an important aspect of cultural advancement. In the
press and publicity work we must adhere to the principle of
keeping the Party spirit, persist in seeking truth from facts and
maintain a correct orientation for public opinion. We should
strengthen supervision over the press and publishing, optimizing
their structures and improving their quality. We should deepen
reform of the system for managing cultural undertakings, and
implement and improve related economic policies. We must adhere to
the principles of serving the people and the cause of socialism
and of "letting a hundred flowers blossom and a hundred schools of
thought contend", giving full scope to the theme of our times
while advocating diversity so as to create more excellent works
which integrate ideological content with artistry.
</P>
<P>
A healthy cultural environment is an important condition for
promoting cultural and ideological progress of society and
advancing the reform, opening up and the modernization drive. We
should conduct mass activities to promote ideological and ethical
progress in depth and in a protracted way, and make great efforts
to advocate social and occupational ethics and family virtues. We
should, on the one hand, try to boost our cultural undertakings,
and on the other, strengthen supervision over the markets for
cultural products so as to facilitate their sound development. We
should build more cultural establishments. More attention should
be paid to the protection of scientific, historical and cultural
heritage and revolutionary relics. We should promote the reform
and development of public health and sports. We should advocate
healthy and civilized lifestyles and constantly improve the
quality of the cultural life of the masses.
</P>
<P>
China cannot develop its culture in isolation from the common
achievements of human civilization. Following the principle of
keeping our own culture as the base and making use of that of
others, we should conduct various exchanges with other countries,
drawing on their strong points while introducing our own
achievements to the world. We must resolutely resist the corrosion
of decadent ideas and cultures.
</P>
<P>
As part of the working class, intellectuals are playing an
important role in the drive for modernization. We should implement
the Party's policy toward intellectuals and give full play to
their initiative and creativity. Intellectuals should study hard
and better themselves so that they will be propagators of advanced
thoughts, pioneers in the development of science and technology,
educators training people to be citizens with high ideals, moral
integrity, a good education and a strong sense of discipline, and
producers of excellent intellectual works, contributing hand in
hand with workers and peasants to the rejuvenation of the Chinese
nation.
</P>
<P>
Chinese culture has a glorious history. In the great practice
of the socialist modernization drive, we are sure to create a more
magnificent socialist culture with Chinese characteristics and
make due contribution to human civilization.

Comrades,
</P>
<P>
Having talked about the economic, political and cultural tasks,
I should now like to make a special point on national defense and
army building. To strengthen national defense and army building is
the basic guarantee for our national security and modernization
drive. Deng Xiaoping's concept of army building in the new period
is the continuation and development of Mao Zedong's thinking on
military affairs and the scientific guide to building our army and
our national defense. In line with the general requirements of
being qualified politically and competent militarily and having a
fine style of work, strict discipline and adequate logistical
support, we should press ahead with the army building and reform
so as to make the People's Liberation Army a more revolutionary,
modernized and standardized army. In our army's 70 years of
brilliant history, it has stood all kinds of tests and become
stronger and stronger, for which the fundamental guarantee is the
strong Party leadership. Under the new historical conditions, the
army must consistently uphold the absolute leadership by the
Party, be in agreement with the Party Central Committee
ideologically and politically, obey orders of the Party Central
Committee in all actions and never forget its nature and purposes
as the people's army. It should adhere to the strategy of active
defense, improve its quality and take the road of fewer but better
troops with Chinese characteristics. The army should be strict
with itself, vigorously strengthen ideological and political work,
carry forward its fine traditions and take the lead in the whole
society in promoting cultural and ethical progress. In order to
adapt itself to the profound changes in the military arena in the
world, the army should intensify its education and training, and
upgrade its defense capabilities under modern technology and
especially high-tech conditions. In addition to the army reduction
by one million men in the 1980s, we shall reduce the armed forces
by another 500,000 in the next three years. We should strengthen
the army by relying on science and technology, put more efforts in
the research in defense-related science and technology, establish
and improve an operation mechanism so that the defense industries
are adapted to the socialist market economy, and gradually upgrade
weapons and other equipment. The army should subordinate itself to
and serve the overall interests of national economic development,
strengthening itself through thrift and hard work and actively
supporting and participating in the economic development of the
country. Party organizations and governments at all levels and the
masses should be concerned about and support the development of
national defense and army building. We shall intensify defense
education, increasing the people's awareness of the importance of
national defense. The army should continue to support the
government and cherish the people, and the government and the
people should continue to support the army and give preferential
treatment to families of armymen and martyrs so as to consolidate
the unity between the army and the government and between the army
and the people. We should also strengthen the work with regard to
the militia and the reserves, and improve the mobilization system
for national defense. We should continue to strengthen the Chinese
People's Armed Police and the public and state security
departments.

<HEADLINE> China Backs IMF's Strengthened Surveillance, Dialogue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Dai Xianglong, governor of
the People's Bank of China, said here today that China supports
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in its increased efforts to
strengthen its surveillance function.
</P>
<P>
Dai, who is here for the annual meetings of the World Bank and
the IMF on September 23-25, also stressed that the IMF should at
the same time strengthen dialogue with member countries in
conducting the surveillance.
</P>
<P>
"We support the Fund's increased efforts to strengthen its
surveillance function, particularly over those countries with
systemic repercussions," Dai said at the 49th meeting of the
Interim Committee of the IMF Board of Governors on the
International Monetary System.
</P>
<P>
"Meanwhile the Fund should take full account of member
countries' individual conditions and strengthen candid dialogue
with member countries in conducting the surveillance," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We welcome the progress in launching the data dissemination
standards and encourage further progress in this area," he
continued. "Not only can technical assistance help member
countries implement the Fund's policy advice and improve their
statistical work, but it can also help enhance the effectiveness
of Fund surveillance."
</P>
<P>
"The Fund should, therefore, continue to strengthen the
provision of technical assistance to the developing countries," he
added.
</P>
<P>
On the current economic situation worldwide, Dai said he was in
broad agreement with the Fund staff and the Board's assessments
and projections.
</P>
<P>
"A sustained strong growth momentum in the developing world, a
continued stable growth in the industrial countries as a whole,
and a positive growth for the first time in the transition
countries as a group have initially laid a good basis for future
sustained world economic development," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he cautioned people against neglecting the risks and
problems facing the global economy.
</P>
<P>
"The economic performance varies widely among major industrial
countries, reflecting the differences in their internal structural
weaknesses and reform intensity. Continental European countries
should strive to reduce fiscal deficits and unemployment so as to
attain a sustained growth," Dai said.
</P>
<P>
He also advised some industrial countries to maintain vigilance
against possible re-emergence of inflationary pressures. "Where
necessary, preemptive measures should be taken to preserve
long-term price stability," he added.

VIII. Promoting the Peaceful Reunification of the Motherland
</P>
<P>
Complete reunification of the motherland is the common
aspiration of all Chinese at home and abroad. Taking the great
cause of the peaceful reunification of the motherland as their
historical task, the Chinese Communists have made unremitting
efforts to that end. Deng Xiaoping's scientific concept of "one
country, two systems" has vigorously pushed forward the process of
the peaceful reunification of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
As a hallmark of the great success of the concept of "one
country, two systems", Hong Kong's return to the motherland
constitutes a crucial step taken by the Chinese people in the
great cause of the reunification of the motherland. Since Hong
Kong's return, the policies of "one country, two systems", "Hong
Kong people administering Hong Kong" and a high degree of autonomy
have been implemented conscientiously, and Hong Kong has
maintained its prosperity and stability. Facts will prove that the
government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR)
and our compatriots in Hong Kong will surely be able to administer
Hong Kong well in accordance with the Basic Law of the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
Macao will return to the embrace of the motherland in 1999,
another great event of the Chinese nation. All preparations for
Macao's return are being made in an energetic and orderly fashion.
Macao's smooth transition and smooth transfer of government can
certainly be secured and its long-term development and stability
maintained.
</P>
<P>
The concept of "one country, two systems" is an important
component of Deng Xiaoping Theory. The basic idea is that on the
premise of national reunification, the main part of China will
stick to the socialist system while Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao
will retain the current capitalist system and way of life for a
long time to come. This concept is the basic policy for promoting
the great cause of the peaceful reunification of the motherland,
because it not only embodies the principled position of achieving
national reunification and safeguarding state sovereignty, but
also takes into full consideration the past and the present of
Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao and embodies a high degree of
flexibility. The adoption of the policy of "one country, two
systems" is in the interest of the reunification of the motherland
and the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation and conducive to world
peace and development.

<P>
Thanks to the introduction of the basic principles of "peaceful
reunification" and "one country, two systems" as well as other
policies, significant headway has been made in the relations
between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits. The smooth return of
Hong Kong and the maintenance of its long-term prosperity and
stability will undoubtedly create favorable conditions for the
settlement of the Taiwan question. However, the growth of the
splitting tendency on the Taiwan Island and the interference of
certain foreign anti-China forces have stood in the way of
peaceful reunification as big obstacles, which of course have met
with determined opposition from the Chinese people including our
compatriots in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
We shall adhere to the basic principles of "peaceful
reunification" and "one country, two systems" and the eight-point
proposal on developing relations between the two sides and
promoting the peaceful reunification of the motherland. We shall
stick to the principle that there is only one China and oppose
splitting, the "independence of Taiwan", the attempt to create
"two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan" and any interference by
foreign forces. We shall not allow any forces whatsoever to change
Taiwan's status as part of China in any way. We shall work for
peaceful reunification, but we shall not undertake to renounce the
use of force. This is not directed against our compatriots in
Taiwan, but against the interference of foreign forces with
China's reunification and against the schemes to bring about the
"independence of Taiwan". We shall spare no efforts in expanding
economic exchanges and cooperation between the two sides, speed up
the establishment of direct links of postal, air and shipping
services and trade between the two sides and continue to promote
mutual visits of people and exchanges in various fields such as
science, technology and culture. We place our hopes on our
compatriots in Taiwan who are endowed with the glorious tradition
of patriotism. Except for a handful of people who stubbornly cling
to the position of "independence of Taiwan", all parties and
personages of all circles in Taiwan are welcome to exchange views
with us on relations between the two sides and on peaceful
reunification.
</P>
<P>
Now we should like to renew our solemn appeal: As the first
step, the two sides of the Straits can hold negotiations and reach
agreement on "officially ending the state of hostility between the
two sides in accordance with the principle that there is only one
China". On this basis, the two sides can undertake jointly to
safeguard China's sovereignty and territorial integrity and map
out plans for the future development of their relations. We hope
that the Taiwan authorities will earnestly respond to our
suggestions and proposals and enter into political negotiations
with us at an early date. On the premise that there is only one
China, we are prepared to talk about any matter. All opinions and
proposals can be put forward as long as they are in the interest
of the reunification. The question of the reunification of the
motherland should be solved by us Chinese on both sides of the
Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan's future hinges on the reunification of the motherland,
and split is no way out. With full determination, we are capable
of finding a final solution to the Taiwan question. No matter how
many difficulties and obstacles are in store for us, the complete
reunification of the motherland and the all-round rejuvenation of
the Chinese nation will certainly come true, for all the Chinese
on both sides and living elsewhere will proceed from the
fundamental interests of the Chinese nation and go forward hand in
hand.

IX. The International Situation and Our Foreign Policy
</P>
<P>
At present, the international situation as a whole is becoming
more relaxed. Peace and development are the main themes of the
present era. The trend toward multipolarity has further developed
globally or regionally in the political, economic and other
fields. World forces are experiencing a new division and
realignment. Relations between the big powers are undergoing major
and profound adjustments. Regional and intercontinental
organizations of cooperation are active as never before. The
overall strength of the great number of developing countries is
growing. The development of the trend toward multipolarity
contributes to world peace, stability and prosperity. The call of
the people of all countries for treating each other on an equal
footing and living together in amity is becoming louder and
louder. It has become the mainstream of the times to desire peace,
seek cooperation and promote development. The factors safeguarding
world peace are gaining strength. For a fairly long period of time
to come, it will be possible to avert a new world war and secure a
favorable, peaceful international environment and maintain good
relations with our surrounding countries.
</P>
<P>
However, the cold war mentality still exists, and hegemonism
and power politics continue to be the main source of threat to
world peace and stability. Expanding military blocs and
strengthening military alliances will not be conducive to
safeguarding peace and security. The unjust and irrational old
international economic order is still harming the interests of
developing countries, and the gap between the rich and poor
countries is widening. It is still serious that "human rights" and
other issues are used to interfere in the internal affairs of
other countries. Local conflicts due to ethnic, religious and
territorial factors crop up from time to time. The world is not
yet tranquil.
</P>
<P>
We should adhere to Deng Xiaoping's thinking on diplomatic work
and firmly pursue an independent foreign policy of peace. In
international affairs, we should determine our position and
policies by proceeding from the fundamental interests of the
people of China and other countries and judging each case on its
own merits. We shall not yield to any outside pressure or enter
into alliance with any big power or group of countries, nor shall
we establish any military bloc, join in the arms race or seek
military expansion. (39)

<P>
We should oppose hegemonism and safeguard world peace. All
countries should settle their disputes and conflicts through
peaceful consultations instead of resorting to force or the threat
of it. No country should interfere in the internal affairs of
another country under any pretext, still less bully the weak and
invade or subvert other countries. We do not impose our social
system and ideology upon others, nor will we allow other countries
to force theirs upon us.
</P>
<P>
We should work to bring about a just and rational new
international political and economic order. This order should be
based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, conform to
the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter and
reflect the trend of the times to seek peace and development.
</P>
<P>
We should respect the diversity of the world. The world today
is rich and varied. All countries are entitled to choose the
social systems, development strategies and lifestyles that suit
their own conditions. The affairs of a country should be decided
upon by its own people, and global issues should be dealt with
through consultations by all countries.
</P>
<P>
We should uphold the good-neighborly policy. This has been our
consistent stand and will never change. Keeping in mind the
overall objective to maintain peace and stability, we should
settle the disputes between China and the surrounding countries
through friendly consultations and negotiations. Should this fail
to serve the purpose, we can put them aside for the time being,
seeking common ground while reserving differences.
</P>
<P>
We should further strengthen our solidarity and cooperation
with other Third World countries. The developing countries share
the same fundamental goal of safeguarding their independence and
developing the economy. China will, as always, join the vast
number of developing countries in mutual support and close
cooperation in all areas to safeguard the just rights and
interests.

We should further improve and develop our relations with
developed countries on the basis of the Five Principles of
Peaceful Coexistence. All countries should respect each other and
live together in amity regardless of their differences in social
systems and ideologies. They should seek converging points in
their common interests, expand mutually beneficial cooperation and
work together to take up the challenge facing mankind for survival
and development. They should persist in dialogue, not
confrontation, in properly handling their differences by
proceeding from their long-term interests and the overall task of
promoting world peace and development. We are opposed to imposing
or threatening to impose sanctions without good reasons.
</P>
<P>
We should uphold the principle of equality and mutual benefit,
and conduct extensive trade, economic and technological
cooperation and scientific and cultural exchanges with all
countries and regions to promote common development.
</P>
<P>
We should take an active part in multilateral diplomatic
activities and give full play to China's role in the United
Nations and other international organizations.
</P>
<P>
On the basis of the principles of independence, complete
equality, mutual respect and non-interference in each other's
internal affairs, we should develop new types of inter-party
relations of exchange and cooperation with all political parties
of various countries which are ready to have contacts with our
Party with a view to promoting state relations.
</P>
<P>
China is a staunch force safeguarding world peace and regional
stability. In carrying out the socialist modernization program, we
need a long-term peaceful international environment, and above
all, we need to maintain good relations with the surrounding
countries. China's development will not pose a threat to any other
country. China will never seek hegemony even when it becomes
developed in future. The Chinese people, for a long time subjected
to aggression, oppression and humiliation by foreign powers, will
never inflict these sufferings upon others. The future of the
world is bright, though the road is tortuous. The Chinese people
are ready to join hands with the people of other countries in
making unremitting efforts to promote the lofty cause of peace and
development and work for a brighter future for mankind.

X. The Communist Party of China Facing the New Century
</P>
<P>
To hold high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory, fulfill
the tasks defined at this congress and advance our cause to the
21st century in an all-round way, it is essential to uphold,
strengthen and improve the leadership of the Party and do well in
Party building.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party of China is the core of leadership of the
people of all nationalities in China. The leading role of the
Party is determined by its nature of being the vanguard of the
working class and secured after going through ordeals in long
years of struggle. Never in China has there been any political
organization like our Party that has absorbed so many advanced
elements, that is so well organized and broadly based and that has
made so many sacrifices for the Chinese nation. The Party
maintains close ties with the people, and, in its forward march,
is good at reviewing its experience and taking its errors
seriously, thereby formulating and upholding correct theories and
lines. History has entrusted a colossal responsibility to our
Party, and the people place high hopes on it. Having led the
people in writing a glorious chapter in the annals of the 20th
century, it can certainly write another one in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Party leadership and Party building have always been connected
with the historical tasks of the Party and with the theories and
lines it has formulated for accomplishing the tasks. Guided by
Marxism-Leninism and keeping the political line of the Party in
mind, the first generation of collective leadership with Mao
Zedong at the core successfully launched the great project of
Party building -- it established a vanguard of the working class
which led the people in winning victory in the new-democratic
revolution and establishing the socialist system. The second
generation of collective leadership with Deng Xiaoping at the
core, creatively applying Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought
to present-day China, launched another great project of Party
building centering on what kind of party it should be and how to
build it under the conditions of reform, opening up and the
modernization drive. Facing the new century, the Central Committee
is leading the entire Party in advancing this new great project.
The project is designed to make the Party a Marxist political
party that is armed with Deng Xiaoping Theory, that serves the
people wholeheartedly, that is completely consolidated
ideologically, politically, and organizationally, that can
withstand all trials and tribulations, that is always at the
forefront of the times and that leads the people of the country in
building socialism with Chinese characteristics. In light of the
general objectives of the new great project, the entire Party
should strengthen its building in ideology, organization and style
of work, always try to improve its leading and governing ability,
and guard against corruption and degeneration so as to show a new
look and greater militancy in leading the people in accomplishing
the new historical tasks.

<P>
To strengthen Party building organizationally, it is essential
to make the Party the core of strong leadership and give full play
to its organizational strength. Our Party has 58 million members
and 3.4 million primary organizations, organized as an integral
whole according to democratic centralism under the guidance of
Marxism and working hard to achieve its common goal. This is a
tremendous organizational advantage. Under the conditions of
reform, opening to the outside world and developing a socialist
market economy, democratic centralism, instead of being weakened,
must be improved and developed. We should further enhance
democracy, guaranteeing the rights of Party members and clearing
and widening channels for inner-Party democracy so as to give full
play to the initiative and creativity of the whole Party. We
should safeguard the authority of the Central Committee of the
Party and be in agreement with it on ideological and political
matters, ensuring the smooth implementation of the Party's line
and the Central Committee's policy decisions. We should improve
the system of Party congresses and the system whereby the
collective leadership by Party committees at all levels is
combined with division of work and individual responsibility. We
should ensure that local Party committees better play their role
as the leading core in the various organizations at corresponding
levels. Leading cadres should take the lead in observing the
various rules of democratic centralism, protecting the overall
interests, strictly observing discipline, preventing the tendency
to make decisions arbitrarily and go their own way, and opposing
the defiance of orders and prohibitions. In accordance with the
principle of making our cadres more revolutionary, younger, better
educated and more competent professionally, we should foster a
contingent of highly qualified cadres who can meet the
requirements of the socialist modernization drive, for that is the
key to ensuring successive victories for our cause. With emphasis
on building the Party ideologically and politically, we should
turn the leading bodies at all levels into united, staunch
collective leaderships that resolutely carry out the Party's basic
theory and line, serve the people wholeheartedly and are capable
of leading the modernization drive. We should accelerate the
reform of the personnel system relating to cadres, enhance
democracy, improve their assessment, promote their exchanges and
tighten supervision, so that competent people will emerge. In
particular, we should make marked progress showing that our cadres
are ready to go up and equally ready to come down. In selecting
cadres, we must thoroughly carry out the principle of having both
political integrity and professional competence, persist in
appointing people on their merits, oppose favoritism and prevent
or rectify unsound practices. We should promptly promote to
leading posts those cadres who are generally acknowledged as
having firmly carried out the Party's line and scored outstanding
achievements and being honest and clean. Persons who deviate from
the Party's line, seek personal gain, practice fraud and crave
official positions can never be assigned to leading posts. It is a
strategic task to train and select a large number of excellent
young cadres who can shoulder cross-century important tasks. We
must lose no time in fulfilling this task. We should pay great
attention to fostering and promoting women cadres, cadres from
among ethnic minorities and non-Party cadres. We should improve
the cadre retirement system and take good care of veteran cadres
politically and in terms of material benefits, encouraging them to
play their role. The primary Party organizations are the locus of
all the Party's work and the base of its fighting capacity. The
work of consolidating and improving primary Party organizations
should be geared to the Party's basic line and serve its central
task. They should study new situations and problems in a spirit of
reform and improve their methods and style of work and their ways
of conducting activities. They should conscientiously educate,
manage and supervise Party members and enhance their capability of
solving their own problems. In light of their own characteristics,
they should earnestly perform their duties prescribed by the
Constitution of the Party and strive to become a staunch, powerful
force that can carry out the Party's line, principles and policies
and that can unite with the masses and lead them in fulfilling the
tasks of their own units.

To strengthen Party building ideologically, it is essential to
unswervingly arm the entire Party with Deng Xiaoping Theory and
give full play to the ideological and political strength of the
Party. Deng Xiaoping Theory has provided a new powerful
ideological weapon that will enable our Party to understand the
world and to change it. The entire Party should attach great
importance to study, be adept at studying and usher in a new
upsurge in studying Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought and
particularly Deng Xiaoping Theory. Leading cadres at all levels,
and especially the several hundred members of the Party Central
Committee and the several thousand cadres at the provincial and
ministerial levels bear a specially important responsibility in
holding high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory. They should
take the lead in studying that theory and comprehensively and
accurately master its scientific system. They should grasp both
the basic ideas and the essence of the theory in an overall
perspective and systematically analyze and understand the relevant
aspects of the theory in light of the respective fields of their
work. We should continue to educate the cadres at and above the
county level in Party spirit and conduct, focusing mainly on the
need to study, to be political-minded and to be honest and
upright. We shall make it a common practice within the entire
Party to study conscientiously, hold democratic discussions, try
to explore new ways and be realistic and pragmatic. We should
continue to integrate theory with practice, study for the sake of
application, acquire a better understanding of the theory of
Marxism, learn to better solve practical problems and transform
our subjective world while transforming the objective world.

<P>
To improve the Party's style of work, it is essential to stick
o the aim of serving the people wholeheartedly and give full play
to the Party's strength in forging close links with the masses.
The fine work styles of integrating theory with practice, forging
close links with the masses and practicing criticism and
self-criticism, which our Party has cultivated in the process of
long struggle, are a reflection of its nature and purpose and
should be carried forward throughout the Party in light of new
practice. Coming from the people and taking root among them, our
Party serves the people. To work for the people's interests
wholeheartedly is the starting point as well as the purpose of all
our work for building socialism with Chinese characteristics.
Party members should listen to the opinions of the masses, help
alleviate their hardships and do practical things in their
interest. Party cadres, especially leading cadres, must faithfully
carry out the Party's line, principles and policies without any
deviation from them. They must correctly exercise the power
entrusted to them by the people and must never abuse it for
personal gain. They must combine responsibility to their superiors
with responsibility to the masses, never separating the two or
setting them against each other. In their work they must uphold
the mass line, go deep into the realities for investigation and
study, and never indulge in bureaucracy, formalism or coercion. So
long as we serve the interests of the masses and have faith in and
rely on them in everything we do, our Party will obtain an
inexhaustible source of strength.
</P>
<P>
The fight against corruption is a grave political struggle
vital to the very existence of the Party and the state. Our Party
can never be daunted and vanquished by any enemy. But the easiest
way to capture a fortress is from within, so in no way should we
destroy ourselves. If corruption cannot be punished effectively,
our Party will lose the confidence and support of the people. We
should fight corruption and continuously give the warning
throughout the process of reform and opening to the outside world.
We should be mentally prepared to fight a protracted war against
corruption, and we should win battles one by one and stage by
stage. We should continue to make sure that leading cadres are
clean, honest and self-disciplined, investigate and deal with
major cases and rectify unsound practices in departments and
trades. Party committees at all levels must take a clear-cut stand
and firmly persevere in this work. We should seek both temporary
and permanent solutions. Education is the basis, the legal system
is the guarantee, and supervision is the key. By deepening the
reform, we should keep eradicating the hotbed for the breeding and
spreading of corruption. With Party committees exercising unified
leadership, Party and government organs exerting concerted
efforts, discipline inspection commissions organizing and
coordinating the work and departments assuming their respective
responsibilities, and relying on the support and participation of
the masses, we shall resolutely check corruption. Leading cadres,
especially senior ones, should play an exemplary role in observing
discipline and the law, readily accept supervision and resist the
corrosion of decadent ideas, setting an example of working hard
and performing their official duties honestly and leading the
people in resolutely fighting corruption. We should combine the
fight against corruption with the purification of Party
organizations, never allowing corruptionists to hide themselves
within the Party.

<P>
Being strict within the Party is the guarantee for maintaining
the Party's advanced nature and purity and enhancing its
cohesiveness and fighting capacity. We are striving to advance
toward the maximum program -- the ultimate realization of
communism. Those who forget this lofty goal are not qualified
Party members and neither are those who do not exert themselves to
achieve the Party's program for the primary stage of socialism.
Under the new historical conditions, to maintain their advanced
nature, Party members should meet the requirements of the times.
They should have lofty communist ideals in mind, take the lead in
implementing the various policies of the Party and the state for
the present stage, be brave in blazing new trails, and take the
initiative to make progress in defiance of difficulties and
setbacks. They should work for the interests of the people
sincerely, be the first to endure hardships and the last to enjoy
comforts, devote themselves to public duties wholeheartedly and
make more contributions. They should study Marxism assiduously,
enhance their ability to differentiate between right and wrong,
master professional knowledge and skills necessary for their jobs
and strive for outstanding achievements. At the critical moment
they should step forward boldly, safeguard the interests of the
state and the people and resolutely combat acts harmful to the
people, society and the state. Party committees at all levels
should adhere to the principle that "the Party should supervise
itself", carry out the policy of being strict within the Party in
all aspects of Party building and firmly rectify the phenomena of
lax discipline and weakness existing within the Party. We should,
therefore, act in strict accordance with the Constitution of the
Party and in line with the Party's rules and regulations. We
should be strict with Party members, leading cadres in particular,
and strictly manage and supervise them. In inner-Party life we
should stress Party spirit and principles, conduct active
ideological struggle, encourage healthy trends and oppose
unhealthy practices. We should admit new members in strict
accordance with the requirements prescribed in the Party
Constitution and see to it that unqualified members are duly dealt
with. We should enforce Party discipline to the letter, ensuring
that all members are equal before discipline. Strict in discipline
and full of vigor and vitality, our Party will surely advance from
victory to victory.

<P>
Comrades,
</P>
<P>
The five years from this congress to the Sixteenth National
Congress of the Party will be a period in which we shall stand new
tests and achieve new victories; a period in which we shall prove
with new achievements that our Party, carrying out Comrade Deng
Xiaoping's behests, is capable of living up to the people's
expectations and opening new horizons for our cause; and a period
in which we shall implement the Ninth Five-Year Plan in an
all-round way and lay the foundation for achieving the long-range
objectives through the year 2010. Now we can say with complete
certainty that the objective of a fairly comfortable life for the
end of this century set by our Party in the early days of reform
and opening up can be achieved as scheduled. It is of great
significance to enter and build up a society leading a fairly
comfortable life in such a country as China with a population of
more than one billion. This will lay a new foundation for the
long-term stability of the country and create a new starting point
for vigorously promoting the socialist modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
The soul of the current congress is to hold high the great
banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory. This will be the hallmark of this
congress in the annals of history. We have struck out a bright
path, but the road ahead is not altogether smooth. We may
encounter various difficulties and risks, predictable or
unpredictable, from within China or from without, and in our
economic life or social and political life. No difficulties and
risks can shake our faith in Deng Xiaoping Theory but will only
encourage us to use it more conscientiously to overcome them on
our way to success. Upholding Deng Xiaoping Theory and continuing
to enrich and creatively develop it in practice are a solemn
historic responsibility of the collective leadership of the Party
Central Committee and the entire Party membership.
</P>
<P>
The task of this congress is to mobilize the whole Party and
the people of all nationalities of the country to unite and work
hard for an all-round advancement of the great cause of building
socialism with Chinese characteristics. Unity is in our overall
interest, and unity is strength. First of all our Party should be
united, and Party organizations at all levels should strengthen
unity. Meanwhile, we should maintain close cooperation between the
Party and the democratic parties and our friends in various
circles, cement close ties between our Party and the masses and
consolidate and develop the great unity of the entire people. This
unity is based on the common interests of all-round rejuvenation
of the Chinese nation and on the common ideal of building
socialism with Chinese characteristics. With the entire Party
membership and the people of all our nationalities safeguarding
and strengthening this unity, our cause will be invincible.
</P>
<P>
Let us hold high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory,
closely rally around the Party Central Committee, work hard
unyieldingly and with one heart and one mind and carry forward in
an all-round way the great cause of building socialism with
Chinese characteristics to the 21st century!

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Cabinet to Discuss Devolution Proposals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan President
Chandrika Kumaratunga will present her government's proposed
constitutional reforms and devolution proposals at a special
cabinet meeting to be held at the end of this month, government
sources disclosed today.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is scheduled to be held on September 29 and the
government will forward the parliament the final draft of the
constitutional reforms and the proposals for devolution in the
first week of October.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the People's Alliance (PA), the ruling party
which consists of six political parties, is to continue its
informal talks with the United National Party (UNP), the Tamil and
Muslim political parties on the proposed reforms.
</P>
<P>
The proposals put forward by the UNP for an independent
election commission and an independent police commission will be
also discussed on the cabinet meeting, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
If the UNP fail to give its approval to the final draft of the
proposed reforms, the government will seek a referendum in March,
1998, they added.
</P>
<P>
The devolution draft, which was proposed in 1995 by President
Kumaratunga, aims at solving the ethnic conflicts between the
Sinhala and the Tamils through a political way.
</P>
<P>
But the Tamil rebels have made it clear that they will not
accept any proposals like this. The rebels have been fighting a
14-year war for an independent country of their own in the
country's northeastern region.
</P>
<P>
The proposals need to win a two-thirds majority in the 225-seat
parliament to be adopted. The UNP, which holds 94 parliament
seats, hasn't expressed its support yet.

<P>
COLOMBO, September 21 (Xinhua) -- All police and security
personnel have been put on a round the clock "red alert" in

<P>
The collectively-owned sector is an important component of the
public sector of the economy. The collective economy is able to
reflect the principle of common prosperity, extensively absorb
funds that are scattered in society, ease employment pressure and
help increase public accumulation and state tax revenue. We should
support, encourage and help diverse forms of collective economy in
the urban and rural areas in their development. This will be of
great significance to the public sector of the economy in playing
its dominant role.
</P>
<P>
Public ownership can and should take multiple forms in its
realization. All governance methods and organizational forms that
reflect the laws relating to socialized production may be utilized
boldly. We should strive to seek various forms for realizing
public ownership that can greatly promote the growth of the
productive forces. The joint stock system is a form of capital
organization of modern enterprises, which is favorable to
separating ownership from management and raising the efficiency of
the operation of enterprises and capital. It can be used both
under capitalism and under socialism. We cannot say in general
terms that the joint stock system is public or private, for the
key lies in who holds the controlling share. If the state or a
collective holds the controlling share, it obviously shows the
characteristics of public ownership, which is favorable to
expanding the area of control by public capital and enhancing the
dominant role of public ownership. Now there have appeared a large
number of diverse forms of joint stock cooperative ventures in the
urban and rural areas. They are new things arising in the process
of reform. We should support them, give them guidance, constantly
sum up their experience and improve them. What should be specially
advocated and encouraged is the kind of collective economy that
features, in the main, the association of laborers in labor and
their association in capital.
</P>
<P>
The non-public sector is an important component part of our
socialist market economy. We should continue to encourage and
guide the non-public sector comprising self-employed and private
businesses to facilitate its sound development. This is of great
importance to satisfying the diverse needs of the people, creating
new jobs and promoting the development of the national economy.
</P>
<P>
It is necessary to improve the legal system concerning property
and protect the legitimate rights and interests of and fair
competition among all types of enterprises and at the same time
exercise supervision over them according to law.

(2) Accelerate the reform of state-owned enterprises.
State-owned enterprises constitute the pillar of the national
economy. Well-executed reform of state-owned enterprises is of
vital importance to building a socialist market economy and
consolidating the socialist system.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of a modern enterprise system is the
orientation of the reform of state-owned enterprises. We shall
corporatize large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises
according to the requirements of "clearly established ownership,
well defined power and responsibility, separation of enterprise
from administration, and scientific management" so that they will
become corporate entities and competitors adaptable to the market.
We shall define more clearly the powers and responsibilities of
the state and enterprises. The state will enjoy the owner's equity
according to the amount of capital it has put into the enterprises
and bear limited liabilities of enterprises while enterprises will
operate independently according to law, responsible for their own
profits and losses. The government should not directly interfere
in the operation of enterprises, and enterprises have to be
restrained by the owner and should not harm the owner's equity. We
shall adopt all kinds of possible means, including direct
financing, to replenish the capital of enterprises. We shall
cultivate and develop a diversity of investors in order to push
the separation of administrative functions from enterprise
management and change the way enterprises operate.
</P>
<P>
We should combine the reform of state-owned enterprises with
their reorganization, upgrading and better management. Aiming at
improving the state sector of the economy as a whole, we shall
effectuate a strategic reorganization of state-owned enterprises
by managing well large enterprises while relaxing the control over
small ones and invigorating them. By using capital as the linkage
and relying on the market forces, we shall establish highly
competitive large enterprise groups with trans-regional,
inter-trade, cross-ownership and trans-national operations. We
shall quicken the pace in relaxing the control over small
state-owned enterprises and invigorating them by way of
reorganization, association, merger, leasing, contract operation,
the joint stock cooperative system or sell-off. We shall promote
technological progress of enterprises, encouraging and channeling
the flow of funds of enterprises and society into technological
upgrading so as to form a new mechanism for the development of
market-oriented new products and technological innovations.
Strengthening scientific management, we should try to institute in
enterprises a system of governance and a system of organization
and management that conform to the law of the market economy and
the national conditions, and set up a decision-making, enforcement
and supervision system so as to form an effective incentive and
control mechanism. We shall improve leaderships of enterprises,
give play to the role of Party organizations there as political
nuclei and adhere to the principle of relying on the working class
wholeheartedly.

<P>
We should encourage merger of enterprises, standardize
bankruptcy procedures, divert laid-off workers, increase
efficiency by downsizing staff and encourage reemployment projects
so as to form a competitive mechanism selecting the superior and
eliminating the inferior. With the deepening of enterprise
reforms, technological progress and readjustment of the economic
structure, it is hard to avoid personnel mobility and lay-off. It
will cause temporary difficulties to part of the workers. But,
fundamentally speaking, it is conducive to economic development,
conforming to the long-term interests of the working class. The
Party and the government will take active measures and rely on all
quarters of society to show concern for laid-off workers, help
them with their welfare, organize job training, open up new
avenues of employment and promote the reemployment project.
Workers should change their ideas about employment and improve
their own quality to meet the new requirements of reform and
development.
</P>
<P>
We should press ahead with all the supportive reforms. We shall
build an effective mechanism for the management, supervision and
operation of state assets to preserve or increase their value and
prevent the loss of state assets. We shall build a social security
system, introducing old-age pension and medical insurance systems
by combining social pools with individual accounts, and improve
the unemployment insurance and social relief systems so as to
provide the basic social security. We shall establish public
accumulation funds for urban housing and accelerate the reform of
the housing system.
</P>
<P>
To deepen the reform of state-owned enterprises is an important
yet arduous task of the whole Party. We should be firm in
determination and bold in exploration and practice to make sure
that by the end of this century most of the large and medium-sized
state-owned key enterprises will have initially established a
modern enterprise system and markedly improved their operation,
thus breaking fresh ground in the reform and development of
state-owned enterprises.

(3) Improve the structure and mode of distribution. We shall
keep to the system in which distribution according to work is
dominant and in which a variety of modes of distribution coexist.
By combining remuneration according to work and remuneration
according to factors of production and by giving priority to
efficiency with due consideration to fairness, such a system is
conducive to optimizing the allocation of resources, promoting
economic development and maintaining social stability. We shall
protect lawful incomes according to law, allowing and encouraging
part of the people to get wealthy first through honest labor and
lawful operations, and allowing and encouraging the participation
of capital, technology and other factors of production in the
distribution of gains. Illegal earnings shall be banned and those
who appropriate public property or seek gains by such illegal
means as tax dodge and evasion or by striking deals between power
and money shall be resolutely punished according to law. We shall
check irrational incomes and we must correct the malpractice of
individuals obtaining extra incomes by taking advantage of
sectoral monopoly and some special privileges. We shall regulate
the excessively high incomes, improve the individual income tax
system, and introduce such new taxes as inheritance tax. We shall
standardize income distribution so as to make income gaps more
reasonable and prevent polarization.
</P>
<P>
To concentrate financial strength on improving the state
finance is an essential requirement for ensuring the development
of all economic and social undertakings. It is necessary to handle
correctly the relations of distribution among the state,
enterprises and individuals and between the central and local
authorities so as to gradually raise the proportion of fiscal
revenue in the gross national product and the proportion of the
central government revenue in the national revenue and, at the
same time, readjust the revenue and expenditure structure to adapt
to the changed ownership structure and the changed government
functions and establish a secure and balanced state finance.

(4) Give full play to the role of the market mechanism and
improve the macroeconomic control system. We should accelerate the
process of building a complete market system in the national
economy. We shall continue to develop all kinds of markets, with
emphasis on markets for capital, labor, technology and other
production factors, and improve the mechanism for pricing these
factors. We shall reform the circulation system, improve market
rules, strengthen market management, remove obstacles to market
development, break regional blockade and sectoral monopoly so as
to build as soon as possible a unified and open market system with
orderly competition and make better use of the basic role of the
market in the allocation of resources.
</P>
<P>
The main task of macroeconomic control is to keep a balance
between aggregate demand and aggregate supply, curtail inflation,
promote the optimization of the major economic structures and
achieve a steady economic growth. In macroeconomic control, we
should mainly employ both economic and legal means. We shall
deepen the reforms of the banking, fiscal and planning systems so
as to improve the means of macroeconomic control and the
coordinating mechanism. We shall carry out appropriately tight
financial and monetary policies, keeping an eye on the degree of
the control. We shall, in accordance with the law, strengthen the
supervision of the financial institutions and markets, including
the securities market, standardize and safeguard the financial
order, and effectively guard against and eliminate financial
risks.
</P>
<P>
(5) Strengthen agriculture as the foundation of the economy,
and readjust and optimize the economic structure. In line with our
economic development and taking into full account the trend of
accelerated development of science and technology in the world and
the speedy regrouping in the international economic structure, we
should make strategic readjustments in the economic structure
aimed at improving the quality and performance of the entire
national economy in an all-round way and at boosting the overall
national strength and international competitiveness. This is a
pressing requirement of the national economic development and a
long-term task. The general principles are as follows: with market
as the orientation, to make production respond to the changing
demand of the domestic and foreign markets; to optimize the
industrial structure by relying on scientific and technological
progress; to bring about a coordinated development of regional
economies by giving scope to the advantages of different
localities; and to change the mode of economic growth, putting an
end to the situation featuring high input, low output, high
consumption and low efficiency.

DHAKA, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh Prime Minister
sheikh Hasina has asked the people and her party workers to face
with patience all conspiracies designed to foil the country's
political stability and economic progress, the independent United
News of Bangladesh (UNB) reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Awami League (People's League) is ready to make "more
sacrifices for the country's interest but will not allow any
quarter to play with the nation's destiny," the prime minister was
quoted as saying Saturday at a meeting of the Central Working
Committee of the ruling Awami League.
</P>
<P>
"Conspirators involved in conspiracies against the interest of
the people, and the country will not be tolerated, whatever party
they belong to," she warned.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister advised the League workers to work hard for
the people who would obviously evaluate their work one day.
</P>
<P>
Those who have amassed wealth through illegal means will
certainly face the wrath of the people, the prime minister

We should continue to give priority to agriculture in all our
economic work, keep the Party's basic rural policies stable,
deepen rural reforms and see to it that agriculture and the rural
economy develop and the peasants' income increases. We shall
increase input through multiple channels, improve agricultural
infrastructure and constantly better production conditions. We
shall step up the effort to develop agriculture by relying on
science and education, aiming at high yield, fine quality and high
efficiency as well as good water-saving results. We shall promote
an industrial management of agriculture to get production,
processing and marketing integrated and supporting each other so
that agriculture will develop toward commercialization,
specialization and modernization. We shall develop farming,
forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production and fishery in an
all-round way and continue to develop town and township
enterprises so as to bring into being a rational industrial
structure. We shall do well in planning and building up small
towns and cities. We shall keep stable for a long time to come the
household responsibility contract system with remuneration linked
to output, improve the two-tier operation system that combines
unified management with independent management and gradually boost
the strength of the collective economy. We shall reform the grain
and cotton purchasing and marketing system and introduce a
rational pricing policy. We shall set up and improve a socialized
service system for agriculture, a farm produce market system and a
system of state support and protection. We must respect the
decision-making power of peasants in their production and
operations, protect their legitimate rights and interests and
really lighten their burdens so that the broad masses of the
peasants will truly benefit from the various rural policies and
the work of the Party.

<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Russia is opposed to
Romania's bid for NATO membership, Jan Diaconescu, chairman of the
Romanian Chamber of Deputies, said upon his return from Moscow
today.
</P>
<P>
Diaconescu paid a four-day visit in Russia as the head of a
parliamentary delegation.
</P>
<P>
He said he and Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov had
discussed the issue of giving back the treasures belonging to
Romania by Russia. But the Russian side refused to negotiate, he
indicated.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that during World War I, the Romanian royal
family sent some treasures to the former Soviet Union for
preservation. So far these treasures have not been returned to
Romania.
</P>
<P>
A commentary carried by the Truth daily said the Romania-Russia
relations have not been on track since 1989. The two countries
have not signed any basic agreement and their economic ties are
far from satisfactory.

We should transform and upgrade traditional industries, develop
rising and high-tech industries and try to informationize the
national economy. We shall continue to strengthen infrastructure
and basic industries, intensify the readjustment and upgrading of
the processing industry, invigorate pillar industries and actively
cultivate new points of economic growth. We shall combine the
efforts to develop new technologies, products and industries with
the efforts to open up markets and integrate the development of
technology-intensive with labor-intensive industries. We encourage
and guide the tertiary industry so that it will develop at an
accelerated pace.
</P>
<P>
We should promote a rational distribution and coordinated
development of regional economies. Taking full advantage of its
favorable conditions, the eastern part of the country should
strive for a still higher level of development in the course of
reform and opening up, and take the lead in achieving basic
modernization where conditions permit. The central and western
parts should speed up the reform, opening up and development, make
use of their advantages in natural resources and develop related
industries. The state will increase its support for the central
and western parts by giving them priority in planning
infrastructure and resources development projects, instituting
step by step a standard transfer payment system, and encouraging
both Chinese and overseas investors to invest in the regions. It
is necessary to further develop all forms of association and
cooperation between the eastern and the central and western parts.
We shall pay more attention and give active support to areas
inhabited by ethnic minorities in their economic development. We
must try all possible ways to minimize the regional development
disparities step by step. Proceeding from their actual conditions,
all regions should develop their economies with distinct local
characteristics, speed up the upgrading of old industrial bases,
let the central cities play their role, and continue to guide the
formation of trans-regional economic zones and key industrial
belts. We shall accelerate the reform of investment and financing
systems, improve state industrial policies, and take measures to
solve such problems as launching "large and all-inclusive" and
"small and all-inclusive" projects and irrational and duplicated
construction projects.

(6) Implement the strategies of developing the country by
relying on science and education and of achieving sustainable
development. Science and technology being a primary productive
force, their progress is a decisive factor in economic
development. We must take full account of the great impact of the
future development of science and technology, particularly high
technology, on the overall national strength, social and economic
structures and the life of the people and make the acceleration of
their progress a vital task in economic and social development. In
this way we shall really get onto the path of developing our
economy by relying on scientific and technological progress and
improving the quality of laborers. In drawing up long- and
medium-term science development programs, we should proceed from
China's long-term development requirements, bear in mind the
overall situation, highlight key areas and, trying to do certain
things and refraining from doing other things, strengthen basic
researches and researches in high technology and accelerate the
pace of applying high technology to production. We should
intensify the development and spread of applied technologies,
promote the translation of scientific and technological
achievements into practical productive forces, and concentrate on
tackling major and key technological problems in economic and
social development. We should import, with our priorities in mind
and on a selective basis, advanced technologies from abroad with a
view to enhancing our own abilities of independent creation. As a
developing country, China should attach greater importance to the
application of the latest technological achievements and bring
about a leap in its technological development.
</P>
<P>
We should deepen the reform of the management systems of
science, technology and education to promote their integration
with the economy. We should give full scope to the roles of the
market, and social demand in orienting and promoting scientific
and technological progress, and encourage and help enterprises to
engage in research, development and technological upgrading so
that they will undertake to engage in research and development and
invest in them. Wherever conditions permit, research institutes
and institutions of higher learning should combine production,
teaching and research by entering into association or cooperation
with enterprises in various ways so as to solve the problems of
segmentation and dispersal of strength in the management systems
of science, technology and education. Innovation, competition and
cooperation should be encouraged. We shall implement the regime of
protecting intellectual property rights. Competent people being
the most important resource for scientific and technological
progress and economic and social development, we should institute
a whole set of incentive mechanisms favorable to the training and
use of such people. We should actively bring in intellectual
resources from overseas, and encourage those studying abroad to
return and work or render their service to the motherland in one
way or another.

As a populous country, relatively short of natural resources,
China must implement a sustainable development strategy in the
modernization drive. We should stick to the basic state policies
of family planning and environmental protection, correctly
handling the relationship of economic development versus
population, natural resources and the environment. While
exploiting our natural resources and making economical use of
them, we lay emphasis on the latter so as to raise the efficiency
of their utilization. We should make an overall plan for the
development and improvement of our land resources and rigorously
enforce laws governing the management and protection of such
resources as land, water, forests, minerals and seas. We shall
institute a system of paid use of natural resources. We must
strengthen the control of environmental pollution and improve the
ecological environment by planting trees and grass, doing well in
the conservation of water and soil, and preventing and controlling
desertification. With regard to population, we should control its
growth and improve its quality, and pay attention to the problem
of population aging.
</P>
<P>
(7) Strive to do better in opening to the outside world.
Opening to the outside world is a long-term basic state policy.
Confronted with the globalization trend in the economic,
scientific and technological development, we should take an even
more active stance in the world by improving the pattern of
opening up in all directions, at all levels and in a wide range,
developing an open economy, enhancing our international
competitiveness, optimizing our economic structure and improving
the quality of our national economy.
</P>
<P>
Focusing on better results, we should expand external trade in
commodities and service and optimize the import and export mix. We
shall stick to the strategy of achieving success on the strength
of quality and a multi-outlet market, and vigorously open up
markets abroad. We shall further lower the general level of
tariffs and encourage the import of advanced technologies and key
equipment. We shall deepen the reform of the system of trade and
economic relations with foreign countries, improving the agency
system and expanding the power of enterprises to handle their own
foreign trade so as to create a policy environment for competition
on an equal footing. We shall take an active part in regional
economic cooperation and the global system of multilateral
trade.

step by step. In accordance with the law, we shall protect the
rights and interests of foreign-funded enterprises, grant them the
national treatment and improve guidance to and regulation of these
enterprises. We shall encourage investing abroad in areas that can
bring China's comparative advantages into play. We shall make
better use of both Chinese and foreign markets and resources. We
shall improve and enforce laws and regulations governing China's
trade and economic relations with foreign countries. We must
correctly handle the relationship of opening up versus
independence and self-reliance, and safeguard the economic
security of the country.
</P>

We should better operate the special economic zones and the
Pudong New Area in Shanghai, encouraging them to continue to march

industries and opening wider to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
(8) Continue to improve the standard of living of the people.
Raising the standard of living of the people is the fundamental
goal of the reform, opening up and economic development. We should
enable the people to enjoy a fairly comfortable life on the basis
of economic growth and then move on toward higher standards. We
shall try to increase the income of the people in real terms in
both urban and rural areas, and broaden the range of consumption
with proper guidance. While improving the people's material
well-being, we shall enrich their cultural life and beautify their
environment to enhance the quality of life. Special efforts will
be made to improve housing, sanitation, transportation and
communication conditions and expand the range of service
consumption. We shall continue to build more public and social
welfare facilities and improve the level of education and medical
and health care. We shall adopt a policy that will ensure the
basic standard of living for urban residents in difficulty. The
state will adopt a variety of measures in a greater effort to
fight poverty, striving to accomplish in the main the task of
providing adequate food and clothing for the impoverished people
in rural areas by the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
Comrades, The goals and tasks we have set forth for the
economic reform and development represent the fundamental
interests of the people and can be accomplished only by relying on
the initiative and creativeness of the people and their hard work.
As long as we persist in pursuing correct policies and in properly
guiding, protecting and tapping the initiative of all quarters of
society, we shall definitely succeed in establishing a socialist
market economy and bringing about a sustained, rapid and sound
development of the national economy.

<HEADLINE> China Aims at Breakthrough in Reform of State Firms, Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 21 (Xinhua) -- China will strive to attain
a breakthrough in the reform of the state-owned enterprise sector
within three years, a senior official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Dai Xianglong, governor of the People's Bank of China, said
China will achieve the target by encouraging the development of
the share-holding system and joint-equity cooperatives.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the 49th meeting of the Interim Committee of the
IMF Board of Governors on the International Monetary System, Dai
said the Chinese government also will take substantial measures
such as merging, bankruptcy and increased diversification of
ownership.
</P>
<P>
Dai said that the Chinese economy has achieved an economic
"soft-landing" and entered a healthy track of high growth and low
inflation through its "steadfast pursuit of moderately tight
macroeconomic policies".
</P>
<P>
In the first half of this year, the real gross domestic product
grew by annualized 9.5 percent, retail price inflation was 4.1
percent over the same period last year, and the balance of
payments position was further strengthened, according to Dai, who
is here to attend the joint annual meetings of the World Bank and
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on September 23-25.
</P>
<P>
"The current favorable macro-economic environment is conducive
to the acceleration of structural reforms," Dai said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that China will continue to implement moderately
tight fiscal and monetary policies and fine-tune policy stance, so
as to sustain an annual economic growth rate of eight percent and
keep inflation below five percent in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
The governor noted that the Chinese government will firmly
implement the basic policy of "One Country, Two Systems," the
Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong with a high degree of
autonomy, to keep Hong Kong's current social and economic systems
unchanged, and basically retain the legal system.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese central government believes that the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (SAR) is capable of maintaining the
stability of the Hong Kong dollar which came under speculative
attacks during the recent currency turmoil in Southeast Asia, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the Hong Kong dollar has remained stable, Dai also
stressed that the central government will lend its unstinting
support to the Hong Kong dollar if necessary.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Promises More Open to Foreign Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Thailand will open the door
wider for foreign investment to boost economic recovery, a senior
Thai official said.
</P>
<P>
Thailand will also fulfill its commitment to the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) program, Thai Finance Minister Thanong Bidaya
said on Saturday before he was leaving Bangkok for the IMF/World
Bank meeting in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Thanong said that he would tell the same thing at the meeting
in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's economic fundamentals remained strong and it was
still an attractive place for foreign investors, he said.
</P>
<P>
To demonstrate its commitment to the IMF program, Thailand's
budget deficit for this fiscal year ending this month would be
capped at 52 billion baht (1.5 billion U.S. dollars), he said.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government also would take measures to curb investment
by the state enterprises and speed up the privatization of several
state enterprises this year.
</P>
<P>
The Thai finance minister also noted that Thailand's bankruptcy
law will be amended to help protect foreign investors who helped
bail out cash-strapped Thai companies.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers said that the IMF board Saturday agreed to
increase the quotas of member countries' contributions to it by 45
percent, which would raise the IMF's total quota capital to 285
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The move is aimed at giving the fund more resources to provide
help in cases such as the recent crisis in Thailand, the
newspapers added.

<HEADLINE> One Million Italians Rally for National Unity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 20 (Xinhua) -- An estimated one million
Italians flocked to Milan and Venice today for a massive
union-organized demonstration against secession.
</P>
<P>
Buses carrying demonstrators from across Italy poured into
Milan throughout the morning, where organizers said up to one
million had gathered by noon time.
</P>
<P>
The left-wing Communist Refoundation leader Fausto Bertinotti
said the Milan event was "a sacrosanct battle" for national unity.
</P>
<P>
In Venice, where up to 80,000 crowded the central San Marco
Square, Sergion D'Antoni, leader of the Italian Confederation of
Working People's Trade Union called for "more social cohesion in a
united Italy."
</P>
<P>
"I've never seen such a massive demonstration," said Venice
Mayor Massimo Cacciari.
</P>
<P>
Today's demonstrations dwarfed Sunday's Northern League rally
in Venice, which drew only about 15,000 people.
</P>
<P>
During that demonstration, the Northern League leader Umberto
Bossi declared the establishment of his self-styled northern state
of "Padania" and "elections" were planned there next month for
its "parliament."
</P>
<P>
His remarks drew a stern rebuke from Prime Minister Romano
Prodi, who said the separatist party must respect the law.
</P>
<P>
"Today, we see an Italy which knows that the only way to reform
society, the economy and the state is by remaining united," said
Fabio Mussi, a senior member of the Democratic Party of the Left,
the largest party in Italy's central-left governing coalition.

-- Building a socialist culture with Chinese characteristics
means taking Marxism as the guidance, aiming at training citizens
so that they have high ideals, moral integrity, a good education
and a strong sense of discipline, and developing a national,
scientific and popular socialist culture geared to the needs of
modernization, of the world and of the future. To do this, we
should persist in arming the whole Party and educating the people
with Deng Xiaoping Theory; we should strive to raise the
ideological and ethical standards and the educational, scientific
and cultural levels of the whole nation; and we should adhere to
the orientation of serving the people and socialism and the
principle of "letting a hundred flowers blossom and a hundred
schools of thought contend", laying emphasis on progress and
boosting academic activities, art and literature. We should foster
socialist ideology and ethics by basing ourselves on China's
reality, carrying on the fine cultural traditions handed down from
history and assimilating the advances of foreign cultures. The
aforementioned basic targets and policies for building a socialist
economy, politics and culture with Chinese characteristics are
well integrated and inseparable. They constitute the basic program
of the Party for the primary stage of socialism. This program is
an important part of Deng Xiaoping Theory, an elaboration of the
Party's basic line in the economic, political and cultural fields
and a summary of the major experience gained over the years.
</P>
<P>
V. Economic Restructuring and Economic Development Strategy
</P>
<P>
The period from the present to the first decade of the next
century will be crucial for China to realize its strategic
objective of the second step before marching toward that of the
third step. We must promote the fundamental shift of the economic
system and of the mode of economic growth, fulfill the Ninth
Five-Year Plan and attain the long-range objectives through the
year 2010 so as to lay a solid foundation for achieving basic
modernization by the middle of the next century. During this
period, we must solve two major problems, that is, how to
establish a more or less ideal socialist market economy and how to
maintain a sustained, rapid and sound development of the national
economy. Keeping to the orientation of building a socialist market
economy, we must strive for new breakthroughs in some major
aspects of our reform and make substantial progress in optimizing
the economic structure, developing science and technology and
raising the level of opening up, so as really to find a way to
coordinated development of the economy featuring a fairly high
speed, fairly good performance and constant improvement of the
quality of the economy as a whole.

(1) Readjust and improve the ownership structure. It is China's
basic economic system for the primary stage of socialism to keep
public ownership in a dominant position and to have diverse forms
of ownership develop side by side. The establishment of such a
system is determined by the socialist nature and the reality of
China in the primary stage of socialism: First, being a socialist
country, China must keep public ownership as the foundation of its
socialist economic system; second, being in the primary stage of
socialism, China needs to develop diverse forms of ownership with
public ownership in the dominant position; and third, any form of
ownership that meets the criterion of the "three favorables" can
and should be utilized to serve socialism.
</P>
<P>
Since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central
Committee, our Party has earnestly reviewed its past experience
and lessons with regard to the ownership issue, formulated the
principle of keeping public ownership in a dominant position and
having diverse economic sectors develop side by side, gradually
removing the fetters of the irrational ownership structure on the
productive forces and bringing about a situation featuring
multiple forms in the realization of public ownership with all
sectors of the economy developing side by side. It remains a major
task in the economic restructuring to continue readjusting and
improving the ownership structure so as to further release and
develop the productive forces.
</P>
<P>
We should have an all-round understanding of the meaning of the
public sector of the economy. The public sector includes not only
the state- and collectively-owned sectors, but also the state- and
collectively-owned elements in the sector of mixed ownership. The
dominant position of public ownership should manifest itself
mainly as follows: Public assets dominate in the total assets in
society; the state-owned sector controls the life-blood of the
national economy and plays a leading role in economic development.
This is the case for the country as a whole. There may be
differences in some localities and industries. Dominance of the
public assets should feature in quantitative terms, but more so in
terms of improved quality. The leading role of the state-owned
sector should manifest itself mainly in its control capability. We
should make a strategic readjustment of the layout of the
state-owned sector of the economy. The state-owned sector must be
in a dominant position in major industries and key areas that
concern the life-blood of the national economy. But in other
areas, efforts should be made to reorganize assets and readjust
the structure so as to strengthen the focal points and improve the
quality of the state assets as a whole. On the premise that we
keep public ownership in the dominant position, that the state
controls the life-blood of the national economy and that the
state-owned sector has stronger control capability and is more
competitive, even if the state-owned sector accounts for a smaller
proportion of the economy, this will not affect the socialist
nature of our country.

<HEADLINE> Costa Rica to Pay 45 Million Dollars for Rice Imports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Costa Rica will spend 45
million U.S. dollars to import rice by the end of 1997, the Costa
Rican Rice Industrialists National Association said today.
</P>
<P>
The association reported that the country imported 27 million
dollars of rice up to August this year.
</P>
<P>
Rice is the most important staple food in Costa Rica, which
consumes 15,646 tons of rice a month.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rica has become a rice importer in the 1990s when local
production could not meet the domestic demand.
</P>
<P>
The El Nino climate phenomenon caused a loss of 29,400 tons of
grain this year, which forced Costa Rica to import a minimum of
40,000 tons of rice in the year.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the country imported 32 million dollars (at the
present exchange rate) of unprocessed rice.

LIMA, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Coca leaf trade has dropped by
18 percent this year in Peru compared with last year, anti-drug

Health Minister Marino Costa Bauer said that the area
cultivated with coca plants decreased by 18 percent during 1996,
from 115,000 hectares to 95,000 hectares.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Banker Calls for Good Economic Fundamentals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 21 (Xinhua) -- Dai Xianglong, governor of
the People's Bank of China, today stressed the need for all the
countries in the world to achieve and sustain good economic
fundamentals.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the 49th Meeting of the Interim Committee of the
Board of Governors on the International Monetary System held at
the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Center, Dai said that the
exchange rate arrangement in a country should be adapted to its
changing circumstances and realistically there is no universally
uniform exchange rate regime suitable for all countries all the
time.
</P>
<P>
"Regardless of whether a fixed exchange rate regime or a
flexible one is adopted, the most essential challenge facing each
economy is to achieve and sustain its economic fundamentals
through consistently pursuing prudent macroeconomic policies and
improving the soundness of the banking sector," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Chinese chief banker called on the reserve
currency countries to take account of the external implications in
pursuit of their policy mix and strengthen international policy
coordination, so as to prevent abrupt volatility among major
currency exchange rates.
</P>
<P>
Touching upon the recent currency turmoil in some Southeast
Asian countries, Dai said: "We believe these instances are of a
temporary nature, their difficulties will soon be overcome, and
confidence will be restored through the strengthened
implementation of a sound economic policy mix and the acceleration
of structural reforms."
</P>
<P>
The cooperation of the international community in general, and
the Asia-Pacific region in particular, has played an important
role in alleviating the turmoil's negative consequences, he said.

<HEADLINE> China to Use More Japanese loans for Development of Interior Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 21 (Xinhua) -- More Japanese yen loans will
be introduced to finance the development of China's central and
western regions, a Chinese trade official said.
</P>
<P>
Today's China Daily Business Weekly quoted Yu Zhensheng, an
official with the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation, as saying that the trend was line with China's
economic development plan and would benefit both countries.
</P>
<P>
According to Yu, the the 1997 yen loans, worth 203 billion yen
(some 1.68 billion US dollars), will be channeled to 14 projects,
including eight new projects and six expansions, in environmental
protection, agricultural and infrastructure fields in central and
western regions.
</P>
<P>
The projects include Shaanxi Hancheng Power Station, Shanxi
Wangqu Power Station and pollution control for the Xiangjiang
River in Hunan Province.
</P>
<P>
China will submit its application for the 1998 yen loans by the
end of this year and his ministry will soon began negotiations
with Japan on the fourth batch of yen loans to China for the next
two years the official said, adding that an agreement is expected
to be reached next year.
</P>
<P>
Japan is one of the first countries to grant governmental loans
to China. In 1979, the country began providing 2,054 billion yen
(16.98 billion dollars) in contracted yen loans, financing some 90
state key projects in transportation, energy, telecommunications,
water supply and other infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
China had a good foreign debt repayment record and its ability
to return foreign debts was unquestionable, the official said.

New breakthroughs have been made in the reform and opening to
the outside world. In accordance with the requirements for
establishing a socialist market economy, we took big strides in
reforming the systems of public finance, taxation, banking,
foreign trade, foreign exchange, planning, investment, pricing,
circulation, housing and social security. Market forces notably
served as the basic means of regulating the allocation of
resources, and the framework of a macroeconomic control system was
preliminarily established. We pressed forward with the reform in
state-owned enterprises after making experiments in selected ones.
We further developed the pattern with the public sector remaining
dominant and diverse sectors of the economy developing side by
side. We continued to expand economic and technological
cooperation and exchanges with other countries, effected big
increases in foreign trade and in the use of foreign funds and
brought about a marked rise in state foreign exchange reserves.
</P>
<P>
We took new steps in promoting cultural and ethical progress.
Gratifying achievements were scored in science, technology,
education, culture, public health, sports, family planning and
other social undertakings. We further improved the publicity work
and guidance for public opinion and promoted ideological and
ethical progress. Significant progress was made in developing
socialist democracy and improving the legal system. A series of
laws and regulations commensurate with the development of a
socialist market economy were enacted, and law enforcement and the
judiciary work were strengthened. The patriotic united front
expanded, and the great unity of all our nationalities was further
consolidated and developed. Social and political unity and
stability provided an important guarantee for the reform and
development.
</P>
<P>
Progress was made in modernizing national defense. The combat
effectiveness of the army was further enhanced. The people's army
made major contributions to defending the national security,
safeguarding the unification of the motherland, taking part in
national economic development and fulfilling such tasks as dealing
with emergencies and disasters and providing relief.
</P>
<P>
The living standards of the people rose notably. The average
annual per capita income for living expenses increased by 7.2
percent for city dwellers in real terms, while the average annual
per capita net income went up by 5.7 percent for rural residents
in real terms, making the period one of those with the biggest
increases. The market had an adequate supply of commodities, and
the people's living conditions including food, clothing, housing,
articles for daily use and transportation improved markedly.
Savings deposits of urban and rural residents rose considerably.
The rural poor population of the country decreased by 32 million.
</P>
<P>
In the past five years we have done a great deal of work with
marked results in the peaceful reunification of the motherland.
The Chinese government has resumed the exercise of sovereignty
over Hong Kong, which is a consolation to numerous revolutionary
martyrs and veterans as it has wiped out the century-old
humiliation of the Chinese nation. This is a great event which
makes every Chinese elated and has won universal acclaim from the
international community.
</P>
<P>
We unswervingly implemented the independent foreign policy of
peace and continued to improve the external environment for
China's reform, opening up and modernization drive. China's
influence on international affairs kept growing.

We stepped up our efforts to strengthen Party building. The
whole Party studied more and more deeply Deng Xiaoping's theory of
building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Progress was made
in strengthening leading bodies and the contingent of cadres, with
a large number of fine young cadres taking leading posts. We
redoubled our efforts to improve the Party's work style, build
clean government and fight corruption and achieved successes by
stages. The building of primary Party organizations was
strengthened, and Party members played a vanguard and exemplary
role. Progress was made in institutionalizing and standardizing
inner-Party activities.
</P>
<P>
We are fully aware that there are still quite a few problems
and difficulties on the road ahead, and that there are also
shortcomings and defects in our work. The following are the main
ones: The quality and efficiency of the national economy as a
whole remain fairly low, the irrational economic structure still
poses a rather outstanding problem, and especially part of the
state-owned enterprises lack vitality. The work style of the Party
and the government, the current social conduct and public security
still fall short of the expectations of the people; corruption,
extravagance and waste and other undesirable phenomena are still
spreading and growing; and bureaucratic style of work, formalism
and deception constitute serious problems. Things have yet to be
straightened out in the matter of income and distribution, uneven
regional development is obvious, and part of the urban and rural
residents still live in poor circumstances. Population growth and
economic development have caused great strains on resources and
the environment. We must pay great attention to these problems and
solve them in a down-to-earth way.
</P>
<P>
Reviewing the work of the past five years, we can say that on
the whole the reform and development have proceeded satisfactorily
during this period. Our Party smoothly realized the replacement of
veteran cadres with younger ones in its collective leadership,
maintained the consistency of the line, principles and policies
and social and political stability throughout the country,
properly settled a series of major issues at home and in our
foreign relations, and consolidated and developed the excellent
situation prevailing since the Third Plenary Session of the
Eleventh Central Committee. This has gratified the people
throughout the country and won praise from the world
opinion. Practice of the five years shows that the policy
decisions made at the Fourteenth Congress are correct and that our
Party is capable of handling complex domestic and international
situations. The achievements scored in the five years are the
outcome of the united endeavor of the whole Party and the people
throughout the country. They have provided valuable new experience
and will serve as a more solid foundation for our future
development. All this will greatly encourage us to win new
victories with greater confidence and enthusiasm.

III. Historical Status and Guiding Significance of Deng
Xiaoping Theory
</P>
<P>
During the new period of the socialist reform, opening up and
modernization drive and the cross-century new journey ahead, we
must hold high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory and apply
it to our entire cause and all our undertakings. This is an
unshakable conclusion the Party has drawn from the past and
present realities.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Communist Party attaches great importance to the
guiding role of theory. Since the Chinese people found
Marxism-Leninism, the Chinese revolution has taken on an entirely
new look. The integration of Marxism-Leninism with China's reality
has experienced two historic leaps, resulting in two great
theories. The result of the first leap was a correct theory, a
body of correct principles and a summary of experience that have
been confirmed in the practice of the Chinese revolution and
construction. Its principal founder being Mao Zedong, our Party
has called it Mao Zedong Thought. The result of the second leap
was the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics.
Its principal founder being Deng Xiaoping, our Party has called it
Deng Xiaoping Theory. These two great theories so achieved are the
crystallization of the practical experience and collective wisdom
of the Party and the people.
</P>
<P>
Ever since it was founded, our Party has taken Marxism-Leninism
as its guiding ideology. After the Zunyi Meeting and the Yan'an
Rectification, the Party decided at its Seventh Congress to take
Mao Zedong Thought -- the integration of the theory of
Marxism-Leninism with the practice of the Chinese revolution -- as
its guiding ideology. This historic decision was based on a
summary of the experience of 24 years after the founding of the
Party. On the basis of the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh
Central Committee and the Twelfth, Thirteenth and especially
Fourteenth Congresses of the Party, the Central Committee has
proposed that the Party, at its Fifteenth Congress, establish Deng
Xiaoping Theory as its guiding ideology by stipulating in its
Constitution that the Chinese Communist Party takes
Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought and Deng Xiaoping Theory as
its guide to action. This historic decision has been made by our
Party after nearly 20 years of successful practice of the reform,
opening up and the socialist modernization drive. It shows the
determination and conviction of the central collective leadership
and the whole Party to bring about an all-round advancement of the
cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics initiated
by Deng Xiaoping to the new century. It also reflects the common
understanding and aspirations of the people of the whole country.

Chinese people in successfully accomplishing their socialist
modernization in the process of reform and opening to the outside
world. In China today, it is Deng Xiaoping Theory, which
integrates Marxism with the practice of present-day China and the
features of the times, and this theory alone, that can settle the
issues concerning the future and destiny of socialism. Deng
Xiaoping Theory is Marxism of present-day China, representing a
new stage of development of Marxism in China.
</P>
<P>
The reasons why Deng Xiaoping Theory has become a new stage of
development of Marxism in China are as follows:
</P>
<P>
First, Deng Xiaoping Theory, upholding the principles of
emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts, not only
inherits the achievements of our predecessors but also breaks with
outmoded conventions on the basis of new practice, and explores a
new realm for Marxism. Seeking truth from facts is the
quintessence of Marxism-Leninism, of Mao Zedong Thought, and of
Deng Xiaoping Theory as well. The speech entitled "Emancipate the
Mind, Seek Truth from Facts and Unite as One in Looking to the
Future" made by Deng Xiaoping in 1978 was a declaration which, at
the end of the "cultural revolution" when China was at a crucial
historical juncture and was faced with the question of which
course to take, shattered the argument of the "two whatevers" [the
notion that after the death of Chairman Mao Zedong, whatever
policy decisions he had made must be firmly upheld and whatever
instructions he had given must be followed unswervingly -- Tr.],
opened up a new road for a new era and initiated the new theory of
building socialism with Chinese characteristics. The talks given
by Deng Xiaoping in the South in 1992 constituted another
declaration showing the spirit of emancipating the mind and
seeking truth from facts, which, at a crucial historical juncture
when we experienced severe tests of political disturbances at home
and abroad, upheld the theory and line formulated since the Third
Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, cleared up many
important misconceptions that had long shackled people's thinking,
and promoted the reform, opening up and the modernization drive to
a new stage. Under the new situation when the 21st century is
approaching and when we are faced with many hard issues we have
never met before, Deng Xiaoping Theory requires us to emancipate
our minds and seek truth from facts more firmly and more
conscientiously, and judge everything by the fundamental criterion
whether it is favorable to promoting the growth of the productive
forces in a socialist society, increasing the overall strength of
the socialist state and raising the people's living standards, or
the "three favorables" for short, so as to open new horizons for
our cause.

<HEADLINE> FDI to Bolster China's Key Industries, Inland Regions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 21 (Xinhua) -- China will intensify its
efforts to use foreign direct investment (FDI) effectively,
guiding foreign funds into key industries and central and western
regions, according to an official with the Ministry of Foreign
Trade and Economic Co-operation (Moftec).
</P>
<P>
"Foreign direct investment is likely to rebound and the
structure of foreign-invested projects is expected to improve in
the next several months," said Ma Xiuhong, director of foreign
investment administration under the Moftec.
</P>
<P>
In the past few months, actual foreign investment volume
exceeded new contracted foreign capital for the first time,
spending about 3.4 billion US dollars per month, said today's
"China Daily".
</P>
<P>
"State companies will be able to take a short cut to enter the
international market and support its competitiveness by working
with foreign counterparts," Ma was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Many foreign-funded ventures have begun to expand westwards
because of rising water, electricity, land and labor costs in
coastal regions, she said.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, she added, 18 interior provinces and autonomous
regions that cover 80 percent of China's land and accommodate 70
percent of its population receive only 10 percent of the country's
foreign direct investment.
</P>
<P>
Ma went on to note that China's rational use of foreign funds,
64 percent of which are direct foreign investment now, focuses on
long-term strategic foreign investment and foreign loans for
actual projects, rather than short-term speculative capital.
</P>
<P>
"Anyone who can seize the chance during the course of market
formation within the next ten years or longer will become the
ultimate winner," Ma said.

Second, Deng Xiaoping Theory, upholding the basic achievements
of the theory and practice of scientific socialism, has grappled
with the fundamental question of what socialism is and how to
build it and incisively expounded the essence of socialism,
raising our understanding of socialism to a new scientific level.
To emancipate the mind in the new period, the key lies in doing it
on this question. Failure to have a very clear understanding of
this question has, in the final analysis, been the cause of the
twists and turns and mistakes our socialism experienced before the
reform and opening up, and the cause of the perplexities people
encountered on their way forward since then. The efforts to set
things right and the all-round reform, from taking class struggle
as the key link to taking economic development as the central
task, from closedness or semi-closedness to reform and opening up,
and from a planned economy to a socialist market economy -- these
historic changes of the recent period of nearly 20 years have
constituted a process of gradually understanding this fundamental
question. And this process will continue in practice in the years
to come.
</P>
<P>
Third, Deng Xiaoping Theory, persisting in observing the world
in the broad perspective of Marxism, has made new, scientific
judgments on the basis of correctly analyzing the features of the
times and the overall international situation, the success or
failure of other socialist countries in the world, the gains or
losses of the developing countries in seeking development, and the
trend of development and the conflicts of the developed countries.
Great and rapid changes are taking place in the world, and
particularly the daily advancing science and technology have
profoundly changed and will continue to change the current
economic and social activities and the appearance of the world.
Marxists of any country have to take this seriously. It is in
these circumstances that Deng Xiaoping Theory has determined the
line and international strategy of our Party, requiring us to
understand, carry forward and develop Marxism from a new point of
view, and stressing that only that is true Marxism whereas
sticking to conventions can only lead to backwardness and even
failure. This shows Deng Xiaoping Theory is clearly geared to the
times.
</P>
<P>
Fourth, to sum up, Deng Xiaoping Theory constitutes a new,
scientific system of the theory of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics. It has been gradually formed and developed under
the historical conditions in which peace and development have
become the main themes of the times, in the practice of China's
reform, opening up and modernization drive, and on the basis of
reviewing the historical experience of successes and setbacks of
socialism in China and learning from the historical experience of
the rise and fall of other socialist countries. For the first time
it has given preliminary but systematic answers to a series of
basic questions concerning the road to socialism in China, the
stages of development, the fundamental tasks, the motive force,
the external conditions, the political guarantee, the strategic
steps, Party leadership, the forces to be relied on, and the
reunification of the motherland. It has guided our Party in
formulating the basic line for the primary stage of socialism. It
is a fairly complete scientific system which embraces philosophy,
political economy and scientific socialism and covers, among other
things, the economy, politics, science and technology, education,
culture, ethnic, military and foreign affairs, the united front
and Party building. It is also a scientific system which needs to
be further enriched and developed in all aspects.

Deng Xiaoping was a great Marxist. He performed immortal deeds
for the independence and liberation of the Chinese nation, for the
establishment of the socialist system in China and for its reform,
opening up and modernization drive. He dedicated all his life to
the Chinese people, with the interests of the people as the
starting point and objective in everything he did. His greatest
contribution to the Party, the people and Marxism, or his valuable
legacy to us, is Deng Xiaoping Theory. This theory is embodied in
the works of Deng Xiaoping and the important documents of the
Party and the state written since the Third Plenary Session of the
Eleventh Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
Marxism is a science, which is firmly based on objective
facts. Actual life, however, is always changing and the changes
over the past century and more have been so drastic and profound
that our predecessors could hardly have conceived them. Hence,
Marxism will necessarily advance along with the development of the
times, practice and science; it cannot remain unchanged. There is
a question concerning the style of study of Marxism: whether we
should indulge in book worship, or use the Marxist stand,
viewpoint and method to study and solve the practical problems in
China. During the rectification campaign in Yan'an, Mao Zedong
emphasized, "A policy should be established of focusing on the
study of the practical problems of the Chinese revolution and
using the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism as the guide, and
the method of studying Marxism-Leninism statically and in
isolation should be discarded." Today when we advocate arming the
whole Party with Deng Xiaoping Theory and studying
Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought with the focus on studying
the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, we
mean precisely to carry forward this fine tradition. We must never
discard Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. If we did, we
would lose our foundation. Meanwhile, centering on the practical
problems in the reform, opening up and the modernization drive and
on the things we are doing, we must emphasize the application of
the Marxist theory, the theoretical study of practical problems,
and new practice and development. It is meaningless to talk about
Marxism in isolation from a given country's reality and the
development of the times. We would get nowhere if we studied
Marxism statically and in isolation, and separated it from its
vigorous development in actual life, or set them against each
other. In present-day China, Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought
and Deng Xiaoping Theory constitute a unified scientific system
imbued with the same spirit. Adhering to Deng Xiaoping Theory
means genuinely adhering to Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong
Thought; holding high the banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory means
genuinely holding high the banner of Marxism-Leninism and Mao
Zedong Thought.

<HEADLINE> Massive Protest Rally to be Held in Manila </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 21 (Xinhua) -- A massive protest rally
against Charter changes moves seeking to extend the term of
President Fidel Ramos was to be held here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The rally, expected to draw at least one million people from
all walks of life, was called by former President Corazon Aquino
and Catholic Church leader Cardinal Jaime Sin.
</P>
<P>
Protest rallies against Charter change moves would also be held
in other cities on the same day.
</P>
<P>
The rally coincides with the 25th anniversary of the martial
law declared by former President Ferdinand Marcos, who was ousted
in 1986 and died in 1989 in Hawaii, the United States.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the mass rally would be bombed by
saboteurs. To prepare for the worst, the government has mobilized
some 5,000 policemen and bomb-sniff dogs to guard the rally.
</P>
<P>
The government would also field medical teams and ambulances in
key strategic positions along Luneta Park, the venue of the rally
in Metro Manila. All hospitals under the Department of Health had
also been put on alert to admit cases needing first aid treatment.
</P>
<P>
Ramos was not invited to attend the rally. Unexpectedly, he
said on Saturday that he will step down when his term ends next
year and "will not run for re-election."
</P>
<P>
"I am fully satisfied with having served as your president for
one six-year term as mandated in the constitution," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he urged lawmakers to stop discussing Charter change
bills and instead, focus on important economic and social reform
bills still pending in Congress.
</P>
<P>
Analysts consider the mass rally a dividing line in the
country's current political situation. If spoiled by violence, it
signals that political instability has befallen the Philippines,
they said.

<HEADLINE> Tariff Cuts Beneficial to China's Economy, WTO Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 21 (Xinhua) -- China's tariff cuts that
begin October 1 will help overhaul the country's industrial and
production structure, improve its investment climate and smooth
its bid for the World Trade Organization (WTO), Chinese officials
said.
</P>
<P>
China announced one week ago that it would reduce tariffs for
4,874 commodities, or 73 percent of those subject to tariffs. That
will bring its 23 percent average tariff rate to 17 percent.
</P>
<P>
The tariff cuts for machinery and electronic products will help
rectify declining imports, officials with the Ministry of
Machinery Building were quoted by today's "China Daily Business
Weekly" as saying.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of the year, machinery and electronics
imports fell nine percent from a year ago to 24.52 billion US
dollars.
</P>
<P>
It was caused by not only sluggish domestic demand, but also
the revocation of tariff exemptions on capital goods imported by
foreign-funded enterprises, which took effect on April 1, last
year, the officials noted.
</P>
<P>
The tariff cuts will be conducive to domestic enterprises
because they can import world-class products and technology to
upgrade the country's industrial and production mix at much less
expense.
</P>
<P>
The tariff cuts will also be conducive to China's long-standing
bid for admission into WTO.
</P>
<P>
China's tariff reductions have been one of the focuses of
bilateral negotiations since 1986, when the country officially
submitted its application for inclusion in the General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade, the WTO's predecessor.
</P>
<P>
The fact that China has reduced its tariffs by 60 percent
within four years demonstrated its intent to accommodate WTO
demands, and will create a still better climate for bilateral
negotiations on its WTO bid, the official said.

IV. The Basic Line and Program for the Primary Stage of
Socialism
</P>
<P>
Since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central
Committee, the Party has correctly analyzed China's conditions and
formulated the scientific thesis that China is still in the
primary stage of socialism. When we talk about the need to proceed
from reality in everything we do, the true reality is that China
is currently in the primary stage of socialism and will remain in
this stage for a long time to come. When we say we must be clear
about what socialism is and how to build it, we must acquire a
clear understanding of what socialism in the primary stage is and
how to build it. One of the fundamental reasons for our failings
in building socialism prior to the convocation of the Third
Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee is that some of
our tasks and policies overstepped the primary stage of socialism.
One of the basic reasons for the achievements in the reform,
opening up and the modernization drive over the recent period of
nearly 20 years is that we corrected the erroneous concepts and
policies transcending the primary stage of socialism and rejected
the erroneous proposition that we should give up the basic system
of socialism. By so doing, instead of deviating from it, we are
building socialism in a down-to-earth manner, so that it is full
of vigor and flourishing in China, and the people, thanks to their
personal experiences, have become all the more enthusiastic in
supporting socialism.
</P>
<P>
The reason why we are laying further emphasis on this question
at the current congress is that, in the face of the arduous tasks
of tackling hard issues in the reform and creating a new
situation, the key to resolving various contradictions, dispelling
doubts and understanding why we must carry out the existing line
and policies and not any other line and policies lies in our
unified, correct understanding of the basic conditions in China
today in the primary stage of socialism.
</P>
<P>
Socialism is the primary stage of communism and China is in the
primary stage of socialism, that is, the stage of
underdevelopment. In this large Eastern country, it is a great
victory for us to take the socialist road after a period of New
Democracy. But, at the time when China entered socialism, it
lagged far behind the developed countries in terms of the level of
development of the productive forces. We are, therefore, destined
to go through a rather long primary stage of socialism. During
this stage we shall accomplish industrialization and the
socialization, market-orientation and modernization of the
economy. This is a historical stage we cannot jump over.

<P>
It is the first time in the history of Marxism that the
scientific concept of the primary stage of socialism is specified
in a party's program. When talking about building socialism in the
primary stage, Deng Xiaoping especially emphasized, "Ours is an
entirely new endeavor, one that was never mentioned by Marx, never
undertaken by our predecessors and never attempted by any other
socialist country. So there are no precedents for us to learn
from. We can only learn from practice, feeling our way as we go."
That is to say, if we really want to build socialism in China, we
should proceed in everything we do only from the actual situation
of the primary stage of socialism, and not from our subjective
desire, nor from this or that kind of foreign models, nor from the
dogmatic interpretations of some theses in Marxist works, nor from
certain erroneous viewpoints imposed on Marxism.
</P>
<P>
The primary stage of socialism is a historical stage in which
we shall gradually put an end to underdevelopment and realize
socialist modernization by and large. It is a stage in which an
agricultural country, where people engaged in agriculture take up
a very large proportion of the population and mainly rely on
manual labor, will gradually turn into an industrial country where
non-agricultural people constitute the majority and which embraces
modern agriculture and service trade. It is a stage in which a
society with the natural and semi-natural economy making up a very
large proportion of the whole will gradually turn into one with a
fairly developed market-oriented economy. It is a stage in which a
society with illiterate and semi-literate people making up a very
large proportion of the population and with backward science,
technology, education and culture will turn step by step into one
with fairly developed science, technology, education and culture.
It is a stage in which a society with poverty-stricken people
making up a very large proportion of the population and the people
having a low standard of living will gradually become one where
the whole people are well-off. It is a stage in which a society
with very uneven economic and cultural development between regions
will become one in which the gap will be gradually narrowed, with
some regions becoming developed first. It is a stage in which, by
introducing reforms and exploring new ways, we will establish and
improve a socialist market economy, a political system of
socialist democracy and other systems that are relatively mature
and full of vitality. It is a stage in which the great number of
people will firmly foster the common ideal of building socialism
with Chinese characteristics, make unremitting efforts to overcome
difficulties, build the country with industry and thrift and
promote cultural and ethical progress as well as material
progress. It is a stage in which we will gradually narrow the gap
between our level and the advanced world standard and bring about
a great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation on the basis of
socialism. It will take at least a century to complete this
historical process. It will take a much longer period of time to
consolidate and develop the socialist system, and it will require
persistent struggle by many generations, a dozen or even several
dozens.

<P>
In the four decades and more since the mid-1950s when China
entered the primary stage of socialism, and especially in the
recent period of nearly 20 years, China has greatly developed its
productive forces and made much headway in all its undertakings.
In general, however, due to a large population and a poor
foundation to begin with, China has seen uneven regional
development, and its underdeveloped productive forces have yet to
be fundamentally improved. The socialist system still needs to be
perfected, the socialist market economy is immature, the socialist
democracy and legal system still have to be strengthened, and
decadent feudal and capitalist ideas and the small-producers'
force of habit still have widespread influence in society. All
this shows that the socialist society in China still remains in
the primary stage.
</P>
<P>
The fundamental task of socialism is to develop the productive
forces. During the primary stage, it is all the more necessary to
give first priority to concentrating on their development.
Different contradictions exist in China's economy, politics,
culture, social activities and other areas, and class
contradictions, due to international and domestic factors, will
still exist within a certain scope for a long time to come. But
the principal contradiction in society is the one between the
growing material and cultural needs of the people and the
backwardness of production. This principal contradiction will
remain throughout the process of China's primary stage of
socialism and in all activities of society. Hence we are destined
to make economic development the central task of the entire Party
and the whole country and make sure that all other work is
subordinated to and serves this task. Only by focusing on this
principal contradiction and the central task can we soberly
observe and control all social contradictions and effectively
promote their resolution. Development is the absolute principle.
The key to the solution of all China's problems lies in our own
development.
</P>
<P>
In the primary stage of socialism, focusing on the fundamental
task of developing the productive forces, we should take reform as
the motive force for promoting all the work in building socialism
with Chinese characteristics. Ours is a comprehensive reform which
means, on the premise of upholding the basic system of socialism,
we conscientiously readjust all the aspects and links of the
relations of production and the superstructure so as to suit them
to the level of development of the productive forces in the
primary stage and the historical requirement of modernization. It
is a great pioneering undertaking to combine socialism with the
market economy. To do this, it is necessary to make active
explorations and bold experiments and respect the pioneering
initiative of the masses. It is necessary to deepen the reform and
resolve the deep-rooted contradictions and crucial problems that
may arise during structural transformation. It is necessary to
open China wider to the outside world and absorb and use for
reference the advanced technology and managerial expertise of
foreign countries including developed capitalist countries.

<P>
In the primary stage of socialism, it is of the utmost
importance to balance reform, development and stability and to
maintain a stable political environment and public order. Without
stability, nothing could be achieved. We must uphold the
leadership by the Party and the people's democratic dictatorship.
We should promote material progress and cultural and ethical
progress, attaching equal importance to both. We must eliminate
all factors jeopardizing stability, oppose bourgeois
liberalization and guard against the infiltrative, subversive and
splittist activities of the international and domestic hostile
forces. We must balance the intensity of reform, the speed of
development and people's ability to sustain them, promoting reform
and development amid social and political stability and securing
social and political stability through reform and development.
</P>
<P>
At this historical moment when we are advancing our cause to
the 21st century in an all-round way, we must solemnly point out
that the whole Party must firmly adhere to the Party's basic line
for the primary stage of socialism and, in the great practice of
building socialism with Chinese characteristics, combine the
central task of economic development with the two basic points --
adherence to the Four Cardinal Principles [keeping to the
socialist road and upholding the people's democratic dictatorship,
leadership by the Communist Party, and Marxism-Leninism and Mao
Zedong Thought -- Tr.], and the reform and opening up. This is the
most valuable experience our Party has gained in the recent period
of nearly 20 years and the most reliable guarantee for the
victorious advance of our cause. We should maintain vigilance
against the Right tendencies, but primarily against the "Left". We
should remain sober-minded, overcome all interference and firmly
adhere to Deng Xiaoping Theory and the basic line. In accordance
with this theory and the basic line and with the focus on the goal
of building a prosperous, strong, democratic, culturally advanced
and modern socialist country, it is necessary to acquire a better
understanding of what the socialist economy, politics and culture
with Chinese characteristics in the primary stage of socialism are
and how to build them.

<HEADLINE> More Investment in Copper Mining in Chile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, September 20 (Xinhua) -- Chilean and foreign mining
firms will invest about 4.8 billion U.S. dollars in the next three
years in the sector, the Chilean Copper Commission (Cochilco) said.
</P>
<P>
Three billion dollars out of the total will be used for the
Dona Ines de Collahuasi and Los Pelambres copper projects, said
Cochilco.
</P>
<P>
Three other new copper mining projects in San Antonio, Lomas
Bayas and Tesoro-Leonor will need more than 1.5 billion dollars.

<P>
The Chilean commission said that an investment of 1.5 billion
dollars is expected in the mining sector this year, a figure that

<HEADLINE> Currency Crisis Not Affecting China's Financial Market: Economist (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Unlike the Southeast Asian countries, which suffered declining
exports as a result of pegging their national currencies to the US
dollar and were later compelled to practise free exchange rate,
China has wisely chosen to open its foreign exchange market
gradually.
</P>
<P>
China's prudence in reforming its foreign exchange system, its
robust economic growth, and reforms in other sectors have combined
to contribute to a stable exchange rate of the yuan, Xiao said.
</P>
<P>
Large foreign investment and debts, especially short-term
debts, have put some Southeast nations under great pressure to
repay interest, according to the professor.
</P>
<P>
China has no problem in debt repayment as its foreign debts are
appropriate in size and structure and are properly used, Xiao said.
</P>
<P>
An increasing macro-economic control ability, he added, is
another reason why China can effectively resist the spillovers of
financial instability on the international markets.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government is in control of the economic
lifelines and the major financial institutions, and its great power
in economic macro control is unparalleled by the governments of
the Southeast Asian nations," Xiao said.
</P>
<P>
As a lesson to learn from the currency crisis in Southeast
Asia, China should create a good and favorable macro environment
for the financial market by maintaining a stable economic growth
and avoiding big ups and downs in economic development, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that China should adhere to a rational policy on
use of foreign investment so as to prevent any possible assault on
the financial market by short-term speculative capital from
overseas.
</P>
<P>
To reduce financial risks, the reform in the foreign exchange
system should go ahead gradually and financial supervision should
be further strengthened, Economist Xiao said.

<HEADLINE> Full Text of Jiang Zemin's Report at 15th Party Congress (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The following is the full
text of Jiang Zemin's report delivered at the 15th National
Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) on September 12,
1997, entitled "Hold High the Great Banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory
for an All-round Advancement of the Cause of Building Socialism
with Chinese Characteristics to the 21st Century":

Comrades,
</P>
<P>
Now, I should like to present a report to the congress on
behalf of the Fourteenth Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
The Fifteenth National Congress of the Communist Party of China
is an extremely important congress. Held at the turn of the
century to break new ground for the future, it will ensure that
the whole Party will carry out Comrade Deng Xiaoping's behests and
march unswervingly and triumphantly along the correct line adopted
since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
The theme of the congress is to hold high the great banner of
Deng Xiaoping Theory for an all-round advancement of the cause of
building socialism with Chinese characteristics to the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
The issue of the banner is of the utmost importance. The banner
represents our orientation and image. Firmly adhering to the line
formulated since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central
Committee means firmly holding high the banner of Deng Xiaoping
Theory. After the death of Comrade Deng Xiaoping, it is all the
more necessary for the whole Party to keep a high level of
consciousness and staunchness on this issue.
</P>
<P>
To advance our cause to the 21st century in an all-round way
requires us to seize opportunities without fail, and blaze new
trails instead of following the beaten tracks. Taking economic
development as our central task, we should make new breakthroughs
in economic restructuring, deepen political restructuring and
develop socialist culture and ethics in real earnest. These
aspects of work should be handled in tandem with a view to
bringing about economic development and all-round social progress.
</P>
<P>
The theme has been defined in the light of the requirements of
the times and the aspirations of the people.

<P>
I. Looking Back and Ahead at the Turn of the Century
</P>
<P>
When the National Party Congress is being held toward the end
of the 20th century, we all realize that our Party shoulders a
lofty historical responsibility for the destiny of the Chinese
nation.
</P>
<P>
Earth-shaking changes have taken place in China over the past
century from 1900 when the Eight-Power Allied Forces occupied
Beijing, subjecting the Chinese nation to great humiliation and
bringing the country to the verge of subjugation, to the year 2000
when China will enjoy a fairly comfortable life on the basis of
socialism and take big strides toward the goal of being prosperous
and strong.
</P>
<P>
After the Opium War of 1840, China was reduced to a
semi-colonial and semi-feudal country. The Chinese nation was
faced with two great historical tasks: to win national
independence and the people's liberation, and to make the country
prosperous and strong and achieve common prosperity for the
people. The former task was set to remove obstacles and create
essential prerequisites for the fulfillment of the latter task.
</P>
<P>
The past century has witnessed the Chinese people undergoing
three tremendous historic changes on their road of advance and the
birth of Sun Yat-sen, Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping, three great
men who stood at the forefront of the times.
</P>
<P>
The first change was represented by the Revolution of 1911,
which overthrew the autocratic monarchy reigning in China for
thousands of years. It was led by Dr. Sun Yat-sen. He was the
first to raise the slogan of "rejuvenating China" and pioneered
the national and democratic revolution in the true sense in modern
times. The Revolution of 1911 failed to change the social nature
of old China and free the people from their hard lot, but it
opened the sluice-gates for progress in China and made it
impossible for the reactionary rule to remain stable any longer.
</P>
<P>
The second change was marked by the founding of the People's
Republic of China and the establishment of the socialist system.
This was accomplished after the founding of the Communist Party of
China and under the direction of the first generation of
collective leadership with Mao Zedong at the core. Through the
Northern Expedition, the Agrarian Revolution, the War of
Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation, we overthrew
the three big mountains of imperialism, feudalism and
bureaucrat-capitalism. The Chinese people rose to their feet.
Proceeding from New Democracy, they took the road to socialism and
scored tremendous achievements in building socialism. This was a
great victory of the people's revolution which had never been
recorded in Chinese history, a great victory of global
significance for socialism and national liberation.
</P>
<P>
The third change was featured by the reform, opening up and the
endeavor to achieve socialist modernization. It was a new
revolution initiated under the direction of the second generation
of collective leadership with Deng Xiaoping at the core. Basing
itself on the achievements scored in revolution and construction
since the founding of the People's Republic, our Party reviewed
historical experience and lessons and blazed a new trail in
building socialism with Chinese characteristics. The exuberant
vigor and vitality of socialism displayed in China has attracted
world attention.

<P>
Our conclusion drawn from the great changes over the past
century is as follows: Only the Communist Party of China can lead
the Chinese people in achieving victories of national
independence, the people's liberation and socialism, pioneering
the road of building socialism with Chinese characteristics,
rejuvenating the nation, making the country prosperous and strong
and improving the people's well-being.
</P>
<P>
As the new century is approaching, we are faced with grim
challenges and, more significantly, we are confronted with
unprecedented favorable conditions and excellent opportunities. We
must be soberly aware that international competition is becoming
increasingly acute, that the economic, scientific and
technological gap between China and the developed countries has
brought great pressure to bear on us, and that we ourselves still
have many difficulties. In the meantime, we must be well aware of
the following factors: First, peace and development have become
the main themes of the present era. The pattern of the world is
changing toward multipolarity. It is possible to secure a peaceful
international environment for a fairly long period of time. The
worldwide scientific and technological revolution is forging ahead
by leaps and bounds, and the economy has continued to grow. This
has provided favorable external conditions for us. Second,
considerable overall national strength has been built up in China
since the founding of the People's Republic, especially over the
recent period of nearly 20 years. The reform and opening up have
brought about favorable structural conditions for the
modernization drive, created broad market demands and sources of
funds, and given fuller play to the new creativity of the people
in their hundreds of millions. Third, what is more important is
that our Party has established the basic theory and basic line of
building socialism with Chinese characteristics which have proved
to be correct in practice. These are conditions we enjoy today,
but we totally or partially lacked in the past.
</P>
<P>
Whether we are able to seize opportunities has always been an
issue which has a vital bearing on the success of our revolution
and construction. We did seize important historical opportunities,
but we lost some as well. Now the whole Party must maintain a high
level of consciousness, firmly seize the historical opportunities
at the turn of the century and take new steps forward.
</P>
<P>
Looking into the next century, we have set our goals as
follows: In the first decade the gross national product will
double that of the year 2000, the people will enjoy an even more
comfortable life and a more or less ideal socialist market economy
will have come into being. With the efforts to be made in another
decade when the Party celebrates its centenary, the national
economy will be more developed and the various systems will be
further improved. By the middle of the next century when the
People's Republic celebrates its centenary, the modernization
program will have been accomplished by and large and China will
have become a prosperous, strong, democratic and culturally
advanced socialist country. As Deng Xiaoping put it, "Since we
have the necessary domestic conditions and a favorable
international environment, and since under the socialist system we
have the advantage of being able to concentrate our forces on a
major task, it is now both possible and necessary for us to bring
about, in the prolonged process of modernization, several periods
of rapid growth with good economic returns. We must have this
ambition."

</P>
<P>
The French combination defeated Belgium's Filip Dewulf and

</P>
<P>
The victory left Belgium leading the best-of-five tie 2-1

On Sunday, Dewulf will play either Raoux or Lionel Roux. And if

<HEADLINE> Currency Crisis Not Affecting China's Financial Market: Economist (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 21 (Xinhua) -- The recent currency crisis in
some Southeast Asian nations will not affect China's financial
market as well as its efforts to push forward reforms in the
foreign exchange system, noted economist Xiao Zhuoji said.
</P>
<P>
"We should learn a lesson from the crisis and not blindly
pursue capital-account convertibility before conditions are mature,
but our efforts to reform the foreign exchange system should not
be delayed," Xiao, a professor at Beijing University, told Xinhua
in an interview.
</P>
<P>
He said that because of different national conditions, the
recent financial turbulence in Southeast Asia will not affect
China's financial market and the Chinese economy.
</P>
<P>
The currency crisis first started in Thailand in July when the
Baht plunged against the US dollar and stock prices plummeted,
forcing overseas investors to bail out. The crisis later spread to
Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese economy, though small in per capita terms, is
powerful enough to resist any residual effects from the currency
volatility in Southeast Asia, Xiao said.
</P>
<P>
China reported an annual gross domestic product of more than
800 billion US dollars in 1996 and its year-end foreign exchange
reserves exceeded 120 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
A major cause of the currency crisis in Southeast Asia,
according to Xiao, is imbalance in economic structure, lack of
diversity in exports and excessive dependence on the international
market.
</P>
<P>
Conversely, China has a relatively balanced economic structure
and diversified export and domestic markets, which make it less
reliant on the international market, Xiao said.
</P>
<P>
"This has enabled China to resist the adverse influence from
overseas economies," the economist said.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that in sharp contrast to huge current-account
deficits of some Southeast Asian nations, China has enjoyed
surplus in the balance of international payments under both the
current and capital accounts since an overhaul of the foreign
exchange system in 1994.

<P>
The Germans used two hours 28 minutes to outplay the
hard-fighting Mexican duo.
</P>
<P>
The Germans won the Davis Cup title three times between 1988
and 1983, led by Boris Becker.

<P>
Becker, who has announced his retirement from Grand Slam
tennis, returned to the team Friday and won the opening singles
against Luis Herrera 7-5, 6-2, 6-3 and his teammate Goellner beat
Alejandro Hernandez 7-5, 6-3, 6-3.

Chinese players getting exactly the same score, the national flags
of two sports acrobatics superpowers simutaneously flew at the
highest level.
</P>
<P>
