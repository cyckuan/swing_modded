NO ARGUING THIS CALL  
 22 UMPIRES WON'T BE ABLE TO STOP FIRINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The day of reckoning for 22 umpires arrives Thursday, the final
day they will be employed by Major League Baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Forget whatever last-ditch efforts may be under way, these boys
will be out of a job come Friday morning. Baseball officials have
drawn their line in the sand and it's not going to be moved one
centimeter.
</P>
<P>
   Already umpires have been told that if they try even a one-day
wildcat strike in an attempt to disrupt the game, they too will be
immediately terminated. The serious manner in which baseball
officials are handling these procedures should indicate that any
thoughts of a strike would be the last act these umpires would
commit against baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Starting Friday, 25 new umpires will start working games.
Guaranteed. These will not be postal carriers or courier drivers
who officiate softball games on the weekends. All of them are fully
qualified minor league umpires.
</P>
<P>
   For any of the 22 umpires whose resignations were accepted and
who are thinking of simply showing up for work Friday as though
nothing has changed, expect there to be a scene or two. All 15
clubs who host games next weekend have been informed not to allow
those umpires on the stadium grounds (unless, of course, they buy a
ticket). Police escorts will be implemented, if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Several National League umpires, who maintain a stronger and
more defiant union stance, have requested their American League
brethren refuse to cross over and work an NL game if requested.
</P>
<P>
   Forget that, too. While 13 of the 22 umpires who will be let go
come from the NL, baseball officials are planning to spread out the
remaining veteran umps, even forcing them to cross leagues to make
for a smoother transition in what will surely be a historic event.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing strikes from the NL umps, each club has been instructed
by the league office to have four replacement umpires ready to work
at each game. They began attending, with their gear inside the
stadiums, at all big league ballparks Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Sandy Alderson, the game's vice president who was placed in
charge of centralizing umpires and harnessing them under the
commissioner's office umbrella, was unavailable for comment.
Special assistant  &UR; Ralph
 &UR; Nelson, a former Diamondbacks front office employee who will
oversee umpires beginning next season, also was unavailable.
</P>
<P>
   My personal favorite during this whole mess was when union chief
 &UR; Richie Phillips said last week that the umpires' resignations were
simply a symbolic gesture. Funny, those signatures at the bottom of
those resignations look very authentic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every moment you're out there, you're thinking about this,''
veteran  &UR; Ed Montague said. ``They put us in this position, and I
think our tempers have been a little short on the field, with
players and managers and such. It's tough on the family life at
home. I will never forget this.''
</P>
<P>
   No one is asking them to forget it. But it was the umpires, at
the urging of Phillips, who placed themselves in this position.
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake, the umpires may believe they were dragged into
this mess, but they made the moves that ultimately sealed the fate
of these 22 umpires who will never again work major league games.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball officials are not going to be flexible on this issue. &QL; 
Trivial question &QL; 
Baltimore reliever  &UR; Jesse Orosco, who recently became the all-time
leader in pitching appearances when he passed Dennis Eckersley,
never has been on the disabled list, a small miracle considering he
made his major league debut in 1979. Who are the only two players
with longer careers never to have landed on the disabled list? &QL; 
Giant talk &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even though they recently won eight of nine games and managed to
cut zero games off their deficit in the NL West, San Francisco
pitcher
 &UR; Shawn Estes insists the Giants are the club to beat for the
division title.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Diamondbacks will be looking over their
shoulder,'' Estes said. ``They're a good ballclub and won't lose
many games, so we just can't lose. We can't put together two or
three losses in a row. If we lose, we've got to win the next day.
That's just how it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to be tough, but you know what? This is our
year.''
</P>
<P>
   If that's the case, it's news to the Diamondbacks, who continue
clicking away victories at an alarming pace, having won 27 of their
past 35 games entering Saturday's game against the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants' grand plan would have them within three games by the
time the Diamondbacks visit Candlestick Park on Sept. 24-26. &QL; 
A familiar sound &QL; 
Seattle Mariners fans began chanting ``Fred-dee! Fred-dee!'' last
week after rookie  &UR; Freddy Garcia pitched another gem of a game.
They used to chant, ``Ran-dee! Ran-dee!'' for  &UR; Randy Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got goose bumps,'' said Garcia, who arrived from Houston
last summer in the trade that sent Johnson to the Astros. ``It's
the first time I've ever heard anything like that. I wanted to do
my best.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he's only 22, the Mariners quietly recognize that Garcia
possesses many of the same traits Johnson does, including being
able to throw a high number of pitches in a game. He had 139 in his
5-0 victory over Detroit last week. &QL; 
Visitors from the East &QL; 
The flood gates soon may open and a number of Japanese players may
be heading to a major league club near you. Using  &UR; Hideo Nomo and
 &UR; Hideki &UR; Irabu as the pioneers, several big-name Japanese players
are seriously considering bolting from their homeland.
</P>
<P>
   At the top of the list is  &UR; Ichiro Suzuki, a 25-year-old
outfielder who has already won five batting titles and is generally
considered the best all-around player in Japan. His $4.2 million
salary is the highest in a country where owners remain strongly in
control of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Suzuki was invited to participate in spring training with the
Seattle Mariners and, at the time, caught the eye of  &UR; Ken Griffey
Jr. Japanese owners struck a deal with Major League Baseball last
winter, allowing them to be compensated if their star players leave
for the big leagues.
</P>
<P>
   No player has attempted to auction himself to a major league
club yet, but if Suzuki decides to, expect the Mariners to make the
most significant effort to sign him. A bonus of up to $4 million
may be due the Orix Blue Wave, Suzuki's club, if he is successful
in reaching the big leagues. &QL; 
Trivial answer &QL; 
First baseman  &UR; Tony Perez, who belongs in the Hall of Fame, and
perennial Gold Glove outfielder  &UR; Darrell Evans had longer careers
than Orosco without ever appearing on the disabled list. Perez
played in 2,777 games in 23 seasons, Evans in 2,687 in 21 seasons. &QL; 
Includes information from other media sources. Pedro Gomez can be
reached at (602) 444-2364 or at pedro.gomez(at)pni.com via e-mail. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE HIT LIST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; One idea that should be shelved before it gains momentum
 &UR; and becomes embarrassing: In Chicago, they're actually making a
push for  &UR; Sammy Sosa to win a second straight MVP award. Last year
was special, but this year belongs to  &UR; Matt Williams,  &UR; Robin
Ventura or  &UR; Jeff
 &UR; Bagwell.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The other side of the century mark: The Anaheim Angels and
Kansas City Royals are trying to avoid their first 100-loss
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Flashback: Damaso Garcia.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; How did they even know?: New York Mets injured outfielder
 &UR; Bobby Bonilla did not show up for the club's annual team photo.
``I don't know where he was,'' Mets GM  &UR; Steve Phillips said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; It's starting to look like his final days: Tampa Bay's
ownership presented aging third baseman  &UR; Wade Boggs with a $50,000
fishing boat last weekend, a move that reeks of a send-off. The
Devil Rays have a 2000 option for Boggs, who recently reached 3,000
hits.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Make those opening day plans now: The Philadelphia Phillies are
tentatively scheduled to open the season at Bank One Ballpark next
year, meaning it should be  &UR; Randy Johnson against  &UR; Curt
 &UR; Schilling. &QL; 
EXTRA BASES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Don't look now, but Atlanta's two-time Cy Young Award winner,
 &UR; Tom Glavine, entered the weekend series 8-2 in his past 15 starts.
``There are situations that bring out the best of everybody,'' he
said. ``This team has always been good with its back against the
wall.''
</P>
<P>
   One unexpected benefit from playing in the more spacious Safeco
Field may be  &UR; Ken Griffey Jr.'s becoming more of a spray hitter.
For only the second time in his career, the Seattle center fielder
hit a pair of opposite-field home runs in the same game.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, the very mediocre St. Louis Cardinals have lost more
than three games in a row only once. Another fun fact, the
Cardinals are 17-27 when  &UR; Mark McGwire hits a home run. When the
big guy hits two in a game, they are 2-5.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in his seven years with Cleveland, center
fielder  &UR; Kenny Lofton apparently will not lead the club in stolen
bases. Lofton has 24 while  &UR; Omar Vizquel and  &UR; Roberto
 &UR; Alomar are more than five ahead of Lofton, who infuriated the
Indians brass when he refused a two-game minor league
rehabilitation assignment last week.
</P>
<P>
   The Pittsburgh Pirates bullpen has blown eight saves since the
All-Star break. The relievers had blown only one in the 66 games
before the All-Star Game. ``Those losses stay with you longer than
other losses,'' Manager  &UR; Gene Lamont said of blown late leads.
</P>
<P>
   Foul territory behind the plate at Dodger Stadium probably will
shrink dramatically next year as the club plans 300 high-priced
seats behind the plate. The seats are expected to be 25 feet closer
to the plate and should be completed before the season opener. &QL; 
THE RUMOR MILL &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Chicago Cubs second baseman  &UR; Mickey Morandini, one of the few
Cubs who plays his heart out every day, looks like the odd man out
in the infield for the remainder of the season. The Cubs want to
take an extended look at rookie  &UR; Chad Meyers. Morandini refused to
sign a contract extension during spring training.
</P>
<P>
   Staying on Chicago's north side, there may be no way Manager
 &UR; Jim Riggleman keeps his job for the final five weeks, not the way
the Cubs are mailing it in. Former Milwaukee Manager  &UR; Phil Garner
could land here before the end of the season. The Cubs' worst month
ever had been 8-21 in August 1921. They are 4-23 this month.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres have been trying like mad to work out a deal with
Detroit that would land them San Diego native  &UR; Tony Clark or Los
Angeles'  &UR; Eric Karros. Also, the Padres plan to bring back third
baseman  &UR; George Arias, who may be shipped to Japan during the
winter unless he shows a marked improvement in the final month.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago White Sox hierarchy is seriously considering making
wholesale changes to the left side of the club's infield, where
shortstop  &UR; Mike Caruso and third baseman  &UR; Greg
 &UR; Norton have struggled mightily. Each entered the weekend series
with 22 errors.
</P>
<P>
   With  &UR; Richard Hidalgo out for the season and  &UR; Moises
 &UR; Alou's return from knee surgery very much in question, the Astros
may turn to All-Star second baseman  &UR; Craig Biggio in left field, a
move that would let  &UR; Russ Johnson take over at second base.
</P>
<P>
   There is growing concern in Dodger land that the catcher of the
future,  &UR; Angel Pena, needs a serious attitude adjustment. Pena was
suspended for seven games last week for insubordination at Triple-A
Albuquerque. At issue are his weight and questionable work habits. &QL;

<P>
   &UR; Toronto Blue Jays: The memories of that dreadful seven-game
losing streak are finally beginning to fade, especially since they
entered their weekend series against Texas riding a three-game
winning streak that pushed them back to within one game of the
American League wild card lead. Most surprising has been the surge
by starter  &UR; Joey
 &UR; Hamilton, who is finally pitching the way the Blue Jays believed he
could. Toronto seriously believes it will win this thing before
it's all over. &QL; 
GOING SOUTH &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Milwaukee Brewers: Firing Manager  &UR; Phil Garner did little to
breathe life into the sagging Brewers, who entered the weekend
series 4-9 since interim Manager  &UR; Jim Lefebvre took over two weeks
ago. Milwaukee had lost 25 of its first 39 games since the All-Star
break and, if not for the complete ineptitude of the Cubs, would be
in the NL Central cellar. The Brewers are only 21-39 at County
Stadium and the offense recently went 557 plate appearances without
a home run, almost impossible to do these days. ``It has been
tough,'' Lefebvre said. ``We just have to keep battling. That's
really all we can do.'' &QL; 
OVERHEARD &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia starter  &UR; Robert Person, after taking a one-hitter
and a 3-0 lead into the ninth inning last weekend only to see Los
Angeles tie the score, a game the Dodgers eventually won in extra
innings: ``It's like being on the beach with the girl of your
dreams. Then
 &UR; Godzilla steps in and messes up the whole mood. This is still a bad
dream to me. I can't believe it happened.'' &QL; 
OUT OF LEFT FIELD &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He's only 19, but the Anaheim Angels think the world of
right-handed starter  &UR; Ramon Ortiz, who has allowed four runs in 15
innings during this first two big league games. Angels first
baseman
 &UR; Mo Vaughn calls Ortiz ``Little Pedro,'' as in fellow Dominican
 &UR; Pedro
 &UR; Martinez. In fact, Ortiz is built a lot like Martinez, wiry. ``I
keep thinking this must be what it's like to play behind a guy like
Pedro,''  &UR; Tim Salmon said. ``It's a great feeling. No one gets good
swings at him.'' Some in the organization believe Ortiz could
become the finest pitching prospect the Angels have developed since
 &UR; Chuck
 &UR; Finley. &QL;

WOODS THREATENS NEC ROUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DAVIS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AKRON, Ohio _ If there were any doubts about who is the best
golfer in the world, Tiger Woods is quickly putting them to rest.
</P>
<P>
   Fresh off a victory two weeks ago in the PGA Championship, Woods
threatened to turn the NEC Invitational into a one-man race
Saturday by shooting an 8-under 62 at Firestone Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   His bogey-free round, which was 1 stroke off the course record,
put Woods at 11-under 199, 5 strokes ahead of Fred Couples and Nick
Price. Second-round co-leader Carlos Franco was 6 back, and a group
7 shots behind included Tom Lehman, Phil Mickelson, Sergio Garcia,
Payne Stewart and Craig Parry.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the best player in the world right now,'' said Couples,
who will be paired with Woods today for the first time in a PGA
event. ``He's proving that every week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, I'm in the hunt. But when you're five behind that great
a player, you can have anyone sit here and say, `I have a shot
tomorrow,' but they are just kidding themselves. He's got to shoot
74 or 73, and I just don't see that happening.''
</P>
<P>
   That would be hard for anyone to envision the way Woods is
playing. He has won four events this year and hasn't lost when
leading after three rounds in eight straight tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   Taking advantage of ideal conditions, he methodically sliced up
the long Firestone South course with a combination of booming
drives and precision wedge shots. A missed 4-foot birdie putt on
the 12th prevented a string of five straight birdies and kept him
from tying the course record set by Jose Maria Olazabal in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels good to know that whatever shot you want to shape,
you can hit it,'' Woods said. ``I still need to play solid golf and
go out and try to make some birdies, but the main thing is to go
out and not make mistakes and give these guys the feeling that they
have an opportunity to win.''
</P>
<P>
   For much of the round, it looked like the NEC could turn into a
rematch of the PGA showdown between Woods and teenage sensation
Sergio Garcia. They shared the lead, along with Price, through nine
holes.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia still was within 3 shots with three to play, but the
19-year-old Spaniard bogeyed the 16th and double-bogeyed the 18th.
</P>
<P>
   One by one, the pursuers fell by the wayside. Mickelson trailed
by 1 shot through nine but parred the next eight holes and bogeyed
the 18th. He and Franco both shot par rounds, while Scotsman Paul
Lawrie, the British Open champion who shared the second-round lead,
shot 4 over, falling 10 shots back.
</P>
<P>
   Only Woods and Couples were able to take advantage of the prime
conditions, with Couples shooting 63, capped by a 40-foot birdie
putt at 18.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman's 67 gave him a ray of hope, but he too knows how long
the odds are of catching Woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``He really didn't play that well Friday, but kept it
together,'' said Lehman, who was paired with Woods and Garcia in
the second round. ``I've always said the mark of a great golfer
isn't a matter of how well you play on your best day. It's how well
you play on an off day, and Tiger has the game to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods said he hit only two bad shots Saturday and, proving
Lehman's point, still carded a birdie on one of them when he popped
up a drive on the par-4 eighth hole with a 3-wood and recovered
with an 8-iron shot that stopped 6 feet behind the hole.
</P>
<P>
   Couples also has a few shots in his bag, as he showed in
Friday's second round when he shanked his approach shot at 18 about
30 yards left of the green, near the 10th tee, behind a tree and
the scorer's tent. He hit a shot that cleared the tent by about a
foot, clipped a few tree branches and came down 3 feet away for a
par-saving putt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to see Freddie playing well,'' Woods said. ``We all
enjoy watching Freddie. I grew up watching him as a kid, went to LA
Opens to watch him play because _ the nickname Boom Boom _ you
wanted to see how far he could hit it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just nice to see Freddie back. He's happy with his life,
and it's wonderful to see a person as content and happy as he is.''
</P>
<P>
   After getting married, Couples chose to devote time to his new
wife and two stepchildren and had played in only 13 events before
the NEC.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a great thing to (win),'' he said. ``I feel like I
have a chance, but it's an outside chance just because of who we're
playing against.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure when Jack Nicklaus played that people were saying the
same thing because this guy is that good.'' &QL;

ARIZONA SCHOOLED IN HARD KNOCKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   STATE COLLEGE, Pa. _ Happy Valley or Death Valley?
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's 41-7 loss Saturday to Penn State in the Pigskin
Classic was neither to Wildcats Coach  &UR; Dick Tomey.
</P>
<P>
   ``This doesn't have to be a death knell,'' Tomey said of a loss
that snapped a seven-game win streak dating to last season. ``The
way I choose to look at this is that we needed it. We didn't want
it to happen in our (Pac-10) conference opener against Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt we needed to come to a tough place in a tough climate
for the development of this team.''
</P>
<P>
   It's safe to say there is a lot of developing to do before
Arizona's next game next Sunday at Texas Christian. &QL; 
Injury report &QL; 
Arizona quarterback  &UR; Keith Smith appeared to hurt his right leg
early in the fourth quarter when he was driven out of bounds and to
the turf by outside linebacker  &UR; Eric Sturdifen. However, he
suffered a mild sprain to his right ankle.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, I thought I might have injured my knee, but I'll be
OK,'' said Smith, whose feelings were hurting a lot more than the
ankle, which was wrapped in ice. &QL; 
Briefly
</P>
<P>
   Smith was disappointed by the loss but had no regrets about
Arizona's decision to play in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a kid, you watch Joe Paterno on television,'' he said.
``You dream of being in big games like these. No matter what the
outcome is, you feel great to be a part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Tomey, on the upcoming game at Texas Christian: ``TCU is going
to be just as tough as Penn State because they have been preparing
for us the last six months. We've looked at them, certainly, but
we've been their sole focus.''
</P>
<P>
   Penn State's 41 points were the most ever surrendered by Arizona
in a season opener.
</P>
<P>
   A few more numbers, none of them pretty: For the first time in
24 games, Arizona was held to fewer than 20 points. For the first
time in 30 games, the Wildcats failed to score in double digits.
Arizona's eight-game win streak on the road also was snapped.
</P>
<P>
   The home opener was the earliest ever for the Nittany Lions, who
before Saturday never had played an August game at Beaver Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Penn State faces five schools ranked among the Top 25 this
season. The Nittany Lions also face No. 12 Miami, No. 9 Ohio State,
No. 23 Purdue and No. 8 Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Big, and getting bigger: Expansion of Beaver Stadium to 103,500
seats is planned for 2001. Saturday's crowd of 97,168 was the
stadium's third-largest.
</P>
<P>
   Penn State fans haven't seen such a dominant performance over a
ranked foe since Nov. 4, 1978. That was the last time the Nittany
Lions beat a rated opponent at home with a 27-3 victory over
Maryland, then unbeaten and No. 8 in the polls. They went on to
beat Alabama in the Sugar Bowl for the national title.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona redshirt freshman  &UR; Leo Mills rushed for 69 yards and
scored the Wildcats' lone TD in the meaningless final seconds. His
rushing total was the most by an Arizona freshman since 1996, when
 &UR; Leon Callen went for 116 yards and scored a touchdown against
UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   Beaver Stadium turf has stayed green during the drought with
waste water from a nearby treatment plant. Penn State's practice
fields were irrigated with water used to cool the core of a nearby
nuclear power plant. Arizona got nuked, too. &QL;

GOODYKOONTZ: SHOW DECEPTIVELY SIMPLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Combine a Kathie Lee-less Regis Philbin, a reworking of a
British game show and the third-place network in the dead of summer
television and what do you get?
</P>
<P>
   A ratings monster. A return to the nostalgic days when game
shows fared well in prime time. Or further proof that people will
watch just about anything you put in front of them in August.
Depends upon your point of view.
</P>
<P>
   If you're an ABC executive, the answer is clear. During the
first week of its 13-day run, ``Who Wants To Be a Millionaire?''
was the second-, fifth-, sixth-, 12th- and 18th-most popular show
on television. Ratings for the latter part of the run _ which ended
Sunday night _ will doubtless climb even higher. Numbers like that
guarantee the show will return in some form, probably as a November
sweeps stunt. (Why not? How many countries can they send Drew Carey
to?)
</P>
<P>
   Even though no one actually won $1 million, ``''``Millionaire''
is a certifiable phenomenon, a water-cooler topic. Who among us
hasn't mentally trashed the knucklehead from Richmond, Va., for not
going for the $1 million question last week? Doesn't everyone know
that Jethro Tull won the first Grammy for heavy metal? Sure, his
$500,000 winnings would have been whacked to $32,000 if he'd
missed, but you know you'd have gone for it.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, you also wouldn't have known Pope John Paul I's real
name, which this guy did to get to the $1 million question.
Details, details. This is television we're talking about.
</P>
<P>
   A contestant on Thursday night missed a $64,000 question _
really _ when he thought the Keating Five was a group of bankers.
This bodes well for John McCain's presidential aspirations.)
</P>
<P>
   On the off chance that you recently defected to the United
States and have no idea what all the fuss is over, here's a quick
explanation (clip and save for the show's return):
</P>
<P>
   One contestant is chosen from a group of 10, who qualified for a
free trip to New York and the studio over the phone. Most had to
pay $1.50 for an area-code 900 call; lucky residents of nine states
(including Arizona) made free 800 calls.
</P>
<P>
   Once chosen, the contestant sits across from Philbin and answers
a series of questions, beginning at $100 and more or less doubling
in value every time. They also increase in difficulty.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds about as interesting as a root canal so far. But the
producers jack up the tension with a space-age set, smarmy music,
tricky lighting and annoying comments from Philbin, who squeezes as
much drama out of a trivia question as Bill Clinton does from an
apology. (But Regis doesn't cry.)
</P>
<P>
   Contestants see the question before deciding to continue. Plus,
they are allowed three ``Lifelines.'' They can eliminate two of the
four possible answers, giving them a 50-50 shot. They can ask the
audience for help (sort of an instant poll). Or they can make a
live phone call to a presumably smart friend, asking for the
answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just doubling the money, questions get a little more
intense,'' Philbin told TV critics earlier this summer. ``But the
production values surrounding this is what really is the icing on
the cake.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lighting gets a little more intense, the music gets a
little stronger, the guy gets up to a quarter million dollars,
suddenly you hear a heartbeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then he calls his friend . . . and asks him the question
with the four possible answers, and that second hand is ticking,
you're down to 16 seconds, the music comes in _ I tell you, it's
really terrific television.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Davies, the executive producer of the show, looked to an
old-time game-show host to explain the phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Monty Hall used to say that every great game show has one
moment where the contestant is going to win everything or lose
everything,'' Davies said. ``This program takes that moment,
heightens it with lighting and music and the intimacy of the set,
and plays that moment again and again and again. And it's a very,
very simple idea.''
</P>
<P>
   It really, really is. Much like the classic '50s game shows
were. Which is probably the real reason people watch the show _ it
seems so simple, you could see yourself winning. And answering
trivia questions is more work than buying a lottery ticket _ you
would feel like you earned your windfall.
</P>
<P>
   The simplicity is deceptive, of course.
</P>
<P>
   ``The questions are not impossible,'' Philbin said on a show
last week. ``It's the broad range that'll kill you every time.''
</P>
<P>
   Before you start naming your first-born son Regis, remember one
thing: It's August. ``Millionaire'' was up against the likes of
reruns of ``Jesse'' and ``Jag.'' That's not much of a test _ a
scrambled porno channel would probably do well in that competition.
</P>
<P>
   (Not to imply that anyone would really watch scrambled porno.
That was a hypothetical example. Besides, I was young.)
</P>
<P>
   So, in the spirit of the thing, when ``Millionaire'' returns,
will it: A) continue to kill in the ratings; B) suffer a huge drop;
C) torpedo ABC's season or D) send Regis scurrying back to Kathie
Lee with his tail between his legs?
</P>
<P>
   You have until November to answer. &QL;

   STATE COLLEGE, Pa. _ There were no chants by the Penn State
faithful. Not yet, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   But the murmurs were there.
</P>
<P>
   No. 1?

<P>
   Are national title aspirations legitimate after Penn State
turned Happy Valley into Death Valley for Arizona?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we'll handle it,'' Penn State Coach Joe Paterno said
after expectations for his team were boosted with Saturday's 41-7
whipping of the Wildcats, who were much more mild than wild. ``I
have an old saying that I have said many times, and most of you
have heard me say it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never are as good as you think you are when you win. And
you never are as bad as you think you are when you lose.''
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to say whether Arizona is consoled by that bit of
Paterno philosophy. Arizona had every reason to feel awful after
its expectations were crushed.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, a cautious Paterno said his Nittany Lions still are
an unknown quantity. An unbeaten one, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how good they are yet,'' he said. ``And I don't
think this ballgame proves anything. It's just one game. One win.''
</P>
<P>
   The most impressive aspect about Penn State was its offense. The
Nittany Lions weren't supposed to be high scoring and versatile.
</P>
<P>
   But on Saturday, they scored the first two times they had the
football and rushed for 262 yards against a program, Arizona, that
has a reputation for great defense.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, the Wildcats defense has fallen into disrepair since
the days of Desert Swarm. It was more like Desert Scorn at Beaver
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a lot of criticism offensively last season,'' said
flanker Chafie Fields, who scored Penn State's first two touchdowns
through an inept Wildcats defense that missed one tackle after
another. ``This is the first step for us to show that the offense
can play, too.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interesting twist, Paterno borrowed an Arizona concept by
alternating quarterbacks Kevin Thompson and Rashard Casey, who
proved to be a more effective combination than Keith Smith and
Ortege Jenkins.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson was the object of boos throughout last season. But
nobody was ready to predict cheers throughout this one.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went out there and showed people what we can do,'' center
Eric Cole said. ``I think we silenced some people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, at least for a little while.'' &QL;

HOLMES COULD BE WORKING OUT SOON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE SHAPPELL  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Right guard  &UR; Lester Holmes, &UR; who was injured two weeks
ago in the one-car rollover accident near Flagstaff along with two
other teammates, is healing well and could be cleared to resume
light conditioning work as early as next week.
</P>
<P>
   Holmes suffered severe cuts across his forehead. Initially, it
was projected that he would need about two more weeks of healing,
possibly followed by plastic surgery, before he was ready to work
out.
</P>
<P>
   The healing, however, has come faster than anticipated. Doctors
now are not certain that additional plastic surgery is required.
</P>
<P>
   Holmes is to be examined again Monday, when a determination
could be made to allow him to resume the light conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   It is doubtful that Holmes will be cleared to resume work with a
helmet on his head for at least two more weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Holmes made his first visit to the Tempe training complex last
week to greet teammates.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive lineman  &UR; Carl Simpson, &UR; who suffered a hip injury in
the crash, could be cleared to return to practice this week.
</P>
<P>
   Guard  &UR; Ernest Dye, &UR; whose right arm was nearly severed in the
accident on rain-slickened Interstate 17 about 25 miles south of
Flagstaff, continues to recover at Flagstaff Medical Center after
seven hours of surgery last week to facilitate regeneration of
nerves in his arm. Doctors are more confident that Dye will not
lose the arm. &QL; 
Coming back &QL; 
Cornerback  &UR; Tommy Knight seemingly has shaken the ``injury prone''
tag, having gotten through preseason with nothing more than a
bruised knee. The 1997 first-round pick got two preseason starts
while Pro Bowl cornerback  &UR; Aeneas Williams sat out because of a
sore neck. Knight convinced the coaches that he was on the road
back to competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Knight has not, however, been able to win back the right corner
job that he lost last season to  &UR; Corey Chavous. &UR; But Knight is the
third cover corner, seeing plenty of action in nickel coverages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tommy has played awfully well,'' Coach  &UR; Vince Tobin said.
``This has been by far his best preseason, and one reason is that
he has stayed healthy. He has lined up and practiced every day, and
he has gotten better every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Also, his attitude has been super. He wants to be a football
player. He's not out of any mix at this point. Our objective is to
get the best players on the field. If he passes up somebody, so be
it.'' &QL; 
Lonesome ends &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; John Shean, &UR; the team's vice president of sales who also oversaw
television and radio contract negotiations, is leaving the team.
 &UR; Tom
 &UR; Cordova, &UR; who has an extensive background in sports business and
marketing, has been hired through the end of the year to assume
Shean's duties. Shean had been with the team for seven years.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Lamont Smith, &UR; who represents holdout first-round pick
 &UR; L.J. Shelton, &UR; has rejected the team's latest offer, a three-year
deal that includes a $2 million signing bonus. Smith continues to
threaten to file a grievance with the league, alleging that the
team is not dealing in good faith. Smith also continues to allege
that he has proof that  &UR; Bill Bidwill Jr., Cardinals vice president,
agreed to a four-year contract before Shelton was drafted 21st
overall in April. Smith has hinted that he has a tape recording of
the conversation but has yet to produce one for reporters. Bidwill
denies having made such an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Seahawks receiver  &UR; Joey Galloway, &UR; who is represented by Phoenix
agent  &UR; Eric Metz, &UR; continues his holdout. Metz also represents
rookie tackle  &UR; John Tait, &UR; a first-round pick of the Kansas City
Chiefs who also has not signed.
</P>
<P>
   Good riddance: The Kingdome is scheduled for demolition in
January at the conclusion of the NFL season. For the next two
seasons, the Seahawks will play at the University of Washington's
Husky Stadium while a voter-approved stadium for the Seahawks is
built. Seahawks owner  &UR; Paul Allen already has picked up the bill
for installation of a state-of-the-art scoreboard and video board
at Husky Stadium that will remain there after the team's stay is
over. &QL;

CARDS FRONT OFFICE NEEDS TO STEP UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Up until now, Cardinals coaches have been good soldiers, not
uttering a peep about the predicament the team's
sometimes-dysfunctional front office has put them in.
</P>
<P>
   They nodded approval when told negotiations with  &UR; Rob Moore were
right on schedule and that the unsigned veteran wide receiver will
report in time to be properly prepared for the Sept. 12 season
opener.
</P>
<P>
   They understood why the team reduced its offer to  &UR; Mark Smith
after the third-year defensive tackle rejected a one-year, $500,000
deal last month to report to training camp on time.
</P>
<P>
   They even supported the club's ``no-frills-under-any
circumstance'' offer to unsigned first-round pick  &UR; L.J. Shelton, a
curious negotiating stance for the Cardinals to take considering
their offensive line had been decimated by injuries.
</P>
<P>
   But that was then and this is now _ two weeks before the start
of the regular season _ and if the players aren't in soon, the
coaches, at least privately, will begin to put heat on team
negotiators to get the deals done.
</P>
<P>
   Management can't expect an offense that is without one of its
top weapons, Moore, to be able to beat Miami, San Francisco and
Dallas in the first month.
</P>
<P>
   The defensive coaches, already unsure when they will get injured
defensive tackle  &UR; Eric Swann (knee) back, can't be expected to stop
the run by simply drawing up creative schemes.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics don't lie and this one makes the most loyal Cardinals
fan sick: Seven holdouts remain in the NFL, and Arizona has three
of them.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say the holdouts are all the fault of the front
office, but officials deserve some blame on each.
</P>
<P>
   They had six months to get Moore's deal done, yet serious
negotiations didn't start until last week.
</P>
<P>
   When Smith's agent,  &UR; Gil Thompson, rejected the
take-it-or-leave-it $500,000 offer in July, why did the Cardinals
have to play hardball? It won't take much to get Smith in camp.
There's no doubt he would sign for about $700,000 this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals are right about not wanting to insult other
players who accepted one-year tender offers (Smith initially
rejected a one-year tender offer of $325,000). They also are right
that it would be a horrible precedent to reward holdouts. But they
can't deny that Smith, who has been a starter for 1{ of his two
seasons, is badly underpaid for a starting defensive tackle in the
NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Once the Cardinals gave top draft pick  &UR; David Boston a four-year
deal, they should have expected Shelton to demand one. Why should
the eighth pick overall get one and the 21st pick overall have to
follow a different set of rules?
</P>
<P>
   In Shelton's case, he might have fans on his side had his agent
not botched the negotiations so badly. As a result, prospective
agents are lining up to take Shelton away from him, each
incredulous that a player who had a chance to start as a rookie
remains out of camp.
</P>
<P>
   Each week, the plot gets stranger, and the agent,  &UR; Lamont Smith,
makes a another desperation move.
</P>
<P>
   His latest stunt is to threaten to file a grievance against the
Cardinals with the NFL, a grievance he hopes would allow Shelton to
become a free agent. If you believe the league is going to make
Shelton a free agent based on a draft day conversation between the
agent and Cardinals Vice President  &UR; Bill Bidwill Jr. that was
``inadvertently'' taped, I can get you a smoking deal on some
beach-front property in Ajo.
</P>
<P>
   For two weeks, Smith has maintained he had a tape-recorded
conversation that was supposed to show that the Cardinals haven't
negotiated in good faith. He hasn't played the tape for anybody but
keeps threatening that he will if the team continues to vow not to
give Shelton anything but a straight deal on a five-year offer.
</P>
<P>
   Smith might file a grievance. Then again, he might not. He might
play the tape. Then again, he might not.
</P>
<P>
   Will any of this help Shelton get signed? Of course, not. &QL; 
Beating them down &QL; 
Cardinals players who think Coach  &UR; Vince Tobin runs a taxing
training camp should talk to former teammate  &UR; Lomas Brown, who
complained last week to Browns Coach  &UR; Chris Palmer that camp was
too long and that the players were spending too much time in pads.
</P>
<P>
   Brown met with Palmer on Wednesday, a day after players were
upset about long afternoon practice in full pads after a
full-contact morning workout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that was the culmination of the whole thing because
the day was so tough,'' Brown said. ``We hit during both of those
practices, and it was toward the end of camp, and I think people
were getting a little bit cranky because we were ready to get out
of these pads.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's certain things you get done with pads on and
certain things you get done with pads off, and I think you have to
have the right mix. I don't think you can have too much of one or
too much of the other.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmer apparently got the message and scheduled three days of
single practices. But he doesn't agree that his first camp was too
tough.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many different personalities,'' Palmer said. ``I
mean, (linebacker)  &UR; Chris Spielman would come out with pads on
every practice, and Lomas Brown would like to come out with
sunglasses on every practice. So there's two different schools of
thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``One guy (Brown) has been in the league 15 years and just has
to get his feet wet to know what's going on and then another guy
(Spielman) wants to see how many times he can run into that big bag
down there.'' &QL; 
Kramer sighting &QL; 
Actor  &UR; Michael Richards, who played  &UR; Kramer in TV's ``Seinfeld,''
made a visit to the Vikings locker room last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me tell you something, I got hazed in there,'' said
Richards, who was on hand to shoot a ``Monday Night Football''
promo for ABC Sports. ``I met them all (the players), and I have
the bruises to prove it. I still haven't quite come down off it.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I walked in, everybody said, `Be Kramer, be Kramer, be
Kramer.' And so I had to do `Giddy-up' and all that stuff before
they'd even settle down and talk to me. I had to perform a little
bit.''
</P>
<P>
   A locker room source said Vikings defensive tackle  &UR; John Randle
led the cheers for Richards to enter his Kramer mode, yelling
``Tape him up, tape him up,'' until Richards relented. &QL; 
Still in trouble &QL; 
Second-year quarterback  &UR; Ryan Leaf continues to get himself in the
middle of controversy.
</P>
<P>
   He was fined $10,000 a week ago for not wearing a Chargers polo
shirt on the sidelines of last week's preseason game against the
Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   Team players not suited up for the game were required to wear
the Adidas polo shirt. Not wanting to give Adidas any air time,
Leaf wore his Nike shirt instead.
</P>
<P>
   The fine was levied a couple of days after Leaf confronted a
heckler in the stands at the team's training camp facility in La
Jolla.
</P>
<P>
   The heckler serenaded Leaf with the Little River Band song,
``Lonesome Loser,'' and told Leaf he was ``the worst draft choice
in NFL history. You make  &UR; Heath Shuler look like an all-star.''
</P>
<P>
   Chargers officials were not impressed when Leaf walked across
the field, and with TV cameras shooting, went nose to nose with the
heckler.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least it's here and not in New York,'' Chargers General
Manager  &UR; Bobby Beathard said. ``In New York, it's a hundred times
worse, as far as hecklers. But that's part of what goes on in
sports.'' &QL; 
Facing the music &QL; 
Everywhere Dolphins Coach  &UR; Jimmy Johnson goes, he hears about the
``criminal'' element on his team.
</P>
<P>
   In the off-season, the Dolphins acquired players with rap sheets
such as rookies  &UR; Cecil Collins and  &UR; Robert Baker, who was convicted
of drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   When the Dolphins scrimmaged the Chargers in San Diego,  &UR; Jerry
 &UR; Magee of the ``San Diego Union-Tribune'' wrote that the Dolphins
are a ``sequel to ``Miami Vice'' without the water. They're not a
football team, they're a rogues gallery. They don't have a roster,
they have a blotter. They're all-precinct.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson defended his moves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Especially for a young guy, I want to give a second chance,''
Johnson said. ``Now if they don't do what's right, we'll eliminate
them in a hurry.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether collecting those players, might have an adverse
effect on the team's chemistry, Johnson said, ``Our country is
doing pretty well, and our president had a second chance.'' &QL; 
Short shots &QL; 
Raiders offensive lineman  &UR; Lincoln Kennedy, scheduled to be with
the team in Friday night's preseason finale against the Cardinals
at Sun Devil Stadium, recently made a cameo appearance in the HBO
series ``Arli$$'' in which he played himself. He was a theater and
drama major at the University of Washington but is not eager to
start an acting career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to be in that genre that it's not productive in
the sense that people make roles available to me like `We need a
big body to stand there and look dumb. You'll play a security guard
in a prison.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Former Lions running back  &UR; Barry Sanders doesn't owe the team
$7.3 million, as has been widely reported. He has to pay back $5.5
million from his original signing bonus as a result of retiring.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys have only 15 players left from their 1996 Super Bowl
team.
</P>
<P>
   Jets Coach  &UR; Bill Parcells, on running back  &UR; Curtis
 &UR; Martin saying he wants to rush for 2,000 yards this season: ``Why
not try to get 50 first?'' The Jets averaged only 2.5 yards per
carry in their first two preseason games. &QL;

LEAGUE LEVELS PLAYING FIELD  
 NEW SEASON BRINGS SET OF NEW RULES FOR ROSTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM MCCURDY  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Last year the Western States Football League almost
became a footnote in Arizona's sports history.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was disbanding,'' Glendale Coach Mike Grossner said. ``It
was a done deal, and then it got brought back.''
</P>
<P>
   Off-season meetings between the Arizona Community College
Athletic Conference members and Ricks, Snow and Dixie junior
colleges were set up to create a more level playing field for the
Arizona schools to compete in the WSFL.
</P>
<P>
   New rules beginning this year mandate that WSFL schools can
carry no more than 75 players on their rosters, a decrease of five
from last year. Of those 75, only 25 can be out-of-state players.
Teams choosing to carry more than 25 out-of-state players will lose
two rosters spots per extra out-of-stater. If a team has 27
out-of-state players, for example, its roster limit would be 71.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona schools argued that the northern schools, which have
traditionally dominated the WSFL, had too much of an advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they go out and recruit in the next couple years, they're
going to be real selective,'' Grossner said. ``As the years go by,
I think it'll even out a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   A committee is being formed to act as the WSFL's governing body.
It will regulate scholarships and make sure each school abides by
the new rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's been a long time coming,'' Grossner said.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a brief look at the WSFL's four Valley representatives: &QL; 
Mesa &QL; 
Mesa Community College Coach &UR; David Rice is a colorful guy. Quick
with the quip. Somebody who always shoots from the hip.
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to football _ especially his team _ Rice gets
serious in a hurry.
</P>
<P>
   ``At Mesa, the standard is higher,'' Rice said. ``If we have the
same number of wins as last year, I'll be very disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   Mesa finished 7-4 a year ago, sharing the Arizona Community
College Athletic Conference title with Arizona Western, finishing
third in the WSFL and ending the season with a No. 14 national
ranking.
</P>
<P>
   Optimism centers on sophomore running back &UR; Louis Hinchey, who
ran for 987 yards in seven games last year. He should challenge
 &UR; Jim
 &UR; Smith's 29-year-old single-season rushing mark of 1,261 yards. He
also has a chance to break  &UR; Bobby Thomas' career record of 2,129
yards set in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Hinchey will run behind one of the nation's best junior college
offensive tackles in 6-foot-6, 290-pound sophomore  &UR; Travis Scott.
Scott, a Mesa Westwood product, is a Division I prospect.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's quick and he's mean,'' Rice said. ``We had to go in and
make his jersey bigger. That's a nice problem to have.''
</P>
<P>
   Mesa Red Mountain's  &UR; Juan Parra and South Mountain's &UR; Rashard
 &UR; Gresham, along with tight end  &UR; Mike Smith, return to the offensive
line. Wide receivers  &UR; Travis McNichols, a converted running
back, &UR; Jamal
 &UR; Gaines (Tempe Corona del Sol) and  &UR; Shawn Broadus give the
Thunderbirds additional offensive threats.
</P>
<P>
   Fullback  &UR; John Davis, who along with Hinchey attended Columbine
High School in Littleton, Colo., also is being heavily recruited.
The 5-10, 230-pounder squats 700 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback  &UR; Angel Montemayer (Tempe McClintock) and defensive
tackle &UR; 
 &UR; Bryan Saveilo are the defensive leaders. They're joined by
defensive linemen  &UR; Andrew Brigham (Scottsdale Saguaro), &UR; Tyler
Burchett (Chandler) and  &UR; Tony Damiani (Apache Junction);
linebackers  &UR; Sammy Siaki (Mesa) and
 &UR; Josh McBurney (Tempe); and defensive backs  &UR; Tom Rayburn (Mesa Red
Mountain) and  &UR; Randy Tyree (Tempe McClintock).
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited about the defense,'' Rice said. ``If we can get
the sophomore leadership and stay away from injuries, we'll be in
every game.'' &QL; 
Glendale &QL; 
The Gauchos are trying to return to the form that made them an
ACCAC champion eight times in the past 10 years. They finished 5-5
last season, so there's plenty of room for improvement.
</P>
<P>
   The defense looks solid with the return of nine players,
including six starters. &UR; Adrian Watson, a defensive end from
Belgium, and linebacker  &UR; Josh Watts (Glendale Ironwood) are the
leaders. Watts had 90 tackles and four sacks last year.
</P>
<P>
   Free safety &UR; Algis Motiejunas (Horizon) was set to play at
Georgia Tech, but the sophomore decided to stay close to home.
Cornerback
 &UR; Robert Canidate from Alhambra, the brother of University of Arizona
running back  &UR; Trung Canidate, linebacker  &UR; Steve Rangel (North
Canyon) and nose guard  &UR; Gene Beard also are back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're definitely going to be improved defensively, and
that's going to have to hold us down until we get the offense
down,'' Grossner said.
</P>
<P>
   Only one starter, center  &UR; Ben Harris (North Canyon), returns to
an offense that last season ranked third nationally in total
yardage, averaging 215 yards rushing and 235 passing.
</P>
<P>
   Sophomore left tackle  &UR; Jason Jewell (Washington) is back after
redshirting at Northwestern a year ago. He played for Glendale in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Freshmen quarterbacks &UR; James McKnight (Washington) and &UR; Nick
Taylor (Avondale Agua Fria) are battling for the starting job.
Their targets include transfers  &UR; Mark Marcos (Peoria Centennial)
and sophomore  &UR; Tyree
 &UR; Gillespie (Glendale Cactus).
</P>
<P>
   Sophomore tight end  &UR; Cameron
 &UR; Harmann (Glendale Ironwood) returns after a two-year layoff. The
1996 starter has spent his time rehabilitating from a shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Sophomore fullback &UR; Aaron Midkiff (Cottonwood Mingus) and
freshman tailback  &UR; Robert Ramirez (Avondale Agua Fria) form a
potent backfield. Ramirez signed with Brigham Young but failed to
qualify academically.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to emphasize the running game,'' Grossner said.
``Hopefully, our quarterback steps up, and with those two transfer
wide-outs we should be able to throw the ball.'' &QL; 
Scottsdale &QL; 
The Artichokes should spice things up with new offensive
coordinator &UR; Gerald Broussard, who spent the past 13 years at
Southwestern Louisiana as the offensive line and receivers coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of the reasons I'm so excited about this operation,''
third-year Coach  &UR; Ken Giovando said.
</P>
<P>
   One of Broussard's first orders of business will be deciding
upon a quarterback. Sophomore &UR; Mike Giudici, a backup last year, and
freshmen
 &UR; Matt Walters,  &UR; Josh Stoltz (Gilbert Highland) and &UR; Geoff Revling
(Tempe Corona del Sol) are in the running.
</P>
<P>
   The offensive line has size and experience in sophomore tackles
 &UR; Ralph Zarate (6-6, 315 pounds) and  &UR; Daniel Laurent (6-4, 295) and
tight end  &UR; Ken Welch (6-9, 280), a 27-year-old from Flagstaff who
fought in the Persian Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
   The backfield boasts sophomores  &UR; Stephen Neal and  &UR; Justin
Neilson (Gilbert Highland) and freshman  &UR; Kenny Clayton (Tempe
Corona del Sol). Returner  &UR; Khalid Meals (Queen Creek Arizona Boys
Ranch) heads a talented group of receivers that includes freshmen
 &UR; Andrew Nowacki of Canada, speedster &UR; Eric Griffin (Mesa) and
 &UR; Freeman Carney.
</P>
<P>
   Defensively, twins out of Mesa Dobson,  &UR; Joe and  &UR; George Pastore,
are back at the safety spots. Defensive tackle  &UR; Clint Ellsworth
(Mesa) is being recruited by Illinois, Kansas and Tennessee. The
sophomore redshirted after breaking his ankle in the second game
last year. Defensive end &UR; Steve Sylvester (Mesa Westwood) is another
Division I prospect.
</P>
<P>
   Nose guard  &UR; Joe Dimarco (Scottsdale Saguaro) and linebackers
 &UR; Troy
 &UR; Soukup and  &UR; Bryan Lindsay (Gilbert Highland) also return.
Cornerback
 &UR; Gideon Smith, a sprint champion out of Mesa three years ago, and
linebacker  &UR; Dominick Zorn are expected to contribute.
</P>
<P>
   Return missionary  &UR; Jeremy Flores, a sophomore who played a year
at Phoenix College, will handle the kicking and punting duties.
Flores' 63-yard field goal in high school set a Missouri state
record. &QL; 
Phoenix &QL; 
First-year Coach &UR; Gary Cook will have his hands full trying to turn
around a struggling program that went 1-9 last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are really hoping to set a different tone this year,'' Cook
said. ``We're talking about the attitude and the way we change
things.''
</P>
<P>
   Cook will benefit from the return of three offensive starters _
quarterback &UR; Richard Lucero (South Mountain), tight end  &UR; Scott Asai
(North Canyon) and 6-3, 305-pound lineman  &UR; Mike Harris (Mesa
Dobson). The Bears also will have a proven running back in &UR; Shawn
Watson (Cortez), who transferred from Glendale.
</P>
<P>
   The Bears have five talented freshmen receivers:  &UR; Jimmy Conner
(Greenway), &UR; David O'Hara (Cortez), &UR; Josh Gill (Desert Vista),  &UR; Tony
 &UR; Manning and  &UR; Wayman Westbrooks (Maryvale). Westbrooks transferred
from Utah following a redshirt season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel like we're going to be able to throw the ball really
well,'' Cook said. ``I have a great deal of confidence in Lucero.''
</P>
<P>
   Six starters are back on defense, including cornerback &UR; Jamarei
 &UR; Bryant, a sprint champion from South Mountain who has attracted the
attention of Division I recruiters.
</P>
<P>
   Linebackers  &UR; Shane Johnson (Maryvale),  &UR; David Holmes (Trevor
Browne) and &UR; Ryan West (Peoria Centennial), defensive end  &UR; Ryan
Bakke (Glendale Apollo) and cornerback  &UR; Robert Gray (Trevor Browne)
join Bryant to form the defensive nucleus.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive line newcomers &UR; Rasheen Rice (Maryvale),  &UR; Scott Sharpe
(Glendale Mountain Ridge),  &UR; Ben Bowlen (Glendale Apollo) and &UR; Daniel
 &UR; Miller (Desert Vista) and first-year defensive backs  &UR; Lamont Jones
(Desert Vista) and  &UR; Keon Cornejo (Tempe McClintock) are others to
watch. &QL;

<P>
   Flip the channels, Ruben Hernandez urges.
</P>
<P>
   Try, he says, to find a Latino actor on television.
</P>
<P>
   And that talking Chihuahua on the Taco Bell commercials does not
count.
</P>
<P>
   There's Cheech Marin on ``Nash Bridges,'' he remembers. But then
Hernandez, of the local chapter of the National Hispanic Media
Coalition, draws a blank.
</P>
<P>
   If he does see a Latino actor, Hernandez says, he's often
playing a gang member or drug dealer who speaks in a thick, Mexican
accent.
</P>
<P>
   There are but a handful of other Latino actors on the big four
networks' prime-time shows and none as the leads in any of the 26
network shows premiering this fall. And so, leaders of 10 Latino
organizations across the country are urging Latinos to send a
message to television executives by turning off their television
sets for an entire week, beginning Sept. 12.
</P>
<P>
   The boycott of the four major TV networks _ ABC, CBS, FOX and
NBC _ is to protest the ``brownout'' of Latinos on television and
push for greater diversity in TV shows.
</P>
<P>
   But walk into the plush-carpeted family room of the Moreno
family and gather with the family members on the teal, L-shaped
couch, and there they are, settled in for the evening news. And an
hour later, they'll be here again, laughing at ``Friends''.
</P>
<P>
   For Katrina and George Moreno of Avondale, the brownout is an
admirable goal, but one with little meaning and, they say, little
effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we'll ignore it,'' says George, 32, adding that he'll watch
his favorite news programs and sitcoms and let their 6-year-old son
watch a parade of cartoons.
</P>
<P>
   But drive 10 miles east, to the Phoenix home of Lorrie Vargas
and walk into the family room to a quiet 32-inch TV screen. Her
children will toss aside ``Passions'' and ``Sunset Beach,'' as well
as cartoons and comedies, for a week because Vargas wants to send a
message to TV executives.
</P>
<P>
   And so, when Hernandez and others call for the boycott at a
press conference this week, they know response from the Latino
community will be as diverse as the Latino community itself.
</P>
<P>
   It's not the first time a minority group has urged TV executives
to better reflect their communities. After seeing African-Americans
boycott in the past with some success, members of the National
Council of La Raza, a national Latino advocacy group, announced at
their annual convention in July that they would try it.
</P>
<P>
   Latino groups across the country plan to hold press conferences
and hand out fliers to let people know about the boycott.
</P>
<P>
   Already, there are signs that the networks are paying attention.
The networks have added some minority characters to existing shows
and put them in new shows premiering this fall.
</P>
<P>
   That should be only the beginning, boycott leaders say.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not all farm workers or trying to get across the border.
We're a big part of the population, and if we're going to break
down stereotypes, we need positive role models,'' said Pete Garcia
of Chicanos por la Causa, which is supporting the boycott. ``We
have doctors and dentists, laborers and others. We need to be shown
in a realistic way.''
</P>
<P>
   Latinos make up 20 percent of the Phoenix area's pulation and 11
percent of the United States'. Yet they make up less than 2 percent
of the characters on prime-time TV, according to La Raza.
</P>
<P>
   Look at ``Walker, Texas Ranger,'' Hernandez said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have maybe one Latino in Texas once or twice every season,
which seems to be a Texas without Latinos, which isn't reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Or ``Friends''.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is based on the concept of a New York City which has no
people of color,'' Hernandez said. ``That is totally ridiculous to
me.''
</P>
<P>
   The big exception is Spanish-language television, where almost
every actor is Latino. The biggest provider, Univision, saw its
audience climb 26 percent from 1998 to 1999, according to ``TV
Guide''.
</P>
<P>
   Many Latinos urging the boycott say TV executives need to look
no farther than Latinos' growing buying power.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that money talks,'' said Luz
Sarmina-Gutierrez, president of Valle del Sol, who plans to forsake
new episodes of ``Ally McBeal'' and ``Frasier'' during the boycott.
``And we have money.''
</P>
<P>
   She thinks the statistics alone should urge a more realistic
portrayal. Latinos are the fastest-growing segment of the
population in the United States. And a recent study found that U.S.
Latinos watch about four hours of TV a day, 45 minutes more than
non-Latinos.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Engaging Television in English y en Espanol'' study, by
the Tomas Rivera Policy Institute in Southern California, found
that the biggest part that Latinos played on TV was in news stories
about crime and immigration.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez said the coalition plans to hand out lists of books by
Latino authors and films portraying Latinos in positive or just
reality-based roles for people to read and watch the week of Sept.

RUSHING A PITCHER IS OFTEN A RECKLESS MOVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Angels could have used rookie pitcher Ramon Ortiz in the
rotation several months ago. But, in a shocking display of
forbearance, they resisted bringing him up until last week.
</P>
<P>
   Outfielder Tim Salmon agreed with the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to feel like you deserve it, or else it always hangs
in the back of your mind,'' Salmon said. ``When I got here, I knew
I belonged. This team's had such a bad year, he could've been
caught up in the misery. You have to protect him.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the right time of year. They didn't rush me, and I
thank them for that. You need people upstairs to have patience.''
</P>
<P>
   The people upstairs usually don't, especially when it comes to
young pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   There are many reasons given for the proliferation of offense in
baseball: juiced balls and juiced hitters, smaller ballparks and
smaller strike zones. There is also the theory that pitchers have
become scared to pitch inside.
</P>
<P>
   But one reason must be some of the best young pitchers in the
game are being rushed to the majors before they ever have a chance
to develop their craft. Instead, they come up before they're ready,
they get bombed immediately and their confidence goes flying out
the window.
</P>
<P>
   Talent is one thing but any major-leaguer can tell you
confidence is the most crucial factor. So how much confidence was
Rangers rookie Doug Davis getting when he allowed 10 runs in his
first and only major-league appearnce, or Corey Lee when he gave up
a three-run homer to Tino Martinez on Wednesday night?
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers have a point when they talk about the needs of the
major-league team being top priority and the difficulties of
manipulating their roster. But Davis and Lee are their two best
young prospects, and they're both left-handers playing for a
franchise begging for left-handed pitching.
</P>
<P>
   At least Lee had pitched over 500 innings in the minors, which
player-development people use as a benchmark for young pitchers.
The Detroit Tigers, who have no chance of making the playoffs this
year, brought up Jeff Weaver, their No. 1 draft pick in 1998, after
less than a year in the minors. The Oakland Athletics brought up
Tim Hudson in less than two years.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Rich Ankiel, the best young pitching prospect in
baseball. He was the Cardinals second-round pick in the 1997 draft,
slipping that far only because other teams thought he would be
difficult to sign. But the Cardinals paid $2 million to keep him
from going to the University of Miami and brought him up the majors
last week after he pitched 263 innings in the minors.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals have been killed by injuries to young pitchers,
especially Matt Morris and Alan Benes, both out for the season with
arm injuries. That makes it even more imperative they do the right
thing with Ankiel and they insist he'll be on a strict pitch limit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what we did to deserve what happened to Alan and
Matt,'' Cardinals manager Tony LaRussa said. ``But, because of
that, you want to be even more careful with Ankiel. It means you're
going to be really attentive and not let things slip through the
crack with him. We have to take care of this pitcher.''
</P>
<P>
   All clubs should feel the same way, but that's not always the
case.
SPOTLIGHT ON BARRY BONDS
Beth A. Keiser Injuries have kept Barry Bonds out of action often
this season, but he's hitting home runs and driving in runs at his
best rate.
When healthy, Bonds showing his best power
Barry Bonds is 35 and has played just 72 games because of injuries.
His absence from the lineup early in the season, plus injuries to
other key hitters, kept the San Francisco Giants from staying up
with the Arizona Diamondbacks in the National League West.
</P>
<P>
   But Bonds, when he has been healthy, has been hitting home runs
and driving in runs at a rate unparalleled during his career. This
season, he has homered every 9.9 at-bats and collected a run batted
in every 3.6 at-bats, better than his high-water marks of 1994
(10.6 at-bats per homer and 4.8 at-bats per RBI).
</P>
<P>
   Bonds doesn't look at the numbers _ 25 homers and 68 RBI in just
72 games _ and wonder what kind of season he could have put
together had he not undergone elbow surgery in mid-April. He does,
however, believe this has been his finest hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of my best seasons I ever had because it's the
first time I've ever had a serious injury and had to go through
surgery during my whole career,'' Bonds said. ``I had to dig down
in myself and see if I could do it, \Rsee\S where my heart stood in
the game of baseball, am I willing to go through this.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a lot to be proud of for just going out there and
coming back. I probably came back a little too early, but now my
arm is starting to feel a little bit normal. I can't throw as well
right now. That's going to take a little bit of time. I'm happy
with the outcome of what has happened. Unfortunately, I'm in this
with the team and we want to win.''
</P>
<P>
   That won't happen this year but the Giants still have reason to
believe Bonds will come back strong when they move into a new
ballpark next year.
</P>
<P>
   \Nsubheds:Quick hits
</P>
<P>
   During the summer of 1989, when Pete Rose was under
investigation for gambling, Commissioner A. Bartlett Giammati made
an offer of a 10-year suspension. Rose refused and later took the
indefinite suspension with the right for reinstatement after one
year. Had Rose accepted the offer, his suspension would be up right
now and he'd be eligible for the Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   One possible reason the White Sox want Frank Thomas to play
first base is to make him more attractive in an off-season trade.
The White Sox want to find room for Paul Konerko and minor-league
sluggers Jeff Liefer and Mario Valdez.
</P>
<P>
   Diamondbacks pitcher Todd Stottlemyre has come back strong in
his first two starts, after missing three months because of a torn
rotator cuff. Said Stottlemyre, who has been hitting 92-93 mph on
the radar gun, ``Three months ago, I said I'd pitch again. I
pitched again. Now I'm telling you I will compete and make a
difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack McKeon has a chance to be the first Reds manager to ever be
named manager of the year. That's right, Sparky Anderson never won
the award. McKeon deserves it, but with all the injuries the Braves
have suffered this season, this is probably Bobby Cox's best job
managing since he's been in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles have a tough decision facing them in the off-season.
First baseman Jeff Conine, batting .311 going in the weekend, has
done a terrific job while Will Clark has been out with an injury.
But Conine is eligible for free agency, while Clark, who had 29 RBI
this year, is back at $5 million next year. Letting Conine get away
would be a blow if Clark can't come back strong.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation in Chicago is that Triple-A Iowa manager Terry
Kennedy is a strong bet to replace Jim Riggleman next season. He
was minor-league manager of the year in 1998, and his father Bob
was Cubs manager in 1963-65.
</P>
<P>
   Former Dodgers general manager Fred Claire's name has been
mentioned in connection with the Brewers general manager opening.
National League president Leonard Coleman is pushing Omar Minaya,
the former Rangers scout now with the Mets, and the Brewers have
received permission to talk to Toronto assistant general manager
Dave Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   Duncanville's Todd Ritchie has been a terrific story for the
Pirates this year, going 12-8 with a 3.60 earned-run average. But
he's pitched 145 innings, his most since undergoing shoulder
surgery in 1994, and the Pirates are concerned. They placed him on
the disabled list as a precautionary measure when he started
feeling some discomfort.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay pitcher Bobby Witt is baseball's version of Forrest
Gump. During his 14-year career, he was at the ballpark when Nolan
Ryan got his 5,000th strikeout and pitched two no-hitters, when
Dave Winfield and Wade Boggs got their 3,000th hit and last season
with Mark McGwire in St. Louis for the final two months of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas City Royals are hoping the sale of the team to the
group headed by Miles Prentice will be approved at the Sept. 15-16
owners meeting. But there's a good chance it could be delayed
again, leaving that franchise in further limbo.

<P>
   They each started six games at quarterback. They played despite
injuries. Both have regained their health. Only one will be the
starter when Nebraska opens at Iowa on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback controversy? Not yet. But Huskers coach Frank Solich
knows he has two capable quarterbacks in junior Bobby Newcombe and
sophomore Eric Crouch. Last season, both proved they had the
ability to run Nebraska's demanding option offense.
</P>
<P>
   Newcombe has been listed as the starter during preseason
workouts. Solich is expected to name the starter _ Newcombe,
probably _ early this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something that we want to make sure doesn't become a
controversy,'' Solich said. ``We'll get a quarterback named, get
this thing over with it and move on.''
</P>
<P>
   And even if he winds up as the No. 2 quarterback, Crouch could
still wind up playing a significant role. The Huskers' offense
places mental and physical demands on the quarterback, who gets hit
on nearly every play.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the type of offense we have, you're going to play a lot if
you're a backup,'' said Crouch, a 6-foot-1, 195-pounder. ``We had
to play three quarterbacks last season. You never know what's going
to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Newcombe started his first game at quarterback in the Huskers'
1998 season opener against Louisiana Tech. He completed nine of 10
passes for 168 yards and one touchdown while running for two more
touchdowns. However, he suffered a torn posterior cruciate ligament
in his left knee in the third quarter. Newcombe played the next
five games before the injury forced him to the sideline. He
underwent surgery in December and missed spring practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a year since I've been able to accelerate or
sprint,'' said Newcombe, a 6-foot, 195-pounder. ``My love for the
sport is tremendous; to have that taken away from me and having to
work to play again, my passion for it has increased 10 times
more.''
</P>
<P>
   Newcombe completed 50 of 79 passes for 712 yards. He gained 228
yards rushing. Crouch, who missed three games with a hamstring
injury and also was hampered by a hip pointer, completed 49 of 101
passes for 601 yards and four touchdowns and rushed for 459 yards,
averaging 4.8 per carry.
</P>
<P>
   Neither player is trying to ignite the flames of a quarterback
controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Newcombe: ``I've always looked at football as improving myself
as an athlete and as a leader, not to compete against another
individual.''
</P>
<P>
   Crouch: ``I don't want it to be called a quarterback
controversy. We have a good relationship. Both of us want to do
whatever the team needs. It's been like that the last three years.
We try to make each other better. It's not that big a deal. I don't
think about the quarterback situation as much as people might think
I do.''
</P>
<P>
   Solich said he has considered using a dual-quarterback system.
In 1969 and 1970, Jerry Tagge and Van Brownson shared time at
quarterback; the '70 team went 11-0-1. However, Solich says he's
more sold on having a clear-cut starter and backup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly you would go forward with a two-quarterback system
if you feel the positives outweigh the negatives,'' Solich said.
``There's a lot to consider in terms of consistency and making sure
you don't throw a new guy in if one guy makes a few bad decisions.
That's not the way to handle it.''
</P>
<P>
   If Newcombe is healthy, he combines explosive running ability
with solid passing skills. Last season, he compiled solid
statistics despite playing at about 75 percent because of his knee
injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I worked on my passing this summer, and I've never felt
more comfortable and confident throwing the ball,'' he said. ``I've
got a quicker and more accurate release, and my arm is stronger.''

BLOCKED PUNTS HELP NORTH CAROLINA STATE UPSET NO. 17 TEXAS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ Texas fans may soon be looking toward Jay Humphrey, not
Ricky Williams, as the most prominent deletion from the Longhorns'
1998 roster.
</P>
<P>
   Humphrey, a rookie with the Minnesota Vikings, handled Texas'
deep snaps. The Longhorns struggled with those last night,
resulting in three blocked punts that cost the nation's 17th-ranked
team a victory in its season opener against North Carolina State.
</P>
<P>
   The Wolfpack scored 16 points off blocked punts and upset the
Longhorns, 23-20, in front of 82,582 at Royal-Memorial Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Texas (0-1) lost despite an advantage in total offense (372-172)
and a 4-3 edge in turnover ratio. But the Longhorns, who had not
suffered a blocked punt since 1996, could not get the ball headed
in the right direction from punt formation against the Wolfpack.
Their failure to do so cost Texas two touchdowns and a safety, with
both touchdowns coming in the fourth quarter and allowing N.C.
State to erase deficits of 17-9 and 20-15.
</P>
<P>
   Both of the fourth-quarter blocks came on plays that began at
the Texas 48-yard line and involved two deep snappers: Marcel
Blanchard and walk-on Hunter McWilliams, son of former Texas coach
David McWilliams.
</P>
<P>
   With Texas protecting a 17-9 advantage, Blanchard offered his
second low snap of the night to punter Ryan Long. The first had
resulted in a block and safety. This kick, however, glanced off the
chest of Terrence Holt and Tony Scott returned it the final 25
yards for a touchdown. A failed two-point try left Texas on top,
17-15, and the Longhorns extended the advantage on Kris Stockton's
second field goal with 7:28 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Texas offense faced two additional fourth-down
situations, with McWilliams replacing Blanchard for both. On Texas'
last deep snap of the night, McWilliams forced Long to leap for the
ball. After he landed, Long's kick was smothered by Holt and Eric
Leak returned it the final 35 yards for the winning touchdown with
3:22 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Texas quarterback Major Applewhite (30-of-46, 316 yards, 1
touchdown) drove the Longhorns to the Wolfpack 44-yard line in the
final two minutes but the march stalled when Applewhite could not
convert a fourth-and-one quarterback sneak with 1:49 remaining.
Applewhite also was stopped on a fourth-and-one sneak at the N.C.
State 15-yard line in the second quarter, when Texas coach Mack
Brown opted not to try a field goal to pad a 10-7 lead.
</P>
<P>
   That decision came back to haunt the Longhorns in the fourth
quarter, when N.C. State defenders began crossing the goal line
with blocked kicks. Until last night, Texas had not allowed a
touchdown on a blocked punt since the 1993 Rice game. A hurried
search last night by Texas publicists could not uncover a game in
which the Longhorns had surrendered three blocked punts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The punting game killed us. This is a devastating loss,''
Texas coach Mack Brown said. ``You always worry when you go into a
game with no one who's ever been a deep snapper \Rat the college
level\S. From where I stood, I thought all three punt blocks came
from different reasons. I was really disappointed in that and
disappointed in the fact we didn't make fourth down and six inches
twice. You're not going to win football games doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas built a 17-9 halftime advantage on the strength of two
quick turnovers, a fortunate bounce on a blocked punt and an
electrifying, 80-yard catch-and-run by tailback Victor Ike, a
redshirt freshman sharing time at the position vacated by 1998
Heisman Trophy winner Ricky Williams.
</P>
<P>
   N.C. State lost two fumbles on its first four snaps, allowing
Texas to drive just 31 yards while building a 10-0 lead. Texas
appeared on the verge of an early knockout until defensive end
Aaron Humphrey was called for a dead-ball, unsportsmanlike conduct
penalty that allowed the Wolfpack to convert a fourth-and-eight.
One play later, Ray Robinson's 25-yard touchdown jaunt cut Texas'
advantage to 10-7 and swung the momentum to the Wolfpack.
</P>
<P>
   A blocked punt by Leak resulted in a safety, which Texas covered
with the touchdown strike to Ike to boost the lead to 17-9. But the
Longhorns could not protect it because of a poor punting game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very frustrating,'' Brown said. ``At one point, I thought
we should have been up, 28-0. And here we are, talking about losing
a game.''

MACK MANIA JOLTED BY SIGHT OF BLOCKED PUNTS ROLLING BACKWARD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ Though dressed to the nines in burnt orange, Mack Mania
took a severe jolting here last night.
</P>
<P>
   Has anybody here seen a Heisman Trophy winner, dressed in
dreadlocks and a white wedding gown?
</P>
<P>
   Not here and not lately, of course. But any doubts about whether
Texas coach Mack Brown was going to dearly miss Heisman winner
Ricky Williams were settled with an ominous exclamation point.
</P>
<P>
   You bet he does. Because you never know when, after three months
of hard-baked drought, Memorial Stadium is suddenly going to start
raining blocked punts.
</P>
<P>
   Texas lost its season opener, 23-20, to the North Carolina State
Wolfpack last night in a game that had all the glamour of a mugging
in the parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   The last time that a football game was decided by not one, nor
two, but three blocked punts, it was probably played on your local
playground field and the star quarterback's dog kept running into
the huddle.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't supposed to happen at this level, and certainly not
on national television, except on maybe ``America's Funniest Season
Openers.''
</P>
<P>
   But it did. And Texas lost amid the grand tableau of a new,
wall-to-wall emerald playing field and a sold-out audience.
</P>
<P>
   And just like that, two disturbing things happened.
Heretofore-rejuvenated Longhorns fans suddenly realized that their
national-title dreams have been radically altered. And, second, the
world of orange realized that the task of replacing Williams is
going to be a daunting one.
</P>
<P>
   The earliest University of Texas football game in history began
under sunny, 98-degree skies with no known forecasts of relative
stupidity. But things quickly began to happen.
</P>
<P>
   Early attention was showered upon redshirt freshman Victor Ike,
who turned a 5-yard out pattern into an 80-yard Texas touchdown.
Ike finished with 48 net rushing yards in 12 carries.
</P>
<P>
   But curiously, Ike was nowhere near the football on two telling
snaps where the Longhorns just needed one yard on fourth downs. On
those plays, one in the second quarter where Texas' Brown eschewed
an easy field-goal try and the other as the fourth quarter wound
down, quarterback Major Applewhite tried to sneak for the first
downs.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't make it. Last year, Williams on a fourth-and-one would
have been college football's definition of a sure thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take responsibility,'' Brown said. ``We can't have blocked
punts. I take responsibility for the fourth-and-shorts. You don't
go for it on fourth down unless you can make it.''
</P>
<P>
   The first decision to go for it on fourth down was defensible,
because Ike and junior Hodges Mitchell had shown flashes of being
able to run the ball against the Wolfpack defense. But why a
quarterback sneak?
</P>
<P>
   And why another quarterback sneak with the game in jeopardy in
the fourth quarter? Applewhite has a certain spunk _ but the state
of Texas is supposed to be brimming with strong-shouldered running
backs who can rush for at least one yard.
</P>
<P>
   Still, without the blocked punts, North Carolina State doesn't
prance away with a stolen victory here last night. The Wolfpack
netted only 172 yards of offense _ Texas helped them with at least
that much yardage in backwards-rolling punts.
</P>
<P>
   Two N.C. State touchdowns and its safety came on the blocked
punts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is devastating,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   Mack Mania, heretofore rampant, is going to have a hard time
disagreeing.

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It has been heartwarming to witness the concern expressed by so
many God-fearing individuals toward a troubled Arizona girl.
Everyone from nationally syndicated radio host Dr. Laura
Schlessinger to presidential candidate Steve Forbes has taken up
her cause.
</P>
<P>
   Last Wednesday night at the state Capitol, approximately 150
protesters attended a candlelight vigil in hopes of stopping a
14-year-old ward of the Arizona courts from being taken to
California for an abortion.
</P>
<P>
   The group was led by Bishop Thomas J. O'Brien from the Catholic
Diocese of Phoenix, along with state House Speaker Jeff Groscost
and U.S. Rep. Matt Salmon.
</P>
<P>
   They marched and prayed and spoke about how terrible it would be
to let the girl undergo the procedure, and how concerned they were
with the unborn and with the sad state of morality.
</P>
<P>
   Because they're all honorable people, I'm willing to take them
at their word. I'm willing to believe them when they invoke God's
name and say they care about children. In fact, it's because I
believe I'd like to ask:
</P>
<P>
   Where in God's name have they been for the past nine years?
</P>
<P>
   The pregnant girl whom the protesters and the talk show hosts
and presidential candidates now claim to be concerned about has
been a ward of the court since she was 5 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Where were they when she was in kindergarten?
</P>
<P>
   Did one of Wednesday's candle-holders volunteer to adopt that
needy 5-year-old back in 1990?
</P>
<P>
   She could have used a good home then. She still can. &QL; 
CRITICAL OF JUDGE
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, the presidential candidate who earned his money the
old-fashioned way _ he inherited it _ says the judge who initially
agreed to allow the girl to have an abortion is an example of
``judicial activism run amok.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, but only if Forbes can prove he's not an example of
political opportunism run amok. Along with Rep. Salmon, Grant Woods
and Eddie Basha.
</P>
<P>
   The congressman and the two former politicians have promised the
pregnant girl thousands of dollars in scholarships if she doesn't
have the abortion.
</P>
<P>
   These are men who've proclaimed for years the worst way to solve
a social dilemma is by throwing money at it.
</P>
<P>
   Now, they're willing to buy off a 14-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   What about all the other troubled teenagers in the state? Are we
going to pay each of them for getting pregnant, too?
</P>
<P>
   And what about the thousands of younger children who suffer from
governmental neglect each day?
</P>
<P>
   Do these guys have enough money to handle them all?
</P>
<P>
   Rather than bribing children one by one, politicians might go
back through slashed budgets and fund a few programs designed to
help kids.
</P>
<P>
   But they don't want to do that.
</P>
<P>
   They'd rather just wait until a child is 14 and pregnant, until
after she uses drugs and comes to believe no one wants her. &QL; 
READY TO GIVE ADVICE
</P>
<P>
   Even now, they don't want to DO something. They only want to
tell others what to do.
</P>
<P>
   They want to tell the girl what to do, and tell the governor
what to do, and tell the judge and the social workers and the
doctors what to do, and tell you and me what to do.
</P>
<P>
   If that's how it is, if Bishop O'Brien, Woods, Basha, Salmon,
Dr. Laura, Forbes and the rest, if they're unwilling to let the
professionals handle this _ as most of us are _ then they should
stop talking and act.
</P>
<P>
   Not only in behalf of this one girl, but for all the girls and
boys like her.
</P>
<P>
   They could alleviate this terrible societal problem on their
own, right now, simply by having each person who claims to know
what's best for homeless and abandoned children open his home to a
homeless or abandoned child.
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't happened yet.
</P>
<P>
   Until it does, I figure each time they tell us what to do, we
can tell them where to go _ an adoption agency. &QL;

A PRO-LIFE, PRO-CHILD PROPOSITION 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It has been heartwarming to witness the concern expressed by so
many God-fearing individuals toward a troubled Arizona girl.
Everyone from nationally syndicated radio host Dr. Laura
Schlessinger to presidential candidate Steve Forbes has taken up
her cause.
</P>
<P>
   Last Wednesday night at the state Capitol, approximately 150
protesters attended a candlelight vigil in hopes of stopping a
14-year-old ward of the Arizona courts from being taken to
California for an abortion.
</P>
<P>
   The group was led by Bishop Thomas J. O'Brien from the Catholic
Diocese of Phoenix, along with state House Speaker Jeff Groscost
and U.S. Rep. Matt Salmon.
</P>
<P>
   They marched and prayed and spoke about how terrible it would be
to let the girl undergo the procedure, and how concerned they were
with the unborn and with the sad state of morality.
</P>
<P>
   Because they're all honorable people, I'm willing to take them
at their word. I'm willing to believe them when they invoke God's
name and say they care about children. In fact, it's because I
believe I'd like to ask:
</P>
<P>
   Where in God's name have they been for the past nine years?
</P>
<P>
   The pregnant girl whom the protesters and the talk show hosts
and presidential candidates now claim to be concerned about has
been a ward of the court since she was 5 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Where were they when she was in kindergarten?
</P>
<P>
   Did one of Wednesday's candle-holders volunteer to adopt that
needy 5-year-old back in 1990?
</P>
<P>
   She could have used a good home then. She still can. &QL; 
CRITICAL OF JUDGE
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, the presidential candidate who earned his money the
old-fashioned way _ he inherited it _ says the judge who initially
agreed to allow the girl to have an abortion is an example of
``judicial activism run amok.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, but only if Forbes can prove he's not an example of
political opportunism run amok. Along with Rep. Salmon, Grant Woods
and Eddie Basha.
</P>
<P>
   The congressman and the two former politicians have promised the
pregnant girl thousands of dollars in scholarships if she doesn't
have the abortion.
</P>
<P>
   These are men who've proclaimed for years the worst way to solve
a social dilemma is by throwing money at it.
</P>
<P>
   Now, they're willing to buy off a 14-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   What about all the other troubled teenagers in the state? Are we
going to pay each of them for getting pregnant, too?
</P>
<P>
   And what about the thousands of younger children who suffer from
governmental neglect each day?
</P>
<P>
   Do these guys have enough money to handle them all?
</P>
<P>
   Rather than bribing children one by one, politicians might go
back through slashed budgets and fund a few programs designed to
help kids.
</P>
<P>
   But they don't want to do that.
</P>
<P>
   They'd rather just wait until a child is 14 and pregnant, until
after she uses drugs and comes to believe no one wants her. &QL; 
READY TO GIVE ADVICE
</P>
<P>
   Even now, they don't want to DO something. They only want to
tell others what to do.
</P>
<P>
   They want to tell the girl what to do, and tell the governor
what to do, and tell the judge and the social workers and the
doctors what to do, and tell you and me what to do.
</P>
<P>
   If that's how it is, if Bishop O'Brien, Woods, Basha, Salmon,
Dr. Laura, Forbes and the rest, if they're unwilling to let the
professionals handle this _ as most of us are _ then they should
stop talking and act.

FOR PARK, HOME IS SWEET AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When Chan Ho Park loaded the bases with one out in
the eighth inning Saturday afternoon, pitching coach Claude Osteen
just came out to say hi.
</P>
<P>
   Osteen wasn't there to remind Park this could be a defining
moment in his season. He didn't talk about how much it would mean
for Park to win his first game at Dodger Stadium since last
September.
</P>
<P>
   Osteen knows it is those big-picture images, those
much-talked-about turning points, that have overwhelmed Park all
year. So Osteen kept it simple and Park responded, getting out of
the jam and going on to defeat the Chicago Cubs 4-3 before a crowd
of 46,129.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is so much that has gone through my mind this year, I've
never been able to relax,'' Park said. ``Today I relaxed and took
small steps. It felt great.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, after the victory, the significance of the game was
discussed at length, including how it was a sign from manager Davey
Johnson that he believes in Park.
</P>
<P>
   In a one-run game, the bullpen was ready. Home run leader Sammy
Sosa had just rolled an RBI single between short and third.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson had a pitcher out there who was 0-6 with a 5.86 ERA in
12 starts at home this season. But in a game between two teams
going nowhere, it had much more to do with the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want him to forget about everything and just throw free and
easy,'' Johnson said. ``To be successful you have to clear your
mind.''
</P>
<P>
   For Park, this season has been a mine field of stalled contract
talks, bad pitching mechanics and a loss of nerve on the mound.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today I felt so much confidence,'' Park said. ``That hasn't
always been there this year.''
</P>
<P>
   There were no guarantees that Saturday's game would be a victory
for Park. Los Angeles Dodgers closer Jeff Shaw took over in the
ninth and nearly gave up a two-run homer to Gary Gaetti.
</P>
<P>
   Gaetti's drive with Lance Johnson on base and two outs would
have put the Cubs ahead if it hadn't died on the warning track in
left field.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he hit it I thought it was out,'' said Shaw, who earned
his 28th save. ``But you can't take anything away from what Chan Ho
did today. Not winning here was bothering him. Now that's over.''
</P>
<P>
   Park watched Gaetti's drive on the Dodgers clubhouse television
and said he started yelling, ``Stay in, stay in.''
</P>
<P>
   When players congratulated each other after the final out, Park
turned to Osteen and said, ``I really wanted that.''
</P>
<P>
   After giving up two runs in the first inning, Park (8-10)
limited the Cubs to six hits and one run in the next seven. Sosa,
who went 0 for 4 the night before after coming in with 53 homers,
was hitless in his first three at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers got two runs in the second, including an
opposite-field home run by Eric Karros that bounced off Sosa's
glove and into the stands in right. It was Karros' 28th homer.
</P>
<P>
   They added two more in the third against Cubs starter Andrew
Lorraine (1-3), a product of Hart High. This time, Gary Sheffield
went deep with his 23rd homer. Sheffield now has 17 RBI in his past
eight games and 76 overall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't as upset with the Karros homer because I thought it
was going to drift foul,'' Lorraine said. ``But Sheffield, that was
frustrating. I made a bad pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   Park settled down after getting the lead. He hit two batters in
the first four innings and often frustrated Osteen with his pitch
selection.
</P>
<P>
   But Park adjusted. Between starts he had watched old video and
noticed a mechanical flaw with his hips during the delivery.
</P>
<P>
   ``That made a big difference in his velocity and control,''
Osteen said. ``I don't know what was going on early in the game,
but the most impressive thing was he worked it out himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaw said that one reason for Park's improved focus was the
recent success of the Dodgers' other starters. Ismael Valdes went
the distance Friday night in a 9-0 shutout. Darren Dreifort goes
after his third consecutive victory tonight and Kevin Brown won
five straight before dropping his last start.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never want to be the only one who isn't contributing,''
Shaw said. ``It can be very competitive between pitchers. That
isn't always a good thing, but when it's working, it's great.''

SLUMPING MONDESI SHOWS SIGNS OF LIFE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Most people think Raul Mondesi is going to break
out of his long slump with a big home run.
</P>
<P>
   But in the second inning of Saturday's 4-3 victory over the
Chicago Cubs, Mondesi showed a side that might be even more
important.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi followed Eric Karros' home run by grounding a base hit
past Cubs second baseman Chad Meyers. The ball rolled into shallow
center and Mondesi kept running until he reached second.
</P>
<P>
   With Todd Hollandsworth at the plate, Mondesi then stole third
and came home on an infield out by Adrian Beltre that tied the game
at 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him, I don't want him to hit home runs,'' manager Davey
Johnson said. ``I told him I just want him to be Mondy.''
</P>
<P>
   That means running and manufacturing runs. Even though the Los
Angeles Dodgers hit two homers, Cubs manager Jim Riggelman said
Mondesi's daring was a turning point in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't let Mondesi run on us,'' Riggelman said. ``You can't
let aggressive guys like Mondesi hurt you, and that stolen base
hurt us badly.''The past two weeks, Mondesi, who has 25 homers and
26 stolen bases, has been booed by Dodgers fans in response to his
profanity-laced tirade aimed at management.
</P>
<P>
   He still refuses to talk about the incident or his demand to be
traded. But the boos are starting to subside.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those of us who have watched him up close know what kind of
player he can be,'' said Gary Sheffield, who homered Saturday and
has 17 RBI in his past eight games. ``He's learned from his
mistakes. Now he has to steady himself and play like that over a
six-month period.''
</P>
<P>
   Quick hits: Until Saturday, Chan Ho Park was one of just two
full-time starters without a win at home. Milwaukee's Scott Karl is
0-7 with a 6.46 ERA at County Stadium.... Paul LoDuca started
behind the plate in place of Todd Hundley and went 1 for 3. He also
threw out Mark Grace attempting to steal and has thrown out 5 of 16
runners (31 percent) this year.... Leadoff hitter Eric Young went 1
for 4 and is 19 for 45 (.422) since coming off the disabled
list.... Robinson Checo (groin) came though Friday's workout with
no discomfort and could begin a rehabilitation assignment Wednesday
at Single-A San Bernardino.... The Dodgers are 15-10 in August and
are guaranteed their first winning month since April. The Cubs'
August record dropped to 5-22.... Cubs left fielder Henry Rodriguez
left the game in the first inning after fouling a pitch off his
right foot. X-ray were not needed.

OH HENRY ... IF ONLY YOU WERE STILL A DODGER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ How awesome is outfielder Henry Rodriguez's range?
Forget all those scouting reports. The only thing you really need
to know is this:
</P>
<P>
   What Jocelyn Hernandez couldn't pull off by herself, Rodriguez
accomplished with disarming ease.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez had been trying for months to arrange a meeting
between her son Gregory, a recovering burn victim, and Los Angeles
Dodgers outfielder Raul Mondesi. Nothing came of her repeated
requests.
</P>
<P>
   Then on Friday night, Rodriguez spotted Jocelyn and 8-year-old
Gregory in the Dodger Stadium stands during batting practice.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, long before Rodriguez became the best power hitter this
side of Sammy Sosa in the Chicago Cubs' lineup, he was a Dodger who
took an hour out of his day to visit Gregory in an L.A.-area
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The next time Rodriguez saw Hernandez was a few hours before the
Dodgers and Cubs opened a three-game series that concludes today.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, who was conversing with Mondesi, motioned for Gregory
and Jocelyn to join him on the field. He introduced mother and son
to Mondesi, autographed a bat and handed it to the spellbound boy,
then called a photographer over to snap a few group shots.
</P>
<P>
   For a few glorious seconds Gregory was drawing the stares of
strangers for reasons that had nothing to do with the grafted skin
on his face.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi may have two Gold Gloves but he hasn't been connecting
much with the cut-off man standing between performance and
popularity. That would be the fan, whom Mondesi has alienated this
summer with his outbursts and antics.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, 31, could school the 29-year-old Mondesi, his
one-time teammate and longtime friend. Everything he has learned
since leaving the Dodgers, Rodriguez says he would gladly pass on
to Mondesi.
</P>
<P>
   All Mondesi has to do is ask.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez offered some roundabout advice Friday night after the
Cubs' nine-run loss. On Saturday, he left the game in pain in the
first inning after fouling a Chan Ho Park pitch off his right
instep, just above the arch.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many things happen in baseball, you just have to see it and
just be quiet,'' Rodriguez said. ``Raul is the kind of guy,
sometimes he says things he doesn't mean.''
</P>
<P>
   Tell Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone and manager Davey
Johnson about it.
</P>
<P>
   There was a lot Rodriguez wanted to say on the May day in 1995
when he was dealt from the Dodgers to Montreal in a trade that
brought center fielder Roberto Kelly and left-handed reliever Joey
Eischen to L.A.
</P>
<P>
   las, his tears got in the way. The Dodgers were in New York at
the time and Rodriguez, who spent 10 years in the Dodgers'
organization, remembers crying from taxi to touch down on his short
flight to Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Mondesi, he didn't want out of L.A. He paid for the sins
of general manager Fred Claire, who didn't re-sign center fielder
Brett Butler in 1995 and had to do something when the team got off
to a miserable start.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up here as a player, I came up in this system, I love
this city,'' Rodriguez said. ``I thought I'd be with the Dodgers
for the rest of my life. I wanted to stay here.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez was the odd man out in a musical chairs outfield that
at various times included Kal Daniels, Darryl Strawberry, Eric
Davis, Cory Snyder, Mondesi, Billy Ashley and Todd Hollandsworth.
</P>
<P>
   He made his big-league debut in 1992 and got more than 300
at-bats in just one of the ensuing seasons, in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 in Montreal, in his first full season as an everyday
player, Rodriguez had an NL-record 20 home runs before June 1. That
equaled his home run outlay in four seasons as a Dodger.
</P>
<P>
   He would finish with 36 home runs. He has 24 in 111 games this
year and his on-base percentage of .402 is tops among Chicago's
everyday players.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, Henry, do the Dodgers wish they could re-write the surprise
endings these past few seasons have generated. You don't have to be
sentimental to see the Dodgers would have been better for having
Rodriguez' left-handed bat and lopsided grin.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez remains as amicable as the day Ralph Avila and
Eleodoro Arias signed him. To wit: It took him 15 minutes to wind
his way from the visiting dugout to the batting cage Friday night
because of all the hands he stopped to shake.
</P>
<P>
   He hasn't changed that much as a player, either, since his
Dodgers days. The only difference is he has bulked up his muscles
and his confidence. The former has increased his power at the plate
and the latter, his patience.
</P>
<P>
   ``The door opened to me when I went to Montreal,'' Rodriguez
said. ``That's because I had the opportunity to play every day.
That's what a young player needs to perform.''
</P>
<P>
   Young players need mentors, too, and Rodriguez found his in two
fellow Dominican Republic natives: manager Felipe Alou in Montreal
and Sosa in Chicago, where the Santo Domingo native was dealt for
pitcher Miguel Batista before the 1998 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dominican (players), they sometimes don't know how to say
things, how to talk to the media,'' Rodriguez said. ``You have to
learn these things.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been an arduous process for Mondesi, a San Cristobal
native who has ``the best talent of any baseball player'' Rodriguez
has seen.
</P>
<P>
   What Mondesi hasn't had since the Dodgers dumped pitcher Ramon
Martinez is someone in the clubhouse with whom he has a history,
someone he trusts, someone he looks up to like an older brother.
</P>
<P>
   Someone who can tell him, straight away, as Rodriguez did on
Friday, ``Sometimes you've just got to play hard and mind your
business.''
</P>
<P>
   That was before Rodriguez showed Mondesi one more thing: If you
can treat the fans like family, so much the better.

TEXAN STRUCK OLYMPIC GOLD AND SAW TERRORISTS LEAVE THEIR MARK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lanny Bassham's room in Munich's Olympic Village was only yards
from what ABC broadcaster Jim McKay called ``the end of an age of
innocence for sports.''
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian terrorists, known as Black September, had broken
into the Israeli dormitory, killing a coach and a wrestler and
taking nine other athletes hostage. The terrorists demanded the
release of 200 prisoners from Israeli jails and safe passage out of
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Bassham and his shooting teammates were horrified with what they
saw just outside their window.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a guy with a black hood and automatic rifle, walking
up and down,'' Bassham said. ``We were in the military and we were
sitting there with all our guns. We had center-fire pistols,
center-fire rifles, but no ammunition. Could we kill one terrorist?
Sure. But think about it, how much sense would that make? But we
felt helpless, we thought somebody ought to be doing something.''
</P>
<P>
   They tried at the airport. West German police assaulted the
terrorists as they boarded a helicopter, but the rescue turned into
a disaster. Nine Israelis, one policeman and five terrorists were
killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of them was on the Israeli shooting team,'' Bassham said.
``He was a friend of mine. We had competed against each other. It
was a tragic day that none of us will ever forget.''
</P>
<P>
   Bassham _ a Richland High graduate and four-year All-America
rifle shooter at UT-Arlington _ would keep a front-row seat to
history throughout the turbulent 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   He would turn a gold-medal performance in 1976 into one of the
most memorable moments in Olympic history and he would suffer
personally for President Carter's decision to boycott the 1980
Moscow Summer Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   But a decade of political turmoil that spread throughout sports
found its worst tragedy in Munich on the morning of Sept. 5, 1972.
</P>
<P>
   Bassham already had won a silver medal in the small-bore rifle
competition at the Munich Games and was preparing his return to the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was actually visiting some friends away from the village
when it happened,'' Bassham said. ``When the terrorists took over
and killed some people, I put in a phone call to my team manager
and said, `What do you think I should do?' He said, `You ought to
get back here because we don't know what this means, somebody could
try to kidnap an Olympian.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a hard time getting back to the village. Even though I
was a silver medalist, I had to have several people tell the
officials who I was. To get me back to my room, they had two guards
with flak jackets put a flak jacket on me and cross an open place.
Only time in my life I ever wore a flak jacket.''
</P>
<P>
   The Olympics were suspended for 34 hours. There was some debate
about whether the Games should be canceled, but IOC President Avery
Brundage ordered them to continue. Bassham agreed with the
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we start letting terrorists change the way we feel about
things, then we empower them,'' Bassham said. ``As long as they
don't change the way we feel about things, then they're just
tragic, sick people. They did the right thing by not shutting down
the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was some concern among the athletes they wouldn't be
strong, they wouldn't continue on, which would have been the
stupidest thing they could have done. But they continued, which was
the right thing.'' UNLIKELY OLYMPIAN Bassham, a native Texan born
in Comanche, wanted to compete in the Olympics for as long as he
can remember. The Games always fascinated him, even though he was
usually the worst athlete in his school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Small, slow and uncoordinated,'' said Bassham, now 59 and
living in Flower Mound. ``I ran the 100-yard dash in 12 minutes. I
remember one time in class we were studying the Olympics. One kid
got up and said, `I know, the one person who will never get to the
Olympics ... And he pointed at me.' ''
</P>
<P>
   That classmate was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Bassham was 12 when he took up rifle shooting. A friend told him
a person didn't need to be tall, strong or fast to shoot. Bassham
knew at once the sport was for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found out there is more than one way to get to the
Olympics,'' Bassham said.
</P>
<P>
   Bassham, under the instruction of his father, William, started
getting there in a hurry. His father was assigned to the Army
Marksmanship School at Fort Benning, Ga., which allowed Bassham to
train with the best shooters in the world. He won a national
championship in his first major competition.
</P>
<P>
   He attended Richland High School after his father retired from
the Army, then took an ROTC scholarship to UTA, where he was a
four-year All-American. By 1972, he was a captain in the Army and a
member of the U.S. Olympic team.
</P>
<P>
   He made the team in two events: the 50-meter and 300-meter
small-bore rifle. To win a gold medal, he had to beat two
teammates: Lones Wigger, a gold medalist in Tokyo in 1964; and John
Writer, a silver medalist in Mexico City in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   They were the two best shooters in the world, but Bassham said,
``In practice, I was beating both of them. I figured if I did the
same in competition, I'd win two gold medals. But in the
competition, I came totally unraveled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just choked.''
</P>
<P>
   Bassham spent the next four years studying mental-management
techniques, learning to control the mind under pressure situations.
His primary sources were former gold medalists. He interviewed
every one he could, including swimmer Mark Spitz, long-distance
runner Billy Mills, even the marksmen he was competing against.
</P>
<P>
   The improvement was drastic. He won eight gold medals at the
1974 world championships and eagerly awaited the 1976 Olympics in
Montreal. Little did he know, his triumph there would elevate the
Olympics above the politics and controversy that had swirled around
the Games from the beginning. OLYMPIAN GESTURE Wednesday, July 21,
1976, was a windy day in Montreal, conditions that are bad for
shooting. But Bassham, using the mental techniques he had
developed, refused to let the elements bother him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I performed as good as I could,'' Bassham said. ``I
used everything I had learned. I remember shooting the last shot
and thinking, `I'm a gold medalist.' Nobody could shoot better than
I did.''
</P>
<P>
   The preliminary scores suggested otherwise. Those scores showed
Margaret Murdock, a 33-year-old nurse from Topeka, Kan., had become
the first woman to ever win a gold medal in shooting.
</P>
<P>
   But that was unofficial, based on a spotter standing behind the
shooter with a telescope. In the days before electronic scoring,
the real winner was determined when the paper targets were taken
down and judged by a jury in a private room.
</P>
<P>
   The preliminary scores showed Murdock had 1,162 points (out of a
possible 1,200), giving her a one-point victory over Bassham. But
Bassham knew that wasn't right.
</P>
<P>
   He knew that he had been given a nine on one of his kneeling
shots and it really had been a 10. Olympic archery champion Darrell
Pace and former Olympic shooter Jack Foster, who were watching his
shots with telescopes, also assured him the score would be changed.
</P>
<P>
   But, while the jury carefully studied the targets for five
hours, the media swarmed over Murdock, believing she was the
champion. So did she.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' Murdock said. ``At the time, I had heard some rumblings
that Lanny had another point coming, but I thought one of mine was
questionable. I thought I could have another point coming.''
</P>
<P>
   When the jury was finished, Bassham was given another point.
Murdock was not. They were now tied and the tie-breaking rule at
the time stated the last 10 shots would determine the winner.
Bassham had the better score in those 10 shots and was ruled winner
of the gold medal.
</P>
<P>
   Both Bassham and Murdock, who had made the team on the same
tie-breaker, pleaded for a shoot-off. The officials refused.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing is that a lot of shooters, not just Lanny and
I, wanted to shoot off ties,'' Murdock said. ``But the
administrators wanted to do it with paper work, it was a lot less
trouble for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Bassham, ``It wouldn't have been so bad if she hadn't spent
the last five hours thinking she had won. I was worried about her.
I was happy about winning a gold medal, but I was just devastated
for her.''
</P>
<P>
   Bassham was the one who filed a protest, asking that both be
awarded gold medals. Again officials refused.
</P>
<P>
   Then he suggested to Murdock that she refuse the silver medal
and call attention to the situation, hoping that would persuade
people to give her a gold medal.
</P>
<P>
   But Murdock said, ``I knew that if I refused the medal, nobody
would ever offer it to me again. They'd give it to somebody else. I
decided to go ahead and take it.''
</P>
<P>
   An Associated Press reporter, thinking he had overheard
something, then filed a story saying Bassham was going to refuse
his gold medal at the awards ceremony the next day. Thinking
another Olympic controversy was brewing, the ceremonies were
swarming with reporters, photographers and camera crews.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never said that,'' Bassham said. ``Never thought of it. But
that's what was reported.''
</P>
<P>
   What he actually did was better.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're at the awards ceremony,'' Bassham said. ``I got my gold
medal, she got her silver medal. I thought, I can't get her a gold
medal, but I can give her the one thing every Olympian dreams of,
just one day standing on the platform with nobody below you while
your national anthem is being played. So when the national anthem
started being played, I brought her up with me. It's never been
done before or since.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Murdock, ``That was very gracious of him to do. In the long
run, it helped our sport a great deal.''
</P>
<P>
   After Montreal, the tie-breaking rules were changed to include a
shoot-off. The sport was also divided into men's and women's
competition, leaving equestrian as the only Olympic sport left
where men and women compete against each other. OLYMPIAN SETBACK
Bassham thought he would have another day, four years later at the
1980 Moscow Olympics. But that chance never came. The Soviet Union
invaded Afghanistan in December 1979. The following January,
President Carter announced the United States would boycott the
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``What in the world was President Carter thinking?'' Bassham
said. ``That was stupid. How is not sending American athletes to
Moscow going to hurt the Russians? Why hurt me? I was shooting the
best in my life at the time when I found out Carter wasn't going to
let us go.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter, in his memoirs ``Keeping Faith'', wrote. ``For the
Soviet Union, the Moscow Olympics was much more than a sporting
event. They saw it as a triumph for Communism and a vivid
demonstration that the Soviets represented the true spirit of the
ancient Olympics. I made it clear that, even if we had to stand
alone among nations, American athletes should not go to Moscow
while Soviet troops were still trying to crush the Afghan people.''
</P>
<P>
   Bassham stopped training. He had a family to support and
training was costing him $15,000 a year. He later competed in the
Olympic trials, but didn't make the team. His Olympic shooting
career was finished.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Carter had let us go, I would have trained,'' Bassham said.
``And nobody would have beaten me. Not any Americans, not anybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure I'm bitter. I'm still bitter. It's just not my medal,
it's all the guys that could have medaled and all my students I had
ready to go. What did the Olympics have to do with Russian-American
relations? We were used as pawns in some political nightmare.
That's irresponsible.''
</P>
<P>
   Bassham sent Carter a letter. He never received a reply.

PATRIOTS WALK THE PLANK 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA _ The Patriots left the field feeling the three H's _ hot,
horrified, and humiliated. Not even the mercurial Michael Bishop
could salvage some self-respect Saturday &UR;  &LR; night, for if the third
game of the exhibition season is the dress rehearsal for the
regular season, the Patriots will be closing after one week on
Broadway and the Jets will pull the final curtain Sept. 12.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots found they can't perform in hostile territory,
getting trashed by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, 45-14, before 64,092
at beautiful Raymond James Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   There was no glimmer of hope anywhere within that score. The
first offense played for nearly three quarters and managed two
scores, including a pretty 40-yard touchdown bomb from Drew Bledsoe
to Tony Simmons in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the most embarrassing game I've been involved with in
nine years,'' said wide receiver Shawn Jefferson. ``I can't explain
it. Why did we play like we did? I have no idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Veteran wide receiver Troy Brown said the lack of intensity was
alarming because, ``the guys who usually get the team ready to go,
the rah-rah guys, didn't do that tonight. Guys on this team depend
on certain guys doing it and for whatever reason, it didn't
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The feeling was similar to two years ago when the Patriots
played one of their worst games in the Pete Carroll Era, losing,
27-7, to Tampa Bay just a few days after the infamous mosh pit
incident at The Paradise, a Boston night club.
</P>
<P>
   ``We missed quite an opportunity to play well in a hostile
environment, but we failed to play with emotion and now we have to
check it out. We have to find out why this happened,'' Carroll
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots couldn't tackle, couldn't hit, and couldn't stop
anything in the middle of the field. They did not manage one
third-down conversion. The frustration reached its apex when rookie
safety Tony George was ejected in the fourth quarter for throwing a
punch at rookie wide receiver Darnell McDonald. That was after
Bishop had directed the offense downfield in the fourth quarter on
scrambles of 11 and 26 yards before fumbling inside the 10.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots were bad in every aspect of the game. Special teams
allowed huge returns, including a 93-yard touchdown runback by Yo
Murphy in the third quarter, immediately following the Patriots'
second score.
</P>
<P>
   It all started when Bledsoe (14 for 19, 178 yards, 2 TDs) was
intercepted in the first quarter. Bledsoe threw deep to Terry Glenn
(4 catches, 53 yards), but Glenn couldn't take it away from strong
safety John Lynch, who returned the interception into Patriots'
territory.
</P>
<P>
   On the first Bucs' drive, the Patriots allowed substantial
passing yardage over the middle of the field. Bucs quarterback
Trent Dilfer (11 for 20, 184 yards) hit tight end Dave Moore for a
29-yard pass play to the 13. Two plays later, after Tedy Bruschi
stopped Warrick Dunn for a 3-yard loss, Dilfer found Dunn, who lost
Bruschi with a quick cut back and brought it to the 1. Mike Alstott
ran up the middle for the score with 5:06 remaining in the first
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Bucs' aggressive defense proved too much for the Patriots
offensive line in the first half. Defensive tackle Warren Sapp
busted in over Heath Irwin at left guard to stop Kevin Faulk (nine
carries, 40 yards) for a 5-yard loss late in the first quarter. In
the second quarter, Sapp plowed through the line past Max Lane,
sacking Bledsoe for a 9-yard loss.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots were oozing negativity all over the field. What
happened to Ty Law? He was playing too loose on Jacquez Green late
in the first quarter, allowing Green to catch a 19-yard pass from
Dilfer. With less than 10 minutes remaining in the second quarter,
Law was called for pass interference on Bert Emanuel, resulting in
a 29-yard gain for the Bucs to the 8-yard line. Alstott did the
rest, picking up 7 yards with the Patriots tackling nothing but
air, and then up the middle for a 1-yard score with 9:47 left in
the half, making it 14-0 Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't isolate one play and say it was this guy or that
guy. We win as a team and we lose as a team,'' said Law. ``There's
no way we can play worse than this so we've got to get it together
next time and get ready for when it counts.''
</P>
<P>
   As demoralized as the Patriots seemed to be, they put together
an impressive second-quarter drive to get on the scoreboard. They
marched 69 yards in four plays, which included quick strikes from
Bledsoe to Faulk (15 yards), and three consecutive passes to Glenn
of 15, 21, and 15 yards, the last a diving catch in the end zone
that cut the gap to 14-7.
</P>
<P>
   Taking over at their own 28, the Bucs romped 72 yards on eight
plays, again exposing the Patriots' soft middle with a 33-yard
Dilfer-to-Reidel Anthony connection, and eventually ending with
Alstott running up the middle for a 4-yard touchdown with 2:55
remaining in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, if things weren't bad enough, Faulk coughed up
the football at his own 30 following a short gain, giving the Bucs
a first down. Two plays later, Dilfer swung a pass to Rabih
Abdullah, who benefited from a couple of blocks and a few missed
tackles on the way to the end zone and a 28-7 Bucs' lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots' first-team offense, which was on the field for
most of the third quarter, cut the deficit to 28-14 on an 80-yard
drive against the Bucs' second-team defense. Bledsoe connected with
Jefferson for 16 yards, following by a 17-yard scamper by Faulk,
before Bledsoe threw a 40-yard scoring bomb to Simmons over a
helpless Brian Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   But before you could say ``Yo'', the Patriots had done something
bad again. The Bucs' Murphy broke out of the wedge and raced 90
yards on the ensuing kickoff for the touchdown with 3:44 remaining
in the third quarter, making it a 35-14 game.
</P>
<P>
   The rest was garbage time. Actually, all of it was.

RED SOX GET A GRIP

 SOX-ANGELS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Those private investigators Mo Vaughn was convinced
were hired by the Red Sox to follow him when he still played here
could be out of work now.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Vaughn could put the snoops to work for him. Have them
check a certain general manager's booth in Yawkey Way, or a certain
CPA's office in Dedham with a J. Harrington nameplate on the door,
to see if there is a Mo Vaughn doll with pins stuck through its
heart.
</P>
<P>
   While Dan Duquette's hand-picked replacement piece for Vaughn,
Jose Offerman, delivered a tie-breaking, eighth-inning RBI double
that gave the Red Sox a 7-6 win over the Angels for their second
last-at-bat win in two days Saturday, there was no joy for Vaughn
and the Anaheim nine in what was once Mo-ville.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn, who missed Friday night's series opener to attend a
funeral, went hitless in four at-bats, three times making outs with
runners on base, then striking out against Derek Lowe in the ninth
to thunderous cheers from the sellout crowd of 33,060 in Fenway
Park. Vaughn is now 1 for 15 with seven strikeouts in four games
here against his former mates.
</P>
<P>
   Lowe, who saved Friday night's 4-3 win and got credit for the
win Saturday, almost gave back the moment when Tim Salmon, who
followed Vaughn to the plate, hit a drive deep to the track in
center. But there was room for Darren Lewis to make the catch,
giving the Sox four wins in their last five games and nothing worse
than a share of the wild-card lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure I heard it,'' Lowe said of the crowd reaction to his
showdown with Vaughn, who remains far more popular with his former
mates (from whom he got hugs) than his once-faithful following (who
offered him mostly boos).
</P>
<P>
   ``But that can work for you or against you. The perfect example
of that is Salmon. I was lucky to get that ball back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you try to do too much. I pretty much threw that
ball to Salmon right down the chute. Thank God he didn't hit it
into the net.''
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Jason Varitek, whose three-run double with the bases
loaded in the third lifted the Sox into a 5-4 lead after they'd
fallen behind, 4-1, first hugged Lowe after the final out, then
grabbed him by the scruff of the neck.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was talking to me about that last pitch to Salmon,'' Lowe
said with a laugh. ``He said, `Next time, get that ball out there.
You're lucky he didn't hit it for a home run.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox, ahead, 6-4, entering the eighth, let the Angels slip
back into a tie when Rich Garces, who had retired Vaughn on a fly
ball with one pitch to end the seventh, walked the first two
batters in the eighth, bringing Lowe into the game, and John
Valentin threw away a double-play grounder, pulling Offerman off
the bag at second.
</P>
<P>
   One run scored on that play, and the tying run scored when
Billerica's Gary DiSarcina hit a 120-foot single off Lowe over the
head of first baseman Mike Stanley.
</P>
<P>
   But in the bottom of the inning, Lewis drew a two-out walk from
Angels rookie Lou Pote, who had set down seven in a row after
relieving starter Steve Sparks. Trot Nixon, who had singled home
Varitek (aboard on another double) for the Sox' sixth run in the
sixth, then grounded another single to right, which brought Angels
closer Troy Percival into the game.
</P>
<P>
   Percival, the All-Star who blew the save the night before when
Troy O'Leary doubled in the eighth, was still on the field 40
minutes after the game Saturday, running laps, after Offerman lined
a 1-and-0 pitch into the right-field corner that bounded over the
railing for a ground-rule double as Lewis scored.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather run out here and work out some frustration than go
in there and make a jackass of myself,'' Percival said. ``It's
either that or throw stuff around here and get somebody hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox hurt themselves with two errors. Valentin botched a
double-play ball for the second time in two games, while Nixon
overran Garret Anderson's single in the third, allowing Salmon to
score the Angels' fourth run of the inning off Boston starter Tim
Wakefield.
</P>
<P>
   But they were able to overcome their mistakes with major
assistance from Varitek, who was in the rare position Saturday of
not only having to catch a knuckleballer (Wakefield), but hitting
against one, too (Sparks).
</P>
<P>
   Varitek's two doubles gave him 31 for the season, making him the
first Sox catcher to have 30 or more doubles since Worcester's Rich
Gedman hit 30 in 1985. Carlton Fisk holds the club record with 39
in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Did Varitek's familiarity with Wakefield's knuckler give him an
advantage against Sparks? ``No,'' he said with a snort. ``I hit a
fastball once (the bases-loaded double, which came on a 3-and-1
count) and a knuckler the second time (an 0-and-2 pitch).
</P>
<P>
   Sox manager Jimy Williams said the guy who deserved the most
sympathy on this day of dueling knucklers was Al Clark, the plate
umpire.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy who had double vision out there was Al Clark, to have
both of those guys,'' Williams said. ``It's tough out there.''
</P>
<P>
   It was tough out there for Vaughn, too. He bounced to first
baseman Stanley with a runner on second in the first, popped to
Nomar Garciaparra on Wakefield's first pitch with runners on first
and third in the third, walked to start the fifth, flied to left on
Garces's first pitch with a runner on second in the seventh, then
whiffed against Lowe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was booed here as a home player, so that wasn't a factor,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``No excuses. I partied for seven years, and I'm going to party
again next year. Payback will be something.''
</P>
<P>
   Assuming, of course, someone pulls those stick pins out of that
Mo doll.

HASKINS WORTH MORE THAN TAG SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The tagline has been with him for years, clinging to
his name _ Don Haskins _ the same way his clip-on ties fasten
themselves to his shirt collars.
</P>
<P>
   In 1966, Don Haskins led an all-black starting lineup from Texas
Western College to an NCAA championship victory over an all-white
team from Kentucky . . .
</P>
<P>
   Dialogue often becomes warped when Americans talk about race and
sports, so much so that the above tagline is supposed to be a
compliment for Haskins. It is, but not when it is framed that way.
Haskins is 69, but history has frozen him and his legacy at 36.
That was when he was in the early years of displaying his deep
understanding of the game he struggled with as a boy. A lot has
happened since then, but that information may be restricted to one
of Haskins's favorite areas: deep in the El Paso brush, where the
man known as The Bear sometimes lies and wails like a wounded
coyote.
</P>
<P>
   The irony is that if Haskins were a black man from Chicago or a
Mexican man from Juarez, we would speak more of his basketball
genius rather than his trivia. But he is a white man from Enid,
Okla., who retired last week from the University of Texas-El Paso
(formerly Texas Western) after 38 seasons, 719 wins, and one title.
The one title produced the tagline that now attempts to shroud the
man.
</P>
<P>
   ``There won't be any other coaches like him,'' Celtics general
manager Chris Wallace said. ``He's the John Wayne of college
basketball coaches.''
</P>
<P>
   Haskins spent his entire career in El Paso, closer to Mexico's
major cities than Texas's. He hated AAU camps and loved his
clip-ons when he had to wear a tie. He told his assistants not to
socialize with him too much. Instead, he hung out with cooks,
railroad workers, and gas attendants. He can play a mean game of
pool and is rumored to be one of the best in his slice of Texas. He
favors GMC trucks, cowboy boots, and belts with big buckles. He
knows the proper way to call for a coyote: lie in the brush on your
back, mimic a wounded coyote, and pounce on them when they come.
</P>
<P>
   You won't find a coach who can teach you that at a summer camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing what he has done,'' said Rus Bradburd, a former
UTEP assistant. ``I want you to look at a map and find El Paso.
When you fly into the airport there, it's like you're landing on
the moon. Rolling hills and cactus may be attractive to me, but not
to a recruit.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all due respect to Dean Smith, John Wooden, Bobby Knight,
and Adolph Rupp, I don't think they could have done what Don did at
UTEP.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradburd wasn't simply talking about the '66 title team, when
Haskins took a group of underdogs who went to school near the
mighty Rio Grande and found a way to get them past favored Kentucky
and Rupp. His game plan, which was to slow the pace and use a
three-guard offense, led to a 72-65 win.
</P>
<P>
   What receives more attention is the fact that Haskins started
his five best players, all black. I don't think that made him a
freedom fighter; I think it made him one of the smartest coaches of
the 1960s. Limiting your talent pool based on race is dumb. So,
yes, Bradburd is right: Rupp could not have been Rupp at UTEP.
</P>
<P>
   Rupp once said that he would never recruit a black player. He
would have had to change his profession _ or himself _ if he found
himself 1 mile from Mexico, 753 miles from Houston, and surrounded
by few talented players who grew up wanting to go to a school
called UTEP.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids from North Carolina and UCLA? They don't open a
letter from UTEP. There's no way in the world,'' Bradburd said.
``What Haskins did was take mediocre players and turn them into
great teams.''
</P>
<P>
   He was a coach among cowboys, too, uninterested in anything
Armani unless it was an Armani flannel shirt with checks. Bradburd
and current Bulls coach Tim Floyd, both assistants in the '70s and
'80s, convinced him to give a kid named Tim Hardaway (also being
recruited by Western Illinois) a chance. The cowboy coach didn't
think Hardaway could shoot, but he took him. They tried to get him
to take a trip to Oakland so he could bring in a skinny kid named
Antonio Davis (also being recruited by the University of Portland).
The appropriately nicknamed Bear scowled and said, ``Dammit, it's
dove hunting season.'' But he took Davis, too.
</P>
<P>
   There was also Tiny Archibald, but most of the other names you
haven't heard, unless you're from El Paso or Juarez, the sister
city across the river.
</P>
<P>
   He and his program were not perfect. The NCAA spanked them twice
for violations but did not keep the Miners out of postseason play.
It also wasn't easy to speak with Coach Haskins if you weren't one
of his assistants. He hated talk shows and coaches' shows. There
were reports that none of his players from '66 graduated, when in
fact 10 of 12 did.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could have sued,'' Bradburd said. ``But his mind doesn't
work that way. He needed a publicist, really, but cowboys don't
have publicists.''
</P>
<P>
   Once, when Wallace watched UTEP beat Georgetown, he heard
Haskins tell his team during a late timeout, ``All right, I guess
we're going to win this (expletive) game, but I don't know how. We
didn't get that many loose balls. After the game is over, I don't
want to see any carrying on, you hear me? Just go to the locker
room.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradburd, who started at UTEP when he was 23 said, ``It took him
a year or two to remember my name and four or five to trust me.''
</P>
<P>
   He laughed after he said that. He then said he was sad that
college basketball was losing a coach like Haskins. You could hear
the love in his voice. You never would have guessed that Haskins
had to fire Bradburd in '91 after recruiting violations. Bradburd
still considers him a legend. That, alone, tells you about the
man's greatness.

REVOLUTION STALLED BY FIRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Interconference games in the MLS are similar to
friendly matches, at least for the visitors, who are not expected
to win and are not greatly penalized for losing.
</P>
<P>
   So the Revolution did not fare too badly in falling, 2-1, to the
Chicago Fire Sunday &UR;  &LR; night. But the Revolution's lack of defensive
cohesion and commitment in the first half and their continued
ineffectiveness in midfield possession were not positive signs for
the future. They remained in fifth place with 19 points in 25
matches in the Eastern Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Revolution will likely have to take at least 7 points
from home matches against Tampa Bay Saturday and Kansas City Sept.
6 and a match at Miami Sept. 11 to remain in playoff contention.
This would not seem like an improbable objective, but the
Revolution have only earned 1 point since July 4 and have not
earned any points against teams other than the last-place
MetroStars since June 19.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago, meanwhile, used this match as a warmup toward defending
its MLS Cup title, and the team displayed enough sustained
possession and firepower to succeed. The Polish combination of
midfielder Peter Nowak and striker Roman Kosecki terrorized the
Revolution's too-passive defense for most of the game. Kosecki
converted a spectacular goal, turning sharply and roofing a
left-footed shot from close range in the 27th minute, and Nowak
earned the second goal in the 38th minute.
</P>
<P>
   The Fire placed goalkeeper-coach Walter Zenga under pressure
from the opening minutes. Jerzy Podbrozny and Kosecki combined in
the second minute, then Nowak and Frank Klopas set up Kosecki, who
hit the left post in the third minute. At that point, the
Revolution defense was being exposed early and often.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution continued to falter, especially after Dan
Calichman aggravated a groin injury and departed in the 36th
minute, to be replaced by Kris Kelderman. Soon thereafter, the Fire
broke down the Revolution defense, and Nowak and Kosecki played a
give and go, with Kosecki cutting a pass back from the end line
that Nowak converted off Kelderman's foot.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution reorganized at halftime and seemed rejuvenated by
Mike Burns's first goal of the season in the 73d minute. But they
did not keep possession long enough to overcome the Fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the first half, they did what they wanted to do,''
Revolution assistant coach Giuseppe Galderisi said. ``It was 2-1,
but we were lucky it wasn't worse. We continue to make the same
errors, playing half the game good and half the game bad. I'm not
angry because we lost, but I am upset because we make the same
errors every time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to change, and I'm talking about in the locker room as
well as on the field, and start to think like a team, and we can
come out of this problem. I thought with time we would have solved
these problems, but now we have to do something different. Everyone
has to take responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution had some good chances early, but their offense
completely broke down after the opening minutes. They easily
surrendered possession and were either too predictable in attack or
simply overmatched against the Fire defenders.
</P>
<P>
   Joe-Max Moore fired a free kick high in the fourth minute. Burns
sent a hard left-footed drive from 30 yards that was parried by
Chicago goaltender Zach Thornton for a corner. Ivan McKinley shot
high from the edge of the goal area off a corner. And when Thornton
failed trying to punch away a McKinley cross, Giovanni Savarese
could not control the ball with the goal open in the 16th minute.
After that, the Revolution seemed to lose confidence, and their
defense became lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came out uninspired and not organized, and they could have
buried the game,'' said Calichman, who is doubtful for Saturday's
Tampa Bay game. ``Defensively, we were all over the place. We let
guys go free and go through us. There was no commitment in the back
and no pressure in midfield, and they had a field day against us.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to be a lot tougher. If you get beat, foul. Chicago
is a good team, and if you let them run at you all day, they will
beat you.''

DEVERS, ENGQUIST TRIUMPH 
</HEADLINE>
 CHAMPIONSHIPS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA HUEBNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEVILLE, Spain _ After roaring out of the blocks and storming to
victory in Saturday &UR;  &LR; night's 100-meter hurdles final, Gail Devers
immediately looked around. Where was Ludmila Engquist?
</P>
<P>
   The answer: One-tenth of a second behind, good enough for a
bronze medal that will forever symbolize the 1996 Olympic gold
medalist's will to hurdle her way through treatment for breast
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   After a huge hug, Devers asked Engquist to join her on a victory
lap. Engquist declined, saying the moment belonged to Devers, and
instead savored a slow walk around the track by herself, draped in
the Swedish flag and waving to well-wishers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a little bit disappointed because I dreamed that I would
have a gold medal,'' said Engquist, whose time of 12.50 seconds in
the semifinals raised the hopes she dared not harbor earlier this
week. ``However, a medal is a wonderful thing for me to have after
all that I have been through.''
</P>
<P>
   Devers ran 12.37 to win, with Nigeria's Glory Alozie second in
12.44 to Engquist's 12.47.
</P>
<P>
   Engquist had her right breast surgically removed April 21, on
her 35th birthday, and is in the midst of chemotherapy. Her next
session is scheduled for Thursday, after she competes at a meet in
Sweden on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Moments after coming off the track, Engquist handed her husband,
Johan, a bottle of champagne. He quickly opened it, threw back his
head, and took a big gulp.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel a lot of joy,'' said the man who is also Engquist's
coach.
</P>
<P>
   The night was also a comeback for Devers, who won the World
Championships in 1993 and 1995 but did not compete two years ago.
In March, Devers, who has been plagued by Achilles' tendon and
hamstring injuries the past two years, also faced a flareup of
Graves Disease, which she has battled for more than a decade, that
was calmed by adjusting her medication.
</P>
<P>
   Using the three rounds to regain her hurdling rhythm, Devers
gained confidence as the meet went on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't surprised, no,'' said Greg Foster, the 1984 silver
medalist, rummaging in his pocket for a slip of paper on which he
had written ``12.33'' Friday night in predicting her time. ``We
knew she was ready to run; we just had to get her ready to believe
in herself.''
</P>
<P>
   Foster works with Devers and her longtime coach, Bob Kersee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just trying to attack the hurdles, and I didn't want
1992 (when she stumbled over the last hurdle and finished out of
the medals) to come back at me again,'' said Devers. ``Over the
last two hurdles, it felt that I was getting too close to them. I
kind of backed off a little bit, but I tried to attack the last
hurdle. I bumped it, but I was determined to stay on my feet.''
</P>
<P>
   Engquist, meanwhile, got a slower start and couldn't close the
gap. Despite tying Sweden's national record, the Russian-born
Engquist said, ``There was no way I could have run as fast as
Devers tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Until this week, said Johan Engquist, Devers and his wife had
not had a good relationship, but Devers _ whose Graves Disease
nearly ended her career earlier this decade _ showed such warmth
and understanding for Engquist at a press conference last Tuesday
that his wife realized, ``OK, this is a competitor, but she can be
a friend, also.''
</P>
<P>
   After the race, Devers praised her rival: ``It's a tough road,
and she's not done yet, but she's about 15,000 miles ahead of where
she should be and she's only going to get stronger and stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   Told that his wife has become an inspiration and beacon of hope
to many, Johan Enqquist nodded.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's very happy and pleased there are people getting strength
from it,'' he said of her battle. ``Don't give up; you can fight.
You can still live a normal life even when it's tough.''

LIGHT WEIGHT LIFTED FROM MEN'S EIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
 CHAMPIONSHIPS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. CATHARINES, Ontario _ It was a quarter of a century _ and
one long year _ in coming. The United States men's lightweight
eight hadn't won a world rowing title since 1974 and had missed
last year by less than three-10ths of a second.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was devastating,'' bowman (and Northeastern graduate) Bill
Plifka said. ``Just about every day it goes through your head. You
pop in the video and there it is again. It's something that just
doesn't leave you.''
</P>
<P>
   Until Saturday, when the Americans replaced a bitter memory with
a golden one, rowing through the Italians and holding off the
British by half a length in a tailwind on Martindale Pond.
</P>
<P>
   ``We showed each other what it meant, and it meant a lot to come
through,'' said stroke Sean Kammann. ``It was really hard to lose
by that little. So it was that much sweeter this year.''
</P>
<P>
   The eight's triumph was the capper to a fine day by the
Americans in the non-Olympic races. The coxed pair of Jim Neil and
Phil Henry snagged the gold by a quarter of a second over the
Germans in their final-only event.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's a way to do it, that's the way,'' said Henry. ``One
race.''
</P>
<P>
   Lightweight sculler Lisa Schlenker came out of last place at the
quarter-pole to take silver behind defending champion Pia Vogel of
Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew exactly where I was, but it didn't bother me at all,''
said Schlenker, who went from sixth to third by the halfway mark.
``They couldn't lose me. The tank was going to be empty by the time
I was done.''
</P>
<P>
   And the women's four, with East Bridgewater's Wendy Wilbur
aboard, climbed up from fourth in the final 500 meters to take
bronze behind Belarus and Germany. ``We looked over at 1,000 meters
and saw everybody ahead of us,'' said Wilbur. ``And we said, `We
are not going to finish last.' So we were able to thrust into our
turbo mode. I knew going into the last 750 that we would get
something.''
</P>
<P>
   What the US flotilla really craves, though, is a fistful of
medals in the 14 Olympic events here. The Americans, who had nobody
in Saturday's seven finals, get their chance Sunday with five
entries in the remaining races on the Sydney program and golden
shots in the men's and women's eights and women's lightweight
double (with Worcester attorney Christine Collins).
</P>
<P>
   All they could do Saturday was watch a bunch of New Zealanders
and Germans and Brits earn themselves the label of Olympic favorite
a year out. New Zealand's Rob Waddell blew through a field that
included Olympic gold medalist Xeno Mueller of Switzerland and
former champ Derek Porter of Canada, retaining his sculling crown
in a world-best 6:36.68.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just thrilled to have won,'' said the 24-year-old Waddell,
the first man to repeat in the single since East Germany's Thomas
Lange in 1989. ``It's such a nerve-wracking week because you've got
so much time to think about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Except for the men's double, where Slovenia's Iztok Cop and Luka
Spik stole the race from the Germans in the first 500, form held in
the Olympic events. Ekaterina Karsten of Belarus came back from
maternity leave to reclaim her sculling crown with a world-best
7:11.68. The Canadians (with Emma Robinson and Theresa Luke) won
the women's pair for the third straight year, the Australians
claimed the men's and the Germans took the women's double.
</P>
<P>
   And Great Britain's legendary Steven Redgrave, who told the
world they could shoot him if they ever saw him around a boat again
after the 1996 Olympics, won his 13th global crown (in four
different events) with the ``Fab Four'' and vowed to continue on to
Sydney and a fifth straight Olympic gold medal.
</P>
<P>
   The US light eight have no chance at Olympus, since the event
isn't on the program. Their global shot was here Saturday and they
vowed, finally, to grab it.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we learned,'' said Kammann, the gold medal around his
neck, ``was that you can't leave anything out there.''

 CHAMPIONSHIPS-RUNYAN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   SEVILLE, Spain _ There are no low branches there, no parking
meters, no potholes. Its boundaries are defined; its dimensions are
known. For Marla Runyan, running around the track might be the
easiest thing she does all day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time I saw a track, I was already visually impaired,
so I only know the track that way,'' said Runyan, who is now
legally blind. ``I don't know how everyone else sees it. I just
know what it's like for me.''
</P>
<P>
   For Runyan, a 30-year-old four-time Paralympic gold medalist,
what it's like these days is hard for even her to believe. First,
she made the United States team for the World Championships of
Track and Field. Then, late last month, she won a gold medal at the
Pan Am Games in a photo finish. Now, she will compete in the final
of the 1,500 meters Saturday night at the World Championships,
going up against the top women in the world, including American
Regina Jacobs, Olympic gold medalist Svetlana Masterkova of Russia,
and Carlo Sacramento of Portugal.
</P>
<P>
   It will be just her eighth race ever at the distance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shock,'' said Runyan.
</P>
<P>
   Runyan ran much of Friday night's semifinal at or near the back
of the 15-woman pack, trying to stay on the outside so she wouldn't
get boxed in. Although the race took off at a pace faster than she
was used to (``I thought, well, you may not make the final, but
isn't this awesome to run in this stadium?''), Runyan was able to
keep up and surge in the final 200 meters, passing enough runners
to finish fourth in 4 minutes 5.27 seconds, a personal best by well
over a second. The top five runners advanced to the final.
</P>
<P>
   It was an ideal race for Runyan because the pack stayed close
together and she could see everyone. Not clearly, perhaps, but well
enough: a form, a ponytail, a colorful uniform. She can't recognize
faces unless they are 3-5 feet in front of her and often doesn't
know whom she is running alongside. Neither can she see the clock,
and the pleasure of spotting a familiar face in the crowd is but a
blurred dream.
</P>
<P>
   Runyan shrugs, insisting she's well aware of what's most
important.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know where the finish line is,'' she said. ``It's at the end
of the straightaway.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the rest of her life, out in the world, that's more
complicated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone gets all excited that I'm running track with 20/300
vision, but nobody got excited when I got a master's degree, taking
the GRE with a magnifying glass for 5 1/2 hours,'' she pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   When she was about 9, Runyan's vision began to deteriorate due
to a condition eventually diagnosed as macular degeneration.
Although she wears regular contact lenses that correct her overall
vision from 20/800 to 20/300, and she describes her peripheral
vision as ``pretty good,'' the blind spots in her retina make it
difficult to see things directly in front of her. ``Whoa, there's a
parking meter,'' she will sometimes realize as she's walking along,
just in time to avoid it.
</P>
<P>
   Because her sight worsened so slowly, she had plenty of time to
adapt. Instead of being surprised when she can't see something that
everyone else can see, she explained, ``I'm usually more surprised
when I realize other people can see what I can't.''
</P>
<P>
   At 14 Runyan was still playing soccer, center-backfield so she
could keep running around the field as close to the ball as
possible, not realizing everyone else could see it better. In high
school she switched to track, and if she couldn't see the high jump
bar when she started her run-up, well, she knew it would come into
view sooner or later. It did: She set the Camarillo (Calif.) High
School record of 5 feet 7 inches and was recruited to jump at San
Diego State, where she soon embraced the heptathlon.
</P>
<P>
   She was good at the seven-discipline event, hurdles and all, but
not as good as she wanted to be. Her showing at the 1996 Olympic
Trials prompted her to concentrate on the middle distances: She may
have finished 10th overall, but her clocking in the 800 meters
(2:04.70) was an American heptathlon record. So it was time to
leave the javelin behind and concentrate on the middle distances.
She moved to Eugene, Ore., and eventually hooked up with a new
coach, Mike Manley.
</P>
<P>
   After injuries virtually wiped out her seasons in 1997 and 1998
(but led to meeting her boyfriend Matt Lonergan, an athletic
trainer, massage therapist, and competitive distance runner
formerly from Brockton), Runyan this year finally began running the
1,500, with her first serious race and second attempt ever at the
Prefontaine Classic in late May.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're announcing everyone's times,'' she recalled,
remembering how it must have sounded to the fans when they heard
``4:24'' with her name. But she ended up fifth of the 16 runners,
in 4:11. More significantly, she said, she felt she could run even
faster.
</P>
<P>
   Six months ago, said Manley, if someone had told him he and
Runyan would be in Seville this week, he would have thought,
``Well, wouldn't that be an exaggeration?'' But now, having seen
and felt what he calls her tremendous focus, desire, and ability,
he said, ``I'm not greatly surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   While competing on the track is relatively straightforward for
Runyan, training can have its adventures.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's the time I forgot and sent her with some of my other
athletes off into the woods,'' said Manley, who wasn't thinking
about the fallen limbs and random rocks. When she finished far
behind the others, he worried that he was overworking her; her
struggle didn't dawn on him until she said, ``Hey, coach, that
wasn't a bad workout for a blind person.''
</P>
<P>
   At the start of this season, Runyan set her goals: qualify to
run in the US nationals and get a top 10 US ranking. Saturday
night, she will be one of 12 women lining up for the World
Championship 1,500. It is not unthinkable that she could end the
season ranked among the top 10 in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every weekend the goals get rewritten,'' said Lonergan.
</P>
<P>
   Add this goal to the list: Someday, Runyan mused, she would like
to read a story about her career that ends nonchalantly with the
words, ``Oh, by the way, she's legally blind.''
</P>
<P>
   The way you're going, Marla, it won't be long.

UNSIGNED DRAFTEE FEELS HE HAS EARNING POWER 
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY MARRAPESE-BURRELL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ When last we saw 20-year-old defenseman Nicholas
Boynton, he was donning a black and gold Bruins sweater on a stage
at the FleetCenter as Boston made him the 21st pick overall in the
entry draft.
</P>
<P>
   Boynton was originally selected No. 9 overall in 1997 by
Washington but never came to terms with the Capitals; with
Washington's permission, he talked to the Chicago Blackhawks just
before he reentered the draft but couldn't come to terms with them,
either.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Boynton remains unsigned. However, what is
interesting is that Boynton, who attended two training camps with
the Capitals before heading back to his junior team in Ottawa, will
attend the opening of Boston's camp this weekend and intends to
play his way to a more favorable pact than the Bruins have put
forth so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``They made an offer, and I think I can come to camp and play
for a better contract,'' said Boynton. ``It wasn't even close, so
I'm just not worrying about that part. I'll let (president/general
manager Harry Sinden) and my agent worry about it. I'm just going
to come to camp and play as well as I can and hope things get
worked out.''
</P>
<P>
   There has been little dialogue between the sides. The Bruins put
forth a proposal, Boynton's camp countered, and the parties agreed
to disagree. All this effort the last couple of years to gain an
NHL contract has been wearing on the youngster, who last season
helped the Ottawa 67s win the Memorial Cup championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a bit of a hassle,'' he said. ``I loved where I
ended up by going back in the draft. I never really wanted to go
back into the draft. I would've liked to have a deal signed and not
had to go through the hassle of the draft, but it couldn't have
worked out better. I am kind of sick and tired of worrying about
the money aspect of it. I've worked hard to get into the best shape
I could, and I just want to come to camp and play as well as I
can.''
</P>
<P>
   Has he ever stopped to wonder whether his demands were too high?
</P>
<P>
   ``Washington never really offered me a contract,'' he said. ``In
Chicago, the negotiating was tough there. I've been through it, so
I kind of had an idea the way things were going to go. It was an
eye opener at first, but now I understand how things work so I'm a
little less worried about it. Chicago was really, really close. It
was one or two things. Really the deal should've been done, but it
got screwed up at the last minute. They were offering good money,
but I felt if I signed it, it screws over a lot of players for the
future and right now. A lot of them were my friends, and I didn't
want to set a precedent like that.''
</P>
<P>
   What Boynton means is that the third year of the offer was for
significantly less money than the first two years, which he
believed would put him in a much worse position to renegotiate when
the three years were up. He didn't want to start from a lower
figure when it came time to begin talks on a second contract.
</P>
<P>
   Boynton is confident he can come into camp and let his playing
plead his case for him. He was taken much lower in the draft the
second time, and being two years older, it has taken away any
leverage he had.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is taking a chance, but I had a fairly good year last
year,'' he said. ``We ended up winning the championship, and that
was a great thing. I've worked really hard this summer. I hope I
can play really well and earn a spot on the team. I don't think I'm
wrong, especially in this case.''
</P>
<P>
   Boynton will certainly have a good opportunity to make the
roster. Ray Bourque, Don Sweeney, and Kyle McLaren should be Nos.
1, 2, and 3 on the blue line. Hal Gill and Mattias Timander to this
point remain unsigned. Darren Van Impe should earn one of the top
six slots, and Jonathan Girard will certainly be in the mix.
</P>
<P>
   As for his legal troubles, which stemmed from a fight with a cab
driver in Ottawa last spring, Boynton said the incident is almost
behind him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should be a matter of days _ either a couple of days or a
couple of weeks,'' he said. ``I have to go through a mediation
process and talk to the cab driver in Ottawa, and that pretty much
takes care of it.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Boynton and Ottawa teammate Mark Bell will be
offering apologies and handing over a settlement check.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, that's pretty much it,'' said Boynton. ``It was a mistake
that happened and it shouldn't have, but it did, so you own up to
it and live with it. I should've known better, but it's something I
can learn from. I learned the hard way, I guess you could say. I've
never been in trouble before, and I don't plan on being in trouble
again.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I've just about run out of tissue sobbing for poor Alexei
Yashin. Isn't it just so sad that he's so grossly underpaid at $3.6
million? Give me a break. Yashin has one year left on his deal and
refuses to honor it until the Senators renegotiate. The team,
reportedly with the league's backing, is threatening to take Yashin
to court for breach of contract. Good for them. It's high time.
It's outrageous for Yashin to demand a new deal when he has a
season remaining. Can you imagine what would happen if Yashin had
had a horrible year last year and the Senators wanted him to rip up
his contract and renegotiate for much less than the previous year?
Yashin would laugh at them, and rightly so. So why is it OK for
Yashin to scoff at the final year of his deal just because he wants
more money? Presumably, he signed the pact when he was not under
any sort of duress. Mark Gandler, Yashin's agent, isn't worried
about legal action by the team. ``It doesn't concern me,'' he said.
``I don't find it relevant in this situation. I can just imagine:
You want to make your best player pay. What is that? What kind of
dressing room atmosphere would that create? How preposterous.''
Those comments, to me, are a head-scratcher. The guy is going to be
paid $3.6 million to play hockey, and he lacks motivation. That's
what's really preposterous. If you listen to the comments of
Yashin's teammates, they aren't getting in line to support him. One
player, who didn't want his name used, said Yashin was getting bad
advice. Magnus Arvedson didn't mind coming out and saying his
teammate is wrong. ``He has a contract,'' said Arvedson. ``He
should play it out. If a player has a bad year, can the team change
the contract? It's easy for me to say, but I think that if I sign a
contract, I'm going to play out my contract.'' Even fans are
getting on board, with one businessman threatening to sue the
player on behalf of the fans. Yashin seems unfazed by the whole
mess. ``Whatever they do, it's fine with me,'' Yashin said. ``It's
a free country. They can do whatever they want to do.'' Here's
hoping the Senators hold their ground . . . It's been a busy summer
for Gandler. In addition to the battle with the Senators, talks
with the Penguins on a new contract for defenseman Darius
Kasparaitis aren't going well. ``We are not happy with the money,''
Gandler said. ``I believe there is a potential problem.''
Kasparaitis, who made $1.1 million last year, was limited to 48
games before undergoing surgery on his right knee. Gandler said
Kasparaitis is healthy, and the Penguins don't appear to be
disputing that . . . A report circulating in Ottawa is that
defenseman Steve Duchesne, who was traded from the Senators to St.
Louis two years ago, might be back in that city. Duchesne is an
unrestricted free agent.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Former coach Mike Keenan has been hired by CTV Sportsnet as an
analyst. He will work 32 national telecasts and 34 regional
Senators games. ``I wasn't sure I was going to end up going this
route,'' said Keenan. ``I was looking at some other hockey
opportunities _ consulting, not coaching. But now that the decision
has been made, I'm excited. I'm not quite a rookie in the TV
business, but I have a lot to learn.'' Keenan hasn't ruled out a
return to NHL coaching, but so far, no perfect situation has
presented itself . . . Former Bruins goalie Andy Moog, a native of
Penticton, British Columbia, will return to his home province at
times during the year when he serves as goalie consultant for the
Vancouver Canucks. Moog, who resides in Dallas, was the Atlanta
Thrashers' goalie coach last season. ``Andy had an outstanding NHL
career and knows what it takes to win,'' said Canucks general
manager Brian Burke. ``We believe the intelligence and knowledge he
will offer our goaltenders is invaluable.'' . . . The Tampa Bay
Lightning have tapped into some Massachusetts talent. They hired
power-skating coach Paul Vincent, who has helped the game of many
local players, to be the club's special skills coach. They've also
hired Bobby Jay, a Burlington native, to be assistant coach to
Paulin Bordeleau with the Detroit Vipers of the IHL. ``Bobby Jay is
one of those high-character, low-maintenance guys you look for,''
said Rick Dudley, Lightning vice president of hockey operations.
``He has a tremendous work ethic.'' Jay, a former defenseman,
played his final year of pro hockey last season, collecting one
goal and three assists in 44 games with the Vipers . . . Canadiens
left wing Benoit Brunet won't be ready for the start of the season
because of a back injury that forced him to miss the final 12 games
of last season. Brunet has a tear in the tissue between vertebrae
and is supposed to rest for a couple of months, though the
offseason rest yielded little improvement. The club is looking for
him to be back sometime in November . . . Word out of Minnesota is
that Doug Risebrough, who has been a player, a coach, and an
executive, will be named general manager of the Minnesota Wild. The
Wild, along with the Columbus franchise, will join the NHL for the
2000-01 season. Risebrough has been vice president of hockey
operations for the Edmonton Oilers the last three years . . .
Individual game tickets for the Bruins are on sale for both the
exhibition game vs. Buffalo at the FleetCenter Sept. 25 and all
regular-season games. Tickets are available at the FleetCenter box
office, at all TicketMaster outlets, through the Ticketmaster phone
charge line (508/617-931-2222), and on the Internet at
www.ticketmaster.com . . . OK, people, I need an update. How are
those ``Sign Dafoe'' banners coming? Opening night is just 34 days
away.

11 DIVIDED BY THREE MULTIPLIES THE FUN 
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It was a day for novelists, screenwriters, comedians,
lawyers, and basketball fans. A press conference was canceled. Two
teams showed their proposed trade to the NBA and, basically, had it
sent back to them so it could be rewritten. Two players exchanged
small talk during an international teleconference. And 11 players _
11 players _ learned that they would have to move immediately.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA has been in business for more than a half-century, but
you could argue that the league never has seen a day like Friday.
That was when 6-foot-3-inch Steve Francis, the Vancouver Grizzlies'
most recent first-round pick, became a Houston Rocket. Francis was
about to call a press conference in his hometown of Takoma Park,
Md., presumably to blast the Grizzlies. But he canceled it when he
learned the biggest trade in league history was going to happen.
Obviously the swap took place. It didn't develop easily. Or
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Late Thursday night, the Grizzlies and Rockets thought they
could deal 10 players between them, the principals being Francis
and new Grizzlies Michael Dickerson and Othella Harrington. Since
both teams had scant salary cap space, they knew they would have to
be precise traders. The contracts being traded didn't have to fit
perfectly, but there was only a margin of error of 15 percent plus
$100,000. In other words, the league allows you to trade a $2
million player for one who makes $2.3 million. But if you try to
fit $2 million into $3.3 million, you've got problems.
</P>
<P>
   These teams had problems, the NBA's lawyers concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers study each contract before a trade can go through. They
noticed that the numbers didn't fit. Another team was needed. So in
came the addicted-to-dealing Orlando Magic, who must respond to any
news of a trade with, ``What about us?'' The Magic had the
flexibility to make the trade work. So . . .
</P>
<P>
   --The Grizzlies sent Francis and Tony Massenburg to the Rockets;
</P>
<P>
   --The Rockets sent Dickerson, Harrington, Antoine Carr, Brent
Price, and a first-round pick to the Grizzlies;
</P>
<P>
   --The Magic sent Don MacLean and a first-rounder to the Rockets
and received Michael Smith, Lee Mayberry, Rodrick Rhodes, and
Makhtar Ndiaye (who?) from the Grizzlies. The Magic also threw in a
second-rounder for the Grizzlies.
</P>
<P>
   Add it up and you have an outrageous 11-player deal. You also
have the inevitable debate: Who won?
</P>
<P>
   Francis is a true dunk artist, a point guard who will be
virtually unguardable if the new, don't-touch-'em NBA rules are
enforced next season. Put the rookie on the same team as Charles
Barkley, Scottie Pippen, and Hakeem Olajuwon and you could have
something dangerous. Last season, Cuttino Mobley and Price led the
offense. Now that job goes to Francis, who didn't think he'd get
the opportunity in Vancouver with Mike Bibby already there. So
that's why people in Houston are excited.
</P>
<P>
   ``We definitely got better with the trade,'' countered Grizzlies
forward Shareef Abdur-Rahim during Friday's teleconference. The
small forward said the ``bad vibes'' Francis sent off about
Vancouver were ``bad for our team and bad for our city.'' Rahim,
22, reminded everyone that Francis ``hasn't done anything in this
league.''
</P>
<P>
   Dickerson played with Bibby at Arizona and is a fine outside
shooter. Harrington said he is ready to emerge from ``the shadow of
so many great players and make a name for myself.'' He is a
dramatic upgrade over the inside rebounders the Grizzlies had last
season.
</P>
<P>
   Still, you have to wonder what the Grizzlies were thinking.
Teams spend thousands of dollars on the draft, working out and
interviewing players. The Grizzlies and president Stu Jackson
should have known Francis didn't want to play in Western Canada.
And they should have known that long before he forced their hand.
They did OK with their trade, but the feeling is that they could
have had more for the draft's No. 2 pick. The Rockets expect
Francis to be a star. Soon. That alone is worth more than a
starter, a reserve, two bodies, and a pick.
</P>
<P>
   There is another haunting element to the trade. If either team
made a huge mistake, it never will be able to run from the error.
That's because these teams play in the same division, the Midwest,
and see each other often.
</P>
<P>
   Rahim, who talked with Francis when the Grizzlies drafted the
guard in June, endorsed the deal. Like Jackson, he mentioned more
than once that Francis has done nothing in the pros. He also said
he would rather have teammates who want to play in one of North
America's most breathtaking cities than a man who needed frequent
convincing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to speak to him myself, to see where his head was
at,'' Rahim said, emphasizing that he did not try to sway Francis
toward Vancouver. ``I wasn't trying to sell him on anything. It was
going to be hard for me to convince another man to do something
that he didn't want to do.''
</P>
<P>
   If Francis had played with Bibby and Rahim (23 points, 7.5
rebounds, 84 percent from the line last season), the Grizzlies
certainly would improve on their eight-win 1999 season. As for
players not wanting to stay in Canada, Rahim said, ``I'm a realist.
I'm blessed to be in the situation I'm in. God didn't have to put
me in this situation. I was just happy once I got in Vancouver.''
</P>
<P>
   Most people were surprised to hear Rahim speaking at all during
the teleconference because they were holding for coach Brian Hill.
Instead they got Dennis Scott, whom the Grizzlies signed that day.
Then they got Harrington. When Rahim came on the line, there was
both comedy and confusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hello? Hello?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who's this?'' Harrington responded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, big fella, it's Shareef.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey . . .''
</P>
<P>
   The two went on to talk about their offseason workouts and how
Bryant ``Big Country'' Reeves is working out with Rahim in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``How's he look?'' Harrington asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good, man,'' Rahim answered.
</P>
<P>
   The day was finally coming to a close.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking forward to meeting you, man,'' Rahim said to
Harrington before hanging up the phone. ``God bless.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Since we are speaking of change, many wonder whether Tim Duncan
leaving San Antonio is realistic. The city plans to begin building
a $175 million arena in six months. That was thought to be one of
the key issues in retaining Duncan. ``I would step down as coach,
take over as president, and use my salary to get him here if I
could,'' Celtics coach Rick Pitino said. ``But there's no way we
would have the salary space to get him.'' But does Pitino see any
scenario in which Duncan would leave? ``Sure,'' the coach said.
``He's a young guy, he's won a championship, and David Robinson is
getting older. He might want to go somewhere else.'' The leader of
the Somewhere Else cities is still Orlando . . . The Spurs might
not repeat as NBA champs, but should we put the Larry O'Brien
Trophy in the hands of the Western Conference right now? The best
teams now reside there. ``It has been a good summer for the
Celtics,'' said Chris Wallace, the team's general manager. ``We got
Penny Hardaway and Steve Smith out of the East and Steve Francis is
staying in the West.'' As stacked as the West is, from Phoenix to
Sacramento to Los Angeles to San Antonio to Minnesota, the East has
no team that scares people. It is nearly impossible to name a great
team in the conference. ``That's why I think we'll take a quantum
leap this year,'' Pitino said. ``Last year, we had three very good
players in Antoine (Walker), Ron (Mercer), and Paul (Pierce). We
gave up a very good player in Ron, but we got three players in
return who can help us, plus a potential lottery pick.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics trained in Newport, R.I., during Pitino's first full
camp. This season, they will hold their October camp at HealthPoint
. . . Wallace, a huge football fan, is taking a couple weeks off
before the start of camp. That will give him a chance to see his
beloved West Virginia Mountaineers twice . . . Harrington
acknowledged that he didn't know much about Vancouver while he was
at Georgetown. That explains why, in the middle of the summer, he
brought a parka to town when the team wanted to work him out in
1996. ``True story,'' Harrington said with a laugh . . . It was a
busy week for the Canadian teams. There was the huge Francis trade
in the West and a significant signing in the East. The Raptors
re-signed Charles Oakley and can now boast a frontcourt with
redwoods Oakley and Antonio Davis. You know how general managers
always speak mystically about the effect of veterans on young
teams? Rahim proved their point when he enthusiastically said of
new teammates Harrington, Carr, and Price, ``I've watched them play
since I was little.'' Carr is 38, Price is 30, and old man
Harrington is 25 . . . My apologies to the Clippers. Last week, I
wrote that they overpaid for Tyrone Nesby and Eric Piatkowski. But
they did not create the market for Nesby. They extended a
qualifying offer to him at the end of the season. The offer was
well under $1 million. Nesby, loved by Western Conference GMs
because of his energy, did not accept. The Spurs, desperate for a
small forward, then made a significant offer to the 23-year-old
player. So it's not their fault. The same cannot be said for
Piatkowski, a good shooter whom the Clippers overpaid by a million
dollars . . . Ask yourself if your boss would ever do this for you:
Don Nelson, trying to woo free agent Gary Trent, treated the
player's fiancee, future mother-in-law, infant son, and parents to
a vacation in Hawaii. Soon after, Trent signed a two-year, $4.2
million contract. He could have made three times that with the
Sonics. The league fined Nelson $25,000 for his Pacific Tour Guide
episode . . . Sixers coach Larry Brown had an interesting vacation
last week. He spent part of it in North Carolina, playing golf with
fellow Tar Heels such as Dean Smith and Michael Jordan . . . Knicks
general manager Scott Layden was told that Jerry Sloan believes the
Jazz will suffer without him. ``I have a great relationship with
Jerry,'' Layden said, ``but he's being kind and giving me too much
credit.'' Sloan believed that the Jazz had a negotiating advantage
with Shandon Anderson with Layden handling talks. The free agent
forward is still unsigned. But, hey, the Jazz did sign Olden
Polynice . . . It was a great week for the Spurs. They began to
settle their messy arena situation and added free agent forward
Samaki Walker (the Celtics were interested). But most important,
Sean Elliott was released from the hospital following a kidney
transplant.

OPENING STATEMENT FOR PENN STATE 
</HEADLINE>
 STATE-ARIZONA-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   STATE COLLEGE, Pa. _ Penn State wrapped up its preseason
preparations Saturday with a ``Blue-White'' scrimmage in front of
an appreciative crowd of 97,168 at Beaver Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Joe Paterno's Nittany Lions now can begin their quest for
the 1999 national championship in their season opener next Saturday
against Akron.
</P>
<P>
   To spice things up, the third-ranked Nittany Lions even gave
Saturday's scrimmage a different name, calling it the Pigskin
Classic. They also invited some fresh faces, an Arizona team that
had pretensions of contending for national honors itself, bringing
with it not only the tag of Pac-10 favorite, but a No. 4 ranking in
the preseason poll.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the crowd, the ABC telecast, and ESPN's ``Game Day''
crew coming in for pregame and postgame shows, it was clear from
the start that this was nothing more than the final workout for the
Lions.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, the result will go into the books as a 41-7 Penn
State victory, a contest that was basically over by halftime, when
the Lions had a 31-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Paterno, starting his 50th season in Happy Valley, went into his
depth chart, giving breathers to his starters early and often on a
78-degree afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   For Arizona and the Pac-10, desperately seeking respect on the
national scene, this was a devastating setback.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's terribly damaging to them and for the conference,'' said
a somewhat stunned Pac-10 commissioner Tom Hanson, who watched in
dismay as Penn State went 80 yards in seven plays on the opening
drive to take a 7-0 lead on a 37-yard TD pass from Kevin Thompson
to flanker Chafie Fields, beginning a blitz of offense and defense
that seemed to bewilder the Wildcats as much as beat them. ``This
was a measuring stick for the Pac-10.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, who apparently will share playing time this season
with Rashard Casey, said it was a relief to get past an opener that
the Lions had focused on all summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this says is we did what we had to do against a good
team,'' said Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona eagerly accepted this challenge when the game was
scheduled last winter, and it came east with a team that was
returning 16 starters from a 12-1 squad that finished its season
with a victory over Nebraska in the Holiday Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   But Penn State was more than ready to take on the challenge.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats, who must hit the road again for a Sunday night
game against TCU next week, didn't help themselves by playing
incredibly poorly in the first 15 minutes, blowing coverages,
missing tackles, and letting runners, receivers, and quarterbacks
slip through their grasp.
</P>
<P>
   The Lions, led by linebacker LaVar Arrington, made adjustments
after a brief opening drive by the Wildcats had them backpedaling
for a few minutes.
</P>
<P>
   On offense, there were explosions coming from different areas. A
70-yard touchdown run by Fields in the first quarter and a 60-yard
pass from Thompson to Larry Johnson in the second quarter that made
it 24-0 erased all doubts about the outcome. Penn State's longest
scoring drive all day took only 2 minutes 57 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   By halftime, the razing of Arizona was assured, although the
scrimmage was scheduled to last another 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The one-sided afternoon surprised both Paterno and Arizona coach
Dick Tomey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we would play well, and we did,'' said Paterno. ``I
didn't expect us to go up and down the field the first couple of
times like we did, but this is a good team. We were prepared to
play well. I said, `Don't get uptight; go out and see how good you
are.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Which remains a question that Paterno still is unwilling to
answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' said Paterno. ``This was just one game.''
</P>
<P>
   For Arizona _ and for the Pac-10 _ it was more than that. The
Wildcats flew back to Tucson Saturday night not quite sure of what
happened, but Tomey tried to put the best spin on the loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``This doesn't have to be a death knell,'' said Tomey. ``This
needed to happen to us, and it's a hell of a lot better than to
Stanford in conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted our team to experience a tough place, a good team
early in the year, to see what we're made of and to fix it early
before you get into conference. If this butt-kicking is part of the
development of the team in some small measure, we will have gotten
a tough lesson. We're trying to find out who we are, and right now
we don't like what we see.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lions seem to know who they are.
</P>
<P>
   Now they can rest for a day or two before beginning final
preparations for their season opener against Akron.

BUCS LEARNED SUCCESS CAN SPOIL YOU

   TAMPA _ They coulda been a contendah last year, but they
weren't, and Tampa Bay coach Tony Dungy believes he knows one
reason why. Call it the Charles Dickens Complex, the Curse of Great
Expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think part of it was our own fault,'' said arguably the best
young head coach in the NFL. ``We lost track of the fundamentals
and basic concentration on what you need to do to win. We talked so
much about getting to the next level that we lost focus.''
</P>
<P>
   Double vision has become one of the curses of the '90s. With a
little success comes such disproportionate acclaim that athletes
begin to see more of themselves than there really is. That's one
reason why this is not the Golden Age of Sport but rather the Age
of Fool's Gold in Sport, a time when little is required to become a
celebrity but a moment of success.
</P>
<P>
   Wear a pink boa and grab a few rebounds, and you're on Letterman
and the cover of Sports Illustrated as ``The Greatest Rebounder
Ever,'' as if Wilt Chamberlain never existed. Intercept a few
passes one year, and you're Night Train Lane the next. Win a few
more games than anyone expected, and the next summer you're going
to the Super Bowl, even if you barely made the playoffs a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   In an era when fast food is considered a meal, instant success
has become the curse of professional sports teams and the men who
try to coach them.
</P>
<P>
   To combat that after last year's disappointing 8-8 season, Dungy
didn't concern himself with elaborate strategic changes or a
remaking of his roster, as so many others have done when success
did not follow immediately upon success. Instead, to go forward,
Dungy took his team backward.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last season helped us understand the difference between
expectations and results,'' said Dungy, whose team had gone 10-6
and reached the playoffs in 1997. ``There are so many of these
sports shows now that when a team like ours, which hadn't had a lot
of success lately, wins 10 games, everybody suddenly is talking
about the Bucs.
</P>
<P>
   ``ESPN. CNN-SI. Locally. Nationally. You see it and hear it
enough, you believe it. You used to have to really do something
phenomenal to get any credit. Now it's easy to be picked to be good
if you do anything. So I told the team this summer, `It's easy to
get picked to be good, but it's tough to be good.' It's a funny
business we're in because every year is different from the year
before. One year has no bearing on the year after. That can be bad,
or that can be good. It's up to you.''
</P>
<P>
   In Tampa's case, it's probably up to two people: defensive
lineman Warren Sapp and quarterback Trent Dilfer. Sapp is the
avowed leader of the second-ranked defense in football, a
quarterback killer who has admitted he came in fat and happy last
summer after signing a big new contract and needed nearly the
entire season to get back to being the kind of player he had been
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, Sapp has dropped 40 pounds and shown all the
skills that made him one of the most dominating players in the game
two years ago. Unfortunately, he also has a lower back strain that
has kept him sidelined for longer than he'd like, but this being
pro football, the problem was seen this way by Bucs general manager
Rich McKay:
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect him to be fine. He could have a disk problem. Most of
our guys do.''
</P>
<P>
   Disk problem? No problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Warren is pretty focused,'' Dungy added. ``You need your
dominant player to be dominant. We all know that's Warren.''
</P>
<P>
   But what of Dilfer, the often-erratic leader of the Bucs'
often-erratic offense? After throwing 63 interceptions the past
four years, Dilfer is facing a new reality this fall. Dungy and the
Bucs have been painfully loyal to him since making him a No. 1
draft choice six years ago, but this offseason they finally made a
move to pressure him by trading for Eric Zeier and drafting
Tulane's highly productive Shaun King.
</P>
<P>
   The job remains Dilfer's today, but for how long is up to him.
Dungy believes he has equipped Dilfer with a full arsenal of
weapons, led by running backs Mike Alstott and Warrick Dunn and
inconsistent receivers Bert Emanuel (who led the NFL in drops last
year with 13) and Reidel Anthony. All that's needed to fire those
weapons is a triggerman; Dilfer must prove he is that man.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't play as well as a team last year as we can, but the
fact is we were No. 2 on defense and No. 4 in rushing,'' Dungy
said. ``Obviously, we've got to throw the ball better. I think
he'll do well and play well. If he doesn't, we have a big decision
to make at the end of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a $4 million decision because that's the size of the bonus
the Bucs have to pay Dilfer by March 1 to retain his services. To
collect it, Dilfer won't have to be great, but he will have to live
up to expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Great Expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have enough talent to do it,'' Dungy said. ``Most of us
have been together for three years now. We should be able to do it
this year.''
</P>
<P>
   They should. But as the Buccaneers learned last season, it's a
long way from should to did.
</P>
<P>

   Ty Law has not abandoned his dream of returning punts and even
working as a part-time wide receiver, but he conceded that the
season-ending knee injury a year ago sustained by Giants All-Pro
cornerback Jason Sehorn on his very first punt return made such a
move all but impossible for him to justify to his Patriot bosses.
``I don't blame them,'' Law said. ``Sehorn was so much a part of
the Giants' defense that when he was hurt, so much was taken away
from them that they didn't play as well. That's what they're scared
of here. I don't want to hear that, but I've got to listen. I'm
smart enough to know my place. It's at cornerback. They won't ever
have a problem of me constantly complaining about it, but it's been
my dream for a long time, so why not keep it going?'' . . . Sehorn
gained attention not only because of his speed and skills but also
because he is white, a pigmentation not often found at cornerback
in this day and age. Sehorn has said he at first felt the Giants
were skeptical that he could play the position, not because of a
lack of skill but because he didn't fit the stereotype. Law finds
this absurd. ``When I look at Sehorn, I see a great cornerback,''
Law said. ``Sure it's not the norm right now to see a white
cornerback with the physical abilities he has, but that's half the
problem with society. People still look at things that have nothing
to do with football.'' . . . It's difficult to believe that six
years ago there was a debate over whether Drew Bledsoe or Rick
Mirer should be the league's No. 1 draft choice. Fortunately, the
Patriots didn't listen to the opinion of the guru of the gridiron,
Bill Walsh, who publicly favored Mirer. Everyone in New England
knows what Bledsoe has done, but what of Mirer? He's now working on
his fourth team (Seattle, Chicago, Green Bay, the Jets), and last
year he completed only 53 passes as a backup on a Bears team
begging to find a quarterback with whom it could win. So much for
genius . . . Speaking of geniuses, what was Carmen Policy thinking
when he was interviewed for the latest issue of Football Digest?
Policy is the master of the salary cap and helped keep the 49ers
near the top of the NFL for years. Now he's trying to perform a
bigger miracle with the expansion Cleveland Browns. So how does a
smart lawyer, born and raised in Ohio, ever let himself say,
``Growing up in Youngstown I was a Browns fan, though I'm compelled
to maintain a level of honesty and admit I rooted for the Steelers
in their glory years. We called Youngstown the 38th parallel (with
Browns fans to the west and Steelers fans to the east). Now we're
reclaiming that territory.'' Who's going to reclaim Policy's dog
when those guys from the Dawg Pound pay him a late-night visit to
discuss this split loyalty? . . . Policy, he's always thinking,
though. He and principal owner Al Lerner promised never to sell the
naming rights to Cleveland Browns Stadium, but that didn't stop
them from coming up with another way to make money. They sold what
they call four ``gateway sponsorships'' to four corporations for
the next 10 years. Tickets now direct fans to one of four
entrances: National City Bank Gate, CoreComm Gate, Steris Corp.
Gate, and Cleveland Clinic Gate. The companies have paid millions,
although Policy says it is still less than the team could have made
selling the stadium name itself. Whatever happened to Gate A?

   Professional athletes are legendary for always looking at the
bright side, but even by the standards of the day, injury-plagued
Titans wide receiver Yancy Thigpen reached a new high when he was
asked about his pulled hamstring. ``I was feeling the best I had in
several years,'' Thigpen said. ``It was at least a good sign that I
could go hard enough to pull a hamstring.'' . . . Patriot
linebacker Chris Slade conceded that it is difficult to downplay
the importance of the season opener Sept. 12 against the Jets, even
though everyone on both sides will try to do just that the week of
the game. ``We've lost three straight to them, and we could easily
be 0-4 if we hadn't blocked a field goal,'' Slade said. ``We need
to show we can beat them. It's a meeting of two heavyweights the
first game. How it goes will say something about the kind of team
we are.'' . . . Down the Jersey Turnpike, Bill Parcells got wind of
running back Curtis Martin's pronouncement last week that he hoped
to rush for 2,000 yards. Ever the wise guy, Parcells said, ``I told
him, `Why don't you try for 50 first and see if you can get that?'
How many guys ever did that? I would say, no, 2,000 is not feasible
for anybody.'' . . . Parcells may be as uptight about the season
opener as Slade or Bob Kraft. After a 10-9 loss to the Eagles last
weekend, Parcells said his team reminded him of the underacheiving
1988 Giants, who missed the playoffs on the final day of the
season. ``They thought they were better than they were, and when it
came right down to the crunch, they couldn't do it,'' Parcells
recalled. ``I had to get rid of a lot of them and start over in
'89.'' The message was not lost on the Jets . . . The Colts spent
more than $16 million in bonuses and free agent salaries to rebuild
their defense but may end up with a rookie starting at inside
linebacker. No. 1 draft choice Mike Peterson has impressed Jim Mora
and his staff that much . . . More and more, it appears that rookie
Cecil ``The Diesel'' Collins will be carrying Miami's running game.
Now that his rookie competition, J.J. Johnson, is limping,
Collins's stock goes up further, and Sapp already handed him the
rookie of the year award after playing against him in one
scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fernando Bryant was the 26th player taken in the first round of
April's draft, but unlike a lot of those taken ahead of him, he may
end up starting on Opening Day. The Jaguars' rookie cornerback
reportedly has been coming on like gangbusters the last two weeks
and moved up from third string to starter in Jacksonville's dime
package of six defensive backs. But he may not stop there. His
coverage ability may be enough to get him into the starting lineup,
a move that seemed more likely last week after coach Tom Coughlin
moved left corner Aaron Beasley to the right side. That could send
normal starting right corner Dave Thomas to the bench and Bryant to
Beasley's old left corner slot . . . Steelers wide receiver
Courtney Hawkins appears to have held off the challenge of No. 1
draft choice Troy Edwards and retained his starting role. Right
after the Steelers made Edwards the 13th player drafted, the rookie
said, ``You don't need the 13th pick to sit on the bench.'' Coach
Bill Cowher might agree, but Hawkins's play has made it impossible
to avoid that. Hawkins led the Steelers in receptions a year ago
with 66 and was mighty upset to be called a ``possession receiver''
after Thigpen and Charles Johnson both left Pittsburgh as free
agents. That's why Hawkins is hopeful that Cowher will make good on
a preseason promise that the offense will go deep more often under
new offensive coordinator Kevin Gilbride. In the second exhibition,
Cowher had quarterback Kordell Stewart fire deep on the game's
first play, resulting in a 32-yard pass interference call . . .
Here's a fact that may surprise you. Seattle's holdout wide
receiver Joey Galloway has been more productive over the past four
seasons than Green Bay's Antonio Freeman, who just became the
league's highest-paid wide receiver with a seven-year, $42 million
deal. Galloway said he would sit out the year rather than play for
below what he feels his market value is. He believes Freeman
established that market. If so, Galloway has to be paid more. He
has 261 receptions for 4,122 yards and 36 touchdowns since 1995.
Freeman, over the same time span, has 229 receptions for 3,706
yards and 36 touchdowns . . . Poor Ki-Jana Carter can't get a
break. Or else he gets too many of them. Carter has played in only
32 of a possible 64 games the past four years, but Bengals coach
Bruce Coslet went into training camp hoping to showcase a finally
healthy Carter. So what has happened? Carter missed the first two
games and many practices with a ruptured cyst behind his right knee
. . . The Browns' rookies held a skit night last week, and punter
Chris Hanson took first prize for posing as diminutive head coach
Chris Palmer. Hanson came out wearing a baseball cap, a Browns
jacket, wire-rim glasses, and two tennis shoes taped to his knees
as he knelt on the floor . . . Kansas City quarterback Elvis Grbac
ended an odd jinx when he finally showed up to play against the
Jaguars Wednesday night. In 1997, Grbac missed the trip to
Jacksonville because of a broken clavicle. Last year, he separated
a shoulder the week before the Jacksonville game and was on the
sidelines in street clothes.
</P>
<P>

   Tampa Bay rookie defensive end John McLaughlin is a fifth-round
draft choice strugging to make a place for himself against long
odds. He may not succeed, but he's already been triumphant over
long odds at least once. While working at an AIDS benefit at
Universal Studios in Hollywood during his college days, out of the
blue he was selected to be Madonna's bodyguard. ``It was weird,''
McLaughlin said. Maybe not as weird as earning a place on a defense
that is deep with talent. But whether he makes it or not, he's
already uttered at least one memorable quote you don't often hear
in an NFL locker room. ``The environment is incredible, but I still
feel like I'm missing class and I need to go back to school,'' the
former Cal-Berkeley star said. ``It hasn't really hit me that I
don't need to go to school.'' That's notable because it usually
seems to hit guys in his position around the fifth grade . . .
Dungy had this to say about the Patriots' chances: ``They look
pretty good to me. They have team speed on defense and experience
on offense. The whole thing with them is: Will a runner emerge on
the level of Robert Edwards and Curtis Martin? If someone doesn't,
it'll be tough on them.'' . . . Dungy is an old-time defensive back
who came into pro football back in the '70s when everything was
different, including the pay scale. Asked what he thought of Law's
$45 million contract, he said, ``Law is a very good player. I don't
know any more what you have to pay very good players.'' The
explosion in salaries has created a new problem for coaches, who
have to spend more time than they'd like reminding some of their
best players of a new reality. ``We try to tell them what we pay
them has no reflection on how good we think they are,'' Dungy said.
``It reflects the market at the time their contract is up. I
remember my rookie year in Pittsburgh, Mel Blount and Jack Lambert
were holding out to get $100,000 salaries. The Steelers had won two
Super Bowls. Neither got it. These are different times, so I tell
the players you can't get mad at what a player makes. Hopefully
you'll hit the lottery later. We love you, but your time is not
now. It's not easy. It's not fair. It can become a coaching
problem, but sometimes you have to try and explain to a guy that
he's just been unlucky.''

   TAMPA _ There are two ways to look at what happened at Raymond
James Stadium Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   You can have a knee-jerk, alarmist reaction or you can step
back, calmly reflect for a moment, and then take the long view.
</P>
<P>
   Take the latter point of view and Saturday &UR;  &LR; night does not bode
well for Sept. 12, when the season opens in the Meadowlands against
the hated Jets. Take the former point of view and it's time for the
band to strike up ``Autumn'' because the Titanic is taking on
water.
</P>
<P>
   How bad was the Patriots' 45-14 loss to the Tampa Bay
Buccaneers? It was bad enough that not only were many of the rabid
Bucs fans seen fleeing the humidity in the third quarter, but so
was Patriots owner Robert Kraft, who headed for his private jet and
a flight home long before his team had finished its crash landing
on the Tampa turf.
</P>
<P>
   If this third exhibition game was what coach Pete Carroll said
it was supposed to be _ a dress rehearsal for the regular season _
they better get some new dresses in New England. Or ask for a few
more rehearsals.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty minutes into Saturday &UR;  &LR; night's exhibition (and what an
exhibition it was), the Patriots were trailing, 28-7, had done
nothing on offense and less on defense, and had convinced their
loyal fans back home to turn on Nick at Nite. If they were going to
stay up watching television all evening, why make it a horror show?
</P>
<P>
   By then that's what the Patriots had made of their dress
rehearsal. It was a horror show on offense and a horrid show on
defense. They didn't block, they didn't tackle, they didn't run,
they didn't catch. Other than that, they seemed to have the game of
football just about mastered.
</P>
<P>
   ``We failed in every phase (of the game),'' a stunned Carroll
said. ``We played without emotion. We have to check that out. Next
week is obviously more important than it was.''
</P>
<P>
   Normally around this time you write, ``But don't panic. It's
only a preseason game.'' Then you try to minimize the disaster in
the name of perspective.
</P>
<P>
   But Saturday &UR;  &LR; night wasn't a good night for perspective. It was
supposed to be the one night in August that is real, the one night
that is more than just an exhibition game. It was supposed to be a
meeting of two teams who wanted to test each other's readiness for
the new season, which opens in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   If it was, education majors across Massachusetts did better on
the teacher competency test than the Patriots did on this football
test.
</P>
<P>
   If you took away the one series that went the way it was
designed, the Patriots' offense gained a total of 56 yards in the
first half. If you add in the four-play, 69-yard scoring drive
early in the second quarter in which Drew Bledsoe and Terry Glenn
accounted for 54 of those yards, they still had only 125 first-half
yards on a night in which the first-team offense failed to convert
a single third-down attempt and crossed midfield only once in the
final 26:22 of the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Defensively, things went no better. New England allowed the Bucs
to pile up 260 yards in the first half and 436 total, was gashed
repeatedly between the tackles by powerful Mike Alstott (11 carries
for 46 yards and three first-half touchdowns), allowed Tampa's
receivers to average 16.6 yards per catch, and found their top
three tacklers in the first half all playing in the secondary.
</P>
<P>
   The latter wasn't because the Patriots were playing without
linebackers. It just seemed that way.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's the matter of those four first-half touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you score three touchdowns, it's a good day,''
Alstott said of his contribution to the effort.
</P>
<P>
   That's true unless you're paid to prevent such things. Then it's
a bad day. A very bad day, indeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big thrust of this week was to get emotionally right for a
club like that and we just didn't have it,'' Carroll said. ``It was
horrible tackling. Tackling is three-quarter emotion and heart.
That's what it's always been. When you don't have it, you tackle
like that.''
</P>
<P>
   And when you don't know where you're supposed to be on the
field, you end up allowing bombs of 50, 45, 33, 30, and 29 yards,
each of which went to a different Tampa Bay receiver.
</P>
<P>
   Yet all those things weren't the worst of it. The worst of it
was that the Patriots even ruined the Buccaneers' halftime dog
show, having upstaged it by putting on one of their own for the
first 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   One might have been able to mitigate some of this had things
changed after halftime because one of the aims of this game,
according to Carroll, was to give his starters an opportunity to
play a half of football, go into the locker room, recover, and come
out and play some more.
</P>
<P>
   Judging by the fact they allowed Tampa's Yo Murphy to return a
kickoff 93 yards for a touchdown after they finally scored a second
time themselves late in the third quarter and then fumbled several
plays later, their readiness for the second act was as suspect as
the first.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, after the score had mounted to 45-14, nothing was
suspect anymore but the Patriots themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was having fun playing football tonight,'' Bucs safety John
Lynch said at halftime. ``I like the fact that we came out with a
lot of intensity, a sense of urgency to make big plays. When things
like that happen, it's a lot of fun.''
</P>
<P>
   When your opponent is giving out halftime quotes that the game
was a lot of fun, it probably wasn't a lot of fun for you.
</P>
<P>
   Or for the people watching back home.

DEVIL OF A TIME FOR ANGEL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It hasn't been easy for Mo Vaughn this season. He is
traveling down the path some people would call success. But
everything is not always as it seems.
</P>
<P>
   When he left the Red Sox and cast his lot with the Anaheim
Angels, he was doing what only comes naturally in major league
baseball these days. The choice was his, and he hit an $80 million
jackpot. Immediately, the weight of the Angels' franchise fell upon
his shoulders, but because of an ankle injury in the season's first
game, he was not able to become the team leader, as expected.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels have faced similar situations with big-name
acquisitions before. In 1979, the team acquired first baseman Rod
Carew from Minnesota for four players, and he led the team to an
American League West Division title. In 1981, the Angels got Red
Sox outfielder Fred Lynn in a deal for Joe Rudi and Frank Tanana.
Carew was hurt in 1979 and played in just 110 games, although he
did hit .318. But Lynn, who also was hurt in '81, batted just .219
in 76 games. Both had better second seasons after their first
campaigns in California.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Fenway Faithful have come down hard on Vaughn. While
the fans may have good reason to hoot his .261 average or his .067
mark (1 for 15) against the Sox, somewhere along the line,
shouldn't they tip their caps to an old friend whose only crime was
that he put his personal future over that of the Olde Towne Team?
</P>
<P>
   It's happened before. It could happen in a few years when
opportunity knocks for Nomar Garciaparra or any of a handful of
would-be Vaughns on the roster. At least the Angels believe they
are lucky to have him, despite all their problems this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy did nothing but play hard for the Boston Red Sox and
did a lot of things around the community,'' said Angels manager
Terry Collins. ``They're booing him probably because they're mad
he's not here. He doesn't deserve it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's played for us on one leg all year long, and he knows he
doesn't have to. He went out there four days with a staph infection
in the right leg. Never said a word. It got so bad we had to sit
him down for six games. He's had a tough time. But I know he's
looking forward to being healthy again as much as we are.''
</P>
<P>
   The Curse of the Angels ranks right up there with the Curse of
the Bambino. The club first took the field in April 1961 and has
had a history of problems on and off the diamond. It won West
Division crowns in '79, '82, and '86, but never advanced any
farther. In fact, it was the Red Sox who sent them packing in their
last attempt. The Angels have been good at developing talent in
recent years. With the addition of Vaughn, the 1999 season was
supposed to be championship-driven. So far, the Angels have had 18
men on the disabled list this year. Babe Ruth or Hank Aaron in
their prime couldn't have won a title if they played on this year's
team. Neither can Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a different lifestyle,'' says Vaughn. ``Out there, you
have to win to bring people to the ballpark. We haven't done that.
When I was here, we were lucky. People always showed up regardless
of the situation. I don't worry about the booing. They booed me
when I played here.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to put things in perspective. I got hurt in the first
game of the season. It probably would have healed if I'd taken more
time. But that's not my style. I don't regret it. I won't make any
excuses.''
</P>
<P>
   Carew is the Angels' batting instructor, so he knows how
difficult it is to live up to the kind of hype that has surrounded
Vaughn. Before he arrived on the West Coast, Carew won seven
batting titles and was named the MVP in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to battle back and help us win the division,'' said
Carew of the '79 season. ``But injuries are part of the game. Mo
has been hurt all year and struggled because of it. But I don't
think he's putting extra pressure on himself. He knows he's got a
job to do, and he goes out and tries to do it. Mo is still the guy
on this club. But he can't carry the load by himself.''
</P>
<P>
   What hurt Lynn, said Carew, was the fact that he had trouble
adjusting his hitting style from Fenway to the stadium in Anaheim.
There was no wall in left-center. One of Vaughn's problems is that
he's not waiting to get his pitch. But there are other concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big difference coming from this park and going to a
bigger park,'' Carew said. ``What I noticed about Mo when he was
here was he basically drove the ball to center field. This year, he
has become more of a pull hitter. Now he has to make an adjustment
for next year where he tries to hit a line drive where it is
pitched.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the rough treatment by some fans, Vaughn said it was a
nice homecoming. He spoke with several of his former teammates and
urged them to avoid the snake pit he has made for himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Nomar that he should do the right thing, don't create
waves and wind up in the same situation that I'm in,'' said Vaughn.
``I thought about a lot. I wish I'd just played and not talked so
much about things. I told him not to put himself in such a
situation. He'll do fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn says he wishes the new season could start tomorrow. He
hopes his teammates feel the same way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a lot of talent, no doubt about it,'' he said. ``But
talent isn't everything. But we have to come together to reach
postseason play. That's what we've got to learn. These guys have
never won a pennant over here, and some of them have to learn how
to do that. Basically, you start at the beginning of the season.
It's all the little things.''

TYSON COULD CRUISE PAST SMALLER NORRIS
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Mike Tyson found what he wanted.
</P>
<P>
   He found an opponent smaller than he is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they view Orlin as a cruiserweight who can't hurt
him,'' said Scott Woodwirth, manager of former cruiserweight
champion Orlin Norris. ``Some guy on TV in LA said he'd rather see
Chuck Norris fight Mike than Orlin Norris, but we believe he can
win.''
</P>
<P>
   What else are they supposed to believe after agreeing to an
$800,000 payday to face Tyson Oct. 23 at the Thomas and Mack Center
in Las Vegas?
</P>
<P>
   To Tyson's handlers, Norris is a perfect opponent for a former
champion who is not as sure of himself as he once was. Not as
perfect as Buster Douglas, who would have been little more than a
cadaver had they gotten away with propping him up in front of
Tyson. But Norris is smaller than Tyson, lacks real punching power,
and though he may be as slick a boxer as Frans Botha, he is not as
strong and therefore won't be able to tie up Tyson and manhandle
him the way Botha did until Tyson knocked him cold with one punch
midway through their January confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   Until the knockout punch landed, Botha had won every minute of
every round by wrestling with Tyson on the inside and slapping him
around from the outside. Norris seems unable to do either, but
Woodwirth argues his fighter is more than he appears to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't offer us this fight because they think Orlin can
beat Mike, but I don't think they believe it's a cakewalk either,''
Woodwirth said from Las Vegas. ``Even as a cruiserweight, Orlin
always looked to box. He'll be looking not to get caught and to be
careful not to get lured into a slugfest and to try and take Mike
12 rounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``People forget Orlin was NABF heavyweight champion before he
ever was a cruiserweight. I know a lot of people have been
skeptical, but Orlin has a good chin, and he always felt he could
compete with the best of the heavyweights. Now he's got his
chance.''
</P>
<P>
   That is debatable considering Tyson's own slippage, but Tyson
remains a ferocious puncher if he lands, as Botha found out. If an
opponent makes the mistake of staying in front of Tyson and making
his chin available, it's early siesta time, and Norris knows it.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, that is what Tyson's people believe will happen
because they feel Norris has neither the power to hold Tyson off
nor the strength to tie him up and mitigate his power on the
inside. That may prove to be true, but from Woodwirth's point of
view, his fighter has what few will give him.
</P>
<P>
   A chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``My guy can beat anybody in that division if he's motivated,''
Woodwirth said of Norris (49-5, 26 KOs). ``I know nobody believes
it, but we do. Whenever Orlin has been motivated, he's been great.
When not, he's not so good. When you're talking about Mike Tyson,
you're talking about a different level.
</P>
<P>
   ``So the question to me isn't, `Can Orlin fight with Mike?' He
can do that. But can he hold his own? Botha's size didn't allow
Mike to manhandle him. Orlin can't let him do that, either. If he
doesn't let him, it will be interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, every time Tyson gets into the ring, it's
interesting. At least until he lands the big one.
</P>
<P>

   Eric Bottjer, a matchmaker for Cedric Kushner Promotions,
reported Angel Manfredy did not have to pay the $2,000 fine the
World Boxing Council demanded for not taking mandatory weigh-ins 30
days and seven days before his recent fight with WBC champion
Stevie Johnston. When WBC representative Steve Crossen tried to
collect the money, Bottjer produced evidence from Manfredy's doctor
that he had taken the weigh-ins and complied with the WBC rules
that he be within 10 percent and then 5 percent of the fight night
limit of 135 pounds . . . Acelino Freitas recently became the first
Brazilian in 24 years to win a world title when he captured the
World Boxing Organization junior lightweight crown by knocking out
Anatoly Alexandrov in Cannes, France. Freitas (21-0, 21 KOs)
dropped Alexandrov at 1:41 of the first round with a barrage of
punches. The last Brazilian to hold a world title was Miguel De
Oliveira, who won the WBC junior middleweight title in 1975. He
lost that title six months later, but during his short reign,
Freitas was born . . . One day, talented WBO super middleweight
champion Joe Calzaghe (27-0, 23 KOs) finally had an opponent for
his Sept. 18 title defense on the Oscar De La Hoya-Felix Trinidad
undercard, a fight that guaranteed him some much-needed exposure.
Next day, the fight was off. Such is boxing, but this time, at
least no one can blame the challenger, a little-known Canadian
named Alain Bonnamie (18-8, 11 KOs). The culprit was an elbow
injury that has plagued Calzaghe since he defeated Rick Thornberry
in his last title defense. ``I'm absolutely gutted, totally
devastated that this has happened,'' Calzaghe said. ``I feel as
sick as a parrot. It was my chance to gain great exposure.''
English promoter Frank Warren also felt sick as a parrot (however
sick that may be). In a press release from his offices in England,
Warren lamented the injury and said the fight had been made in
hopes of introducing Calzaghe to the American fight fan. Perhaps
so, but some skeptics say it's the story that's sick, because
already there is talk of Calzaghe making a defense in England a
month after the scheduled Sept. 18 fight . . . Factual Update
Dept.: Turns out that while the late Dan Duva did control 40
percent of the profits of Main Events, the other 60 percent was
split among his four siblings, not just brother Dino, who took over
when Dan died of a brain tumor and complications, and sister Donna.
They received 20 percent each, with two other sisters splitting the
remaining 20 percent. The situation itself remains as stated,
however. Duva's widow, Kathy, controls all the voting stock and
hence the company unless her in-laws can buy her out . . . De La
Hoya has often talked lately of his distrust of many of the people
around him. It is one reason he has so frequently changed managers
and trainers, not to mention advisers. To some, this insecurity in
a great champion is seen as a weakness, but to veteran trainer
Teddy Atlas, it is hardly unusual for a fighter in De La Hoya's
position. ``Fighters don't want to go up those three steps any more
than anyone else, but they discipline themselves for that moment,''
Atlas said. ``It's their trade, and it's an acquired trade to face
that moment, but in other ways they're often insecure. They're
often less secure than other people. In boxing, people are around
you for what you do, not for who you are. You don't get normal
relationships in boxing. First you're alone. Then if you're
successful, people are all around you because there's something in
it for them. But fighters always worry what happens when they lose.
Will they all be gone? It's a pretty deep insecurity.'' . . . Newly
crowned International Boxing Federation cruiserweight champion
Vassily Jirov (21-0, 19 KOs) makes his first title defense
underneath De La Hoya-Trinidad against undefeated Dale Brown
(18-0-1) . . . Los Angeles boxing writer Bruce Bebb made the kind
of reference we all wish we were literate enough to make when he
said this of troubled IBF junior middleweight champion Fernando
Vargas: ``Although Vargas has a nice family, he reminds me of
something George Eliot wrote: `He was like a cock who thought the
sun had risen to hear him crow.' Elsewhere, Eliot wrote, `Character
is destiny.' If that's true, the Vargas family is headed for
trouble.'' Vargas was recently indicted on felony assault charges.

   Former lightweight champion Shane Mosley may have moved up in
weight a little too fast. The undefeated Mosley tired of having no
real competition at 135 pounds and on Sept. 25 will fight Wilfredo
Rivera as a full-fledged welterweight for the first time. It is a
12-pound jump right past the super lightweight division, a decision
Mosley and his father, Jack, made partly because they saw no one in
that division with whom they could make a big payday. But after
former junior welterweight champion Kostya Tszyu's 10-round
destruction of two-time world champion Miguel Angel Gonzalez a week
ago, Mosley may be having second thoughts. Tszyu was once seen as a
likely showdown for De La Hoya when both were fighting at 140, but
before that big-money fight could be made, Tszyu ran into a buzzsaw
named Vince Phillips in 1997 and was knocked out in an outcome so
stunning it cost him not only his IBF championship but also much of
his reputation as a dangerous predator. For a time, Tszyu returned
to Australia and disappeared, but he resurfaced with a vengence
against Gonzalez, himself a two-time world champion whose only loss
had come in a tough 12-round battle with De La Hoya. From the first
round to :28 into the 10th, Tszyu dominated. He cut Gonzalez's left
eyebrow, closed his right eye, and left him so defenseless along
the ropes when the 10th round opened that Gonzalez's trainer, Alex
Sanchez, leaped into the ring to save his fighter before referee
Frank Santore could act. ``It was total control,'' Tszyu said. ``He
has a great heart, but my punches were too effective.''

   Boxing has long been the favorite sport of the literary set, and
the latest proof of that can be found in the new issue of the New
Yorker, which features a lengthy advertorial for HBO in which an
article on the sport written by novelist Joyce Carol Oates makes up
the copy. An example much closer to home is in production in
Gloucester. Any fight fan or theatergoer looking for a good night
out should get up to the Gloucester Stage Company production of
Israel Horovitz's new play, ``Fast Hands,'' which runs through next
Sunday. It is more the story of a son tracking down the father he
never knew and how their relationship grows than it is about
boxing, but the one is a fighter and the other a broken-down
trainer who lost fights for a living as a young man, and the
setting in dank gyms and on greyhound buses is often just right.
More than a few lines will make you laugh, which only makes the
play better. For ticket info call 978-281-4099 . . . A dinner
honoring Carmen Basilio and Tony DeMarco will take place at the
Suffolk Downs Turf Club Sept. 18 in conjunction with the
closed-circuit broadcast of the De La Hoya-Trinidad fight in Las
Vegas. A limited number of seats at $60 will be available for the
event, which includes dinner, a night of racing, a chance to meet
Basilio and DeMarco, and the closed-circuit broadcast. Nearly 45
years ago, Basilio and DeMarco fought what Ring Magazine has called
the greatest welterweight title fight in history. Each will be on
hand to talk about that fight and what may be the last great
welterweight championship bout of this century. For ticket info
call 617-567-3900 . . . Speaking of tributes, Ward Street in
Brockton will be renamed Petronelli Way at a ceremony at Brockton
City Hall Plaza Wednesday. It was in the Petronelli Brothers gym on
that street that Marvelous Marvin Hagler learned his trade and came
into prominence as one of the greatest middleweight champions in
history. Hagler will be on hand to honor his former
manager/trainers.

 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM McCABE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AKRON, Ohio _ For those of you keeping score at home, this
week's NEC Invitational is the second of three World Golf
Championships events in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The first one was the Andersen Consulting Match Play
Championship in February, and No. 3, the American Express
Championship, looms in early November in Valderrama, Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, there were going to be four of these WGC events
annually starting in 2000, but that may not happen. PGA Tour
commissioner Tim Finchem, who brought together the pro tours of
Japan, Australia, South Africa, and Europe to run these World Golf
Championships, said the other day that the World Cup may remain
just as it is _ a fun event with enough meaning for players
worldwide to give it legitimacy, an event that has never needed a
$5 million purse to lure honorable stars _ and may not be renamed
the World Cup Team and become WGC event No. 4.
</P>
<P>
   That was the best news we have heard since it was announced
Jumbo Ozaki was doing the honorable thing and taking himself off
the Presidents Cup team. (No. 14 in the world? Who is No. 15? Seve
Ballesteros?)
</P>
<P>
   ``We are pretty excited about the future of the World Cup, and
we're looking at some format changes and some interesting venues,''
said Finchem. ``But we are just not quite there yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Please, put it in park and turn off the ignition. Stay where you
are _ at three World Golf Championships events. We don't need any
more of these contrived tournaments and their $5 million purses and
limited fields. There is plenty of quality international golf as it
is, and fans have ample opportunities to see great fields without
adding a fourth WGC event.
</P>
<P>
   Add more, and you run the risk of forcing marquee players into
decisions that will be bad for the sport (as well as their PR). As
it is, there are some world-class players who look at the schedule
and wonder how to make all the pieces fit into one calendar.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Lehman, for example, deserves a loud round of applause for
pushing himself almost weekly since May 28 to secure a spot on the
Ryder Cup team. His reward for such diligence? A few moments to
catch his breath, then a schedule that makes him wonder how
baseball players do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, 162 games,'' he said. ``How do you play that many
games and be competitive in every one of them?''
</P>
<P>
   Lehman is playing the NEC Invitational, though he'd much prefer
to be home with his family. Sitting in yet another hotel room, he
can look at a schedule that will take him from Firestone CC to some
Ryder Cup tuneups, then that intense competition at The Country
Club in Brookline, Mass., and finally the prestigous Tour
Championship.
</P>
<P>
   Well, not quite finally, because there's that little event in
Valderrama the week after the Tour Championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Tour Championship used to signal the end of the year,''
said Lehman. ``Now you've got to go to Spain. I don't want to go to
Spain; I want to go home.''
</P>
<P>
   He is speaking for a lot of players, though most likely he'll
go, pushing his offseason back a week.
</P>
<P>
   Finchem is aware of the less-than-ideal schedule, ``but we've
arranged for a charter,'' he said, to take players from Champions
Golf Course in Houston, site of the Tour Championship, to Spain.
``We know we may lose one or two players, but we're sure we'll have
a great tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   They may start losing many more than that if the schedule keeps
growing. There are the four majors, then all those events that
attract great fields (the Nissan Open, Bay Hill, TPC, the Memorial,
the Colonial). Throw in the three WGC events and you understand
that it isn't hard to envision a player skipping a $5 million
tournament. Heck, already some marquee names have wondered out loud
whether it is worth going to Australia for the WGC Match Play
Championship in 2001.

   ``There's always a reason to play, and to stay up all the time
is difficult,'' said Lehman.

   The furor that was raised during the PGA Championship had hardly
died down when similar dissatisfaction started among caddies. The
issue, of course, is how little money the PGA of America shares
from the Ryder Cup. Tiger Woods, David Duval, Mark O'Meara, and
Phil Mickelson were singled out after a closed-door meeting, but
the most vocal caddie chose to come front and center with his beef.
Andy Martinez, arguably the PGA Tour's most respected caddie, told
a reporter for Golfweek, ``The PGA of America has no consideration
for us.'' In 1997 at Valderrama, the PGA of America picked up the
expenses for the 12 caddies and paid them each $500. This year it
will be expenses and $1,000. Martinez, who carries for Lehman,
thinks that is too low, given all money that is made. Some of his
colleagues, however, weren't as upset about that as they were about
the fact that they were being asked to pay their own way to Boston
for Monday's practice round at The Country Club. That problem (but
not Martinez's complaint) was settled earlier this week when the
PGA of America agreed to pay the air fares . . . Speaking of
caddies, Joe ``Gypsy'' Grillo is back working for Steve Elkington
after a scare at the PGA Championship. Grillo was rushed to a
hospital before the start of Round 1, complaining of breathing
problems and chest pains. Elkington happened by the commotion as he
headed to the locker room, and when he discovered it was Grillo, he
immediately withdrew. Fortunately, it was not a heart attack, but
an asthma problem that had similar symptoms. It was a class act by
Elkington, who considers Grillo a member of his family. ``Steve
knows what matters in life,'' Grillo told reporters, ``and he takes
care of his friends. He's the best.'' . . . What does one of the
sport's old guard think of the recent silliness over all this
money/charity stuff surrounding the Ryder Cup? Not surprisingly,
Jack Burke Jr. calls it as he sees it: ``These guys are golfers.
The only thing they should be concerned about is putting a number
up in that little box _ and hopefully it begins with a 6.'' Burke,
who played on five Ryder Cup teams (compiling a 7-1-0 record) and
was twice a captain, said the players have legitimate points that
should be addressed, but it never should have come to the surface
weeks before the event. ``They should be thinking about playing
golf and trying to win this thing,'' said Burke. ``Instead, they
are possessed by possessions.'' . . . Fortunately, there are people
like Lehman who are actually talking about the golf part of the
Ryder Cup. He recently visited The Country Club and offered high
praise. ``It was better than I expected,'' he said. ``I expected a
lot, but it was way better than I had imagined.'' . . . Before he
could be asked about the Ryder Cup controversy, Finchem offered his
opinion ``because, frankly, I would not like to discuss it during
the course of the championship this week,'' he said. Finchem then
stated that (a) the story has been blown out of proportion, (b) the
players never asked to be paid, (c) he thinks it is totally
appropriate for competitors to be able to direct proceeds to
charities of their choice, and (d) it is wrong to criticize the PGA
of America for building the Ryder Cup into a money-making machine.
``The PGA of America has worked hard to build the commercial
viability of the Ryder Cup, just as we (the PGA Tour) do with every
championship or tournament that we manage. The PGA of America
managed the Ryder Cup for 60 years before it turned a profit.
Nobody was calling and saying, `Gee whiz, we heard you were losing
money on the Ryder Cup. Can we send you a contribution?' '' . . .
Touching on a very sore subject with captain Ben Crenshaw and some
other Ryder Cup loyalists, Finchem did use the E-word. As in
exhibition. ``Technically, it is an exhibition,'' said Finchem.
``There's no question about that. But it is an exhibition that is
very popular, the most intense golf on TV. It is riveting.''

   TV journalists, be careful, because Woods is watching. A report
on The Golf Channel last week said Woods had snapped his driver in
half after hitting into the water at the Sprint International.
Woods called in to the network's Viewer's Forum and said right
story, wrong guy. It was Jesper Parnevik who did the snapping, and
Jay Haas came to the rescue with another driver . . . The disaster
at Carnoustie is more than a month behind us, but reactions to it
are still worth visiting. Nick Price's assessment: ``If you like
root canals and hemorrhoids, you would have loved it there.'' . . .
During Thursday's first round of the Reno-Tahoe Open, players had
to contend with smoke from a nearby forest fire. That didn't faze
Franklin Langham, whose journeyman career has included tours in
Asia. ``All of Singapore, Indonesia, and Malaysia was just a
haze,'' he said. ``They were slashing and burning. And I actually
played pretty well there.'' . . . Joel Kribel, the former Stanford
All-American who has turned pro, received a sponsor's exemption
into the Reno-Tahoe event but opened with an 80 . . . Long-hitting
Hank Kuehne made his pro debut at the Sprint International but
missed the cut. He did, however, keep most of his shots within
state lines at a tournament where 200-yard 8-irons are the norm . .
. It's not easy being a spectator at a golf event. Two onlookers
were struck with errant shots in the first round of the NEC
Invitational. Sergio Garcia and Darren Clarke were the players who
sent their shots off in the wrong direction. Each of them offered
apologies and an autographed ball . . . The winner of this week's
NEC Invitational will be presented with the Gary Player Cup, and
the legendary South African was on hand earlier in the week for the
formal announcement of that fact. In February, Jeff Maggert
received the Walter Hagen Cup for winning the WGC Match Play
Championship. Which golf legend gets the honor for the American
Express Championship? That will be announced at a later date.

   Mission accomplished, so now Grace Park will have some fun. The
1998 US Women's Amateur champ, who declared her pro status in early
June, finished as the leading money-winner on the Futures Tour,
thus securing her LPGA Tour card for 2000. That means the talented
20-year-old will now accept sponsor's exemptions (two in
September). They had been there for the taking, but Park chose
instead to pursue her card through the far-from-the-spotlight
Futures Tour, a decision that appears to be brilliant given the
recent woes of Jenny Chuasiriporn. Like Park, Chuasiriporn had a
stellar amateur career and turned pro this year. Unlike Park,
Chuasiriporn accepted several sponsor's exemptions and headed out
to test her game against the best. She fared poorly. The
indifferent play continued last week as she tried to get through
the first stage of Qualifying School; Chuasiriporn shot 76-77 and
missed the cut. Another sectional qualifier will be held Sept.
7-10. The Final Qualifying Tournament is scheduled for Oct. 19-22,
and that field will include Franklin, Mass., native Pam Kerrigan,
who shot 74-75-71-74 in her sectional to place T-13. Michelle Bell
of Melrose missed advancing, as did Kellee Booth, another recent
amateur star, and 1998 NCAA champion Jenny Rosales . . . David
Gossett recently had an impressive US Amateur victory, made even
more so by the fact that he shot 80 in the first round. He came
back with a 71_151 to get in under the cut by one shot, then
marched through the field in match play like a hot knife through
soft butter: 2 and 1, 5 and 4, 5 and 4, 4 and 3 (over Chestnut
Hill's James Driscoll), 2 and 1, and 9 and 8 in the championship.
It was the largest margin of victory since Hal Sutton won by that
same score over Bob Lewis in 1980. Gossett, 20, will return to the
University of Texas for his sophomore year, resisting the urge to
turn pro . . . Congratulations to Jim Sheerin, head professional at
Abenaqui CC in Rye, N.H. He sank a 15-foot birdie on the second
playoff hole to win the New England PGA Seniors Championship at
Woodstock CC in Woodstock, Vt. Sheerin shot 74-68_142 to finish
tied with Mike Egan (73-69) of Gardner Municipal, then claimed the
playoff victory at the 176-yard par 3. Both players recently turned
50. They advance to the PGA Senior Club Pro Championship in Florida
in October, along with Paul Barkhouse of Woburn CC (74-69), Bob
Molt of Solomon Pond Driving Range (72-71), Peter Matthews of
Newport (Vt.) CC (72-71), and Dan Diskin of Amherst CC (75-69).

GOOD BLEDSOE EFFORT CAN'T SALVAGTE GAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE BURRIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA _ At times Saturday night, Drew Bledsoe was sharp. There
was the 40-yard touchdown strike to Tony Simmons with 4:02 left in
the third quarter, the 15-yard touchdown pass to Terry Glenn in the
second-quarter to cap a four-play, 41-yard drive. Those were
moments when the Patriots quarterback led his unit down the field
with relative ease.
</P>
<P>
   Those moments were short-lived.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, Bledsoe could do little to prevent the
offense from sliding down a collision course so dreadful that New
England's only solace was that it was just an exhibition game.
</P>
<P>
   But it was exhibition game No. 3, just two weeks before the
regular season begins.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, we are what we are,'' said Bledsoe, who
completed 14 of 19 passes for 178 yards, two touchdowns and an
interception. The latter came with 9:31 left in the first quarter,
when Tampa Bay safety John Lynch stepped in front of a pass
intended for Glenn.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he would request to play longer in the Patriots' last
exhibition contest Thursday against Carolina, Bledsoe said,
``Playing another quarter in the Carolina game won't make much
difference. I'll leave that up to Pete (Carroll, Patriots coach).''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll was upset by the team's overall performance, but the
coach didn't seem disappointed by his signal-caller, save the
ill-advised pass that led to the pickoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got hammered sometimes on the pass rushes,'' Carroll said.
``The interception he threw was an inside fade route, and they made
a nice play on it. That's a mistake on his part and the receiver's
part. He didn't need to throw that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall, I thought he threw the ball pretty well. I thought he
got rushed moreso than he had before in the last couple of games.''
</P>
<P>
   That rush was due in part to the exceptional play of Tampa Bay
defensive tackle Warren Sapp, who sat out the team's last game with
a sore back and appeared set to prove he was ready for battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their front seven is as good as anyone in the league,'' said
Bledsoe, on whom Sapp preyed upon. The quarterback was sacked in
the shotgun formation in the second quarter as Sapp stormed past
would-be blockers and closed in on the signal-caller for a 9-yard
loss on third down and 4 from the Patriots' 34-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't block him,'' Carroll said about Sapp. ``He beat
everyone he was on.''
</P>
<P>
   But beyond that, Bledsoe wasn't bad. He was 4 of 6 in the first
quarter, and one miss was the interception. Problem was those four
completions amounted to just 20 yards. In the second quarter, he
was 6 of 8 for 89 yards and the touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   He clearly was sharpest on his second-quarter touchdown drive.
Starting at the New England 31-yard line, Bledsoe completed four
consecutive passes, the first to running back Kevin Faulk, the last
three to Glenn.
</P>
<P>
   In the third, Bledsoe picked up where he left off, completing 4
of 5 passes for 69 yards. With 5:54 left in the quarter, he marched
the Patriots from their 43 on a 7-yard pass to Tony Carter and a
16-yard pass to Shawn Jefferson. That opened up the running game,
and Faulk capitalized, rushing for 17 yards to the Tampa Bay 40.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe then capped the drive with his longest completion of the
evening, a 40-yard pass to Simmons, who slipped past safety Damien
Robinson and into the end zone untouched for the score. It was
textbook precision by both the quarterback and his receivers. For a
moment, it silenced the raucous crowd.
</P>
<P>
   But Bledsoe summed up the score with six words that could have
been echoed by players on both sidelines. ``By then,'' he said,
``the game was over.''

Napolitano have raised issues about the viability of the fetus,
saying the pregnancy may be too far along to abort. Story will move

LEMON DROP KID WINS DRY RUN IN TRAVERS 
</HEADLINE>
 STAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. _ For all practical purposes, Lemon Drop
Kid won the 130th running of the $1 million Travers Stakes when the
sun came up over Saratoga Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Scotty Schulofer, who trains ``The Kid,'' told everyone who
would listen that his charge would win as long as the track was
dry. After Thursday and Friday rains heavy enough to make the
surface sloppy for Friday's card, Saturday yielded nary a drop. The
track was officially listed as ``good'' for the first three races,
then ``fast'' for the fourth, and, with solid footing, Lemon Drop
Kid turned his trainer into a prophet before a crowd of 51,371, a
record for the Travers.
</P>
<P>
   Off as the second choice at 7-2 ($9.30 to win) under Jose
Santos, Lemon Drop Kid stalked a duel between Vision And Verse,
with Shane Sellers, and Cat Thief, under Mike Smith. After a mile,
Cat Thief backed out of the fray, but Vision And Verse, who ran a
tremendous race at 14-1, surged ahead. Lemon Drop Kid came charging
on the outside, while Vision And Verse held on grimly from the
inside. Finally, in the final yards, Lemon Drop Kid edged away to a
three-quarters of a length victory in a time of 2:02 for the 1 1/4
miles.
</P>
<P>
   Menifee, the 8-5 favorite with Pat Day aboard, finished strongly
after a rough trip to gain the show, a length and three-quarters
farther back, but the two horses in front of him were clearly
better this day.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came into the paddock like a champ,'' said Schulhofer of
Lemon Drop Kid. ``He knew what he was out there for, and he was
great. He's trained real good for quite a while. He's just a real
good horse, and I'm happy he's starting to show it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lemon Drop Kid ran second in the Jim Dandy Aug. 8, the prep for
the Travers, over a sloppy track. Vision And Verse was a dull sixth
in the same race, which was won by Ecton Park, who finished fourth
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't like slop, but he ran well in the Jim Dandy
anyway,'' said Schulhofer. ``I was afraid for a while this morning
that the track might be off, but track superintendant Don Orlando
did a real good job. I was very happy with the condition of the
track.''
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, Vision And Verse, who is trained by Bill Mott,
may like slop even less than Lemon Drop Kid, as he followed his
poor effort in the Jim Dandy with a great showing in the Travers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew we were setting a slow pace (dawdling early fractions
of :24, :48 1/5, and 1:12 2/5), and around the turn I realized that
Cat Thief was empty,'' said Sellers. ``When we straightened out, my
horse took off. Lemon Drop Kid is such a tough horse, and he has
such a long and powerful stride. I wish we could have gotten there,
but I'm still happy with the way my colt ran.''
</P>
<P>
   Schulhofer, 73, is in the Hall of Fame, but Lemon Drop Kid, who
is owned by breeder Jeanne Vance, gave him his first Travers in six
tries. Lemon Drop Kid won the Belmont Stakes June 5, but he didn't
get all the credit because Charismatic, who was seeking the Triple
Crown, broke down on the way to finishing third.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always wanted to win the Travers,'' he said. ``It's great
to win it. We knew what kind of a horse we had, and we were proud
of him after the Belmont. He has a lot to do yet, but if he runs
well in his next couple of races, he has a big chance. We'd have to
beat Behrens (the leading handicap horse) and some of the older
horses to get Horse of the Year. We'll probably go to the Woodward
(Sept. 18 at Belmont) next.''
</P>
<P>
   Santos, who won the Travers for the first time in 10 attempts,
put on a flawless ride.
</P>
<P>
   ``It definitely was a fantastic race,'' he said. ``I have to
give all the credit to Scotty; he did a wonderful job with this
horse. I was in perfect position the whole race. I had the race won
at the half-mile pole. Shane was moving his horse, and I was just
sitting there. I hit him three or four times, the crowd roared, and
he got going. If you could dream to have a perfect trip, this was
the trip.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The total handle of $27,154,229 on the 10-race Travers card,
which includes wagering at simulcast outlets, was an all-time
record for The Spa.

ARIZONA JUDGE BLOCKS LATE-TERM ABORTION REQUESTED BY TEEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS MOESER, KARINA BLAND AND   
 Brent WHITING  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ An Arizona appeals judge on Saturday temporarily
blocked a 14-year-old girl from going to Kansas for a late-term
abortion, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear why the stay was granted, but Gov. Jane Hull and
state Attorney General Janet Napolitano have raised issues about
the viability of the fetus, saying the pregnancy may be too far
along to abort.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank God, somebody with some common sense has intervened,''
said Rep. Laura Knaperek, R-Tempe.
</P>
<P>
   Appeals Court Judge Michael Ryan's ruling was the second court
action in one day revolving around the fate of the girl, a ward of
the state who was raped, and the 24-week-old fetus she is carrying.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday morning, Judge William Sargeant of Maricopa County
Superior Court affirmed an earlier decision to permit the girl to
seek an abortion, sources close to the case said. The decisions
have been made in secret because the girl is a juvenile.
</P>
<P>
   The state had asked that Sargeant reconsider his ruling of last
week that the abortion could proceed. Officials said the girl
should be required to see a doctor to determine whether her fetus
is able to survive outside the womb. They also questioned her
competency to make the decision.
</P>
<P>
   The state immediately took the case to the Arizona Court of
Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   Later Saturday, Ryan stayed Sargeant's ruling, said Bryan
Howard, president of Planned Parenthood of Central and Northern
Arizona, and other sources. The next step is likely to be a hearing
before a three-judge appellate panel this week.
</P>
<P>
   Howard said Ryan's ruling meant the girl will ``have to go
through additional hurdles'' before getting an abortion. Howard
provided no other details.
</P>
<P>
   The girl appears to be running out of time to get the abortion,
according to sources familiar with the case, who said that soon it
will be hard to find a doctor willing to perform the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's facing a very compressed time line,'' Howard said.
</P>
<P>
   The girl, who has been a ward of the court since she was 5,
requested the abortion when she was 14-weeks pregnant but ran away
before the procedure could be performed. She returned about two
weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Sargeant removed the girl from custody of
state child welfare officials, sources said, and turned her over to
Juvenile Court officials, who now have control over her
whereabouts.
</P>
<P>
   The girl had been staying at the Durango Juvenile Detention
Center in Phoenix, sources said, but she was moved to an
undisclosed location after she was reportedly harassed by
anti-abortion staffers. She remains in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   The plan had been to send the 14-year-old to Kansas, where Dr.
George Tiller is the nation's leading practitioner of late-term
abortions.
</P>
<P>
   State attorneys were said to be focusing their appeal, in part,
on the differences between Arizona's abortion law and the more
liberal guidelines in Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   Late-term abortions in Arizona are allowed only when the life or
health of the mother is in danger. An abortion is considered late
term if the fetus is able to survive outside the womb. In Arizona,
that determination is made by a doctor.
</P>
<P>
   No Arizona clinics currently provide abortions after 20 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In Kansas, exceptions are allowed for late-term abortions if the
mother's life is in danger or if there is danger of major bodily
impairment or loss of function, which some, including Tiller, have
interpreted to mean the mental health of the mother.
</P>
<P>
   In Arizona, late-term abortions are done by the method most
likely to preserve the life of the fetus. In most cases, that means
a Caesarean section with two doctors present _ one to monitor the
health of the mother and the other to take control ``and provide
immediate care for a living child born.''
</P>
<P>
   In Kansas, doctors are not required to attempt to save the
fetus.
</P>
<P>
   State attorneys reportedly want to require that any abortion
proceed under Arizona laws.
</P>
<P>
   New details also emerged Saturday about Napolitano's handling of
the case.
</P>
<P>
   Sources said Napolitano initially told Hull on Friday that she
had no plans to pursue the case.
</P>
<P>
   Hull then threatened to hire former Attorney General Grant Woods
and former GOP attorney general candidate Tom McGovern to represent
the state in the matter. Napolitano defeated McGovern for the job
in November.
</P>
<P>
   Napolitano reportedly got upset, telling Hull she would not like
it if Hull's 1998 opponent, Paul Johnson, was consulted, sources
said.
</P>
<P>
   But she agreed to meet with Woods. According to sources, the
pair had a succinct conversation in which Woods tried to pin down
his successor on exactly how she would proceed with the appeals. He
reported back to Hull.
</P>
<P>
   There was a growing sense among Hull's aides Friday that
Napolitano, who supports abortion rights, would not pursue every
possible appeal, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Napolitano denied the assertion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any suggestion by unnamed sources that I gave legal advice
based on threats is inaccurate,'' Napolitano said in a statement.
``Throughout, I have only had two objectives: doing what is in the
best interests of the child and providing accurate legal advice to
the client.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge who issued the stay enjoyed a reputation as one of the
most respected trial judges in Arizona before his appointment to
the Court of Appeals in 1996 by then-Gov. Fife Symington.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, Ryan presided over the televised criminal trial of
former Gov. Evan Mecham and his brother, Willard, who were
acquitted of charges relating to campaign finances. In 1987, the
judge oversaw the infamous Phoenix Suns drug case, in which charges
against most of the defendants were dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, he was back in the public spotlight as the judge in the
``AzScam'' political corruption case involving charges of bribery
against seven legislators and others.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, friends describe Ryan as a soft-spoken, unassuming
and private man. They say he gets no ego gratification from
high-profile cases.
</P>
<P>
   A judge since 1985, Ryan gets around in a wheelchair because of
a bullet wound he suffered while a Marine combat officer in
Vietnam. &QL;

 &HT;    Miami's Biscayne Boulevard turns corner on road to renewal
 &HT;    By Mike Williams
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ For 50 years, Biscayne Boulevard was Miami's gateway: a
broad, handsome roadway lined with neon, palms and mom-'n'-pop
motels that welcomed visitors to sun-splashed Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the freeway.
</P>
<P>
   When I-95 opened in the 1960s, visitors whisked into town at 60
mph and 20 feet in the air. As in many American cities, the
elevated highway changed the look and feel of Miami overnight _ and
turned Biscayne Boulevard into an afterthought.
</P>
<P>
   Long the city's proud route of entry, Biscayne began a 30-year
decline. Cozy motels once packed with family station wagons became
crack dens and flophouses. Customers disappeared from shops and
restaurants, while blocklong stretches fell into urban decay, with
boarded-up buildings marred by graffiti.
</P>
<P>
   Hookers became more prevalent than tourists. As recently as last
winter, it was on Biscayne that cops running a prostitution sting
snared an Atlanta Falcons player the night before the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   But now, almost miraculously, Biscayne Boulevard is making a
comeback.
</P>
<P>
   The redevelopment boom that swept across South Beach in the past
decade has jumped Biscayne Bay and is working its way up a 50-block
stretch of Biscayne.
</P>
<P>
   Overnight, it seems, trendy interior design stores, antique
shops and upscale restaurants have opened. Low-rise buildings with
priceless 1940s storefronts are being scrubbed and painted. ``For
Sale'' and ``For Rent'' signs are sprouting like tropical blossoms,
while residents of neighborhoods just off Biscayne report housing
prices rocketing up by double-digit leaps.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have more and more clients who have moved here from the
suburbs,'' said Frank Beyer, an urban pioneer who opened his home
furnishings shop, Surroundings, two years ago. ``They're fed up
with that hour commute. And lots of people are moving over from
South Beach. Prices there are just too high.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the vanguard of the rebirth seems to be made up of South
Beach refugees. The trendy Miami Beach district was transformed in
the 1990s from a moribund retirement area with run-down buildings
into an international jet-setter's paradise featuring fashion
boutiques, refurbished art-deco hotels and a thriving nightclub
district.
</P>
<P>
   But South Beach has gotten so pricey and crowded that some
residents are looking for quieter, cheaper pastures.
</P>
<P>
   ``South Beach is a party place,'' said James Perkins, who moved
to Miami from Kentucky in the mid-1990s. ``It's not a place to put
down roots.''
</P>
<P>
   After living on South Beach, Perkins bought a house in the
Biscayne district in 1996, scooping up a quaint home in the Belle
Mead neighborhood. Three years later, the value of his home has
risen sharply.
</P>
<P>
   Three months ago, Perkins opened Antique Heaven, a small
furniture shop a half block off Biscayne. He's getting plenty of
foot traffic and drive-up customers in an area that until recently
was dominated by down-and-outers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The community has been very supportive,'' he said. ``People
from the neighborhood come in just to tell me they're so happy to
see a new business opening.''
</P>
<P>
   City leaders are delighted at the turn on Biscayne. Planners had
long hoped that a sparkling new Performing Arts Center, which is
scheduled to be built near the Miami Herald building off Biscayne
just north of downtown, would trigger the rebirth. Also anchoring
the transformation is American Airlines arena, which will open next
year and host Miami Heat professional basketball games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to see Biscayne become a street with low-density
shopping centers where people can walk and enjoy,'' Miami Mayor Joe
Carollo recently told the Herald.
</P>
<P>
   City officials have been gently nudging the area for years. In
the mid-1990s, they allowed restricted access to several of the
residential areas just east of Biscayne Boulevard, toward the bay.
Landscaped street barricades and guardhouses have stopped the
encroachment of the drug and prostitution business.
</P>
<P>
   Police have cracked down on speeders, hookers and drug dealers
by running stings and sweeps with high-visibility patrols.
</P>
<P>
   David Seigfried, who has lived in the Bayside neighborhood for
30 years, is heartened by the changes after the long years of
decline.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thirty years ago you could walk the boulevard and feel safe,''
he said. ``It was really nice. It started going down in the 1970s.
If this redevelopment spreads west of the boulevard, it's really
going to take off.''
</P>
<P>
   Early pioneers like Beyer and Perkins realize they took a risk,
but in recent months have seen plenty of evidence that their gamble
is paying off.
</P>
<P>
   This spring, the owner of one of South Beach's trendiest
restaurants, the News Cafe, opened a posh new restaurant, Soyka's,
just off Biscayne. The place is packed for lunch and dinner, with
professionals crowding into a territory that just months ago was
the turf of bums and petty criminals.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the beginning, my friends looked at me and asked, `Are you
nuts?''' Beyer said. ``But now, with someone of Mark Soyka's
reputation and success coming in, everybody sees it's really
happening.''

 &HT;    Reports indicate deaths from Midwest heat wave a combination of
temperature, neglect
 &HT;    (EDS: Photos available.)
 &HT;    By Steve Bennish and Christine Vasconez
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ In Sanders, Ky., a 41-year-old mentally ill man
leaves a state-licensed group home in a heavy coat and bicycles
more than three hours in the sweltering July heat. He dies within
hours.
</P>
<P>
   In Xenia, Ohio, a case manager finds a 24-year-old mentally ill
client, who had just moved into an apartment without
air-conditioning, dead after a weekend of temperatures in the high
90s.
</P>
<P>
   In Cincinnati, a 34-year-old schizophrenic woman is found dead
in a state-licensed group home after temperatures soar to 95
degrees. Days later, the owner installs air-conditioning after a
state inspector threatens to discharge the remaining residents.
</P>
<P>
   Each of these cases involved mentally ill people on medicine
that made them vulnerable to heat stroke. A Dayton Daily News
review of medical examiner reports, police investigations and state
inspections found that at least seven other mentally ill people who
died after failing to cool down during July's intense Midwestern
heat wave were on prescribed medicines.
</P>
<P>
   The 10 deaths _ in Ohio, Kentucky, Wisconsin and Missouri from
July 21 to Aug. 3 _ raise questions about how well government
agencies and care-givers monitor the mentally ill. Three of the
cases involved deaths in state-licensed group homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Physicians are used to giving the medications,'' said
Milwaukee County Coroner Jeffrey Jentzen. ``They may advise
patients that they may experience a dry mouth, but they don't warn
them during the summer they could experience hyperthermia.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not known how many of the approximately 300 Midwestern heat
wave victims were on medication to treat mental illness. Toxicology
reports that could show the presence of psychotropic drugs are
pending in many cities, including Chicago, where a third of the
heat deaths occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Some medical examiners told the Daily News they never checked
whether any heat victims were taking medicines. The federal Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention is examining fatalities in
Chicago and Cincinnati to pin down what role psychotropic drugs
might have played.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything good comes out this, it will be to raise the
standards of care we require,'' Cincinnati Health Commissioner
Malcolm Adcock said.
</P>
<P>
   Some authorities explained the deaths by emphasizing the rights
of the mentally ill to live their lives independently. The heat
stroke deaths refute that argument, said Bill Emmet, of the
National Alliance for the Mentally Ill in Arlington, Va.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a rights issue for someone to put him or herself in
clear risk of death or serious harm,'' Emmet said. ``It's a medical
issue. Someone should intervene to make sure they are not harming
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Psychiatrists know that certain medicines taken by the mentally
ill can make them especially vulnerable to heat stroke, a condition
that can cause death within 15 minutes. However, the risks are
seldom publicized and general health warnings issued during heat
waves typically cite only dangers to the elderly and the very
young. The mentally ill, historically stigmatized by society, are
rarely mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our practice hasn't caught up to our knowledge,'' said Emmet.
``The time is right to attack the stigma.''
</P>
<P>
   The Combined Health District of Montgomery County, Ohio, does
not include the mentally ill in its heat advisories.
</P>
<P>
   When the Daily News asked district spokesman Bill Wharton why
the mentally ill were not mentioned, he said he was not aware of
the specific dangers of psychotropic medicines. Wharton said the
warning will be reworded.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to increase the emphasis of the mentally ill and
psychotropic drugs because the community might not be aware of the
increased risk,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Psychiatric patients risk heat stroke because the medications
they take confuse their internal temperature gauge, diminishing
their awareness of hot weather. Many psychotropic drugs also shut
down the body's ability to sweat.
</P>
<P>
   The dangers are well documented.
</P>
<P>
   Nigel Bark, a physician affiliated with the Albert Einstein
College of Medicine at the Bronx Psychiatric Center in New York
City, examined heat waves and the mentally ill from 1950 to 1984.
The study, published in the August 1998 issue of Psychiatric
Services , found that psychiatric patients in New York City area
state hospitals had twice the risk of dying during a heat wave than
the general population. After preventive measures began in 1979
that included installing air-conditioning, patient deaths declined
to match the overall population's risk.
</P>
<P>
   Death came with little warning to the mentally ill in the
Midwest this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-four-year-old Jeffrey Hodge, evicted from his
air-conditioned apartment in Xenia, hauled his clothes, bedding and
furniture during the broiling last week of July to a nearby
apartment that had a broken air conditioner.
</P>
<P>
   Hodge's friends said he took lithium and Thorazine. Although he
lived by himself, a case manager from Community Network and
Community Support Services of Greene County, Ohio, visited him
twice a week. In fact, the case manager saw him on Friday, July 30,
when the temperature hit 100 in Xenia. After a weekend of highs in
the upper 90s, the case manager returned Monday and found Hodge
dead in his second-floor apartment.
</P>
<P>
   The Montgomery County coroner said the death was from heat
exposure, and listed psychotropic medication as a factor.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbor Dannie Slaven saw Hodge days before his death when he
stopped by to cool down in Slaven's air-conditioned apartment
before returning to his own place. ``If that apartment had been
cool, he'd be here today,'' Slaven said.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn West, Community Network's chief operating officer, said
Hodge's caseworker brought two fans to his apartment that Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just feel awful. Poor Jeff. He was so young,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In light of Hodge's death, Paul VanderSchie, chief executive
officer of the Eastern Miami Valley Alcohol, Drug Addiction and
Mental Health Services Board, said he plans to purchase 150
air-conditioning units to lease to needy clients at an affordable
rate. The board, which oversees West's agency, provides services to
clients in Greene, Clark and Madison counties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fans circulate air but don't cool it,'' VanderSchie said. ``If
it's 95 degrees, they blow 95 degrees.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends say Hodge should have been watched more closely.
Neighbors Flora Mae Rich, 53, and Darlene Fannin, 31, said Hodge
often complained about lack of sleep at night and jitters during
the day. He couldn't hold a job, and frequently asked Fannin and
Rich for food and cleaning supplies, saying he had no money.
</P>
<P>
   ``He shouldn't have been left alone,'' Fannin said.
</P>
<P>
   The youngest heat-stroke victim in Cincinnati was Pamela
Current, 34, who lived in a state-licensed home without
air-conditioning and took medication to control her schizophrenia.
She was found dead in her second-floor bedroom July 24. Her body
temperature measured 106.2, according to coroner's office
investigators. In the room, the temperature was 92.1. That day
temperatures outside hit 95 degrees with 93 percent humidity.
</P>
<P>
   The Ohio Department of Health cited the home for having extreme
temperatures and being understaffed, after the Hamilton County
Mental Health Board requested an investigation. No fine is
proposed.
</P>
<P>
   The home's owner, Daniel S. Deters, ``is the full-time staff for
three facilities and has no designated manager,'' which led to
understaffing, the state report said. A toxicology report on
Current is pending.
</P>
<P>
   Current's roommate told investigators: ``Air-conditioning was
not discussed much with the homeowner because `he would get mad.'
When asked what the resident did to cool down, resident stated they
left the facility and went to Hardee's or some place else that had
air-conditioning,'' the state report said.
</P>
<P>
   After the state investigator told Deters to discharge the
remaining residents or cool the house, Deters installed two
air-conditioning units July 28, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   Deters didn't return a phone call for comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``For sure, next year we'll be more pro-active,'' said Monica
Kennedy, the Hamilton County Mental Health Board's chief
psychiatrist. After Current's death, Kennedy warned case managers
about medication and heat dangers. ``You can die from heat
exhaustion in 15 minutes,'' she said. ``People are caught off
guard.'' Ohio law does not require air conditioning in homes
licensed for the mentally ill.
</P>
<P>
   Two Montgomery County people taking psychotropic medicine also
died from the heat.
</P>
<P>
   Malcom Lunderman, 50, of Kettering, was last seen alive on
Friday, July 30. The former nurse, whose only companions where his
three cats, was found dead in his home the next day by a relative.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never realized he didn't use the air-conditioner. Otherwise
he could have stayed on (our) couch,'' said Jo Karmele, who lives
two houses away.
</P>
<P>
   Betty Lou Dotson also had an air-conditioning unit in her Dayton
apartment, but refused to turn it on. Dotson, a 59-year-old on
psychotropic medicine, was found by the apartment's maintenance
supervisor Sunday, Aug. 1, after being seen three days earlier.
</P>
<P>
   WISCONSIN
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee County Coroner Jeffrey Jentzen linked two of
Milwaukee's 10 heat-related deaths to psychotropic medicines.
</P>
<P>
   The East Samaria boarding house tried to beat the heat over the
July 31 weekend by periodically shuffling clients such as
54-year-old Raymond Shagen into the basement TV room and kitchen,
the only air-conditioned area in the facility.
</P>
<P>
   East Samaria administrator Phyllis Reitter said the staff
frantically tried to cool the 87 residents, even buying 21 fans.
</P>
<P>
   She said Shagen was sitting on the porch at 7 p.m. ``He was a
whole lot more with it than most of the people here,'' Reitter
said. ``Ray(mond) knew what to do, others had long-sleeve shirts
on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stripped one woman naked and washed her down. If anything I
thought she would be the one that wouldn't make it.''
</P>
<P>
   But by 3 a.m., it was Shagen who collapsed and died in his bed.
Shagen took lithium and other medicines, and the coroner listed the
temperature in his one-room apartment at 96 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Reitter said the home bore no responsibility in the death.
</P>
<P>
   ``Legally, we're just like a landlord,'' she said. ``We provide
three meals a day and they pay their rent. They have case managers
that take care of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Eilers, administrator for the Milwaukee County Mental
Health Division, agreed that the home was not responsible in
Shagen's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are tragedies that I'm not sure were preventable. They
were at risk because of their medical problems and the psychotropic
drugs,'' she said. ``This is a community where there are plenty of
non-air-conditioned places, rich and poor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to keep people locked up in air-conditioned
rooms so they are OK when there's heat.''
</P>
<P>
   Shagen's family remains angry about the circumstances of the
death.
</P>
<P>
   Daughter Deinna Estergard doubts whether he was regularly
checked. ``I don't think they were doing their job,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It surprised me they didn't have air-conditioning,'' said
another daughter, Lisa Weigelt of Oconto, Wis.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Neuner, 47, died between his bathroom and closet in a
Milwaukee apartment without air-conditioning the same weekend.
Neuner, a paranoid schizophrenic who took Wellbutrin and Thorazine,
was last seen by his case worker five days prior to his death. He
participated in a work program, assembling small items.
</P>
<P>
   Neuner moved to the apartment two years earlier, after leaving a
more structured program. Eilers said the death did not warrant
further investigation by Milwaukee County mental health officials.
Kentucky
</P>
<P>
   In Sanders, Ky., a town of 100 people, rest home resident Brion
Lee McCardwell was found on his bed at 8 p.m. July 30 ``foaming at
the mouth'' and semi-conscious. The 41-year-old was rushed to a
hospital where he died of heat stroke. Carroll County Coroner James
Dunn said that shortly before McCardwell's death his body
temperature was 106.9 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   According to a Kentucky state inspection report after
McCardwell's death, Valley Haven home staff saw him that afternoon
wearing a heavy coat as he bicycled throughout the town for 3 hours
when temperatures reached 104 degrees. A state report said
McCardwell was diagnosed with ``mental Illness and borderline
intellectual functioning.''
</P>
<P>
   Employees at the state-licensed home described McCardwell as hot
and sweating when he returned. He was seen in his room at 6:30
p.m., still wearing his coat and sitting on the floor. He died at
10:10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   McCardwell was taking the anti-psychotic drug Mellaril at the
time of his death, sheriff Charles Maiden, Jr. said. He plans to
forward his ongoing investigation on the death to the local
prosecutor, who will examine whether criminal charges for abuse or
neglect are justified.
</P>
<P>
   ``He shouldn't have been out on a bicycle in that kind of
weather,'' Maiden said, adding it's common for deputies to retrieve
walkaways from the facility. ``We pick them up all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Ransdell, owner of home, didn't return a call for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The home installed air-conditioners and fans after the death,
said Gil Lawson, a spokesman for the Kentucky Cabinet for Health
Services. He questioned whether anything could have been done to
prevent McCardwell's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``(McCardwell) wasn't in jail. He wasn't locked up,'' Lawson
said. ``He was free to come and go.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the health cabinet's Division of Licensing and
Regulation cited Valley Haven for endangering residents' lives.
Sheriff's investigators reported temperatures at 95 July 31, 10
degrees above the state's maximum allowed temperature standard in
licensed facilities. They also found four flushed,
heavily-perspiring residents wearing heavy winter coats, jackets or
sweaters. Residents said the heat was so bad they couldn't sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Valley Haven faces a maximum fine of up to $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   MISSOURI
</P>
<P>
   Two of Kansas City's 19 heat deaths involved victims who were on
psychotropic medicine, including a 40-year-old resident in a
state-licensed group home, the Jackson County medical examiner's
office said.
</P>
<P>
   Electrical workers on July 21 told a nurse about a foul odor
coming from one of the residents' rooms. The resident, Steven Cook,
had been taking Clozaril , a powerful prescription drug used by
schizophrenics. He was last seen alive July 16. and had apparently
been dead for days.
</P>
<P>
   The Missouri Department of Mental Health is investigating.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis Medical Examiner Michael Graham also said one of the
36 heat deaths there included a man on psychotropic medicine. He
wouldn't provide further details.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City Heat Task Force chairman Daniel Lindholm said his
goal is to eliminate heat-related deaths through education and a
heat alert plan. A heat wave in 1980 took 160 lives in that city.
This summer's heat wave killed 19.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are people who don't have family members or neighbors
right there,'' he said. ``People were dead two or three days before
they were discovered. That's a tragedy. All heat-related deaths are
preventable if everyone had someone to check on them.''

 &HT;    Lotto Texas proposes a new game under an old name
 &HT;    By Osler McCarthy
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Searching for a way to prop up Lotto Texas
sales, the state lottery commission gave preliminary approval
Saturday for a new game under an old name.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposed change, lotto players would continue to pick
six numbers, but the range would run from 1 to 54 after four
numbers are added to the mix. That would drive the odds of matching
six numbers from one in 15.8 million to one in 25.8 million,
creating fewer winners so larger jackpots can accumulate. Larger
prizes typically inspire more people to play the game.
</P>
<P>
   The new Lotto Texas also would introduce a ``bonus ball'' _ a
seventh number pulled from the remaining 48 that would double the
number of winners who match five, four or three numbers.
</P>
<P>
   According to theory, a greater chance of winning smaller prizes
would entice more players during the early stages of each game,
when jackpots are smaller and ticket-buyers show more reluctance to
play.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what it takes,'' lottery Executive Director Linda
Cloud said.
</P>
<P>
   Lottery commission staff had reported a 17 percent drop in
average weekly sales this budget year compared with the last, the
second straight 17 percent annual drop.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is like a business,'' Cloud said later. ``We've got to
put attractive products out there.''
</P>
<P>
   By a 3-0 vote, commissioners approved drafting the necessary
legal change to redefine the Lotto Texas game. A public comment
period would follow. If adopted, the new game _ the first
substantial change in Lotto Texas since 1993 _ could go into effect
in November.
</P>
<P>
   The $1 ticket cost would not change.
</P>
<P>
   Adding the ``bonus ball'' would develope a new class of
winnings. Based on a lotto jackpot of $15 million, the staff
proposal calculated these changes for a 54-number game:
</P>
<P>
   _ Instead of paying $3 for matching three numbers, the smallest
prize would be $5 for matching either three numbers or two numbers
and the bonus.
</P>
<P>
   _ Matching four numbers or matching three numbers and the bonus
would yield $25.
</P>
<P>
   _ Matching five numbers would fetch $1,000, while matching four
numbers and the bonus would pay $250.
</P>
<P>
   _ Matching five numbers and the bonus would win $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   Players would have to match the first six numbers drawn to win
the multimillion-dollar jackpot.
</P>
<P>
   Commission Chair Harriet Miers questioned whether the proposed
game change should be attempted while the lottery is increasing the
prizes in the instant, scratch-off games.
</P>
<P>
   Cloud answered that players were demanding lotto changes,
perceiving that prizes were too small and too remote. Without some
kind of remedy to boost ticket sales, she warned that beginning
jackpots could fall from $4 million to $3 million.

 &HT;    Let's expand debate on creationism
 &HT;    By Martha Ezzard
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Kent Richards, professor of the Old Testament at Emory
University, is normally at the opposite end of the political
spectrum from conservative state Rep. Jeff Williams of Snellville,
Ga. But the two men are more in tune on the current controversy _
in Georgia and many other states _ about biblical teachings in
public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Williams wants the creation story from Genesis included.
Richards, director of the worldwide Society of Biblical Literature,
agrees to a certain extent. ``I'd like to say to Brother Williams:
You're right, and the liberals are wrong in wanting to leave values
and religion out of education.''
</P>
<P>
   Knee-jerk liberal thinking, which avoids any reference in school
to the spiritual, is leaving our high school seniors with a
``kindergarten understanding of religion,'' Richards says.
</P>
<P>
   He sent an e-mail recently to Georgia School Board Chairman Otis
Brumby to volunteer the Society's resources. While there's no push
in Georgia to allow school districts to stop teaching evolution _
as happened in Kansas _ the underlying nature of the broader
conflict hasn't changed much since the 1925 trial of John Thomas
Scopes. The Tennessee history teacher was found guilty of violating
state law when he exposed students to Charles Darwin's theory of
evolution.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, state School Superintendant Linda Schrenko and many
fundamentalists want a course on biblical literature as a high
school elective, one with a Christian evangelical slant that
includes the Genesis story of creation. Richards would like to see
as many creation stories as possible, including those of Buddhists,
Muslims, native Americans. Many stories share common themes about
the nature of life, not related to any dogma, and I agree with
Richards that young people should be exposed to them. From there,
it's up to families to guide children.
</P>
<P>
   Richards' primary aim is to broaden the framework of the debate.
``Whether it's Shakespeare or physics, the related values are based
on centuries of religious thought,'' and they ought to be
discussed, he says. And he's sick of theologians talking only to
each other instead of including the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to demystify religion as much as we need to demystify
sex,'' he says. Sex education won't solve all of our social
problems, but that doesn't mean we should avoid the subject if we
want our children to have meaningful sexual relationships as
adults, Richards says.
</P>
<P>
   The colorful professor, whose academic research is rooted in
Hebrew poetry, looks out the large glass windows of his Emory
office and sweeps his hands toward the forested surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   ``My God, there it is,'' he says. ``This kind of beauty _
something powerful had to get it all going.''
</P>
<P>
   While Richards believes intellectually in some form of
evolution, like many scientists and theologians, he's convinced
there must be something more to the creation of an orderly
universe. As scientists learn more about the origins of the
universe, the current theory of evolution will undoubtedly change.
Richards concedes he'd prefer to believe God snapped his fingers
and created the world in seven days, but he points out the Bible
itself has more to say about creation than Genesis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plants and animals, humans _ but where did wisdom come from?''
he says. He turns to the book of Proverbs, chapters 8 and 9. And
with a twinkle in his eye he notes the origin of wisdom is
attributed to a woman: ``Doth not wisdom cry? And understanding put
forth her voice? She standeth in the top of high places ... Wisdom
hath builded her house.''
</P>
<P>
   If there's common academic ground in what Richards and Williams
are saying _ and if it doesn't trample on the Constitution _ our
children surely would be the richer for it.

 &HT;    Flames of hate dividing Tennessee farming area
 &HT;    By Kathy Scruggs
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BYBEE, Tenn. _ Tensions hang as heavy as clouds over this
community on the edge of the Great Smoky Mountains where an uproar
over a federally funded day care center for migrant farmers has
pitted neighbor against neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   The feud is so nasty that the FBI has been called in to
investigate.
</P>
<P>
   More than 400 of the 600 people in the Bybee community have
signed a petition to keep out the Head Start program for children
of Hispanic workers. Many residents marched against the proposed
facility last month. Then, early July 24, someone torched the barn
belonging to the farmer leasing the tract for the center.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the project, who deny any role in the arson, said
Hispanic workers have tossed Molotov cocktails at their protest
signs, and they complain that while the FBI is investigating the
barn burning, it is not looking into the firebombings.
</P>
<P>
   Many residents view the Mexican migrant workers as a threat to
their families and to their way of life and future jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This thing has literally torn this community apart,'' said
Danese Marshall, a longtime resident. ``This is not Bybee.''
</P>
<P>
   The FBI is investigating the barn burning as a possible hate
crime. In 1997, the last year for which national FBI hate crime
figures are available, Hispanics were targeted in more than half
the ethnic-related incidents _ 491 of 836.
</P>
<P>
   James Ellison, 72, the farmer whose barn was torched, figures
his loss, including 170 rolls of hay, at around $30,000. He is
mostly in the beef cattle business now, but in the past he worked
as many as 16 migrants on his tobacco crops.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would see the little kids sitting in the hot sun in
vehicles. It's critical,'' Ellison said of the Head Start program.
``You'd never get any of the white people to do the job. Farming is
just about over with. If it weren't for the migrants, it would be
over.''
</P>
<P>
   But some residents contend the Mexicans steal from their stores,
leer at local women and contribute little to the economy because
they send most of their pay home in money orders.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll steal more than they buy,'' said Jack Lane, the owner
of a store. ``I had three dozen pairs of rubber gloves. One bought
a pair and the rest of them they stole. You can't watch them; it's
like watching a bunch of flies.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, the day care is stalled until an environmental impact
study can be done on the land, which opposition members said is
swampy wetlands _ of use only to the crayfish that burrow there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is worth the investment to dispel the concerns of the
community,'' said J. Davis, state director of the Telamon Tennessee
Migrant-Head Start Program, operated by the Telamon Corp., a
nonprofit organization based in Raleigh.
</P>
<P>
   About two years ago, a similar project in nearby Parrottsville
was abandoned because of opposition that got so threatening that
the previous Head Start director left town, Davis said. ``It got
pretty frightening.''
</P>
<P>
   Migrant farmers, mostly Mexicans, have been part of the Southern
agricultural landscape for more than 20 years, but the Hispanic
population has grown dramatically in the 1990s. In Tennessee, the
increase was 73 percent from 1990 through 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In Bybee and Cocke County, migrant workers harvest tobacco and
tomatoes from July through October. But locals said there are only
two big commercial farms left in the poor community and that the
immigrant workers are taking away jobs and bringing problems that
the day care center will only facilitate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why is it that when one of these things comes in, the dope
comes in?'' asked Donald Strom, one of the opponents. ``The
Mexicans have always been involved. That's why I'm opposed to it.
They are a liability. They are no assets to any community. Why pay
our tax money for something we have no use for? What we need are
good-paying jobs. We're prejudiced against what the federal
government is doing.'' The Head Start program, funded by federal
dollars, would employ 25 people to take care of 50 children,
ranging in age from infancy to 4 years, Davis said. There are
already five other Head Start programs in Cocke County, available
to children of impoverished families who are too young to go to
school, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Bybee was selected for the new site because of its central
location to surrounding counties and the children will be bused in,
Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not trying to do something secretive; we're not trying
to do something destructive to the community,'' Davis said. ``And
we're certainly not trying to get anyone hurt.'' Some residents
complain in particular about the absence of any public discussion
before the project was set in motion.
</P>
<P>
   It was only when the surveyors started working on the property
that next-door neighbor Robert Bible and much of the rest of the
community found out about the Head Start project.
</P>
<P>
   Bible said he was startled out of bed at 4 a.m. by law
enforcement officers on the morning the barn burned. He denounced
the violence but defended the attitude of many residents against
the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not against the children, but we want our community to
stay just like it is,'' Bible said.

 &HT;    El Paso, Hooker had tumultuous relationship
 &HT;    By Alfred Charles
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL PASO, Texas _ When Mary Kaye Hooker was chosen to manage the
public libraries in this west Texas town, she began the job with
sizable support.
</P>
<P>
   But that goodwill evaporated during a rocky four-year tenure in
which she was banned from her office by her boss, criticized by
library patrons who took issue with the way she ran the system and
feared by workers who said she was a stern taskmaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy she's in Atlanta and not here, for the sake of our
employees,'' said El Paso City Councilman Larry Medina, who led a
council committee that investigated library workers' complaints.
``Hopefully, she will do a better job there than she did for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Of her tumultuous experience in El Paso, Hooker said, ``That
library system demands so much of its director. You become well
qualified to take on any challenge. It's a wonderful training
ground.''
</P>
<P>
   It will be a challenge presiding over the Atlanta-Fulton library
system. Hooker, who will earn $100,000 a year, has been hired for a
job that two previous directors abruptly abandoned, citing
conflicts with the 17-member governing board, which has been
criticized as being too involved in the system's day-to-day
affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Hooker said she is looking forward to the task of running the
largest library system in Georgia, with its 35 branches and annual
budget of nearly $30 million. It is a big step up from El Paso,
which has roughly 700,000 residents but only nine library branches
and an annual budget of nearly $6 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the nation will look to us as the leader for what a
library of tomorrow is,'' Hooker said from her downtown Atlanta
office on the main library's sixth floor.
</P>
<P>
   Hooker was among a handful of applicants recommended by Gossage
Regan Associates, a New York-based national recruiting firm paid
$34,000 to find a library director. The library board interviewed
seven candidates, narrowing the field to Hooker and another
applicant before making its choice.
</P>
<P>
   Interviews in El Paso with city officials, library supporters
and workers indicate an enormous amount of animosity toward Hooker.
</P>
<P>
   The ill-will ran both ways. In a move the El Paso city attorney
said was unprecedented, Hooker, who is white, filed a complaint
with the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, alleging
that the largely Hispanic city administration discriminated against
her because of her ethnicity.
</P>
<P>
   She contends that Mayor Carlos Ramirez and other top
administrators did not intervene on her behalf in a dispute with a
subordinate. The subordinate, Ivonne Jimenez, who was the library
system's highest-ranking Hispanic administrator, has filed her own
EEOC complaint and a lawsuit in state district court against the
city, charging that El Paso officials did nothing to stop ethnic
harassment by Hooker. Both complaints and the lawsuit are pending.
</P>
<P>
   The city is also disputing a claim for workers' compensation
benefits Hooker filed while on medical leave after falling down a
flight of stairs in March. Hooker contends she was pushed, but
there has been no definitive ruling by investigators.
</P>
<P>
   While on medical leave, Hooker testified in a deposition given
during the Jimenez court case that the mayor had prohibited her
from entering her office his attempt to ensure that the chain of
command was clear for workers who might see her there.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Ramirez declined to speak with a reporter about Hooker or
the city's library system.
</P>
<P>
   Hooker was appointed by Ramirez's predecessor. She blames the
current mayor for many of the system's woes, arguing that the
library ranked low on his list of concerns. She said Ramirez
targeted the library system repeatedly for budget cuts, reductions
that hamstrung her decision-making.
</P>
<P>
   Expenditures for many city agencies are in question as Ramirez
tries to hold the line on a tax increase. El Paso has allocated
$5.4 million for its libraries for the 2000 fiscal year, compared
to $6.1 million for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Before being named director of the El Paso libraries, Hooker was
coordinator of the Texas Trans-Pecos Library System. She reported
to El Paso's library director and was charged with managing
activities with libraries in other west Texas towns.
</P>
<P>
   ``She performed her job well,'' said Ramiro Salazar, who was
then director of El Paso's libraries and is now director of public
libraries in Dallas. ``She did well with the small staff.''
</P>
<P>
   When Salazar left for the Dallas job, Hooker applied for and got
his position in 1994. Performance evaluations show that she got off
to a good start.
</P>
<P>
   In her first-year review, she earned a 4 on a 5-point scale and
her personnel department reviewers said she responded to challenges
quickly and encouraged her staff to act independently. But toward
the end of her tenure, reviewers noted conflicts between Hooker and
her employees.
</P>
<P>
   Hooker lists her successes in El Paso as the opening of four new
branches, enhancement of automated services, remodeling of the main
library and the receipt of several national grants.
</P>
<P>
   But her critics take issue with many of her accomplishments,
saying the new branches were already in the works when she was
hired, and they insist she dragged her feet on applying for
$388,760 in grants in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Hooker admits some grants were lost, and she places the figure
at nearly $1 million. But she said they were forfeited because the
Ramirez administration did not sign off on grant applications that
required matching funds.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the harshest complaints about Hooker come from El Paso
library workers, who said morale sank under her watch. Nearly 50
workers formed a library chapter of the Association of Federal,
State, County and Municipal Employees to represent their interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something had to be done,'' said Mary Bowles Grijalra,
business manager for AFSCME Local 59. ``We had too many complaints,
and when you have that many complaints something is happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Library patrons also criticized Hooker. She was not welcome at
meetings of the El Paso Public Library Association.
</P>
<P>
   Other support groups also grew frustrated with Hooker's
management, citing her decisions to change operating hours, a
missed opportunity to receive $500,000 in bond money that would
have been available this year to purchase new books, and the loss
of six librarians in three weeks who left for other jobs rather
than continue working for Hooker.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was due to her management that we lost those people,'' said
Carol Ginty, a member of the Friends of Irving Schwartz Library.
``I was not sorry to see Ms. Hooker go.''
</P>
<P>
   Hooker said she was surprised by the criticism from the friends
group.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always respected their approach,'' she said. But she prefers
not to dwell on her El Paso experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't talk about the past, I'm for the future.''

 &HT;    She was in no distress, and I dared not say 'jump'
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Waco welcomes another animal shelter next month.
It's about time. With my house and the Waco Humane Society Animal
Shelter shouldering the weight, the local animal rescue industry
has been strained.
</P>
<P>
   Every animal lover in Waco knows the story of the Fuzzy Friends
Rescue by now _ how David Carpenter, recognized in this space for
grooming and thereby saving the lives of many strays _ was caught
up in a misunderstanding when almost 100 stray dogs and cats he
saved were confiscated from his property under the concern that he
was neglecting them.
</P>
<P>
   Happy ending: Carpenter got his animals back. Even better: His
story pumped adrenaline into an effort underwritten by Betsy and
Clifton Robinson and other animal lovers to establish a no-kill
shelter, coalescing around Carpenter's kindness.
</P>
<P>
   To the end that the Fuzzy Friends group will be better able to
serve its constituency, I thought I'd share some of my experience
in animal rescue. It has to do with our collie Layla and what
happened in our backyard.
</P>
<P>
   How she got in the backyard in the first place is a story unto
itself. We coaxed her into our van a couple of years ago with two
strips of bacon a cook at Denny's had brought out in a napkin. She
had disrupted our breakfast that day, forcing us to wince and worry
as we watched her in the parking lot. She was wet, sore,
disoriented and within a bone's throw of Interstate 35.
</P>
<P>
   She ended up in our backyard for good.
</P>
<P>
   Most every morning it's the same greeting from Layla _ a
stretch, a satisfied moan, a couple of barks and a ritual nibbling
at my socks.
</P>
<P>
   That's every morning except for the one not long ago when I
found her on the trampoline.
</P>
<P>
   I share this story with reservations. I know what our doctor
said when we bought a trampoline, that it would come back to haunt
us, particularly if we hadn't met our deductible.
</P>
<P>
   Not for a second did I consider this was something I might have
to explain to our veterinarian.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, a collie on a trampoline. You say this is a leap. But it's
explainable. A plastic lawn chair was beside the tramp. It had
provided a mounting opportunity. I don't know how long Layla had
been there and what somersaults she'd been performing, only that
she was there. And she'd still be there.
</P>
<P>
   A trampoline is a foolproof collie trap. Its springs serve as a
giant circular cattle guard, a canine guard, if you will. As
excited as Layla was to see me, even if she wanted to get off the
trampoline she wasn't about to try to cross the springs. The
contraption is suitable for patenting.
</P>
<P>
   The only problem with the collie trap is the extrication end.
From the lawn chair I tried to pull Layla off the trampoline. No
way.
</P>
<P>
   I gingerly got on the tramp to attack the problem from another
angle. I momentarily lost my balance and did a half bounce
backwards. Layla half-bounced with me. Up on all fours, she wagged
her tail playfully.
</P>
<P>
   All these months she'd been watching longingly as the youngest
son and I had done the dueling jumping-bean thing on the hot nylon.
</P>
<P>
   ``At last, you jump with me,'' she telepathed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are wrong, biscuit breath,'' I telepathed back.
</P>
<P>
   With no other options, I crouched and lifted 60 pounds of collie
up in my arms. Negotiating springs I could not see below the furry
mass, I found the chair with my feet. In a precipitous descent, I
deposited us both on the ground. Now she bounced on terra firma.
</P>
<P>
   ``Again!'' she wagged.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're grounded,'' I wagged.
</P>
<P>
   It goes without saying that I admire all who do animal rescue
full-time. Thanks to them for giving some bounce back to the world.

 &HT;    What kind of Texan are you?
 &HT;    (EDS: Photos available.)
 &HT;    By Michael Barnes
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Familiar jest: ``You can tell a Texan, but you
can't tell him much.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who smiles at this joke recognizes Texans as a breed
apart, and a shamelessly proud bunch at that.
</P>
<P>
   But who, exactly, qualifies as a Texan?
</P>
<P>
   A native? A longtimer? A newcomer who adopts a Texas state of
mind, or an expatriate who cultivates a Texan identity from a
distance?
</P>
<P>
   These questions come to mind as the University of Texas next
month launches its ``Texas Season'' at the Performing Arts Center.
Most artists in this series _ from Fort Worth virtuoso Van Cliburn
to Austin country legend Willie Nelson _ clearly represent Texas
and its distinctive cultures.
</P>
<P>
   Other artists on the program, such as avant-garde director
Robert Wilson and eclectic dancer David Rousseve, grew up in Texas
but retain only tenuous connections to their native state.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are not, strictly speaking, all Texans,'' Neil Barclay,
associate director of the PAC, said of the artists booked for the
themed 1999-2000 season. ``We wanted to explore the cultural
influences on Texas, as well as Texas' influence on the world. Some
of the artists were born in Texas; others lead Texas cultural
institutions. Still others represent the immigrant influences of
France, Spain and Mexico, and the ongoing reach of Texas culture on
world artists, such as (German choreographer) Pina Bausch, whose
work reflects her visits to the state.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a fascinating proposition, but it doesn't really help us
define who is _ and who is not _ a Texan. So we asked six Central
Texans what they thought about the evolving questions of state
citizenship and cultural integrity.
</P>
<P>
   We picked the six because they represent different cultural
perspectives: native, imperial, frontier, bicultural, transient and
cosmopolitan. They are the people behind what could be seen as the
new six flags of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Native Texan
</P>
<P>
   Defined primarily by pride in the state's indigenous cultures.
</P>
<P>
   Name: Vincent Salas
</P>
<P>
   Age: 44
</P>
<P>
   Occupation: Corporate affairs director, AT&AMP;T
</P>
<P>
   What it means to be a Texan: Being born with the bragging rights
afforded to no other U.S. citizen. A Texan can passionately hold
onto the folklore of our past while reflecting the future,
remarkably connecting the two and developing a legacy. As Texas
develops its strength in high technology, for example, we don't let
loose of our reputation as cattle barons or oil magnates. Whether
you have ever been directly associated to technology, cattle or oil
is irrelevant. The fact that you are a Texan gives you instant
connection to the legacy.
</P>
<P>
   How long it takes to become a Texan: At conception, I would
think. However, I do recognize there are those Texan wannabes who
either have lived here for many years, or just long for the fame.
Many people I talk to say they consider themselves Texan for
whatever reason, but please! Then there are those who have been
made honorary Texas citizens by proxy of the governor. To me,
that's pretty official. One of the first Christmas gifts I gave my
wife many years ago was her honorary Texas citizenship papers,
signed, sealed and framed. I was so proud when she opened it. She
thought I was nuts. Now, she brags like the best of us!
</P>
<P>
   Symbol for the new Texas: I think of a heart because it
represents warmth, life, hospitality. After all, you might find
yourself living one day in Buenos Aires, but you are still a Texan
at heart. I also think of a flying tortilla _ if you can imagine it
_ transforming into a Frisbee and then into a CD-ROM or silicon
wafer. The visual to me represents our strong Hispanic roots, but
reflects our freedom to fly into the future.
</P>
<P>
   Imperial Texan
</P>
<P>
   Does the native Texan one better by exporting the state's
larger-than-life culture.
</P>
<P>
   Name: Elizabeth Lawrence Gillies
</P>
<P>
   Age: 42
</P>
<P>
   Occupation: Homemaker, rancher's daughter and volunteer
</P>
<P>
   What it means to be a Texan: I don't know how to verbalize it.
It's who I am. I took dirt from my papa's ranch all over Europe. I
was stopped at a border and the guard said ``Americano?'' I said
``No, Texan.'' (Gillies is pictured above with her father Lee R.
Lawrence on his ranch in Williamson County.)
</P>
<P>
   How long it takes to become a Texan: I've always known I'm a
Texan (sixth generation on both sides). When you realize that, you
would never, ever consider living anyplace else in the world. This
is it; you know you're a Texan.
</P>
<P>
   Symbol for the new Texas: If you could see how precious my dad
is, his face would tell you everything. He's the last of the
ranchers. Never owned a pair of shoes. He's the last of the last.
</P>
<P>
   Frontier Texan
</P>
<P>
   Newcomer who came to Texas for the freedom and the distances
from cultural capitals.
</P>
<P>
   Name: Julie Mann
</P>
<P>
   Age: 27
</P>
<P>
   Occupation: Managing director, Frontera (at) Hyde Park Theatre
</P>
<P>
   What it means to be a Texan: Having recently moved from New York
City, the concept of pride in one's locale is very familiar. So I
thought it would translate. But to the contrary, I have learned
that to be a true Texan is much deeper than the self-importance
with which many people associate Texas. It is to respect the Texan
way, its history and legends, people and politics, its
authenticity. I came to Texas because I heard Austin was
extraordinary and thriving culturally. I expected there to be a
distinct Texan type. I have met such an eclectic group of people
from all over the country and of different philosophies, many of
whom would fall in the category of true Texans.
</P>
<P>
   How long it takes to become a Texan: There's no way to pinpoint
a time. But it is not a superficial event that marks your
ascension, nothing involving withstanding the salsa or the heat.
Friends have said 10 or even 15 years, but to me, it is
immeasurable.
</P>
<P>
   Symbol for the new Texas: A sunset.
</P>
<P>
   Bicultural Texan
</P>
<P>
   Newcomer, loves the state, but wants to transform features from
a traditional culture of origin into Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Name: Amy Wong Mok
</P>
<P>
   Age: 46
</P>
<P>
   Occupation: Therapist and trainer, president of Asian American
Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   What it means to be a Texan: To me, being a Texan is foremost a
state of mind: to have the courage to be a pioneer, emboldened by
the enormous spirit of the frontier woman/man who can go it alone,
and generous in spirit to lift someone who has fallen off the wagon
train.
</P>
<P>
   How long it takes to become a Texan: As soon as one is imbued
with the Texan state of mind, there walks a Texan.
</P>
<P>
   Symbol for the new Texas: A giant silicon chip reflecting the
faces of many ethnicities and each person has a heart big enough to
place a ranch inside.
</P>
<P>
   Transient Texan
</P>
<P>
   A short-timer who will leave behind only a smattering of his or
her culture.
</P>
<P>
   Name: Tom Fulsom
</P>
<P>
   Age: 25
</P>
<P>
   Occupation: Documentary producer. Originally from Atlanta, by
way of New York, will be in Texas only a year.
</P>
<P>
   What it means to be a Texan: LBJ and variations on that.
</P>
<P>
   How long it takes to become a Texan: Until you can put on cowboy
boots without thinking it's neat that you own a pair.
</P>
<P>
   Symbol for the new Texas: California
</P>
<P>
   Cosmopolitan Texan
</P>
<P>
   Fuses a respect for native traditions with an active
appreciation for world cultures.
</P>
<P>
   Name: Russ Smith
</P>
<P>
   Age: 36
</P>
<P>
   Occupation: Executive producer for Chocolate Media and Chocolate
Records
</P>
<P>
   What it means to be a Texan: ``Texas'' comes from the Hasinai
Indian word ``tejas,'' which means friends or allies. So anyone who
holds a place in their heart for this open and loving Hasinai
spirit can be considered a Texan. But in the day-to-day bustle of
modern urban life, anyone who holds as a state of mind an
identification with the socio-psycho-economic boundaries ``allied''
with the physical borders of this 28th state adopted to the Union
and has the documentation to prove it is also a Texan.
</P>
<P>
   How long it takes to become a Texan: An instant. As spontaneous
as love itself, becoming a Texan can sneak up on you and make its
mark in an instant! But if you're born in Texas, it depends on the
length of your mother's laboring.

 &HT;    Thomas-Hill battle makes riveting movie
 &HT;    By Kevin D. Thompson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Long before Bill and Monica, there was Clarence and Anita.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, Clarence Thomas, ultra-conservative Supreme Court
justice nominee, and Anita Hill, reserved law professor, sat before
100 million enraptured viewers and engaged in the biggest _ and
most sordid _ case of he said-she said the nation had ever seen.
Hill claimed that Thomas sexually harassed her when both worked at
the Department of Education and later the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission from 1981 to 1983. Hill charged that Thomas,
among other things, talked graphically about pornography, made lewd
comments about her anatomy and bragged about his sexual prowess.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, of course, denied all accusations while claiming he was
the victim of a ``high-tech lynching for uppity blacks.'' In a
narrow 52-to-48 Senate vote _ the lowest winning margin ever for a
Supreme Court nominee _ Thomas was confirmed as the 106th justice
of the highest court in the land.
</P>
<P>
   ``Strange Justice,'' Showtime's riveting docudrama, takes us
back to one of the most controversial points in recent American
history. The movie, directed with stylish verve by Ernest Dickerson
(''Surviving the Game''), offers a fascinating behind-the-scenes
look at how Thomas' nomination spiraled out of control and led to a
series of hearings that stunned America.
</P>
<P>
   The hearings also polarized the country and were juicy fodder
for heated water-cooler discussions. Democrats squared off against
Republicans. Men argued with women and husbands debated their
wives. Who was lying? Who was telling the truth? No one knew for
sure, because both Thomas and Hill were the last two people you
expected to be at the center of a nasty sexual harassment scandal.
After all, Thomas (played by Clockers' Delroy Lindo) was a courtly
man whom friends and aides said always treated women with courtesy
and respect. Meanwhile, Hill (''I'll Fly Away'''s Regina Taylor)
was soft-spoken with strong spiritual beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   The film, based on the book by Wall Street Journal reporters
Jane Mayer and Jill Abramson, does not take sides _ and that's
wise. Since only Thomas and Hill know what really happened, the
producers didn't want to be viewed as favoring one version over the
other.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't want to be accused of imposing our Hollywood liberal
point of view where everyone would have expected us to come down
and make a movie that was out to vindicate Anita Hill,'' notes
Jerry Offsay, Showtime's programming president.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was never our goal to do a piece that pointed fingers at
either camp,'' adds Jacob Epstein (''L.A. Law,'' ``Sliders''), who
wrote the screenplay and executivced the movie. ``Our goal
was to talk about the process and the machine.''
</P>
<P>
   The film does an exceptional job of that. While both Lindo and
Taylor shine as the embattled witnesses, much of ``Strange
Justice'' belongs to Mandy Patinkin (''Chicago Hope''), who plays
master media lobbyist Ken Duberstein. It is Duberstein who is asked
by President Bush to get Thomas confirmed _ at all costs.
</P>
<P>
   So we see the fiery Washington insider grilling Thomas in dark
conference rooms, sleek limos and pricey restaurants. It's clear
Thomas' handlers mercilessly coached him on what to say and how to
think. Democratic kingmaker Vernon Jordan (a scene-stealing Lou
Gossett Jr.) is shown sarcastically hinting that Thomas needs to
learn how to be black. When Duberstein informs Thomas there's a
rumor going around that he beat his ex-wife, the mud-slinging
tactics leave Thomas dumbfounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you getting a sense of how the game is played?''
Duberstein tells Thomas. ``A lie goes halfway around the world
before the truth can get its boots on.''
</P>
<P>
   Patinkin says playing a well-connected spinmaster and learning
how the unforgiving Washington political machine works fascinated
him. ``The larger issue in this movie is how the truth is
manipulated and packaged, and how it's delivered through the media,
spin doctors and political figures,'' Patinkin says.
</P>
<P>
   Adds director Dickerson: ``I was joking with Jacob (Epstein) and
saying that if we didn't call this ``Strange Justice,'' we could've
called it ``Your Government At Work,'' because that's what it's
really about.''
</P>
<P>
   Dickerson wisely didn't make a C-SPAN-like film. His visually
arresting style _ ``Homicide''-like camera cuts, muted colors and
shadowy figures juxtaposed against bright lighting _ gives
``Strange Justice'' much of its heart and edge. And instead of
rehashing the hearings in documentary-style detail (though there is
some of that), Dickerson chose to have Lindo rip off his shirt and
use his tie as a noose during Thomas' famous high-tech lynching
speech. Taylor looks downright possessed while testifying about
Thomas' alleged pubic hair on the Coke comment.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor says she sympathized with her character.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always had a great affinity for Anita,'' says Taylor. ``I
wanted to do her justice, and I took great pains to show her as a
human being. She had an overriding intelligence and grace and
dignity.''
</P>
<P>
   Lindo believes both Thomas and Hill were put in unfortunate
situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were both victimized in that they were forced to resolve
this issue in a public forum.'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, eight years later, we are (ITAL)still(END ITAL) no closer
to learning who was lying, and who was telling the truth.

 &HT;    Texas could have _ should have _ won game
 &HT;    By Kirk Bohls
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ If blocked punts were the story of the game _
and they most certainly were _ it was only fitting that the central
character in this plot line proved to be a fellow named Leak.
</P>
<P>
   By position, Eric Leak is listed as a running back on the North
Carolina State roster, although the depth chart doesn't include him
among its top five ball-carriers. Pay no attention to that chart.
</P>
<P>
   No Wolfpack player carried any better than the 5-foot-8-inch,
188-pound junior, who blocked a punt for a safety and returned
another blocked punt 35 yards for the game-winning touchdown to
stain 17th-ranked Texas with a 23-20 loss in both teams'
season-opener.
</P>
<P>
   What amounted to almost 82,582 members of the Mack Brown Fan
Club at Royal-Memorial Stadium _ give or take the 1,500 North
Carolina State ticket-buyers _ probably left in a daze, perplexed
over just how their favorite team lost Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina State's faithful would certainly offer viewpoints
to the contrary, but the nagging suspicion here is that the best
team did not win. Hopefully, that will be settled in the months to
come. The most opportunistic one definitely did, by virtue of three
blocked punts that led to 16 Wolfpack points.
</P>
<P>
   Texas easily could be taking a 1-0 record into this week's
Stanford game, had it minimized some major mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   Three obvious ones were a costly unsportsmanlike conduct penalty
against senior defensive end Aaron Humphrey, which prolonged a NC
State drive that resulted in a touchdown; and a pair of
fourth-and-1 calls that had Major Applewhite going nowhere on two
lame quarterback sneaks that cost Texas scoring chances. Something
tells me the Longhorns never missed a certain guy in dreadlocks
quite as much as on those two downs.
</P>
<P>
   As always it's the little things that add up to victory or
defeat, but it's rare that the focal point of a game involves the
deep snapper three times. That's not to assign all the blame to
centers Marcel Blanchard and Hunter McWilliams for poor snaps,
because North Carolina State's punt rush was relentless and found
few obstacles in their paths.
</P>
<P>
   Before those of burnt-orange persuasion begin looking for high
ledges, be reminded that Texas suffered embarrassments of grander
proportion just a year ago against UCLA and Kansas State before
rebounding to finish in fine style. There is no guarantee that
similar good fortune will repeat itself in 1999, but the Longhorns
showed enough mettle to preclude any premature panic.
</P>
<P>
   While the defeat against a supposedly inferior opponent will
assure Brown that he cannot expect another raise for a month or so,
the second-year messiah's team revealed a defense that improved
mightily against a passing team of some repute; capable receivers
in Kwame Cavil, Ryan Nunez and Montrell Flowers; and a secondary,
paced by Ahmad Brooks, that was up to the task of taking away what
an opponent does best.
</P>
<P>
   All was not balloons and confetti, however. The early run
defense smacked of previous nightmares induced by Rashaan Salaam
and Curtis Martin, although NC State curiously shut down the run of
its volition long before Texas managed to. Following a first
quarter in which the Pack sprinted through the Longhorn defense for
90 yards on the ground, NC State Coach Mike O'Cain had his offense
run the ball only four times on the next 16 plays.
</P>
<P>
   Texas also demonstrated a peculiar philosophy at times,
eschewing the deep ball. Few of the attempts were longer than 5
yards, aside from a nifty 24-yard throw to Kwame Cavil in the
fourth quarter. The passes were too short, but they at least were
longer than most of the Longhorns' punts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take responsibility for the loss,'' Brown said in a
refreshing admission from previous coaches, ``and I take
responsibility for the fourth-and-shorts that we didn't make. But
you can look at the numbers and think of 90,000 positive things and
think there's no way we could possibly have lost the game.''
</P>
<P>
   One of those 90,000 was the performance of tailback Victor Ike.
The talented redshirt freshman scored on an 80-yard
catch-and-run-and-juke play and outplayed senior Hodges Mitchell,
whose play could best be described as spotty and whose punt returns
were altogether inexplicable.
</P>
<P>
   But they were better than the punts, which pretty much explains
the general funk Austin will be in for at least six days.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you lose,'' Applewhite said, ``it stinks.''

 &HT;    NCSU shocks football world in win against Texas Longhorns 23-20
 &HT;    By Mark Wangrin
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Ryan Long averaged 44.0 yards a punt for Texas
on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   On the ones that went forward.
</P>
<P>
   But the North Carolina State Wolfpack, who managed only 172
yards total offense _ only 23 in the second half _ got to three
punts only a nanosecond after Long's foot did. They scored
touchdowns on two of the blocks and a safety on the other, more
than enough to offset a decent performance by a rebuilding Texas
offense and stellar effort by a Texas defense, save for some early
game problems against the run.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I want to be optimistic, I can look at stat sheet and find
90,000 positive things that say we win this game,'' Coach Mack
Brown said after his Longhorns' 23-20 loss to North Carolina State.
``But we couldn't get three punts off, and that lost us the game.''
</P>
<P>
   No. 17 Texas blew a 10-0 first-quarter lead, ending a seven-game
win streak and a seven-year streak of opening-game wins. Brown, who
had won eight of his last nine openers, lost to N.C. State Coach
Mike O'Cain for the first time in six tries.
</P>
<P>
   After Terrence Holt, the younger brother of former Wolfpack
All-American Torry Holt, blocked his second punt and Eric Leak ran
it in 35 yards for a touchdown with 3 minutes, 22 seconds left in
the game to give N.C. State its first lead, the Longhorns failed on
two possessions. The first ended when quarterback Major Applewhite
was stopped cold on fourth-and-1 at the N.C. State 44 with 1:49
left, and the second concluded with Lloyd Harrison's interception
of a desperation Applewhite heave at the final gun.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew special teams were going to play a big part and they
did,'' said Wolfpack quarterback Jamie Barnette.
</P>
<P>
   Though redshirt freshman Victor Ike showed flashes of productive
inside running, the Longhorns were unable to dominate on the
ground. Ike led all Longhorn rushers with 48 yards on 12 carries,
but the Horns managed only 56 yards rushing against a team that
ranked in the bottom quarter of NCAA Division I-A teams in rush
defense last season.
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't the only way Texas missed Ricky Williams, the major
college all-time leading rusher and Heisman Trophy winner.
Applewhite came up short on fourth-and-1 quarterback sneaks, the
first early in the second quarter at the Wolfpack 15 with Texas
leading 10-7.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was disappointed twice that we couldn't make fourth
down-and-six inches twice,'' Brown said. ``Especially the last one.
We needed to go in and get the points.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnette, a second-team all-Atlantic Coast Conference pick last
fall as a junior, was not a factor, completing only nine of 26
attempts for a career-low 65 yards and no touchdowns. He wasn't
able to hurt Texas with his running.
</P>
<P>
   The big test was supposed to be for the Longhorns' secondary and
it was, though it had less to do with their coverage skills and
more with their ability to tackle running backs rampaging through
the line untouched. Texas' blitzing kept Barnette from having any
time to pass, but it allowed the Wolfpack backs to crease the line
and gain an average of 19.6 yards on their first five running
plays.
</P>
<P>
   If not for two Wolfpack fumbles in their first four offensive
plays, both of which Texas recovered inside the N.C. State
40-yard-line, the first half might have gone much differently. But
the Longhorns turned the first into a six-play, 35-yard drive that
culminated with a 2-yard touchdown run by Applewhite on a naked
bootleg. The second ended with a 48-yard field goal by Kris
Stockton and Texas led 10-0 with 7 minutes, 42 seconds left in the
first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   A cruicial mistake by Texas defensive end Aaron Humphrey, who
drew a personal foul for pushing offensive lineman Todd Boyle after
Barnette had thrown incomplete on third-and-8 at the Texas 40, set
up the Wolfpack's first score. Ray Robinson ran 25 yards off right
guard for a TD on the next play.
</P>
<P>
   Texas had gone into the game hoping to block a punt, but the
Wolfpack's Eric Leak slipped through the left side of the Longhorn
punt protection and blocked Long's first punt. Leak tried to pick
up the ball at the 4, but was unable to corral the ball until it
had slid out the back of the end zone for a safety. That cut the
Texas lead to 10-9, but Ike took a short pass in the right flat,
cut to the sideline and raced downfield, juking Brian Williams at
the N.C. State 45 and taking the ball 80 yards for a score and a
17-9 Texas lead.
</P>
<P>
   Neither team could move the ball consistently in the second
half. Texas managed only 144 yards offense and turned the ball over
twice. N.C. State was even less effective, gaining only 23 yards
and turning the ball over three times.

 &HT;    Kicking game suspect well before Longhorn's loss to NCSU
 &HT;    By Suzanne Halliburton
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The first warning that the punting game for the
University of Texas wasn't going to be a team strength came two
weeks ago in the Longhorns' first intrasquad scrimmage of the
preseason.
</P>
<P>
   On that evening in mid-August, UT Coach Mack Brown wore a
concerned look on his face. He didn't know whether to see the glass
as half full or half empty. After all, his team had blocked two
punts. But then again the same team had also allowed two blocked
kicks.
</P>
<P>
   In a 23-20 loss Saturday night to North Carolina State, Brown
saw where the problems were.
</P>
<P>
   His punt coverage team allowed a shocking three blocked punts,
leading to 16 Wolfpack points, and were the most obvious reason why
the Longhorns, despite being a nine-point favorite, suffered a
devastating home loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our punting game killed us,'' Brown said. ``You can't have
three blocked punts and give up 16 points and expect to win the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't hard to determine that North Carolina State's blocked
punts were a single-game UT record. Until Saturday, there had only
been two seasons (1943 and 1946) that the Longhorns had even
allowed three blocked punts for the entire year.
</P>
<P>
   The last time an opponent returned a blocked punt for a
touchdown came against Rice in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The first block Saturday came with 5 minutes and 51 seconds
remaining in the first half, when Eric Leak burst through the
middle of the Longhorn line and swatted the ball toward the
Longhorn end zone. But no player from North Carolina State could
control the football until it rolled out of the end zone, giving
the Wolfpack a safety and cutting UT's lead to 10-9.
</P>
<P>
   The next two blocks came in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Given the play of the Longhorn defense, UT looked to have a
commanding 17-9 lead. North Carolina State safety Terrence Holt,
younger brother of former Wolfpack standout Torry Holt, blocked the
punt, which was picked up by Tony Scott and returned for a
touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   The snap of Marcel Blanchard was a low one, and Ryan Long didn't
have time to get off the kick.
</P>
<P>
   Brown changed deep snappers a series later, determining that
Blanchard was too winded to play both offense and special teams.
Walk-on freshman Hunter McWilliams was in on the final punt, which
was blocked with 3:22 remaining in the game.
</P>
<P>
   On the play, Holt blocked the kick, which was picked up by Leak,
who high-jumped the last remaining Longhorn into the end zone. The
block put the Wolfpack up 21-20, and the ensuing two-point
conversion gave N.C. State the final margin.

 &HT;    Forget ''Sex and The City,'' How About ``Sistergirl and The
City?''
 &HT;    (EDS: Moving in (K) commentary and (L) lifestyle categories.)
 &HT;    By Susan E. Smith
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Since I've been in Washington, I occasionally watch
HBO's popular series ``Sex And The City,'' the racy exploits of a
quartet of cosmopolitan single women who live in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe my interest in the show has grown because now, I, too, am
a single urban woman. In between deadlines, I've pondered the
reality of romantic love, while riding the Metro, where men come
and go as fast as the underground trains. But my urban exploits
rate a wholesome G compared to the R-rated activities of the show's
characters.
</P>
<P>
   After several weeks of watching the Emmy-nominated series and my
own urban experiences, I see the potential for a competing Showtime
series, ``Sistergirl in The City.'' And who better to star in it
than the feline and intelligent Angela Bassett?
</P>
<P>
   Washington, more associated with illicit sex than romantic love,
could nonetheless provide a charming urban backdrop for a witty
take on the search for romance.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from location and minimal adult content, my show would
diverge from the HBO series in a couple of ways. Unlike Sex's stars
who hail cabs, our D.C. heroine would ride public transportation.
That would provide a new twist on romance because the Metro is not
an easy place to meet a love interest, as a recent opinion piece in
the Washington Post observed.
</P>
<P>
   One would think otherwise. Afterall, headed to and from work
every day you're packed into a train tighter than tuna in an
air-locked can. Elbows rub elbows. And hands touch hands as you
clutch the rails for standing passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet you could be cheek to jowl with Mr. Right and never know it.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow the loss of our ``personal space,'' the three-foot
boundary that is territorial etiquette, doesn't result in intimate
encounters. It's risky business to look at someone, let alone
flirt, on a train full of strangers. Most Metro riders adopt the
urban stare, a blank staight-ahead look at nothing in particular.
It's not unlike the stare of cows.
</P>
<P>
   If you are bold enough to flirt, you have to do it quickly
before your stop or his stop comes up. Most often, you and your
potential Mr. Right, or ``Mr. Big,'' are like two ships passing in
the night. The rich Big, the male love interest on ``Sex And The
City,'' wouldn't be caught dead on the New York City subway. Big ,
like the women on the show, always takes a cab.
</P>
<P>
   Crafting a Metro romance could prove difficult for
``Sistergirls''' writers. But the soundtrack is another matter.
</P>
<P>
   The barefoot trumpet player outside of Union Station who plays
for tourists' tips could be the show's musical director and perform
live each week.
</P>
<P>
   Strolling to the Union Station Metro one Friday as the trumpet
player blared ``It Had To Be You,'' I imagined my soulmate suddenly
appearing from the urban mass of humanity and dancing toward me on
a shiny sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   As the trumpet tune coaxed long dormant romantic thoughts from
deep within me, I looked around for HIM, who would whisk me to the
train bound for a candlelit dinner-for-two. To my dismay, I saw
only the dirty feet of the barefoot trumpet player. And I swore I
heard some unprincely guy grunt a crude remark.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, well.
</P>
<P>
   Urban romance, as the women of ``Sex And The City'' discover
each week, is elusive, like the mobile men of the Metro. Still, I
remain a sucker for the waning concept of romantic love. With the
winsome Bassett as the central character of my show, the crowds on
the train would part as eager young men dance toward her. And
Washington would be as romantic as April in Paris.

them particularly vulnerable to heat stroke and death, a fact

   BISCAYNE _ MIAMI _ For 50 years, it was Miami's gateway: a broad
boulevard lined with neon, palms and Mom-and-Pop motels that
welcomed visitors to sun-splashed Miami. Then came the freeway.
When Interstate 95 opened in the 1960s, visitors whisked into town
at 60 mph, 20-feet up in the air. As in so many American cities,
the elevated highway overnight changed the look and feel of Miami.
Biscayne Boulevard, long the city's proud route of entry, began a
30-year decline. Cozy motels once packed with family station wagons
became crack dens and flop houses. Customers disappeared from shops
and restaurants, while block-long stretches fell into urban decay,
with boarded-up buildings marred by graffiti. Hookers became more
prevalent than tourists. As recently as last winter, it was on
Biscayne that cops running a prostitution sting snared an Atlanta
Falcons player the night before the Super Bowl. Now, however,
almost miraculously, Biscayne Boulevard is making a comeback.

   TOWN-DIVIDED _ BYBEE, Tenn. _ James Ellison recently leased land

Ellison was stunned by his neighbors' angry response. Two weeks
ago, residents staged a march against the facility. A few days
later, Ellison began receiving threatening letters and harassing
phone calls. Then, on July 24, his hay barn was set on fire. The
FBI is investigating. Some locals say it's unfair that immigrant
children would be given education privileges their own kids don't
have and speculation is rampant that Ellison may have burned his
own barn to make the town look bad. A look at the divided town.

may have violated open meeting requirements. Hooker's tenure in El
Paso was marked with controversy and poor performance reviews and
nearly everyone she's run across in recent years describes her as
antagonistic. Hooker also was the subject of two complaints filed
with the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and a
lawsuit in state district court against the city. All were filed by
the highest-ranking Hispanic administrator in the El Paso system,
who has accused Hooker, who is white, of discrimination. Hooker at
one point accused the woman of pushing her down some stairs (while
on extended medical leave from that, she sought the Fulton job).

   TEXAS-LOTTO _ AUSTIN, Texas _ Searching for a way to prop up
Lotto Texas sales, the state lottery commission gave preliminary
approval Saturday for a new game under an old name. Under the
proposed change, lotto players would continue to pick six numbers,
but the range would run from 1 to 54 after four numbers are added
to the mix. That would drive the odds of matching six numbers from
one in 15.8 million to one in 25.8 million, creating fewer winners
so larger jackpots can accumulate. Larger prizes typically inspire
more people to play the game. (McCarthy, Austin American-Statesman)

   BEIJING _ The unassuming old Chinese cobbler who works on a
narrow city alley suddenly realized he risked getting locked up. So
he took the logical step and stopped doing his daily meditational
exercises.
</P>
<P>
   And he makes sure everyone knows it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to practice Falun Gong, but now I know it's not good,''
he announced out of the blue to a foreigner who stopped to chat.
``It was a good thing the government explained this.''
</P>
<P>
   The government has not merely ``explained'' the evils of Falun
Gong to average Chinese like Liu Donghua, the 73-year-old who
quietly tends to broken shoes and zippers from his tiny alleyside
chair.
</P>
<P>
   It outlawed the popular regime of meditation and exercise, and
has blanketed this nation of 1.2 billion people with an unrelenting
propaganda barrage that even government supporters describe as
overkill.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of Chinese followers of Falun Gong were detained at
least briefly, and thousands more like Liu now have renounced the
sect and its charismatic founder Li Hongzhi, who lives in exile in
New York. In coming weeks the movement's core leaders are expected
to be charged here and tried for crimes related to undermining
social order.
</P>
<P>
   Why this attack-dog response to a spiritual, mental and physical
regimen that draws on respected, centuries-old Chinese traditions
such as Buddhism and Taoism? Or is Falun Gong really something more
insidious?
</P>
<P>
   Beijing's communist power elite knows its country's history.
Such moralistic or quasi-religious movements undermined past
Chinese regimes, from the Donglin Society in the 1600s to the
Taiping uprising against the Qing rulers in the 1850s, as Chinese
unhappy with their lives became mesmerized by teachers promising to
show a better way.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the wake-up call jolted Beijing on April 25, when
10,000 Falun Gong members suddenly showed up at the capital,
quietly ringed the seat of government at Zhongnanhai compound and
protested their failure to win official recognition.
</P>
<P>
   The top leadership soon discovered that Falun Gong encompassed
not just cobblers, but military officers, educated professionals
and even Communist Party members. The group had set up 39 teaching
centers, 1,900 places of instruction and more than 28,000 group
exercise venues. It had also published books and produced videos,
and kept it all connected with high tech communications via
Internet, phone and fax.
</P>
<P>
   It was organized, and to an autocratic Communist regime that
does not countenance any other independent organizations, that
meant it was dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   On July 22, Falun Gong was banned.
</P>
<P>
   A month-long drumbeat of government-sponsored propaganda against
the group has included daily articles in newspapers and
testimonials televised day and night from Chinese telling how their
lives or their loved ones were ruined by the practice of Falun
Gong. The tragedies included suicides and deaths from refusing
medical treatment, supposedly under Falun Gong influence.
</P>
<P>
   The promise last week(CQ) to prosecute key organizers carried a
pledge to go lightly with those who see their error and give up the
practice. But it also drove another wedge in relations with
America.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not believe people should be persecuted or prosecuted
simply for peaceful assembly or for exercising their religious
beliefs or practices, as long as they are not harming anybody,''
said U.S. State Department spokesman James Foley.
</P>
<P>
   China gave its normal response: keep out of our internal
affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Falun Gong is an anti-scientific, anti-human, anti-social,
anti-government and illegal organization with all the
characteristics of an evil religion,'' a Foreign Ministry spokesman
added.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese government claims that Falun Gong has wreaked both
personal physical harm and broader societal damage are countered by
the group's response that it promotes a simple, take-it-or-leave-it
philosophy for better living.
</P>
<P>
   Li Hongzhi, 48, only devised the movement in 1992 as another
sibling in the Qi Gong (pronounced, ``Chi Gong'') family of
meditational exercise and martial arts. In America, the best-known
is Tai Chi.
</P>
<P>
   Until he started studying Qi Gong, Li was known for nothing
remarkable; playing the trumpet at a military stud farm while he
was a conscript in the People's Liberation Army and later working
in security at an agricultural enterprise in eastern China.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Li managed to attract as many as 70 million Chinese
adherents to his five meditational exercises, four done standing
and one seated. Slow-motion arm movements combined with clearing
the mind are said to relax and free the practitioner from stress.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps in this time of change and uncertainty, some argue, the
greater attraction was his moral dictum to cultivate zhen-shan-ren
_ or truthfulness, compassion and forbearance _ while eschewing
unhealthy habits like cigarettes and alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   However, the government's claims of anti-scientific teachings
have some basis in Falun Gong literature, all of which has been
banned.
</P>
<P>
   The group's Web site speaks to the ``supernormal capabilities''
of Li and other masters of meditation, such as ``penetrative'' and
``remote'' sight permitting them to see through objects and miles
distant. It suggests they can ``remove the evil spirit and pull out
the root of the disease'' from a person who is ill.
</P>
<P>
   Although Falun Gong defenders say they never propose
``disturbing the normal state of human society'' by using these
supernatural powers on a wide scale, the message certainly could be
bent in the mind of a mentally challenged or physically sick person
seeking comfort.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever Falun Gong has preached, and whatever average Chinese
truly think about it today, the government hit a societal nerve
when charging the movement incited disturbances and fostered
instability.
</P>
<P>
   Liu the cobbler, who had practiced Falun Gong for nearly two
years and said he is in great physical shape, nonetheless seemed to
have dropped it effortlessly. The explanation may lie in another
comment he made, when asked to cite the best change in China in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Social stability,'' he said. ``It's improved peoples' lives in
every way.''

`DENMARK VESEY': COMPELLING HISTORY OF MAN BEHIND SLAVE REBELLION
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Publication notes are at end of review.) 
(jw) 
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``No one thought to describe his face,'' is the first line of
``Denmark Vesey,'' David Robertson's interpretive history of one of
the most famous of the failed slave rebellions to take place in the
American South. It is an important point.
</P>
<P>
   The absence of any physical descriptions or paintings of Denmark
Vesey, the ``terrible and haughty urban black revolutionary'' who
led the aborted rebellion, is symbolic of the enforced facelessness
of slavery itself.
</P>
<P>
   The burden of Robertson's readable book is to restore the
missing features, not by surrounding them with a halo but by
putting them in their historical reality.
</P>
<P>
   Vesey, as Robertson puts it, ``organized the most elaborate and
well-planned slave insurrection in the history of the United
States.'' Had he succeeded _ and Robertson makes a persuasive case
that he almost did _ he would have wiped out the entire white
population of Charleston, S.C., which was at the time the third
biggest American city. Robertson does not speculate on how
subsequent American history would have been different if Vesey's
1822 plot had not been discovered and suppressed, but surely it
would have been very different; Robertson's book reminds us of that
interesting fact.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the strongest chapters in this slender volume are the
early ones in which he provides some historical background both of
South Carolina and of Vesey himself. The point here is to
demonstrate that slavery was not just a peculiar institution but a
diverse and historically complicated one as well.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina was the only state in the country to have a black
majority. In 1820 Charleston, which had 57,221 slaves and 19,376
whites, was, as Robertson puts it, ``demographically and literally
an African-American community during Denmark Vesey's early
adulthood.'' Vesey, too, who was literate and worldly and who spoke
French as well as English, was a ``historically distinct
individual'' in a historically distinct American community ruled
over by a small white minority whose greatest fear was of a slave
rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   Vesey in this sense emerges from these pages, as do some of his
chief collaborators, as an unusual figure, not just in the power of
his character but in his background as well. Most likely he was
born in the Caribbean. He arrived in the United States in 1781
aboard a ship commanded by a certain Joseph Vesey, a Bermuda-born
ship's captain and slave trader who frequented the slave markets of
Barbados and St. Domingue, the French possession that later became
the Republic of Haiti. Denmark Vesey was 14 at the time; his name
was given as Telemaque. Captain Vesey sold him to a plantation
owner in Charleston who put him to the hard labor of chopping sugar
cane.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence is that the boy faked a case of epilepsy, which
forced Vesey to buy him back from his owner. He gave him a new
name, Denmark Vesey _ Denmark because, presumably, he had
originally been bought in the Danish Virgin Islands _ and for two
years he made him into a kind of interpreter-assistant as he went
about his slave-trading business. When Joseph Vesey retired from
seafaring and settled permanently in Charleston, Denmark Vesey
served him as a slave for 17 years; then, in an extraordinary twist
of fortune, he won $1,500 in the East Bay Street Lottery, bought
his freedom and set himself up in business as a carpenter.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson stitches together a fascinating narrative out of the
strands of information available on Denmark Vesey, much of which
comes from the record of his trial in 1822 after the failure of his
insurrection and from the testimony given by slaves made to testify
against him.
</P>
<P>
   The insurrection itself was a large-scale conspiracy that was
able to unite several very distinct slave and freedmen groups under
a single banner. These included Muslims as well as the parishioners
of the African Methodist Church in Charleston. There were
French-speaking slaves who had been brought to Charleston by their
owners after the successful slave rebellion in Haiti in 1791; there
were African-born slaves from Angola as well as the speakers of
Gullah, an amalgam of English and African languages used in the
coastal areas of South Carolina and Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every principle which could operate upon the mind of man was
artfully employed'' in winning recruits for the rebellion, Vesey's
Charleston judges later wrote. ``Religion, hope, fear, and
deception were resorted to as the occasion required.'' Robertson
does not disagree with that assessment. The rebellion was betrayed
from within the slaves' ranks only a few days before Vesey's
impressive military plans were to have been put into operation. Had
it not been betrayed, Robertson leaves no doubt that Vesey would
have ordered the slaughter not just of the white men of Charleston
but the white women and children as well. Only the sea captains,
needed to take the rebels to Haiti or to Africa, would have been
spared.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was undeniably a man capable of compassion, and at times he
employed, along with other blacks, the vocabulary of the Christian
faith,'' Robertson writes of Vesey. ``Yet he can also be seen as a
precursor of the terrible practitioners of 20th-century genocide.''
</P>
<P>
   Robertson ends his book with a brisk analysis of Vesey's role as
archetype, placing him in the context of other historical black
American archetypes, from Marcus Garvey to Malcolm X to the Rev.
Martin Luther King Jr. One can quibble with some of Robertson's
assessments here, which take on a portentous quality and are not
discussed in enough detail to give the arguments full substance.
</P>
<P>
   But Robertson does make the case that in important ways Vesey,
while radically different from King, foreshadowed figures like
Garvey and Malcolm, whose solution was separatist and radical,
especially in its threats of race war or the dream of a return to
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   In other words Vesey belongs in the broad pantheon of historic
black figures of American history. That is where Robertson has
placed him in this short but compelling book.

   HAZING _ The results of the nation's first comprehensive survey
of hazing in college sports will be released at 9:30 a.m. EDT today
at a news conference at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C.
The survey results are based upon a random sampling of 3,000 NCAA
coaches and 10,000 NCAA athletes from 224 colleges and universities
in the United States. (Dayton Daily News staff)

   FBC-OHIOSTATE-MIAMI _ EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Game story.
(Dayton Daily News)
</P>
<P>
   FBC-TEXAS-NCSU-WRAPUP _ AUSTIN, Texas _ Ryan Long averaged 44.0
yards a punt for Texas on Saturday night. On the ones that went
forward. But the North Carolina State Wolfpack, who managed only
172 yards total offense _ only 23 in the second half _ got to three
punts only a nanosecond after Long's foot did. They scored
touchdowns on two of the blocks and a safety on the other, more
than enough to offset a decent performance by a rebuilding Texas
offense and stellar effort by a Texas defense, save for some early
game problems against the run. ``If I want to be optimistic, I can
look at stat sheet and find 90,000 positive things that say we win
this game,'' Coach Mack Brown said after his Longhorns' 23-20 loss
to North Carolina State. ``But we couldn't get three punts off, and
that lost us the game.'' (Wangrin, Austin American-Statesman)
MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   FBC-TEXAS-SPECIALTEAMS _ AUSTIN, Texas _ The first warning that
the punting game for the University of Texas wasn't going to be a
team strength came two weeks ago in the Longhorns' first intrasquad
scrimmage of the preseason. On that evening in mid-August, UT Coach
Mack Brown wore a concerned look on his face. He didn't know
whether to see the glass as half full or half empty. After all, his
team had blocked two punts. But then again the same team had also
allowed two blocked kicks. In a 23-20 loss Saturday night to North
Carolina State, Brown saw where the problems were. (Halliburton,
Austin American-Statesman) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   FBC-TEXAS-BOHLSCOLUMN _ AUSTIN, Texas _ If blocked punts were
the story of the game _ and they most certainly were _ it was only
fitting that the central character in this plot line proved to be a
fellow named Leak. By position, Eric Leak is listed as a running
back on the North Carolina State roster, although the depth chart
doesn't include him among its top five ball-carriers. Pay no
attention to that chart. No Wolfpack player carried any better than
the 5-foot-8-inch, 188-pound junior, who blocked a punt for a
safety and returned another blocked punt 35 yards for the
game-winning touchdown to stain 17th-ranked Texas with a 23-20 loss
in both teams' season-opener. Texas easily could be taking a 1-0
record into this week's Stanford game, had it minimized some major
mistakes. (Bohls, Cox News Service) MOVED.

IN BRAZIL, 3 NEWS WEEKLIES BATTLE FOR UPSCALE READERS

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil _ It boasts of having the largest circulation
of any weekly news magazine outside the United States and is the
flagship of Latin America's biggest publishing group. Yet Veja
magazine finds itself involved in a full-blown circulation war,
forced to fend off not one but two rivals intent on breaching its
seemingly impregnable dominance of the huge Brazilian market.
</P>
<P>
   More than just bragging rights are at stake: Advertisers spend
more than $2 billion annually in Brazilian newspapers and
magazines, and no consumers are more coveted here than the affluent
readers of news magazines. And despite a lingering recession that
included a 40 percent currency devaluation in January, overall
circulations among news weeklies are rising as disposable incomes
have grown and the illiteracy rate has been cut nearly in half
since 1980, falling to less than 18 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts see a market with plenty of growth ahead. And while
Veja (pronounced VAY-zha) is dealing from a position of strength,
it cannot discount the competitive might of its challengers _
particularly Epoca, which was introduced in May 1998 and is being
financed by the Editora Globo conglomerate, the owner of Brazil's
leading television network and Rio de Janeiro's biggest newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   The third protagonist is IstoE, which was founded in 1976 and is
published by a company called Editora Tres. But contrary to the
many predictions that the entry of Epoca into the market would take
readers away from the two established news magazines, all three
appear to be benefiting from the public interest that the
competitive frenzy has generated. Total news magazine circulation
is up by some 20 percent, to 1.75 million copies a week, since
Epoca hit the newsstands last year.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Veja (a word whose popular usage translates to ``look'')
is clearly dealing from a position of strength. Founded in 1968, it
is the flagship of Editora Abril, which publishes nearly 200 other
magazines, eight of which rank among the 10 most widely sold titles
in this nation of 165 million people, and has weathered a military
dictatorship, six different currencies and bouts of inflation as
high as 2,500 percent a year to build a circulation that in its
best weeks exceeds 1.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``The competition is fierce, but there is a big market out there
and Veja still sells twice as much as our competitors combined,''
Roberto Civita, chairman and chief executive of the publishing
group, said in an interview at the company's headquarters here.
``If you are the No. 1 player in a market like this,'' he added,
``you should look where you are going and not worry about the other
guy gaining on you.''
</P>
<P>
   Epoca's executives sound equally sanguine. ``The potential of
the market in Brazil has barely been tapped,'' said Aluizio
Maranhao, deputy editor of Epoca (which means epoch). ``The United
States and Europe are mature markets, but the circulation of
magazines in Brazil is still at a low level. And if inflation and
the illiteracy rate continue to drop, there are great prospects for
the growth of the media in general.''
</P>
<P>
   With an eye on that growing pie, the magazines are engaged in an
old-fashioned, bare-knuckles battle, the likes of which have rarely
been seen in publishing circles here.
</P>
<P>
   Domingo Alzugaray, publisher and editor of IstoE (Portuguese for
i.e. or ``that is'') said that Globo had first tried to buy his
magazine rather than start its own. But when negotiations broke
down, he said, an executive from the rival company warned him
``you'd better get ready, because we are going to roll over you
with a bulldozer.''
</P>
<P>
   Marcos Dvoskin, publisher of Epoca, confirmed that talks had
taken place but added that since he did not take part in them, he
could not comment about any threats to Alzugaray's magazine. He did
make clear, though, that Epoca's immediate goal was to pass IstoE
and then challenge Veja head on. Lately, Epoca and IstoE have had
average weekly circulations between 300,000 and 325,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our objective is to become second as quickly as possible,''
Dvoskin said. ``Then, after we are turning a nice profit, we will
fight to be first.'' For readers, the competition has been a boon,
with Epoca offering various sorts of discounts _ its cover price is
3.50 reais (about $1.85), compared with 4 reais ($2.10) for both
Veja and IstoE. And all three magazines are fighting to get to
newsstands on Saturday night instead of on Monday, as is the custom
in most other countries. ``That's part of the reason for our
success,'' Civita said. ``We scoop the Sunday papers all the
time.''
</P>
<P>
   But each of the magazines has a strikingly different format,
meaning that, as Civita noted, ``the overlap in readership is very
small.'' Epoca features shorter stories and more graphics than its
rivals.
</P>
<P>
   IstoE, on the other hand, has cultivated a reputation for being
both cheeky and nationalistic since its founding 23 years ago by a
group of reporters and editors who had begun at Abril. ``During the
dictatorship, we were more negative and left wing,'' Alzugaray
acknowledged, referring to the right-wing military regime that
lasted from 1964 to 1985. ``But we have changed that. Today we are
a magazine that believes in Brazil.''
</P>
<P>
   Veja, which aims for comprehensive and aggressive coverage of
national and international events, has a bigger staff and glossier
look than its rivals, and those factors have translated into a
significant advertising edge. It charges $40,000 for a full-page
color ad, and one recent issue had 80 ad pages, compared with 52
for IstoE, which charges $19,000 for a full-page color ad, and 26
pages for Epoca, which charges $16,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I have a client who is going to chose only one magazine in
which to advertise, that magazine is going to be Veja,'' said Mauro
Salles, director of the Salles/DMB&AMP;B ad agency here. ``It is only
if you have money for a second that you see a fight between IstoE
and Epoca.''
</P>
<P>
   The Brazilian Congress is considering legislation that would
allow foreign companies to take a 30 percent stake in media
enterprises here. Civita of Abril said that foreign media companies
interested in establishing a presence in Brazil once the new law is
passed ``have all already come down and are looking around and
positioning themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Stock and media analysts here say that IstoE, lacking the
treasure chests of its two competitors, is the most likely
candidate for some sort of partnership.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember that when IstoE started, there was a lot of talk
about whether there was space for a second magazine,'' Salles said.
``Now the question is whether there is room for three. But these
people are all professionals, so this is a competition that doesn't
necessarily have to produce a victim.'' &QL;

IN VENICE, ART TRANSACTIONS MASK THEFT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Italy, Britain, Germany)  (mk) 
 By ALAN RIDING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ In hindsight, Helmut Rumbler concedes that his defenses
were down when he flew to Venice on June 26 expecting to sell 14
valuable prints to a wealthy Italian collector. It was his wedding
anniversary, and Rumbler, a Frankfurt art dealer, was accompanied
by his wife. ``There was a full moon, we were in a good mood, and
we had not been able to sell the prints in a year, so we were not
really cautious,'' he recalled sheepishly.
</P>
<P>
   He and his wife, along with a gallery assistant, Matthias Kunze,
were picked up at their hotel on the Lido and taken by water taxi
to an apartment in a 17th-century palazzo. They were met by a young
man, supposedly the collector's son, who said the collector had
been called away to a hospital, where his mother was dying. Two
hours later the collector called to apologize and suggest meeting
the following day. Rumbler agreed and left the prints in exchange
for a receipt.
</P>
<P>
   ``The apartment was quite well furnished and looked good,''
Rumbler said. ``I also remember Matthias, who speaks Italian,
whispering to us, `You know, for Italian men, the mother is very
important.'''
</P>
<P>
   And yet, as he looks back on how the prints were stolen from
under his nose, Rumbler can at least be consoled by the fact that
he was not the only European dealer defrauded that weekend in a
sophisticated scam organized by at least two Italian men. British,
German and Dutch dealers were also persuaded to leave art objects
with the men pending completion of a sale. The men and the art
objects then promptly disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   So far about a dozen dealers are believed to have been swindled
out of paintings, prints, jewelry, books and antique clocks worth
$1 million. Since July warnings about the Italian operators have
been circulated among gallery owners in Europe and the United
States. A comprehensive article about the racket is to appear in
the September issue of The Art Newspaper, a influential monthly
published in London, Rome and Paris.
</P>
<P>
   What most of these dealers have in common is that all had stands
at the Maastricht Fine Arts Fair, held annually in that city in the
southern Netherlands and attended by 60,000 buyers. In each case
the dealer was called during the week of June 20 by an Italian who
gave his name as Cenni and expressed interest in specific artworks
he had seen at the Maastricht fair.
</P>
<P>
   The man further explained that he lived in Canada but would be
visiting Venice the following weekend, and he asked for the art
objects to be delivered urgently to him there, since they were
intended as a wedding present for his daughter. When a sales price
was agreed upon, it was then arranged for the dealers or their
envoys to take the objects to Venice, where payment would be made.
</P>
<P>
   Evert Douwes, an Amsterdam art dealer, was telephoned by the
Italian on June 22 about two paintings that had been on display in
Maastricht. The man spun the now-familiar tale of needing a wedding
present in Venice that weekend. After negotiations, ``Cenni''
agreed to buy ``Swags of Flowers,'' by Jan van den Hecke, for
$70,000 and to consider on approval a still life by Jasper Geerards
for $70,000. They were then taken to Venice by a shipper who
delivered them to the palazzo on the afternoon of June 26, just
hours before Rumbler would visit the apartment.
</P>
<P>
   ``This `Cenni' knew a lot about the paintings,'' Douwes said in
a telephone interview. ``He had seen them in Maastricht. He said
his wife had visited the gallery here. If I had gone myself,
perhaps I might have been suspicious. But I was in Russia, and the
shipper faced a difficult decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``When `Cenni' calls to say he can't come because he's with his
dying mother, the shipper asks himself, `Do I take the paintings
and alienate a collector?' He left the paintings and was given a
receipt.''
</P>
<P>
   The Italian team was having a fruitful weekend. Two hours before
the Douwes paintings were handed over, a German book vendor from
Stuttgart left two books in the apartment after ``Cenni'' failed to
show up. The previous day Derek Johns, a London-based dealer in Old
Masters, who remembered meeting ``Cenni'' in Maastricht, had an
assistant carry a view of San Marco by Giacomo Guardi to Venice.
And again, after hearing the story about the dying mother, she left
the painting in the apartment in exchange for a receipt, although
she also saw documents identifying the young man as ``Massimo
Cenni.''
</P>
<P>
   The Art Newspaper reported that an unidentified jewelry dealer
took antique jewelry to Venice later the same day in response to a
call from an Italian who had seen some examples in Maastricht. As
with the others, the dealer was booked into a luxury hotel, picked
up in a water taxi and taken to the apartment.
</P>
<P>
   The ``son'' picked three pieces of diamond jewelry, said by the
newspaper to be worth less than $100,000, and the father _ again,
called away to tend to his dying mother _ approved the purchase by
telephone. The dealer was given a check, which promptly bounced.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Like several of the dealers, Rumbler said he was impressed by
the knowledge of art that ``Cenni'' showed. ``He sounded serious,''
he said. ``He called for a print by Lucas van Leyden and then said
it was too expensive and opted for Christoffel Jagher's `Rest on
the Flight to Egypt.'''
</P>
<P>
   It was almost 24 hours after Rumbler handed over this print and
others that he realized he had been duped and reported the crime to
Italian police, who discovered that the apartment had been rented
for just one week and had already been vacated.
</P>
<P>
   Rumbler also described the theft in a fax to leading European
print dealers, including Christopher Mendez in London. On July 6
two young Italians tried to sell Mendez 10 of Rumbler's prints, and
he immediately called police.
</P>
<P>
   The men, reportedly from Rimini, were arrested, but they were
quickly released on bail _ neither was the elder ``Cenni'' _ and
have since disappeared. Four of Rumbler's prints, as well as other
art objects stolen in Venice, are still missing.
</P>
<P>
   Some dealers did not fall into the trap. Charles Roelofsz, an
Amsterdam dealer, was called by ``Cenni'' on June 23 about a
17th-century French oil, but when told that it could not be shipped
to Venice by the weekend, the Italian asked for two other
paintings.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said it was urgent because he had to leave for Hong Kong,''
Roelofsz recalled. ``I became suspicious. He had changed his story.
I didn't go.''
</P>
<P>
   The Art Newspaper reported that the same week, two New York art
dealers, Richard Feigen and Otto Naumann, heard from an Italian who
said he needed a painting in Venice for a wedding present. The
newspaper said Feigen became suspicious and broke off negotiations,
and Naumann canceled his flight to Venice at the last minute after
he, too, became suspicious. Neither Feigen nor Naumann returned
calls to their offices on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   While police in Italy, Germany and Britain are investigating the
swindle, Rumbler and Douwes said they were most disturbed by
evidence that several dealers had been cheated by the Italians in
Milan earlier this year but did not announce the crime. Not only
would he and other victims have been warned, Rumbler said, but
galleries would also have been alerted to look out for the stolen
objects.

SUITOR TOLD IT CANNOT KEEP SHARES IN SOCIETE GENERALE
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was after 4 a.m. in Paris on Saturday when French bank
regulators voted to end one of the most bruising corporate takeover
brawls in many people's memories by refusing to allow Banque
Nationale de Paris to retain its shares in its rival, Societe
Generale.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won a battle, just as previously we lost one,'' an
executive close to Societe Generale's chairman, Daniel Bouton, was
quoted as saying. ``But the war is over.''
</P>
<P>
   The war of the banks may be over in France, but a bigger one
involving competitors outside the nation's borders may be looming
as the European banking industry continues to consolidate.
</P>
<P>
   The battle that Societe Generale lost was its bid, begun in
February, to acquire Paribas, the French financial services
company. Banque Nationale de Paris sought to thwart that bid a
month later when it made a $37 billion hostile bid to take over
both Societe Generale and Paribas.
</P>
<P>
   Shareholders tendered 65 percent of their stock in Paribas to
Banque Nationale, but only 32 percent of voting shares in Societe
Generale. That left France's bank regulators to decide whether to
allow Banque Nationale de Paris to retain its stake in Societe
Generale.
</P>
<P>
   As the financial markets were poised to open Monday, it remained
to be seen who would be the winner among the banks, but the big
loser appeared to be the head of the French central bank,
Jean-Claude Trichet, who had strenuously backed a three-way deal.
The very French notion that the central authorities could dictate
the shape of the banking system was badly wounded in the process,
as well.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said they expected share prices in both Banque
Nationale de Paris and Societe Generale to rise Monday, as
investors bet that the banks will come into play.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement after their 11-hour meeting, the bank regulators
ruled that Banque Nationale did not have effective control of
Societe Generale, and given a lack of willingness among the banks
to reach some form of cooperation, Banque Nationale would have to
divest itself of its new shares in Societe Generale.
</P>
<P>
   Michel Pebereau, the 57-year old chief executive of Banque
Nationale de Paris, sought to deflect attention from this setback
by emphasizing the potential of his institution's alliance with
Paribas. Previously, Pebereau had boasted that a three-way merger
would have afforded pretax savings of more than $600 million over
three years. But in an interview Sunday in Journal du Dimanche of
Paris, Pebereau said, ``We're going to see if we can surpass that
goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course the decision leaves Banque Nationale free to submit an
offer for Societe Generale on improved terms. But a spokesman told
Reuters that the enhanced financial position of Banque Nationale
after its acquisition of Paribas made it more likely that it would
seek growth outside France, ``in Europe and internationally.''
</P>
<P>
   For Bouton of Societe Generale, it remained unclear what his
options would be. He had insisted through the five-month brawl that
Societe Generale could go it alone. But the regulators' ruling
unleashed speculation about possible future alliances or bidders
for Societe Generale, some of them outside France.
</P>
<P>
   The central banker, Trichet, in seeking a three-way alliance of
the banks, had argued that only by creating a French national
banking champion could the authorities prevent one of the banks
from falling prey to a foreign takeover attempt.
</P>
<P>
   But his inability to negotiate a compromise against the bitter
resistance of Bouton and his team may embolden bankers in France
and elsewhere to seek the cross-border consolidation he sought to
discourage.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, whose advisers backed Trichet's
effort, defended the regulators' decision Sunday, saying that
forcing the three-party deal could have created a ``serious risk of
instability for the French financial system, and for the economy
and job creation.''
</P>
<P>
   That appeared to be a reference to threats by bank union leaders
of widespread strikes if Trichet had forced a merger against the
outcome in the market. Michel Marchet, a leader of the big
Communist labor federation, the CGT, warned on Friday, as hundreds
of bank employees picketed the Bank of France building, that ``if
they do it, the strike will last months.''
</P>
<P>
   The outcome of the takeover effort was a significant
embarrassment for Trichet, who is scheduled to take over as head of
the new European Central Bank in Frankfurt when the term of Wim
Duisenberg expires in about three years.
</P>
<P>
   But a majority on the 10-member board of regulators appeared to
have voted against Banque Nationale for fear of sending a false
signal to international investors, who play an ever more important
role in the French capital markets. In the past, the regulators had
made clear that they would only consider possession of 51.01
percent of a company's shares effective control.
</P>
<P>
   ``They simply could not send a signal that they were not abiding
by their own rules,'' an official close to the group's
deliberations said.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bands of heavy showers and gusty winds will brush the Middle
Atlantic and Southeast coast from southern Virginia to central
South Carolina on Monday as Hurricane Dennis moves northeast off
the North Carolina Coast. Very strong winds will remain offshore
near the hurricane's center, but wind gusts over 45 mph will be
common on the Outer Banks of North Carolina where the most
persistent rain will occur. Winds will also grow stronger during
the day farther north along the coast from Virginia to southern New
Jersey as the pressure difference between the hurricane and high
pressure over Ontario increases. In the wake of the hurricane,
ample sunshine and warm conditions will cover most of the
Southeast.
</P>
<P>
   Unseasonably cool weather will cover much of the Northeast.
Plentiful sunshine will be mixed with patchy clouds as sprawling
high pressure spreads across the region. Active breezes circulating
around the high will add to the chill of the day, especially in New
England.
</P>
<P>
   Clouds and a few thundershowers will occur in parts of the
northern Mississippi Valley as warmer air from the Plains is forced
to rise over the cool air in place over the region. Meanwhile, very
warm conditions will linger over a large area from the Rockies to
the southern Plains. Afternoon thunderstorms will erupt over many
mountains from western Wyoming to northern Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Clouds, scattered showers and gusty winds will develop in the
cool air behind a front in the Northwest. Scattered frost will
occur in the interior Northwest Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Helpful Hurricanes
</P>
<P>
   Gusty winds, fitful rain and pounding surf from Hurricane Dennis
will cause considerable inconvenience near the East Coast this
week. But, this storm, like most hurricanes, will perform the
important function of moving heat from the tropics toward the
middle latitudes. In the cold season, powerful winter storms
transport frigid air toward the equator while circulating warmer
air toward the poles, helping to erase the natural global energy
imbalance. In summer, when middle latitude storms are much weaker,
tropical storms, both benign and destructive, help balance the
weather budget.

VOTERS INDICATE BUSH'S SUPPORT IS BROAD BUT NOT YET DEEP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga., S.C., N.C., Texas, Ariz.)  (mk) 
 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARIETTA, Ga. _ Tom Sims did not hesitate. When he heard, at the
last minute, that Texas Gov. George W. Bush was about to make an
appearance at a social services center here on Friday, he hiked out
into the 90-degree heat, crossed a busy street separating his
office from the center and stood under a withering sun to catch a
glimpse of _ and maybe snatch a word with _ Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not every day you get a chance to talk to the potential
president of the United States,'' said Sims, a health care
consultant who generally votes for Republicans and is pleased about
Bush's chances of winding up in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Surely, then, Bush had Sims' vote sewn up?
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Sims hastily interjected. ``It's ridiculous to make a
decision at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Sims said that with the first wave of Republican primaries more
than four months away and the general election seven months after
that, he was still looking, still learning. His vague, visceral
fondness for Bush was not connected to any detailed knowledge of
where Bush stood on an array of issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really couldn't tell you,'' Sims said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush's record-breaking yield of campaign contributions
and his alpine perch in polls convey the impression of an
irreversible groundswell of support for his candidacy for the
Republican presidential nomination, interviews with dozens of men
and women who attended his campaign events this week told a
different, less emphatic story.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of $1,000-a-head fund-raising events, Bush's
appearances in a three-day swing through South Carolina, North
Carolina and Georgia drew voters who, as often as not, said that
their affinity for, or curiosity about, Bush had not yet turned
into rock-solid support. Many of these people had favorable but
diffuse impressions of him and wanted to know more, but were in no
hurry, saying the election still seemed very, very far away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't even tell you who else is in the running at this
point,'' said Karen Davis, the finance director of the social
services center that Bush visited here.
</P>
<P>
   Many voters who had already decided on Bush or were leaning
sharply in that direction had difficulty articulating why, and
usually cited either their respect for his father, the former
president, or their determination to put a Republican in the White
House. Gov. Bush, they said, has developed enough momentum that he
seems to be the Republican with the best shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to go with the front-runner, otherwise you're
wasting your vote and betting on a losing horse,'' said Jack
Hamilton, a retired military officer who attended a speech by Bush
on Thursday morning in Myrtle Beach, S.C.
</P>
<P>
   The comments of Hamilton and others who had taken the time to
attend a Bush campaign event suggested that Bush had not struck
some deep, resounding chord with Republican voters or swept them
off their feet with his magnetism. To a significant extent, he was
simply the candidate with a name that they recognized, and he was
surfing a tidal wave of outsized expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing really that I see in him that impresses me
more than anybody else,'' said Will Buddin, a real estate agent who
showed up to hear Bush speak in Goose Creek, S.C., on Wednesday
afternoon. ``He's just got a good bandwagon right now. The general
media push makes you feel there might be something there.''
</P>
<P>
   Only a few people mentioned Bush's catch phrase of compassionate
conservatism as part of his appeal or even seemed familiar with the
term. If it had penetrated their awareness, it was mostly as a way
of pegging Bush as a moderate Republican, which was what many of
them said they wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of Republicans are conservative on fiscal issues
but more liberal on social ones,'' said Ed Barns, a manager for a
textiles manufacturer who also listened to Bush in Goose Creek.
</P>
<P>
   Barns said he got the feeling that Bush was of a like mind, but
he said he also got that feeling about Elizabeth Dole, one of
Bush's rivals for the Republican nomination, and was intrigued as
well by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., another candidate in the crowded
field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just haven't decided yet,'' Barns said.

</P>
<P>
   Without being asked about it, many voters volunteered that they
did not care whether Bush had ever used cocaine as a younger man, a
question that had dogged the Texas governor throughout the previous
week and had received considerable attention from the news media.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever he did in the past, he has recent accomplishments to
be proud of,'' said Cynthia Hudson, another person in the audience
at Goose Creek.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hudson, who had brought her two small children with her and
proudly identified herself a soccer mom, added that many people she
knew were reckless or wild in their youths. ``I'm surprised I
survived college,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She said that she liked what she had seen of Bush so far but
that she had not seen enough, or paid close enough attention, to
decide which of the Republican hopefuls was her favorite.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want somebody who's going to make a strong showing against
Democrats, and he could be the one,'' she said. But, she added, ``I
haven't done my homework yet. We've got a lot of time.''
</P>
<P>
   That last sentence was a common refrain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's sad that polls are taken so seriously so soon,''
said Tom Brown, a pension consultant who had come to hear Bush
speak at a Rotary Club luncheon in North Charleston, S.C., on
Wednesday. As for Bush's potent showing in those surveys, Brown
said, ``He's a name everybody knows.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown noted that many of the candidates were still waiting
before unveiling their policy proposals on important issues and
that he, in turn, was waiting to decide which of them had his vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far, all we have is political gobbledygook,'' Brown said.
``I need more information.''
</P>
<P>
   That many people were not devoting much thought to the
presidential race and did not know much about Bush's actual
political record could be read two ways, with different
implications for Bush's candidacy. One was that his numbers were
softer than the polls made them seem, and more subject to change as
the primaries drew nearer.
</P>
<P>
   The other interpretation was that voters were generally
distracted and disconnected and simply wound up gravitating toward
a candidate with a familiar name and face, factors that were not
only working in Bush's favor now but would continue to help him in
the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's all name recognition,'' said Clare Majorossy, a
retiree at the Myrtle Beach event, who added that voters were moved
by fickle and not always sensible impulses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes,'' she said, ``people say, `Look, wouldn't it be
nice for the father if the son got elected?' People get dumb
sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   She herself was undecided, as was her husband, George Majorossy,
who said that they were attending Bush's speech at the Myrtle Beach
Convention Center because the president of their homeowners'
association, an active Republican, had told them there would be a
free breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was expecting bacon and eggs,'' Majorossy said as he waited
for Bush to deliver his remarks. Instead, Majorossy got pastries
and coffee. ``I was a little disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   Majorossy asked his interviewer if Bush's speeches were
generally good.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it worth hanging around?'' he said. ``Because I've got a
racquetball game waiting on me.''

ANALYSIS: INTERNET BODY FEELS DEMOCRACY'S TUG
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Va., Calif.)  (nk) 
 By JERI CLAUSING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTIAGO, Chile _ The Internet may be a one-man, one-mouse world
without borders or kings. But that doesn't mean it is yet a
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Equal representation seems to be the big challenge for Icann,
the experimental body that met here for three days last week as
part of its continuing effort to create a new system for global
Internet governance.
</P>
<P>
   Even as it was taking its first step toward substantive policy
making, Icann _ the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and
Numbers _ was hearing criticism that its structure and orientation
so far has favored business and government interests at the expense
of nonprofit groups and individuals.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very difficult world for new players to break
into,'' said one in attendance, Alan Davidson, policy analyst of
the Center for Democracy and Technology, an online civil
libertarian group based in Washington. ``Icann is clearly
addressing issues that will have tremendous long-term impact on the
shape of the Internet, but very few consumer or public interest
groups have been involved.''
</P>
<P>
   During a public session that the board held on Wednesday, Esther
Dyson, an American who is the board's interim chairwoman, responded
to Icann's critics. ``With all due respect,'' she told the
audience, ``we are less interested in complaints about process''
and more interested in ``doing real work and moving forward.''
</P>
<P>
   The next day, in its first open board meeting, Icann's interim
board, which consists of 10 members from seven nations, approved
draft rules meant to resolve so-called cybersquatting disputes
between parties with competing claims to the use of trademarks in
Internet addresses.
</P>
<P>
   The move was applauded by many of the 200 people from around the
world who came to monitor the board's activities. And yet the
action also raised questions about how soon Icann will insure that
every Internet user has a voice in the policy making process.
</P>
<P>
   Icann was chosen last year by the U.S. Department of Commerce to
take over the administrative functions of the Internet and
introduce competition into the business of registering Internet
addresses in the domains of .com, .net and .org. That business
until recently has been run exclusively by a Herndon, Va., company,
Network Solutions, under a government contract.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, the process for moving administration of the Internet
from American federal contractors to private, international
oversight, has been driven largely by government agencies and by
business interests and trade associations with a financial stake in
the outcome _ and with the resources to attend and influence the
four main meetings Icann has held around the world.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Icann has recognized membership bodies that represent
companies that register domain names, Internet service providers
and the groups that set technical standards. Before Icann's next
meeting, in Los Angeles in November, those constituencies are
expected to elect nine of what will be 18 permanent board members.
</P>
<P>
   But the interim board is still grappling with the more complex
issue of creating the structure for an at-large membership, one
that Icann has decided should have at least 5,000 members and would
have the power to elect the other nine members of the board. And
questions remain about whether even that at-large group will be
sufficient to represent the interests of non-business and
individual Internet users.
</P>
<P>
   A small core of representatives of consumer and nonprofit
interests made the trip to Santiago, both to monitor the
controversial board and to begin planning an outreach effort to
rally other nonprofit groups to get involved in Icann.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a huge gap'' in representation at the Icann meetings
to date, said Davidson, contending that Icann's oversight of domain
names and other Internet policy issues has the potential to ``chill
speech on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrew L. Shapiro, a senior advisor to the Markle Foundation, a
New York-based organization that underwrites projects it deems to
be in the public interest, said his group coordinated the trip for
nonprofits groups, as part of Markle's recently announced
five-year, $100 million commitment to become more involved in
digital communication issues. Other groups attending under Markle's
aegis included representatives from the American Library
Association and the American Association for the Advancement of
Science.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately, the domain name system is about your ability to be
seen and heard in the digital age,'' Shapiro said.
</P>
<P>
   Nonprofit and individual interests, however, were largely absent
from the process that drafted the cybersquatting rules that Icann
adopted on Thursday. Those rules, which will be written into all
domain name registration contracts, call for all disputes involving
the use of trademarks to be arbitrated by Icann-accredited
mediation bodies, with the loser paying.
</P>
<P>
   Heeding criticism that a key voice was left out of the process,
Icann did request that the definition of cybersquatting be more
narrowly defined and that new language be added to protect
individuals and others from having legitimately registered domain
names wrested away from them by large companies.
</P>
<P>
   The board's action, however, takes the final drafting process
out of the hands of Icann's members, giving it instead to a small
group that will be appointed by Icann's interim president, Mike
Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro said that he and and others were concerned that the
``train is leaving the station before everyone could get on
board.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If this is the constitutional convention for cyberspace,'' he
said, ``it's as if they started the talks in Philadelphia without
half the colonies.''

   BISCAYNE _ MIAMI _ For 50 years, it was Miami's gateway: a broad
boulevard lined with neon, palms and Mom-and-Pop motels that
welcomed visitors to sun-splashed Miami. Then came the freeway.
When Interstate 95 opened in the 1960s, visitors whisked into town
at 60 mph, 20-feet up in the air. As in so many American cities,
the elevated highway overnight changed the look and feel of Miami.
Biscayne Boulevard, long the city's proud route of entry, began a
30-year decline. Cozy motels once packed with family station wagons
became crack dens and flop houses. Customers disappeared from shops
and restaurants, while block-long stretches fell into urban decay,
with boarded-up buildings marred by graffiti. Hookers became more
prevalent than tourists. As recently as last winter, it was on
Biscayne that cops running a prostitution sting snared an Atlanta

almost miraculously, Biscayne Boulevard is making a comeback.

later, Ellison began receiving threatening letters and harassing
phone calls. Then, on July 24, his hay barn was set on fire. The
FBI is investigating. Some locals say it's unfair that immigrant
children would be given education privileges their own kids don't

may have violated open meeting requirements. Hooker's tenure in El
Paso was marked with controversy and poor performance reviews and
nearly everyone she's run across in recent years describes her as
antagonistic. Hooker also was the subject of two complaints filed
with the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and a
lawsuit in state district court against the city. All were filed by
the highest-ranking Hispanic administrator in the El Paso system,
who has accused Hooker, who is white, of discrimination. Hooker at
one point accused the woman of pushing her down some stairs (while
on extended medical leave from that, she sought the Fulton job).

   TEXAS-LOTTO _ AUSTIN, Texas _ Searching for a way to prop up
Lotto Texas sales, the state lottery commission gave preliminary
approval Saturday for a new game under an old name. Under the
proposed change, lotto players would continue to pick six numbers,
but the range would run from 1 to 54 after four numbers are added
to the mix. That would drive the odds of matching six numbers from
one in 15.8 million to one in 25.8 million, creating fewer winners
so larger jackpots can accumulate. Larger prizes typically inspire
more people to play the game. (McCarthy, Austin American-Statesman)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mitchell Bernstein did his bit to chip away at the profits of
the newspaper industry this year. Not that he meant to. The
26-year-old advertising copywriter was simply looking for a job
with an Internet company in the most logical way _ on the Internet.
He posted resumes on Monster.com and Hotjobs.com and scoured the
job boards of the New York New Media Association, which eventually
matched him with Organic, an Internet services firm in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked in newspapers,'' Bernstein said last week, ``but
there are no jobs that I'm looking for in newspapers.''
</P>
<P>
   Those are chilling words for newspaper publishers, whose most
lucrative revenue source is usually those pages of agate type,
pages that generations of job seekers, home buyers and car buyers
have torn out and punctuated with penciled circles. Online
journalism has caused concern about the industry's standards, but
online classified advertising threatens newspapers' profits and
dominance in an $18 billion market.
</P>
<P>
   That revenue currently represents an average of 43 percent of
the advertising revenue of the largest-circulation newspapers _ and
more than a third of their total revenues _ according to the
figures of the Inland Press Association, a trade group.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is challenging a franchise that flourished with the
post-World War II buying boom, when newspapers' role as a local
marketplace fattened their daily editions. It has continued despite
cyclical advertising recessions and intermittent shocks, like
Wal-Mart's suffocation of small businesses, whose advertising died
with them.
</P>
<P>
   Classifieds, in particular, brought in a higher and higher
percentage of newspaper advertising dollars. The figures of the
Newspaper Association of America show classifieds represented 18
percent of advertisers' newspaper spending in 1950; 26 percent in
1975; and 41.5 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the question is how much revenue newspapers are going to
lose to the hundreds of Internet competitors, and how quickly.
While the weighty pile of printed classifieds is not fading away
any time soon, Michael J. Beebe, a media analyst for Goldman,
Sachs, said flatly, ``There is going to be an erosion in revenue
and profitability'' in the old-fashioned newspaper classifieds.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not to say that some company might not discover the
right model and build an economically viable and perhaps
value-added business, using the Internet to its advantage,'' Beebe
added. ``They're all searching for it.''
</P>
<P>
   For the past four years, through investments in online ventures
like AdOne L.L.C., Careerpath.com, Classified Ventures and
Careers.wsj.com, newspaper companies have scrambled to compete in
the fast-growing world of online classifieds.
</P>
<P>
   Their competitors come from all over _ an employment-advertising
agency like Omnicom's Bernard Hodes Agency, which also happened to
be the single largest purchaser of newspaper advertising ($572
million in 1997, according to Editor &AMP; Publisher, the trade
magazine) and operates Careermosaic.com. There is also TMP
Worldwide. This marketing services and executive search firm is a
major yellow pages advertiser whose Monster.com Web site is the
most-visited in the online help-wanted world.
</P>
<P>
   There are also technology giants like the Microsoft Corp., which
runs Carpoint.com; the National Association of Realtors, which runs
Realtor.com; and portals like Yahoo Inc. and America Online, which
offer free classifieds. The list gets longer daily. Less than two
weeks ago, the CBS Corp. took a 38 percent share of Jobs.com, a
Texas company, in return for a pledge of $62 million in promotion
and other considerations.
</P>
<P>
   The geometric expansion of online competitors coincided with a
disturbing dip in newspapers' help-wanted advertising during
portions of the past 18 months in at least five markets _ San Jose,
Dallas, Boston, New York and Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Newspaper executives and industry analysts are cautious about
attributing all the drop to the online predators. A full-employment
economy, like the United States has enjoyed for more than two
years, reduces the need for employers to place ads.
</P>
<P>
   All that said, it is clear that the ads for job-seekers like
Bernstein _ not to mention technology managers, Web designers,
software developers and computer engineers _ are disappearing from
print newspapers. While paper is portable, it cannot match the
Internet for fine-grained search capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Robert W. Decherd, the chairman and chief executive of the Belo
Corp., is hardly panicking. At Belo's flagship, The Dallas Morning
News, he said, ``It's not as if classifieds have fallen off a
cliff.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, ``There is one major category that is temporarily
disabled'' _ employment ads.
</P>
<P>
   And the drop in help-wanted ads, in some markets, more than
offset gains in auto and real-estate ads. After two years of robust
growth, The Dallas Morning News' help-wanted declines pulled its
overall classified advertising linage down 3.1 percent in 1998. It
is down another 3.6 percent through the first half of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, The San Jose Mercury News, owned by Knight Ridder,
typified the trend. Classified advertising revenue at Silicon
Valley's hometown newspaper dropped 9.2 percent in 1998, compared
to the previous year. A turnaround in help-wanted advertising
starting this spring reduced that decline to 2.4 percent through
July.
</P>
<P>
   At The Boston Globe, which is owned by The New York Times Co.,
overall classified ad linage inched up 0.5 percent in the last
quarter, compared to the second quarter of 1998. But volume dipped
in each of the three previous quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Overall classified linage at The New York Times was up 2.7
percent in 1998 and is down 1.4 percent through July, according to
Janet L. Robinson, the newspaper's president. The Times, however,
drew 25 percent of its total advertising revenue from classifieds
in 1998, a proportion well below the industry average.
</P>
<P>
   At The Los Angeles Times, the flagship newspaper of the Times
Mirror Co., help-wanted advertising volume declined in 1998, but it
was offset by real estate and auto gains in every period except the
first quarter. Overall, classifieds were up 7.1 percent through the
first half of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   All these markets have a high concentration of high-technology
employers, who are spending less and less on newspapers. Companies
like the Intel Corp. are now on many online jobs boards, often
limiting themselves to a few print ads directing readers to their
own Web site listings.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey C. Taylor, the founder of The Monster Board and
currently an executive vice president at TMP, is more than happy to
take some of the blame. ``A whole industry developed under the
umbrella they were standing under and they didn't see it,'' Taylor
said of newspapers. The people abandoning newspapers are ``your
information-age workers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a computer on the desk,'' he said. ``They look for a
job at work.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Few analysts will put a hard figure on what Monster, Hotjobs.com
and other sites will cost newspapers. One that does, Forrester
Research, predicts a rough future for newspapers. Competitive
pressures to lower rates, the loss of existing revenues and the
failure to capture new business will cost newspapers $4.7 billion
by 2003, Forrester estimates.
</P>
<P>
   But that estimate is widely disputed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nowhere near as severe as they make it out to be,'' said
P. Anthony Ridder, the chairman and chief executive of Knight
Ridder. ``The big strength that newspapers have is the relationship
with advertisers in the places where they do business.''
</P>
<P>
   But Taylor of Monster.com scoffs at this, saying that most
newspaper classifieds come through advertising agencies, not local
employers.
</P>
<P>
   While it is clear that online sites _ including newspapers' own
_ can cost newspapers money, it is unclear how to make money
online. Monster.com is one of the rare Web sites to turn a profit.
Analysts expect it to generate about $120 million in 1999 revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Peter M. Zollman, the principal of Advanced Interactive Media
Group L.L.C. of Altamont Springs, Fla., said: ``There will be
significant growth in online classified advertising. Newspapers
have a superb opportunity to capture a tremendous amount of that _
or to throw it all away _ depending on how they respond.''
</P>

<P>
   To date, two major competing models have emerged. Both involve
pooling help-wanted, real-estate and automobile advertising, but
the structures are distinct. One establishes territories and allows
newspapers to protect most revenues from their local markets; the
other treats the whole country as a single market.
</P>
<P>
   The territorial model was adopted by the New York Times Co., the
Times Mirror Co., the Tribune Co. and the Washington Post Co.,
which jointly founded Careerpath.com. They also are backers of
Classified Ventures, a similar company whose newspaper participants
also include the Gannett Co. and Central Newspapers Inc. The idea
is to sell advertisers _ car dealers, realtors, employers, agencies
_ a package, offering online classifieds for free or a nominal fee
to those buying print ads.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts question the wisdom of a cooperative model they
believe is built on defensive fiefs, questioning how quickly it can
respond to the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Decherd of Belo backs the approach of AdOne, which was acquired
in January by a consortium of media companies. The initial
investors include Advance Publications Inc. and the Hearst Corp. In
July, more media companies, including Belo and Pulitzer Inc.,
joined AdOne and its Classifiedwarehouse.com site.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why he preferred AdOne, Decherd said: ``Essentially,
because it's boundaryless. There is no trying to carve up
territories. We're trying to create a national platform that will
compete head-to-head'' with the new online firms.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, analysts and newspaper executives are keenly aware
that making money on the Internet may require not just advertising
jobs or purchases but making them happen and taking a share of
these online transactions.
</P>
<P>
   Whichever model survives, the current newspaper-backed sites,
like their competitors', will offer more than listings. David
Israel, the president of Classified Ventures, said, ``We're in the
business of trying to create really big, attractive marketplaces.''
For instance, ``for a car _ people want to know all about pricing,
reviews, financing rates, about decisions about leasing vs.
buying.''
</P>
<P>
   The value-added concept has been embraced by many online sites.
Homestore.com Inc., the parent of Realtor.com, has signed a
multiyear marketing deal with Norwest Mortgage Inc., which is owned
by Wells Fargo &AMP; Co. The realtors' site has its own newspaper ally;
on Thursday it announced it would provide online listings to
Homes.wsj.com, a new site on The Wall Street Journal Interactive
Edition, which is owned by Dow Jones &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Most newspaper executives tend to bank on their local roots.
John W. Sweeney, associate publisher and president of Hearst's
Houston Chronicle, said the essence of classifieds is ``local
companies offering local people jobs, local dealers offering them
cars.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately,'' he said, ``newspapers should be able to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Beebe, the Goldman, Sachs analyst, thinks Monster is
formidable. ``The more employers have jobs there, the more
consumers are going to trust the brand.''
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts believe newspapers have to be willing to sell or
give away online classifieds that might leach revenue from the
printed newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Robinson of The New York Times said, ``If portions of our
business wane, we will see other portions of our business grow
dramatically.'' She added: ``The model is changing constantly. The
idea is for the newspaper companies to remain as nimble as
possible.''

AMAZON.COM TRIES TO STEM CONTROVERSY OVER ITS LISTS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Utah, Tenn., Miss., Kan., Calif., Pa., D.C.)   (jw) 
 By DAVID F. GALLAGHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Amazon.com is trying to stem controversy over a new marketing
tactic that uses personal data about its 10.7 million customers to
compile online lists of books and music that people they live near,
or work with, are buying.
</P>
<P>
   After critics raised privacy concerns late last week, Amazon.com
said that it would adjust the program by letting customers request
that their buying habits not be included in the ``purchase
circles,'' as the listings are known.
</P>
<P>
   But the controversy underscored the growing tension between
sales goals and personal privacy in the new world of online
commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing things that have never been done before,'' Paul
Capelli, an Amazon.com spokesman said, after the company agreed to
let consumers opt out of the purchase circle program. ``We use our
customers to help us evolve.''
</P>
<P>
   The purchase circles, which Amazon.com introduced on Aug. 20,
comprise thousands of best-seller lists that enable customers to
browse and see what books, music and videos are popular among
various groups of people _ by categories that include geography,
employer, university or professional organization.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com customers from New York City, according to a listing
last Friday, were buying up copies of Kurt Andersen's novel ``Turn
of the Century,'' for example. U.S. Navy buyers were ordering many
copies of Cher's ``Believe'' compact disk. And Amazon.com shoppers
logging in from Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. tended to select the video
``Tae-Bo Workout: Instructional and Basic.''
</P>
<P>
   To generate the lists, Amazon mines the data that all of its
customers provide when they shop: a shipping address, an e-mail
address and the list of items bought. The shipping addresses let it
create its best-seller lists based on geographic areas like towns
or foreign countries. Using the Internet domain name in the e-mail
address, Amazon can often identify a customer's employer or
college, for example.
</P>
<P>
   The lists give no actual sales figures. Nor do the purchase
circles identify individual buyers, even though Amazon.com's data
base is capable of doing so. Amazon said these rankings of
``uniquely best-selling'' products _ titles that are more popular
with a particular group than among its customers generally _ are
simply meant as a way to let browsers know the buying preferences
of people with whom they might have something else in common, or
about whom they might simply be curious.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon and other online retailers have long offered
recommendations generated by software that analyzes buying
patterns, letting a customer know that people who bought the same
R.E.M. and Miles Davis CD's also tend to like Liz Phair, for
instance. The drawback to such referrals is that a customer knows
very little else about who those other customers are.
</P>
<P>
   So Amazon came up with preference circles as a way to give a
customer a stronger sense of common cause with fellow shoppers. The
premise is that peer pressure might make the lists more effective
as a sales tool than a generic list that reflects the buying habits
of the entire country. Amazon said the preference circle lists
would be updated weekly or monthly, depending on the size of the
group. Customers can sign up to have new lists e-mailed to them.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever Amazon.com's motives, once word began circulating last
week of Amazon.com's new program, privacy-rights advocates began
sounding alarms.
</P>
<P>
   ``An awful lot of people, including myself, purchase books using
their own money but using the e-mail address that's assigned to
them by their company,'' said Beth Givens, director of the Privacy
Rights Clearinghouse, a nonprofit organization in San Diego. Ms.
Givens said she would not want one of her own recent book purchases
to show up on a list that might appear to be endorsed by her
organization.
</P>
<P>
   The privacy policy on Amazon's site says the company does not
disclose information about individual customers or their purchases
to outside parties. But the policy statement also says that the
company reserves the right to do so in the future. Amazon.com,
however, allows customers to indicate by e-mail that they never
want their information released.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are continuing to look at ways that we can take this data
and reapply it back to Amazon.com in a way that is fun and
interactive, but is done in a way that our customers are
comfortable with,'' Capelli said. ``We would never do anything that
would compromise or call into question individuals' confidentiality
for items they have purchased.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Corporate confidentiality is a separate issue from individual
rights. When Amazon's computers zoom in on purchasing quirks at a
specific company, the results could end up revealing more than
Amazon's customers might like, since the lists are available to any
curious or nosy outsider.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for example, Levi Strauss &AMP; Co., which has been trying to
make its classic jeans brand hip again. Amazon's purchase circle
listing for Levi says that employees at the company have been
busily ordering the books ``Strategic Brand Management,''
``Building Strong Brands'' and ``Street Trends: How Today's
Alternative Youth Cultures Are Creating Tomorrow's Mainstream
Markets.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Beckman, a spokesman for Levi Strauss, said company
officials would not comment on the Amazon list because, ``as you
know, we're intently focused on revitalizing the brands here.''
</P>
<P>
   The Levi book purchases simply confirmed what outsiders already
knew about the company's hot buttons. But critics wondered what
clues outsiders might glean about the internal issues of a company
if its book list revealed heavy purchases of titles about
international expansion, say, or finding a new job.
</P>
<P>
   Anita Allen, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania Law
School and co-author of a recent book, ``Privacy Law'' (West
Publishing, 1999), said that ``confidential business plans or
corporate issues might be indirectly revealed'' by the lists. But
she said that Amazon's use of customer data in this way was
``disturbing but not necessarily illegal.''
</P>
<P>
   There are laws protecting some facets of individual privacy in
this area. A federal law prohibiting video stores from releasing
movie rental records was passed in 1988 after reporters obtained
such records for Robert Bork when he was a Supreme Court nominee.
And most states have similar laws protecting library patrons from
disclosure of their book-borrowing habits.
</P>
<P>
   But ``things like the Bork law governing video checkouts or
library records don't apply when you have information aggregated''
for many individuals, Ms. Allen said. And in any case, the privacy
laws that would protect individuals in such cases have not been
shown to apply to corporations, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Capelli of Amazon said last week that no companies had
complained about the purchase circles. But because some people had
said that they did not want their purchasing data used for such
lists, the company amended its Web site on Thursday, telling
customers that they could send an e-mail to have their purchases
excluded from the lists. And companies can send faxes on their
corporate letterhead requesting that their employee purchasing
lists be removed from the site.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon also updated its privacy policy to mention the purchase
circles. Customers who never read the privacy policy or visit the
purchase circle pages, however, are unlikely to see this opt-out
information or know that they have a choice about how their
purchasing data are used.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly the opt-out should appear at the time the individual
is making the purchase,'' said Ms. Givens of the Privacy Rights
Clearinghouse.
</P>
<P>
   Capelli said allowing an opt-out at the time of purchase would
be ``excessive.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the marketing and privacy implications, the lists do
offer an unscientific survey of regional tastes. Outside of major
cities like Los Angeles and New York, the lists of best-selling
music, for example, are remarkably homogeneous across the country,
with artists like Sarah McLachlan and the Dave Matthews Band
predominating.
</P>
<P>
   The book lists show more regional variation. A series of novels
about an imminent apocalypse by Tim LaHaye and Jerry Jenkins is
popular on the charts in Memphis, Tenn.; Wichita, Kan., and
Jackson, Miss. But none of those books made it to New York's list,
which after Andersen's ``Turn of the Century,'' lists ``The Girls'
Guide to Hunting and Fishing'' by Melissa Bank and ``For the Relief
of Unbearable Urges'' by Nathan Englander. The highest-ranked book
in Salt Lake City, meanwhile, is the paperback version of ``Secret
Ceremonies: A Mormon Woman's Intimate Diary of Marriage and
Beyond.''

Take, for example, Burning Man, which might be surprised to find

   Attending Burning Man in 1997, Vida wanders from specialized

   &UR; EATING AND WEARING &LR;
</P>
<P>
   - The Polish news agency reports that since June, when  &UR; Pope &LR; 
 &UR; John Paul II &LR;  visited his hometown and said he had a childhood
passion for kremowki (cream cakes), sales of the pastries have
rocketed from 200 a day to 2,500 a day.
</P>
<P>
   - At a party in Martha's Vineyard the other night,  &UR; Chelsea &LR; 
 &UR; Clinton &LR;  and  &UR; Prince Andrew  &LR; were overheard in serious discussion
about Mad Cow disease, reports the New York Post.
</P>
<P>
   -  &UR; Art Garfunkel &LR;  gave Food &AMP; Wine his basic requirements for a
dinner party: ``Humor and water come to mind. ... You have to be
funny and down-to-earth. But I'm also an Evian man. In the '90s,
you've got to have water.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; - Tom Ford &LR; , creative director of Gucci, discussed supermodels
with the Telegraph of London. ``My dog is my favorite model,'' he
said. ``He is the most elegant creature I know and he is a lot less
expensive than  &UR; Kate Moss &LR; .'' -  &UR; Wallace Tchon &LR;  has called to
Personals attention ``Not Vegetarian,'' a section of
www.veg.org/veg, which says that  &UR; Claudia Schiffer &LR; ,
self-proclaimed vegetarian, eats chicken; furthermore, although
 &UR; Benjamin Franklin  &LR; was once a vegetarian, he gave it up later in
life.
</P>
<P>
   - New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art and Cleveland's Rock and
Roll Hall of Fame have collaborated on ``Icons of Rock Style,'' an
exhibition to open at the Met on December 9. Sponsored by  &UR; Tommy
Hilfiger &LR;  USA, the show is purported to be about ``the influence of
rock on fashion.'' ``Look out,'' says artnet.com, ``deep thinking
ahead!''
</P>
<P>
   P.S. In perhaps related news,  &UR; Thomas Hoving &LR; , former director
of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, has completed writing ``Art for
Dummies,'' which is to be published in October. According to Town &AMP;
Country magazine, the author ``revels in the opportunity to
demystify art without denigrating it.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, it is said in New York that Hoving complained to
friends that ``Dummies'' editors wanted him to delete a phrase in
which he'd described something ``as revolutionary as the Boston Tea
Party.'' The editors said that readers wouldn't understand the
reference. Hoving refused to cave, however, and the not very
obscure reference is in.
</P>

   - The menswear journal DNR says that orange is the color of the
day, but a San Francisco shopper, having scanned wares at a number
of chichi stores, proclaims ``Black is the new black.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHO SAID WHAT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``As I took my final few steps down the shaded walk of our
palatial country estate, I felt the relentless pounding of a
battered and aching heart, scarred with memories of unbridled
passion _ memories that now must last a lifetime. I slipped into my
Jaguar and drove off. It was a new day.''
</P>
<P>
   -  &LR;   &LR; From a faux press release credited by the Los Angeles Times
to  &UR; Bob Mills &LR; , revised by  &UR; Curt Anderson &LR; , in which a romance
novelist announces her separation from husband No. 5.

CONSUMERS' DESIRE FOR PERSONAL INFORMATION PRIVACY IGNORED
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By DENISE CARUSO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If privacy is indeed the pivotal concern for people who use data
networks _and by every objective indication to date, it is _ then
why are companies and law enforcement agencies still getting away
with monitoring and collecting, and using and selling, as much of
our personal data as they can get their hands on?
</P>
<P>
   What is it about ``no'' that these folks don't understand?
</P>
<P>
   Several new, sweeping Internet surveillance initiatives, for
example, have been introduced by the Clinton White House over the
last few weeks _ including one that would monitor private
industries for illegal transactions. Another would allow law
enforcement agents with a court order to secretly enter private
homes or offices to ``wiretap'' the hard disks and Internet
connections of computer users.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Federal Trade Commission, which a few years ago had
shown such enthusiasm for making Internet-based businesses toe the
consumer privacy line, has backed down from consumer advocacy and
is now advocating for industry. The agency officially concluded
last month, in its 1999 Report to Congress on Self-Regulation and
Privacy, that voluntary industry practices were working just fine
and that ``no legislative action is necessary at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   This summation came despite comments from one FTC commissioner,
Sheila F. Anthony, who said in a written statement to a Senate
subcommittee in July that she was dismayed by the results of
studies that show a gap as large as 89 percent between the number
of sites that gather personal information and those that post
substantive privacy policies. Self-regulation ``is not enough if
the privacy practices themselves are toothless,'' wrote Ms.
Anthony, who dissented in part from last month's report.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, a telephone industry posse, led by U S West,
persuaded a federal appeals court in Denver to reverse some recent
FCC rules that had been specifically designed to protect private
customer data.
</P>
<P>
   According to the chairman of the Federal Communications
Commission, William E. Kennard, who said the agency would appeal
the decision, those rules were the result of a request by Congress
to provide ``meaningful protection for consumers' privacy rights.''
</P>
<P>
   The FCC rules had required phone companies to get explicit
permission from their customers _ a method known as ``opt in'' _
before using or sharing customers' records, calling patterns and
other personal information to market new services to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``You call your doctor, your clergyman, your therapist,''
Kennard said. ``You order products. And when you pick up that
telephone, most consumers have no earthly idea that call might be
used by someone to market another service to them. When you pick up
that telephone, you should have ownership of that information. It's
the way we live our lives and it's private to us.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a 2-1 ruling published on Aug. 18, which has obvious
implications for the data-hungry Internet economy, the 10th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals said that rules protecting consumers from
having information like the numbers they call and the services they
subscribe to used without their permission interfered with the
phone companies' First Amendment rights to free speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although we may feel uncomfortable knowing that our personal
information is circulating in the world,'' the ruling said, ``we
live in an open society where information may pass freely.''
</P>
<P>
   One wonders how many circuit court judges would be willing to
have the form and substance of their phone bills ``pass freely''
among the employees of U S West or its partners.
</P>
<P>
   The court's decision does not allow U S West and others to sell
proprietary customer data to outsiders, but it does give the
telephone companies permission to scrutinize this highly personal
data _ data gathered only as a byproduct of subscribing to their
services _ without the subscribers' explicit permission. Not
incidentally, it gives the companies an enormous edge over others
selling competing services.
</P>
<P>
   Kennard said he was disappointed that the court came down on the
side of the business interests of telephone companies. ``If that's
the way privacy laws will be interpreted,'' he said, ``then I think
consumers will have a lot to worry about.''
</P>
<P>
   Oddly enough, the ruling _ which, if it stands, would seem to
hamper any future attempts to limit the ability of companies to
disclose consumers' personal information _ got very little play in
the national news media.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the victorious companies _ U S West, Vodaphone
Airtouch, Sprint, SBC Communications, MCI Worldcom, Bell South and
Frontier _ did little to call attention to the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   And who can blame them? Consumers do not like it when companies
do not protect their privacy, as Amazon.com found out this week
when it started publishing lists of its products purchased by
specific companies, nonprofit groups and government agencies. But
refusing to flaunt data mining and refusing to practice it are two
different matters. ``The technology generates a lot of information
that's very valuable, and everybody wants to get their hands on
it,'' says David L. Sobel, general counsel for the Electronic
Privacy Information Center in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Sobel does not buy the ``corporate First Amendment'' argument
that he said won the day for U S West et al. ``We do, in fact, have
existing federal laws that restrict companies from disclosing
personal information, like video rentals,'' he said. ``It's not a
violation of free speech rights to forbid people to divulge inside
information. Why should it be a violation to pass laws restricting
the use of private data?''
</P>
<P>
   And Kennard said he saw a broader issue around the collection of
detailed consumer data in every transaction from the supermarket
scanner to the credit-card number on the Internet. ``As a society,
we have to come up with a way of protecting that information for
benefit of consumers,'' he said. ``It doesn't necessarily mean that
government has to do it, but government is certainly a logical
place for it to be done if industry isn't going to step up to the
plate.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Anthony, the FTC commissioner, has also become a believer in
a government role. In her statement to the Senate subcommittee, she
wrote that ``industry progress has been far too slow'' since the
FTC encouraged voluntary fair information practices in 1996. ``I
believe that the time is ripe for federal legislation to establish
at least baseline minimum standards upon which meaningful
self-regulation can flourish.''
</P>
<P>
   And despite their protests, that may be the only ``no'' that
industry will understand.

A GREAT Y2K MYSTERY: HOW MANY MISTAKES ARE GOING UNNOTICED?
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Mass., Ill., Conn., Ga., Calif., Va., Pa.)  (ms) 
 By BARNABY J. FEDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A growing number of companies and government agencies are
claiming that their vital systems are ready for any and all Year
2000 dates, but life seems as hectic as ever for many Year 2000
technical workers in that advance guard.
</P>
<P>
   Managers continue testing on the assumption that at least minor
flaws lie buried in some ``ready'' systems. Previously unknown Year
2000 defects keep popping up in commercial software. And normal
activities like adding equipment or software carry the risk of
inadvertently introducing bugs into systems that had been cleaned
up and tested.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is testing and retesting,'' said Steven Kutnick, the
Year 2000 project leader at the Northern Trust Company in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   How many crucial mistakes are being caught by testing _ or
missed _ has become a great Year 2000 mystery.
</P>
<P>
   Consultants and companies selling Year 2000 software-testing
tools contend that repairs typically miss many date problems and
introduce bugs that may or may not be related to dates. Some
authorities, like Capers Jones, chief scientist at Software
Productivity Research, a consulting company in Burlington, Mass.,
warn that testing fails to catch many defects.
</P>
<P>
   The Gartner Group, a technology consultant in Stamford, Conn.,
says it is common for independent tests to find errors lurking in 5
percent of computer code that has been altered during Year 2000
work and that the error rate reaches 15 percent in poorly run
projects. Nearly two-thirds of those errors are serious enough to
create faulty data or cause programs to crash, according to
Gartner.
</P>
<P>
   There have been a number of reports highlighting the
consequences of failing to screen out defects. Northwest Metrology,
an electronic test equipment company in Bakersfield, Calif.,
recently disclosed that an office computer it had tested last year
had nevertheless crashed and destroyed data in January after
encountering Year 2000 dates. The company, already out $80,000 as a
result, is still struggling to restore the lost data eight months
later.
</P>
<P>
   Year 2000 project managers agree that such perils are real and
that they make rigorous testing worthwhile. But many say their
experience in fixing programs, testing them and putting them back
into use leads them to doubt that hidden defects are anywhere near
the levels projected by Jones and influential consultants like
Gartner.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to change less than 1 percent of our programs after
testing,'' said Mary Stewart, who heads Year 2000 work at Total
System Services Inc. of Columbus, Ga., which handles 195 million
credit- and debit-card accounts for major banks and retailers like
Sears, Roebuck and Nordstrom.
</P>
<P>
   The Chase Manhattan Corp. and its outside consultants found just
300 errors after the bank made needed alterations to three million
lines of computer code. ``They tended to be extremely easy to
fix,'' Brian Robbins, a Chase senior vice president, said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, testing strikes Year 2000 managers whose repairs are
completed as a good bet to minimize risks, if only by increasing
confidence among business partners and consumers in general. Chase,
in fact, went so far as to pay for independent testing of the
repairs at the Alltel Corp., a key telecommunications supplier.
</P>
<P>
   No testing program can cover everything software programs do, so
managers like Ms. Stewart have allotted time to other forms of Year
2000 double-checking too, including assigning some programmers to
what could be the most mind-numbing of all follow-up work, a
process called desk checking. That is techno-speak for the job of
reading through critical code line by line to search for possible
errors that did not show up during the repair work or earlier
rounds of testing.
</P>
<P>
   In between the elaborate world of testing and the drudgery of
desk checking lie a range of other tasks for Year 2000 technical
workers finished with critical repairs. Some are repairing systems
that had been on the back burner because businesses regard them as
useful but not vital.
</P>
<P>
   CSX Technology Inc., a unit of the Richmond-based CSX Corp. that
has handled Year 2000 work for the CSX railway, its sister company,
is about to repair some desktop programs it could do without,
according to Charles Wodehouse, president of CSX Technology. Such
``dogs and cats,'' as Wodehouse calls them because they are like
old pets, produce reports or do other tasks that could be done on
newer software like Microsoft Office. But it can be a battle to
persuade managers to let the old programs die, he said.
</P>
<P>
   At some big companies, retiring programs has become a
time-consuming late-stage Year 2000 activity in its own right.
Household International, a consumer credit company in Prospect
Heights, Ill., is halfway through a two-month drive to shelve more
than 10,000 programs it replaced with new software rather than
fixing, according to Thomas Wilkie, head of the company's Year 2000
program. But the shelved programs will be archived for a year
before they are discarded.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to eliminate anything that might be used,''
Wilkie said.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkie and others are also busy repatching systems that they had
classified as ready as major software vendors like Microsoft report
previously unknown Year 2000 defects. Microsoft recently released
supplementary code, known as a patch, that represented its sixth
attempt to make its NT operating system fully compliant with Year
2000 needs.
</P>
<P>
   If a patch released by a vendor is deemed to be crucial, a
company might have to undergo a new round of testing and training.
Microsoft has been criticized because scarcely a month goes by
without announcements of newly discovered flaws in popular programs
like Windows, the NT operating system or the Excel spreadsheet, but
it has plenty of company. Software vendors have posted nearly 480
warnings of previously unreported Year 2000 flaws since early May,
according to the Infoliant Corp., a Pittsburgh firm that tracks
such data.
</P>
<P>
   A related concern _ benignly called ``clean management'' _ is
preventing the software and systems the company has worked so hard
to fix from being infected with Year 2000 problems by new, untested
software or links to the outside.
</P>
<P>
   The dangers are substantial for companies like Public Service
Enterprise Group, parent of New Jersey's largest power company.
Public Service finished Year 2000 work on its giant customer
information system in January. This year, though, Year 2000 experts
hovered anxiously as it rewrote 60 percent of the programs in the
system to prepare for utility industry deregulation. The activities
ranged from essentials like billing to helpful refinements like the
data on past contacts that telephone agents see as they greet
customers.
</P>
<P>
   Fears of corrupting clean code _ along with the need for final
testing _ are two key reasons computer users are almost universally
talking about freezing all changes in their computers at some point
this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``No programmers here are working on Year 2000 right now but
nearly everyone is rushing to complete other projects before the
freeze,'' said Ron Kerr, senior manager of information services at
Home Depot Inc., which plans to halt changes on Oct. 11. Until
sometime next year at the earliest, it may be hard to find a
computer worker immune from the gravitational pull of Y2K.

ANALYSIS: TV EXECUTIVE IS YOUNG, FEMALE AND UNEMPLOYED 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BILL CARTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For reasons that were never entirely clear to her,
Jamie Tarses, who quit last week as the top programmer for ABC, had
as much talent for attracting detractors as for choosing shows.
</P>
<P>
   All through her embattled tenure as the president of ABC's
entertainment division, detractors lobbed barbs at Ms. Tarses,
accusing her of being too young, too immature, too emotional and,
yes, too female for the job she was assigned: to find successful
shows for the network's prime-time schedule.
</P>
<P>
   That she was significantly responsible for putting hits like
``Friends'' and ``Dharma and Greg'' on the air was seldom mentioned
in these critical appraisals.
</P>
<P>
   But there apparently were not enough hits like that _ or
would-be hits like ``Sports Night'' and ``Two Guys, a Girl and a
Pizza Place,'' which also had her distinctive fingerprints on them
_ to turn around an ABC programming slump, nor to turn around the
impression that Ms. Tarses' creative talents were not enough to
make up for her management limitations.
</P>
<P>
   In one sense Ms. Tarses was handicapped by a development that
has affected everyone who runs a network programming division in
this era when all the networks are diminished: The true mega-hit,
the kind that can change the fortunes of a network and the
reputation of a programmer overnight, seems to have become a
vestige of another time, with only holdovers like ``Friends'' and
``E.R.,'' both now six years old, doing an approximation of that
lost species. But for better or worse, television executives still
label their industry ``a business of hits.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tarses herself conceded last week that she had ``made some
mistakes,'' beginning with the way she handled her departure from
NBC in 1996 to jump to ABC. That was when the onetime super agent
Michael Ovitz, newly enthroned at Walt Disney Co., ABC's parent,
guided her exit from her contract at NBC.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts she also blundered in handling the scrutiny the
press directed toward her. That started, predictably, because she
was the first woman to become a head network programmer. She
offered a tripleheader of angles for press attention: She was
young, single and attractive enough to be a player in the Hollywood
glamour game.
</P>
<P>
   Whom she was seen with in public became another factor in how
she was evaluated. This was especially so when she was seen with
the stars of some of her shows, calling into question her
objectivity. That she was also quickly rumored to be in trouble
with her bosses added a shower of additional sparks to the flame.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tarses said all the scrutiny was unfair and even cruel at
times. Not without justification, she attributed much of it to the
fact that, ``I'm not a guy, and I'm not married.''
</P>
<P>
   But for some who worked closely with Ms. Tarses, it was too
simple to write off all her struggles for professional acceptance
as a function of sexism or resentment about her appearance or her
personal life.
</P>
<P>
   Some of her colleagues at both NBC and ABC cited another
liability she carried into the job of managing a network program
department during a time of shrinking ratings and profits. This was
a perceived limitation in temperament: Ms. Tarses had, if anything,
too refined a creative vision for her own good. She was attracted
to shows that hit her own more sophisticated taste and not to those
that did not.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time Ms. Tarses did not display the kind of business
savvy that is now required in an industry where the question of who
owns the show is at least as important as who stars in it.
</P>
<P>
   One former executive who worked in the program area with her
said: ``On every creative level, Jamie made great decisions. It was
on the personal and professional and business level that she
sometimes ran into disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   As explained by some colleagues, Ms. Tarses seemed to be a
programmer with exceptional skills, but perhaps skills that
belonged at what are called niche networks _ those with a narrow
target audience, like WB, which seeks to attract women younger than
25. But she did not work for a niche network; she worked for ABC,
which is still in the business of reaching a much broader audience,
all adults between the ages of 18 and 49.
</P>
<P>
   Executives who worked with her say that Ms. Tarses had a
brilliant eye and ear for one particular type of show: the
sophisticated, urban, young-adult comedy, and something of a tin
ear for almost everything else.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was truly great at developing those sophisticated
comedies, like `Friends,''' said Warren Littlefield, who was her
principal mentor when he was president of NBC's entertainment
division. ``The writers felt a kindred soul and champion in her.
She was very good at working with written material and had a strong
eye for casting.''
</P>
<P>
   But he added that her detractors had a different opinion: ``To
them she seemed to display the feeling that if you didn't belong to
the hip, single club, then you didn't exist.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As one example, Littlefield cited her lack of enthusiasm for one
of the staples of network comedy. ``Jamie didn't go for family
comedy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even as she began her days at ABC, Ms. Tarses articulated her
vision as one that accepted her youth and personal taste as
advantages. ``My sensibility is the sensibility that people seem to
want to see,'' she said in 1996. ``The shows I helped develop are
the shows I want to watch, the shows I will show up at home for.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of Ms. Tarses' staff members said in subsequent
conversations that the only shows they really liked were shows that
centered on people like them: young city dwellers with active
social lives.
</P>
<P>
   But other viewers were watching other sorts of shows, like
``Home Improvement,'' which had been ABC's biggest hit and was
never duplicated either in style or popularity under Ms. Tarses.
</P>
<P>
   One senior ABC executive said last week that Ms. Tarses had been
less enthusiastic than her boss, Stu Bloomberg, about ABC's
decision to put on the game show ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,''
which has become a phenomenon this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stu was totally passionate about it,'' the executive said.
But, the executive added, this was the type of show that didn't
click as instantly with Ms. Tarses' sensibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Bloomberg, the chairman of ABC entertainment, had worked out a
comfortable working relationship with Ms. Tarses. That dynamic
changed when Disney reorganized its entertainment structure to
merge the company's television studio with the network
entertainment division last month.
</P>
<P>
   The decision led to conflicts over duties and prerogatives with
the studio head, Lloyd Braun. Ms. Tarses, disappointed with the
changes, chose to resign.
</P>
<P>
   For all the criticism, Ms. Tarses had enough ability to leave
ABC in what is, by most accounts, considerably better shape than
when she arrived. Similarly, NBC seemed to suffer, especially in
the comedy area, after she left.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tarses said she believed ABC was poised to make a leap
forward this season. That is the kind of promise programmers tend
to make every season; but advertisers, among others, seem to agree,
having backed ABC's shows with a sizable increase of dollars this
fall.
</P>
<P>
   But if ABC does show improvement this season, Ms. Tarses expects
none of the credit. She knows the game too well for that.

   JERUSALEM _ The Whopper has become embroiled in Middle Eastern
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Late last week, Burger King International asked its Israeli
franchise holder to remove the company's brand name from a
three-month-old hamburger stand in a new mall in Maale Adumim, the
largest Jewish settlement in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli company, Rikamor Ltd., said Sunday it refused to do
so, proudly defending its right to proffer kosher Whoppers at a
food court in disputed territory.
</P>
<P>
   What Burger King International, a Miami-based unit of the
British company Diageo PLC, professes to see as a purely commercial
issue _ a quarrel with a franchisee _ is quickly turning into a
heated political confrontation and a public relations nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   First, earlier this summer, Arab-American groups protested the
establishment of an Israeli-owned Burger King in the West Bank.
They led scattered demonstrations at Burger King restaurants in the
United States and started a boycott of the company for what they
saw as a business act legitimizing Israeli settlement in land
claimed by the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after Burger King's decision on Thursday to cancel its
franchise contract for the shop in Maale Adumim, Jewish groups are
accusing the company of capitulating to Arab pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hamburgers and fast food are a symbol of America, and what
Burger King is doing, submitting to blackmail, is un-American,''
said Abraham H. Foxman, director of the Anti-Defamation League of
B'nai B'rith.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli settler leaders _ supported by some American Jews who
showed up at a small rally in Maale Adumim on Sunday, including
Noach Dear, a New York City Councilman from Brooklyn _ are
promising their own boycott if the company does not backdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``From here on in, we are not going anywhere near a single one
of that hamburger chain's restaurants,'' said an editorial Sunday
in Hatzofe, the National Religious Party's newspaper. ``After all,
we are not starving to death.''
</P>
<P>
   Burger King officials say the Israeli franchisee, Rikamor Ltd.,
deceived them when it sought and received approval to open a
restaurant in Maale Adumim.
</P>
<P>
   By listing the settlement's address as Maale Adumim, Israel,
instead of Maale Adumim, West Bank, or Occupied Territories, the
Israelis deliberately misled Burger King in their formal
application, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that the location was misrepresented,'' Robert A.
Doughty, Burger King's vice president for public relations and
communication, said in an interview Sunday in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Doughty said Burger King believed a misrepresentation had been
made because the Israeli franchisee knew that an application to
open a restaurant in the West Bank would be denied.
</P>
<P>
   ``They asked us 12 to 18 months ago if we would approve a
restaurant in the occupied territory,'' Doughty said. ``We told
them we would not, because of the sensitivities in that area,
because at this stage of the peace process there are issues related
to that land that are too complicated for us to get involved in.''
</P>
<P>
   Burger King International did perform a site inspection before
granting the Israelis approval to open the franchise in Maale
Adumim, which is a bedroom community for Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   But the inspector came from the company's office in the Persian
Gulf emirate of Dubai and it was not clear to him, or made clear to
him, that he was visiting a mall in a West Bank settlement, Doughty
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no sign that says, `You are now entering occupied
territory,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Roni Rahav, a spokesman for Rikamor, said that he would not
discuss the details of the franchise relationship or the Maale
Adumim store. He said only that Meshulam Riklis, the Los
Angeles-based businessman who owns the company, would not close it
or remove the Burger King name.
</P>
<P>
   Doughty said the fact that Maale Adumim was located in the West
Bank first came to Burger King's attention through a Bloomberg News
story in early July, a couple of months after the restaurant _
really a booth in a food court _had opened. An investigation was
begun by Burger King's European division. It eventually determined
that Rikamor had breached its franchise contract.
</P>
<P>
   The Burger King official said Riklis subsequently promised twice
to shut the restaurant. After he did not, Burger King made its
decision late last week to cancel the franchise, a decision that
Doughty insists had nothing to do with the Arab-American and Muslim
boycott of Burger King.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was an internal commercial matter,'' he said. ``We are
not political. We're in the business of selling Whoppers, fries and
Cokes. Period.''
</P>
<P>
   But Arab and Muslim groups received the news as a validation of
their protest campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an example of what American Muslims can achieve if we
work together toward a common goal,'' said Ali R. Abuzaakouk, the
director of the American Muslim Council. ``The community spoke out
and Burger King listened.''
</P>
<P>
   Some leaders of the American Jewish community saw in this an
echo of the days before 1995, when the Arab economic boycott of
Israel frightened many American companies from investing in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``They always couched it as a commercial decision then, too,''
Foxman said.
</P>
<P>
   But Doughty pointed out that there were 46 Burger Kings in
Israel, including one in Jerusalem, and that the first had been
established before the Arab boycott had been called off.
</P>
<P>
   The company also operates 84 Burger Kings in the Persian Gulf
states and sees the Arab Middle East as a target market for
expansion.

WHEN SENATORS BECAME TEXAS RANGERS: BIG-LEAGUE BASEBALL COMES TO
NORTH TEXAS

<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Dick Bosman sat in the home clubhouse at RFK
Stadium after the last game of the 1971 season, glumly watching his
Washington teammates clean out their lockers.
</P>
<P>
   The usual melancholy of another lousy season, another year of
loss piled upon loss, was augmented by the knowledge that never
again would this group of players meet in this clubhouse, in this
ballpark, in this city.
</P>
<P>
   The Senators were pulling up stakes, moving to Arlington where
they would reconvene as the Texas Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sat in that clubhouse until the last guy left,'' Bosman
said. ``I just sat there and watched everybody go. On the one hand,
it was resignation, and on the other hand, there was some regret
that we were going. Some of us felt some guilt about not playing
better and not drawing more people.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senators began play in 1961 as an expansion team, but never
progressed past infancy. They had just one winning season, and with
attendance lagging, owner Bob Short decided to move the club to
Texas after receiving permission from American League owners on
Sept. 20, 1971.
</P>
<P>
   It was not a popular decision with the players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd had my first good years in Washington, my wife is from the
suburbs of Washington and we made a lot of friends there in the six
years I played there,'' said Bosman, who is now the Rangers'
pitching coach. ``I was bitter about it. My wife's parents were
there, and it was a very comfortable setting for us. In the early
'70s, Washington was a nice town to play in.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Grieve didn't play in Washington in 1971, but he did as a
rookie in 1970. He was a former first-round draft pick who was out
of minor-league options, so he was excited about his chances of
making the big-league club in '72. But Grieve, born and raised in
New England, was not thrilled about moving to Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really liked the idea of playing in Washington,'' Grieve
said. ``It wasn't that far from Massachusetts where I grew up, we
had a nice stadium, and the tradition and history of Washington was
appealing to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only were the Senators leaving a nice ballpark in a city
they liked, but they were moving to a place many considered the
wild frontier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't flunk geography or anything, but I had no clue what
this place looked like,'' Bosman said. ``I thought it was sand and
cactus and a bunch of cattle running around.''
</P>
<P>
   When the team arrived in Arlington the players discovered the
town didn't belong in a John Wayne western.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once here, it was very shortly afterward that everybody
realized what a great opportunity it was to be a new team in North
Texas,'' Grieve said. ``Several guys bought houses here and wanted
to stay here. It didn't take long for everybody to really like it
here. Very few people were disappointed when they got here and saw
everything this area had to offer.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the players had a nice area, the area didn't have much
of a team. The move was not an elixir to cure what ailed the
franchise. In a season delayed a week by a players' strike over
pension benefits, the Rangers went 54-100 and finished last in the
AL West, 381/2 games behind first-place Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   The area greeted its first big-league baseball club with a yawn.
A meager 20,105 showed up at Arlington Stadium for the home opener
on April 21, 1972, when the Rangers defeated the Angels, 7-6. The
season attendance was 662,974.
</P>
<P>
   ``There wasn't much of a big-league atmosphere at the time,''
Grieve said. ``The people who came were enthusiastic, and the guys
appreciated that small group. But it took awhile to catch on.''
</P>
<P>
   The team wasn't very good, they played in a minor-league
ballpark, the heat could be oppressive and the population largely
ignored the new club. But in other ways, the move was positive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't think of too many negative things, other than we lost
a lot,'' Bosman said. ``We were a very close-knit club. There were
five or six couples that were very close. We used to go to Eagle
Mountain Lake and do things, we'd play cards or go to Joe T.
Garcia's. There are a lot of fond memories when it comes to the
closeness of the club.''

IN THE NATION'S CAPITAL, THE NATIONAL PASTIME STRUCK OUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DON BOWMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The 1970s were a time of awareness. We learned that reality
wasn't always what we had believed.
</P>
<P>
   We discovered that our government sometimes didn't tell the
truth, that wars weren't always black and white and that students
weren't safe on campus. It was a time when the individual gained a
voice and the world gained (shudder) disco.
</P>
<P>
   Terrorism changed our concept of the Olympics in 1972. Strikes
hit sport, and the concept of players playing an entire career with
the same team started to change.
</P>
<P>
   For me, however, it wasn't as wide-reaching as all of that. In
1971, for the first time, I learned about betrayal. And I learned
about heroes.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, I had been betrayed before, of course. By friends telling on
me to authority figures, by girlfriends (sigh), by my brother,
constantly.
</P>
<P>
   But never before by something I believed in with all my heart.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball made me a cynic.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1969 season, the Washington Senators finished 86-76.
Attendance was up, the fans were excited, the team had promise.
</P>
<P>
   But a series of bad deals took the Senators from that 1969
record to 63-96 in 1971. As the team got worse, the ticket prices
got higher, and not surprisingly, the attendance dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Owner Bob Short, however, who engineered most of the deals and
raised the ticket prices, used the low attendance as a reason for
his move to Arlington. And the major-league owners, perhaps in
hopes of getting rid of Short, approved the move.
</P>
<P>
   The enormity of losing the team, however, didn't really hit home
until Sept. 30, 1971 _ the last game for major-league baseball in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Most of us who attended that game believed we'd have another
team. But like many things in the '70s, we were misled.
</P>
<P>
   In the final game, against the New York Yankees, the Senators
drew 14,460. There had been a lot in the Washington newspapers
about boycotting the game, but we wanted to say goodbye _ to
baseball, to the Senators, and especially to Frank Howard.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine the popularity of Ivan Rodriguez here. It pales in
comparison to how Washington felt about Howard. He wasn't a great
player, but he epitomized class. He always hustled, hit Mark
McGwire-length home runs, and would never turn away a fan.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees jumped on Washington ace Dick Bosman (if you can
have an ace when you're 63-96) and took a 5-1 lead. But in the
bottom of the sixth, Howard electrified the crowd with a long home
run that sparked a four-run inning, tying the game.
</P>
<P>
   In the bottom of the seventh, the game was stopped momentarily
when a couple of fans ran out on the field to shake hands with some
of the Washington players.
</P>
<P>
   In the eighth, several more fans reached the field, but again,
after a short time, the game continued. And with the help of two
Yankees errors, Washington scored two runs in the bottom of the
eighth for a 7-5 lead. In the ninth, reliever Joe Grzenda got out
Felipe Alou and Bobby Murcer and baseball had just one out left in
the nation's capital.
</P>
<P>
   It never got it.
</P>
<P>
   The fans swarmed the field, determined to grab a part of
history. Grass was torn up, bases were taken, scoreboard lights
were stolen.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't go on the field, but I watched it all. I had grown up a
Washington Senators fan, and I didn't want it to end.
</P>
<P>
   But my mental image of the night was of calm, not fury. Standing
by the dugout, Howard, surrounded by fans, signed autographs.
</P>
<P>
   One after another he signed slips of paper, always with a word
to the fan, always with a smile. There were reports that he stayed
long after the game to talk to fans and sign his name. The next
day, the Washington papers reported that he couldn't stop crying as
the fans said goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   I was betrayed by the sport, but not by the players. Howard
typified the best of them. Even now, in this era of money-hungry
athletes, there are still heroes.
</P>
<P>
   If only they were in Washington.

   One was the team of the decade _ the other, the team of the
ages.
</P>
<P>
   The Pittsburgh Steelers were the dominant team of the 1970s,
winning three Super Bowls (and capturing another in January of
1980). For one season, the Miami Dolphins did something no NFL team
had done before _ or since _ go undefeated for a season.
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins had a reason to expect success in the 1972 season.
They had won the AFC championship the year before and lost to the
Cowboys in Super Bowl VI, 24-3. A strong ground game, keyed by
Mercury Morris and Larry Csonka, was expected to give the Dolphins
another solid season, but not even the biggest Miami fan could have
expected what was to come.
</P>
<P>
   After two easy victories, the Minnesota Vikings extended the
Dolphins in the third game of the season, before Miami pulled out a
16-14 decision. But after that, only two games (a 24-23 victory
over the Buffalo Bills and a 28-24 decision over the New York Jets)
were close during the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   It got a little tougher in the playoffs as the Dolphins scored
the winning touchdown with 4:56 to play to defeat Cleveland, 20-14,
then rallied to defeat Pittsburgh (of course), in the AFC title
game, 21-17.
</P>
<P>
   In Super Bowl VII, against the Washington Redskins, the Dolphins
turned to their defense and it came through. The Redskins were
limited to 228 yards total offense, their only points coming on a
turnover, as Miami won, 14-7, and completed their 17-0 season.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Steelers lost the AFC title game that season, it
was one of their few failures of the decade. After going 11-17 the
first two seasons of the decades, the Steelers were 88-27-1 in
regular season games the rest of the 70s. They won Super Bowls in
1975, 1976 and 1979, and after going 12-4 in the 1979 regular
season they won Super Bowl XIV, which was played in January of
1980.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Bradshaw was the quarterback on all three championship
teams, and was named the MVP in Super Bowl XIII when he threw four
TD passes in Pittsburgh's 35-31 victory over the Cowboys.
RUNNERS-UP Oakland A's: Led by Reggie Jackson, Catfish Hunter,
Rollie Fingers and a team that rarely got along with each other,
the A's won three consecutive World Series titles, from 1972-74.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas Cowboys: The Cowboys won two Super Bowls and went to six
NFC Championship Games during the decade.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA men's basketball team: The Bruins won the first four
championships in the 1970s and won a fifth in 1975. UCLA's
domination of the sport came over a two-decade period as the Bruins
also won five of the final six titles in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Montreal Canadiens: The Canadiens won six titles in the 70s,
including the final four in a row. In those four seasons, they lost
a total of three games in the Stanley Cup Finals.

ATHLETE OF THE DECADE: ROGER STAUBACH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   To some, he was ``Captain Comeback'' and to other others, he was
``Roger the Dodger.'' Regardless of the moniker, Roger Staubach was
a winner.
</P>
<P>
   Staubach was the central player for the Cowboys in a decade in
which they moved to another level of excellence in the NFL. In the
1971 season, his third in the league, Staubach led the Cowboys to
the Super Bowl VI, where they defeated Miami, 24-3.
</P>
<P>
   In the '70s, Staubach led the Cowboys to six NFC Championship
Games, where they won four, and four Super Bowls, where they won
two, and Staubach was a five-time Pro Bowl choice.
</P>
<P>
   Staubach was usually at his best in the clutch, leading the
Cowboys to 23 comeback victories, including 14 in the final two
minutes or in overtime. Perhaps he gave no more famous performance
than the one on Dec. 28, 1975.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys were trailing the Vikings 14-10 with 32 seconds
remaining in a first-round NFC playoff game. The ball was on the
50, and it was second-and-10 for the Cowboys. Staubach sent wide
receiver Drew Pearson deep and lofted a ``Hail Mary'' pass in
Pearson's direction. After jostling with Vikings cornerback Nate
Wright, Pearson pinned the ball between his elbow and his hip at
the 5 and jogged into the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drew made the play happen,'' Staubach said after the game.
``It was more of the catch than the pass that won the game. I threw
it long and high, and that gave him a chance to catch the ball. ...
With all the defenders back there, it was the catch that made the
play.'' \Nsubheds:HONORABLE MENTION Mark Spitz: In an eight-day
span at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, Spitz won seven gold
medals in swimming and set seven world records. He also won the
1971 Sullivan Award as amateur athlete of the year. Spitz returned
to the United States as a national hero _ 300,000 life-sized
posters of him with his seven gold medals around his neck were sold
throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Bench: Was the dominant catcher in baseball in the '70s,
playing in nine of 10 All-Star Games. He was selected to play in
the other, but was injured. Bench hit 290 home runs and had 1,103
runs batted in. He was National League Most Valuable Player in 1970
and 1972 and was World Series MVP in 1976. He played in six League
Championship Series and four World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Bradshaw: Was the first player selected in the 1970 NFL
draft and eventually led the Steelers to seven AFC Central and four
Super Bowl titles in the '70s. He was most valuable player in Super
Bowls XIII and XIV and was AFC player of the year in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Reggie Jackson: Probably baseball's biggest celebrity in the
'70s, he became the only player to be named Most Valuable Player in
two World Series (1973, 1977) and won the American League MVP in
1973. He hit 292 home runs and had 922 runs batted in the decade
and played in eight American League Championship Series and five
World Series.

1970S INNOVATION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPORTS LABOR The 1970s were noted for the rise in sports labor,
particular in Major League Baseball and the National Football
League.
</P>
<P>
   The gateway to money was opened when pitchers Andy Messersmith
and Dave McNally played without contracts in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Free agency was born as a result of their actions when a federal
court upheld a previous ruling by abritrator Peter Seitz. Players
could shop around their talents.
</P>
<P>
   After a brief lockout by owners in 1976, both the players and
owners agreed to allow six-year veterans become free agents. As a
result sports salaries have increased exponentially leading to
nomadic careers.
</P>
<P>
   A sports labor timeline:
</P>
<P>
   1969 - Players Association boss Marvin Miller announces massive
holdouts in spring training, the first joint action by the union.
They win major pension concessions from the owners and confidence
is born in their fledging union.
</P>
<P>
   1970 - Former Cardinals outfielder Curt Flood, opposed to being
traded to Philadelphia, sues baseball and the antitrust exemption.
The case goes all the way to the Supreme Court and Flood loses, but
he has shown others the way.
</P>
<P>
   1972 - Baseball players conduct the first strike in professional
sports history, again over the pension. Again the players stun the
owners with their unity and the strike is settled in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   1973 - Salary arbitration is instituted in an attempt to end
spring training holdouts.
</P>
<P>
   1974 - Oakland pitcher Jim ``Catfish'' Hunter wins free agent in
a contract dispute with owner Charlie Finley. He eventually gets a
whopping five-year, $3.75 million contract from the Yankees and the
players discover what free agency s really worth.
</P>
<P>
   1975 - In the most momentous decision in sports history,
arbitrator Peter Seitz strikes down baseball's reserve clause,
which ties players to their old club ``forever.'' Pitchers Andy
Messerschmidt and Dave McNally are made free agents.
</P>
<P>
   1976 - The Players Association and owners negotiate a new basic
agreement that allows free agency after six years service time.
Football 1968 - The owners counter the Players Association threat
of a strike by locking them out in spring training. The stalemate
is broken quickly as the players are given pension concessions and
a two-year deal.
</P>
<P>
   1970 - This time the lockout last two weeks but the players hang
tough, only 19 of 1,300 veterans report to camp. A four-year deal
is reached.
</P>
<P>
   1974 - The players, looking for unrestricted free agency, strike
right before training camp. It lasts until Aug. 14. A two-week
truce is called and the union decides to stay on the job. But no
agreement is reached.
</P>
<P>
   1977 - The Rozelle Rule is struck down, which gave the
commissioner the right to decide free agent compensation if the two
teams involved couldn't. The players have won unrestricted free
agency.
</P>
<P>
   1977 - The players sell free agency back to the owner for an
increase in benefits and other monetary claims. It is the best deal
ever negotiated by an ownership group in sports. INNOVATIONS
Designated hitter: In 1973, baseball's American League set another
trend by implementing the designated-hitter rule. The result was
increased scoring, extended careers and decades of disagreements
between the National League and American.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tommy John Surgery'': Tommy John was a veteran left-handed
pitcher for Los Angeles when he tore the ulnar collateral ligament
in his left elbow in 1974. He became a medical pioneer when Dr.
Frank Jobe transplanted a tendon from his right arm to repair the
damage.
</P>
<P>
   After rehabilitation, John resumed his career in 1976. Upon his
return, he was even more effective than before _ he pitched 14 more
seasons in the major leagues, during which he compiled a 164-125
record (he was 124-106 before the surgery). He won 20 games three
times in his first five seasons back on the mound.
</P>
<P>
   Colors: Not so effective were teams' use of the glow-in-the-dark
colors and experiments with futuristic uniforms. Houston used its
orange and blue combinations while the White Sox played briefly
with colored shirts and even shorts. Oakland owner Charlie Finley
unsuccessfully promoted his orange-colored baseball.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ A car dealer here is making a big push into leasing
used cars to poor people with no credit or bad credit. But the
deals come with streetwise terms: Miss a payment and the car won't
start.
</P>
<P>
   The dealer, Mel Farr, the former Detroit Lions football player,
leases the cars to anyone who can come up with at least $50 a week.
The catch is that a payment is due every Friday night, and
customers must pay up each week to get the code they need to punch
into a device attached to the dashboard. Otherwise, the car stays
parked.
</P>
<P>
   So, does that make Farr an angel for making cars available to
those who otherwise couldn't afford them, for giving people a
reliable way to get to work and an opportunity to reestablish their
credit? Doing business with him isn't cheap: Car buyers who qualify
for bank loans can borrow at about 9 percent, and Farr charges more
than twice that on comparable leases to customers with the coded
device. So, does that make him a vulture getting top dollar for
old, beat-up cars by preying on those who have nowhere else to
turn?
</P>
<P>
   It depends on whom you talk to. Farr, the owner of the Mel Farr
Automotive Group, said the unusual arrangement is a boon to
inner-city residents who might otherwise have to rely on spotty
public transportation _ or their feet. Customers seem to be
generally satisfied, though two have filed a lawsuit contending
that their engines shut down as they were driving the cars.
</P>
<P>
   Farr's biggest supporters are the country's political and
economic elite. Prodded by the Rev. Jesse Jackson, Wall Street
recently showered Farr's company, the biggest
African-American-owned business in the United States, with $36.5
million in new financing that enables him to expand in urban
markets. And, in a public-relations coup last month, President
Clinton publicly thanked him for bringing cars ``to every community
in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Some critics, though, portray Farr less as a do-gooder than an
exploiter. ``It is a no-fault system of consumer oppression by an
auto dealer who should know better,'' said Ralph Nader, the
consumer advocate. ``It is an electronic form of consumer
servitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Nader objected to Farr's interest rates, which fall between 22
and 25 percent, and to his marketing to people so desperate for
transportation that ``they'll take anything.'' He also worried
about the danger of an accident if the devices malfunctioned.
</P>
<P>
   Farr, a media hound who plays a ``superstar'' in his own
commercials, wearing a red sequined cape and flying, brushed off
such criticisms, insisting he is giving access to credit to people
no one else will lend to. ``It would be cheaper for them to have
good credit,'' he said. And cutting off the juice is a time-honored
tradition in this country, he added. ``You don't have to have good
credit to have lights and electricity,'' he said. ``If you don't
pay your light bill, they will cut it off _ they don't care what
you've got in your refrigerator or how cold it is outside.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``on-time'' devices on his cars are necessary, he said, to
insure that people who have a track record of not paying their
bills pay up. He contended that it was impossible for the apparatus
to shut off the engine while a car was running. Moreover, he said
the leases were properly priced because ``the risk justifies it,''
and they were within the confines of Michigan laws, which allow
charges of up to 25 percent. ``I'm not taking advantage of the
customer and they're not taking advantage of me,'' Farr said.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview last week, Jackson defended Farr's
unorthodox leases, saying that while the interest rates are high,
they are legal and they are a good first step to bringing credit
where none is available now. ``As we seek to greenline these
redlined zones, you must introduce access and then competition and
then bring prices down _ that's the way our system works,'' Jackson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Since late June, when the deals were first offered, 280 people
have signed up, most here in Detroit and the rest in the Dayton,
Ohio, area. None are behind on their payments, according to the
company. And many of those questioned about the leases seemed
perfectly content.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you come in walking, you don't squawk,'' said Detroiter
Betty Ware, who had ridden the bus to the dealership to lease a
bright red 1995 Ford Aspire for $77 a week.
</P>
<P>
   She didn't go to Mel Farr's dealership first; she went to the
one she knew had overcharged her for her last car. But they wanted
$5,000 down for a used Chevrolet Blazer, more than she could
afford. ``I don't have the best credit in the world,'' she said.
``When you don't have great credit, you usually deal with who will
deal with you.'' She said she didn't mind the on-time device.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Sandelin, 46, who had just signed up to buy a black 1993
Ford Ranger pickup, said he actually liked Farr's system. ``It is
easy for me to get delinquent in payments because I often
procrastinate,'' said Sandelin, a Detroiter who builds Chryslers on
the morning shift at a suburban factory and has been riding to work
with a friend in his neighborhood for the past few months.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   He came to Mel Farr's dealership because he heard a radio
advertisement saying that those with bad credit could still buy a
car. Sandelin said a divorce had left him owing back taxes and
other debts that led him to declare bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Zarbaugh, 38, was more fatalistic. ``I think it is all
right, I guess,'' said Zarbaugh, who owns a business installing
carpets and tiles and has never taken out a loan. ``If you plan on
making your payments, it is no big deal.'' Because he knew he had
no credit history, he came to Mel Farr's dealership after seeing a
sign out front that said ``we finance anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit concerning the on-time device was filed by two women
who blamed the contraption for shutting off their engines. The
women, who had made their payments on time, are seeking revocation
of their leases as well as unspecified damages, and they want the
dealership barred from using the devices.
</P>
<P>
   According to their lawsuit, the women were not told that their
cars would carry the devices until after they had given the
dealership their down payments.
</P>
<P>
   Their lawyer, Kenneth Hylton, said the women had gone separately
to Farr's dealership to buy cars but had been told that they lacked
good credit and were instead steered toward leasing cars with the
on-time device. ``They were desperate for transportation,'' Hylton
said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   One of the plaintiffs, Chavela Jones, 21, who pays $75.96 a week
to lease a light blue 1991 Ford Escort, said that as she was
driving along the freeway with her three-month-old son, she heard
the on-time device click, and suddenly found herself coasting along
in the far left lane. ``Cars are just whizzing by _ trucks and cars
_ and I'm in a little bitty Escort,'' she recalled. She threw the
car into neutral and was able to restart the engine as it rolled
along. But the engine shut off again and again, she said, and she
repeated the procedure to get off the freeway safely.
</P>
<P>
   She told the dealership she'd had repeated trouble with the
device since getting the car July 24, and they replaced it Aug. 3,
she said. Since then, she's had no problems with the device, but
fears it will malfunction again. She also said she felt humiliated
by the experience. ``I just don't feel like I should be treated
like a second-class citizen,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The other plaintiff, Mandy Bergeron, leased a red 1994 Ford
Probe that shut down three times, according to the lawsuit _ twice
on a freeway and once at work.
</P>
<P>
   Farr, through a spokeswoman, insisted that the on-time payment
device was not to blame, saying there could have been a mechanical
problem with the used cars that caused the vehicles' engines to cut
off.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Simon, who invented the gadget and is the vice president
of its maker, Payment Protection Systems Inc. in Temecula, Calif.,
said, ``Our system is designed to be fail safe.''
</P>
<P>
   The mechanism can be attached to the car's starter or the car's
ignition circuit, he explained. If it is linked to the starter
circuit, it functions only when the car is started, not when it is
running. If it is hooked up to the ignition, the computerized
device monitors the ignition line for voltage, which indicates the
car is running. It only activates the signal that keeps the car
from starting when it finds the ignition line is inactive _ that
is, when the car is turned off, Simon said. ``This is not a
dangerous system.''
</P>
<P>
   Other customers are content driving around with the gizmo.
Starlene Blevins, 25, said she'd had no problems with the burgundy
1994 Mercury Tracer she got in mid-July. ``It's been working fine _
although my note has been paid always,'' said Ms. Blevins. She
adds, though, that when her friends see the blinking lights on the
dashboard that remind drivers that a payment is due, they say that
``I'm crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The devices have been in use for about two years, and they have
drawn limited interest from car dealers; Farr is the largest user,
and most others are tiny ``buy here, pay here lots,'' said Simon.
He said his company has sold about 1,000 of the devices in the past
nine months for $189 each. Other companies make similar devices,
and perhaps 15,000 to 20,000 are on the streets, he said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Farr, who last month accompanied Clinton on a tour of
poverty-stricken communities like East St. Louis and the Watts
neighborhood of Los Angeles, has been part of Jackson's effort to
prod Wall Street into lending more to companies owned by
minorities. On Aug. 20, Farr raised $36.5 million in a private
placement. About $13 million of that money will be used to fund
approximately 1,200 additional leases for customers who qualify for
the on-time device, with the rest used to pay down existing debt
from his finance company.
</P>
<P>
   Farr said he had a hard time persuading investors to back his
deal. He had originally hoped to raise $45 million, and had
expected the deal to close early last month. Getting the deal done
was ``the toughest thing I've ever had to do in my entire life,''
said Farr, because ``I happen to be black and I happen to want to
do business in the community that they say won't pay you.''
</P>
<P>
   To inspire customers to pay up, Farr shows them a video of
himself giving money-management tips. Farr appears in his trademark
tan suit and red cape and urges those on a limited budget not to
waste money on fancy hairstyles, manicures, clothes or fast food.
Those who pay on time for a year are promised the chance to trade
up to a nicer car. So far, many customers are paying three payments
ahead of time, to be sure their cars will start.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't pay us, I'll do everything in my power to find
you and take my car back,'' Farr says sternly in the video. ``So
make the most of this opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   After all, he is. ``I see no competition,'' Farr said. ``They
are customers that no one wants.''

   KATSURAO, Japan _ A bit nervously, Haruo Saito faced his doctor.
Saito, 78, short and slow-moving since his stroke a few years ago,
had already had a blood-pressure check and an electrocardiogram,
and now he reported that he had been dizzy lately.
</P>
<P>
   The doctor, Shuichi Shigetomi, listened politely, but he was a
bit stiff and showed no warmth in his bedside manner _ which was
not entirely surprising, since he was 30 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   The consultation took place over a videophone and a small
electronic monitoring box put in Saito's home in Katsurao, a tiny
town in the hills about 160 miles northeast of Tokyo. The checkup
demonstrated that even after a decade of humiliating recession and
stagnation, Japan has a knack for turning up unexpected ways to
harness technology and create surprising new ways to pamper the
consumer.
</P>
<P>
   Mention Japan these days, and one thinks of tumbling property
prices and tumbling egos, a struggling stock market and rigid
regulation, bad bank loans and caterpillarlike consensus
management. But the overall economic and financial catastrophe in
Japan is obscuring a metamorphosis that is slowly taking shape here
in mood and method, particularly in technologies that make life
more convenient and alter the way companies do business.
</P>
<P>
   Take the new mobile videophone from Kyocera. Or the new
microwave from Sharp that automatically cooks from recipes found on
the Internet. Or the new washing machine with an 18-minute cycle
that scrubs people instead of clothes. Or the nifty personal
locators that fit into a pocket and use satellite data to generate
a map showing one's whereabouts.
</P>
<P>
   Global positioning systems may be an American invention, but
many Japanese mothers use them as locators that fax maps to them
showing the whereabouts of their children or elderly parents.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's last wave of successes was with cars and audiovisual
products and, in the 1970s and '80s, with Walkmans and sedans and
compact-disc players. That wave has largely run its course, and now
Japanese companies are scrambling to race ahead of the rest of the
world by reaching into millions of homes and transforming their
kitchens, bathrooms, televisions and every other aspect of life in
an aging society.
</P>
<P>
   There is, of course, no guarantee that these futuristic devices
will catch on with consumers or that technology or the market will
not shift in other, unanticipated directions. But Japan has always
been a king in new gadgetry, even though it has lagged in the
Internet and in information technology and is struggling to catch
up to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In the process of recapturing its technological prowess, experts
say, Japan is coming up with original applications and snazzy
designs that may once again captivate the world.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, the experts say, executives are taking on more
risk, dancing around bureaucrats and becoming increasingly
entrepreneurial, as the government unfetters industries ranging
from finance to telecommunications. If the momentum grows, it might
help cultivate the spirit of creation that will help Japan reinvent
an economy that is threatening to wind down in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the U.S. saw five years ago is around the corner,'' said
Kenichi Ohmae, an author and business consultant, referring to the
shift in spirit and a growing surge in technologies. ``I can even
hear the roar of the tidal wave.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dynamics
</P>
<P>
   Video Prescriptions and Robotic Pets
</P>
<P>
   There is no country like Japan when it comes to fusing and
cross-fertilizing technologies to create something new, and as a
country, it often gains the largest bounty of patents each year.
The United States almost always invents the new paradigms, but
Japan often transforms them into popular new products.
</P>
<P>
   Take toilet technology, for instance. Japan took the mundane
American toilet and added bells and whistles, not to mention water
sprays and hot-air jets. Japanese companies took videophones and
electrocardiogram technology, also spearheaded in the United
States, and twisted them into a special new form of telemedicine in
the village of Katsurao. They are also miniaturizing their own
robotic technology to produce robotic dogs and cats, especially as
companions for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   Now, imagine marrying the playfulness of Japan's
three-dimensional video games with the convenience and commercial
opportunity of online shopping. It is still on the drawing board,
but Ohmae says that instead of clicking and shooting down the
enemy, consumers will be clicking and putting the bread into a
shopping cart.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Japan dominates some key electronics businesses, like
household appliances, where much change is poised to take place,
and Japanese companies are forging alliances with American
companies like Microsoft and Sun Microsystems to secure leadership
roles in the next generation of technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Some economists also believe that Japan is now moving more
resolutely to deregulate its economy, by liberalizing brokerage
commissions, easing the way for new entrants in some industries and
eliminating some licensing rules. Alongside the new technologies,
they say, these moves will usher in an era of greater dynamism,
innovation, and profitability in many sectors of the Japanese
economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those innovations come out of a process of a lot of people
beating on you to make sure you're using your capital
efficiently,'' said Robert Alan Feldman, chief economist at Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter in Tokyo. ``As you deregulate markets, the
return to a good invention goes up and so people start having more
good inventions.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Uncertain Road
</P>
<P>
   Playing Catch-up for High Stakes
</P>
<P>
   Still, even experts disagree on how far Japan will go, and
critics say it has a great deal of catching up to do. Moreover,
there is no guarantee that these new technologies can help restore
Japan's faded economic prowess, and no one today sees Japan as a
colossus ready to take over the world, a view that was common just
a decade ago. In fact Japan's record in technology has been
embarrassing lately.
</P>
<P>
   It invested enormous sums in high-definition television, in an
advanced ``fifth-generation computer'' project, in small-scale
industrial robotics and other areas, with few of these huge
investments proving commercially successful.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Japan has yet to find its niche in the world's new
Internet framework, and in recent years it has lagged in the
hottest new advances in information, biotechnology and
environmental technologies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been totally defeated by U.S. technologies,'' said
Nobuhiro Muroya, a deputy director of strategy at the Science and
Technology Agency. ``But we want to find the possibility of a big
win the next time around.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Japan remains the world's largest net exporter, and many
of the goods it exports are the product of clever manufacturing by
Japanese companies that have usually paid for 80 percent of the
cost of research and development in new technologies, on the theory
that the market knows best where to invest.
</P>
<P>
   While the government does not expect to alter that balance
dramatically, its last five-year plan for science and technology,
which runs to the year 2000, set aside about $150 billion for
scientific projects. And bureaucrats are pressing to pour still
more money into key areas like genetics, information and the
environment. Taking a cue from the United States, the government is
also trying to build bridges between companies and universities,
where many original ideas are generated.
</P>
<P>
   But the market is still likely to drive technology better and
faster than Japan's bureaucrats. A good place to see what is
brewing in the marketplace is the house of the future built by
Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., a showroom for its cutting-edge
technologies. This model house has devices that are now very
expensive but that Matsushita expects to become affordable soon,
perhaps in a couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   At the front door, the moving picture of a visitor is sent to
screens in each room, and if no one is home, the image is recorded
and dropped into a home server, a storage center for the
computerized, Internet-linked home. In the living room, a 50-inch
plasma-display television is a miniature theater-style screen
offering video-on-demand, electronic shopping and travel booking,
and family-calendar planning.
</P>
<P>
   In the children's bedroom, online education allows children to
participate in classroom discussions and view themselves and other
students asking questions.
</P>
<P>
   In the bathroom, a health-monitoring toilet seat can measure a
person's weight and body-fat ratio, and it examines the urine and
automatically sends the results to the local hospital by Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In the kitchen, one can choose a menu, order the ingredients for
a meal and send the instructions to the microwave oven through the
Internet. A refrigerator can register each item, so that at the
supermarket one can call up the refrigerator's Internet address and
check its contents to see what food is needed.
</P>
<P>
   The Rising Stars
</P>
<P>
   New Under the Sun: a Few Entrepreneurs
</P>
<P>
   While Japan has long been dominated by big government and big
business _ by five-year plans and companies like Matsushita _ in
the last year or so there have been growing signs of sprouting
entrepreneurship in high-tech start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   Japan has had entrepreneurial fads before, and the tiny sums of
venture capital newly trickling into start-up ventures have not yet
changed any major corner of the world, but the mood seems to be
shifting. Last month, for example, a rising star at the Finance
Ministry quit his job to join a small start-up company. Resumes
from elite-trained bureaucrats throughout the government are also
pouring into the offices of headhunters.
</P>
<P>
   ``This country is an agricultural people and it takes a long
time to change, but once it changes, they rush,'' said Sachio
Semmoto, a professor of business at Keio University.
</P>
<P>
   Venture capital funds are forming like wildfire, perhaps faster
than the entrepreneurs can soak up the funds. Even someone like
Yoji Kawake, who used to have to beg small companies in Kyoto to
take his venture capital, because he is not a traditional banker,
is having an easier time. ``I think the entrepreneurial spirit is
on the rise,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of companies are blazing a new trail, led by young
energetic people like Hiroshi Mikitani, 34, who four years ago left
his job as an investment banker at the Industrial Bank of Japan. He
called a few of his buddies in America _ he attended Harvard
Business School _ and raised money to start Rakuten Market, an
online market that is becoming one of the hottest sites for
electronic shopping in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Rakuten has 700 virtual stores, auction platforms and customer
bulletin boards, and it sells everything from fish to books. After
many months of recruiting engineers to write software and making
some 2,000 phone calls to find clients, Mikitani is generating
sales of $2 million a month and attracts 80,000 shoppers to his
site each day.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the most important things for an entrepreneur is that
you feel everything as a challenge, not as a obstacle,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the obstacles are many _ like high taxes, mounds of
regulation, difficulties in hiring, and expensive
telecommunications charges that have stifled the growth of the
Internet. Japan is also still largely a hierarchical,
status-conscious society, though e-mail is threatening to turn
everything upside down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does the emperor use e-mail? Once you can say yes, then this
breaks down the social boundaries,'' said Ray Tsuchiyama, a
director at Analog Devices and a former representative in Japan for
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, Japan may still have to wait a bit. Makoto
Watanabe, a spokesman for the imperial household, said that neither
the emperor nor the empress currently uses e-mail, nor do they plan
to start.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Plugged-in Future
</P>
<P>
   Laboratory Tests of the Easy Life
</P>
<P>
   For now, most of the innovation in Japan is hidden in the
corners of Big Business, which is still Japan's best big bet in
technology.
</P>
<P>
   That's how Saito, the man on the videophone, got his machines.
In the first experiment of its kind, the long-distance medical
trial in Katsurao was launched this spring by Nippon Telephone and
Telegraph, which poured in 50 million yen ($449,236) and was able
to attract a remarkable 75 million yen ($673,854) in central and
local government funds.
</P>
<P>
   Though a sleepy little place, Katsurao is one of Japan's most
plugged-in villages thanks to some aggressive local officials, and
it has become a laboratory for the kind of devices that will make
life easier for the elderly people who make up 27 percent of its
1,900 inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
   Each of Katsurao's 500 households now has its own videophone,
courtesy of Nippon Telephone, and soon 300 households will have
electronic units from NEC to measure vital health signs like blood
pressure and heartbeats.
</P>
<P>
   Katsurao has no pharmacies of its own, and the only medical care
is a part-time clinic open two afternoons a week. But the hospital
in the next village is linked to Katsurao villagers, and pharmacies
have agreed to send medicine by mail. Soon the university will set
up teleclasses.
</P>
<P>
   Ensconced in her home in front of drawings by her grandchildren,
Toshiko Yamada, a 62-year-old retiree, can rest assured that
specialists are monitoring her health from the hospital. All she
has to do is punch in yes-or-no answers to questions like ``Have
you eaten?'' or ``Have you had vertigo?'' or ``Do you have a
problem breathing?''
</P>
<P>
   She can then order an electrocardiogram, whose results will be
automatically sent to specialists by the machine. Every month, she
gets a report summarizing her daily condition and any
abnormalities.
</P>
<P>
   ``One time the rate of my heartbeat went above 100, and the
public health official got worried and gave me a call,'' said Mrs.
Yamada, as she sat on a floor cushion beside the telehealth
machine. ``Then I realized that I had measured my heartbeat right
after I had finished upstairs hanging up the laundry to dry.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone, though, is as overjoyed as Mrs. Yamada by such
conveniences. Indeed, her husband, Isao, 66, staunchly resists
giving in to home technologies. When he answers the videophone, he
stands far enough away that the camera cannot capture him in full
view.
</P>
<P>
   His hesitancy, however, appears tied mostly to anxiety over the
unfamiliar. ``For now, I'm not using it,'' he says. ``But maybe I
might someday.''

   NY-LANDFILL (New York) _ On May 29, 1996, a splendid day for
celebration and champagne on Staten Island, as Gov. George Pataki
and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani announced that the Fresh Kills landfill
_ the biggest dump in the world, the last in New York City and the
perennial bane of the city's least populous borough _ would finally
close. There was one small problem. Until 48 hours before the
announcement, no one in the mayor's office had bothered to tell
anyone in the Sanitation Department. The department suddenly had to
figure out what to do with the 13,000 tons of household garbage
that was heading each day for the dump. Thus began a long-running,
and to this day unfinished, scramble that has made New York City
the butt of jokes and has produced sharp divisions between the
boroughs over the growing burdens they will have to bear. By

   DILI, East Timor _ Defying a campaign of terror, the people of
East Timor began to emerge early Monday from their locked homes,
from refugee centers and from the forests where they had fled to
vote on whether to end 24 years of occupation by Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome of the vote, which will not be known for about a
week, will determine whether this ragged and remote territory of
800,000 people will enter a new autonomous relationship within
Indonesia or will become the world's newest sovereign nation.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign leading to the referendum has been as ugly as the
long and violent occupation during which at least 200,000 people
died as the Indonesian military struggled to suppress a separatist
insurgency in this former Portuguese colony.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to derail the vote and maintain Indonesian
sovereignty here, irregular militias recruited and armed by the
military have killed residents of pro-independence areas, burned
homes and driven tens of thousands of people into hiding.
</P>
<P>
   They have threatened and occasionally attacked officials of the
United Nations, which is conducting the referendum with the
participation of officials from some 70 nations.
</P>
<P>
   Until the last day, on Sunday, Indonesian military and police
leaders have repeatedly promised _ and broken their promises _ to
curb the violence and provide a safe environment for a free vote.
</P>
<P>
   After months of demands and pleading, U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan demanded once again on Sunday: ``We expect the
Indonesian government to honor its undertakings to insure an
environment free of violence or other intimidation in which the
population can decide its destiny without fear and in hope for a
peaceful future.''
</P>
<P>
   Under an agreement reached among Indonesia, Portugal and the
United Nations, Annan will be the final arbiter of the election
outcome, factoring into his assessment any intimidation that may
have affected the turnout and the nature of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   In his statement Sunday, Annan pledged that the United Nations
would aid in any transition period toward any new East Timorese
administration, whether in an independent state or autonomous
Indonesian region.
</P>
<P>
   Under intense pressure from the United Nations, leaders of
opposing pro- and anti-independence fighting groups pledged at a
public meeting on this final day to lay down their arms. The
Indonesian police, which is charged under the U.N. electoral plan
with maintaining order, pledged to provide security and to seize
all weapons.
</P>
<P>
   It was the fourth such set of promises that have been made over
the past four months, and like the previous ones, it was broken
before the day was out by all parties involved.
</P>
<P>
   Though Sunday was far from the worst day the territory has seen,
there were reports of more threats and violence both here in the
tiny capital city and in remote and terrorized towns.
</P>
<P>
   In heavily pro-independence eastern neighborhoods of Dili, where
the pro-integration militias have carried out repeated raids,
scores of young thugs guarded the streets with an extraordinary
jumble of homemade weapons and badly beat at least one man.
</P>
<P>
   Barefoot or wearing rubber sandals, they carried butcher knives,
dirks, sharpened chisels, crude axes, slingshots, bows and arrows,
spears, nail-studded clubs, scythes, lengths of plumbing, sticks,
stones and iron bars as well as an array of homemade pistols.
</P>
<P>
   Across town, anti-independence militia members in black t-shirts
carrying knives, pistols and a few automatic weapons menaced
passers-by and threatened journalists who approached them.
</P>
<P>
   In both areas, groups of police looked on passively, seeming to
shrink from confrontation. Two days ago, David Wimhurst, the chief
U.N. spokesman here, described police explanations for their
passivity in the face of violence as ``inadequate.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the anti-independence militias have clearly had the upper
hand in terror, the pro-independence forces, with 24 years of
experience in both war and propaganda, have seized the political
high ground in the role of well-intentioned victims.
</P>
<P>
   They have the support of much of the international community as
well as of East Timor's two Nobel Peace Prize winners, the Roman
Catholic Bishop Carlos Belo and the exiled politician Jose Ramos
Horta.
</P>
<P>
   At Monday's public meeting, a militia leader named Eurico
Guterres, who has become a vivid personality here with his long,
tangled hair, menacing displays of arms and bellicose statements,
asserted that some mysterious third party must be carrying out the
violence.
</P>
<P>
   In a much smoother presentation, Falur Rate Laek, the
third-ranking leader of the separatist insurgency known as
Falintil, called for peace, brotherhood and a bright future for
East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   Echoing the policy put forward by Jose Alexandre Gusmao, an
imprisoned separatist leader who could become the leader of a free
East Timor, Falur pledged to embrace his battlefield enemies in a
general amnesty.
</P>
<P>
   Then Falur, in his Che Guevara-style beret and dark glasses,
offered a demonstration: He turned to Guterres and embraced him.

DEMOCRATS READY FOR SENATE FIGHT ON TEST-BAN TREATY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Del., N.C. , Pa., Miss., Vt., S.D., N.D., Maine)   (jw) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House and Senate Democrats say they are
preparing for a pitched battle with the Republican-controlled
Senate to save one of the top foreign policy goals of President
Clinton's waning administration: a treaty banning nuclear testing.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with public opinion polls and the support of many
scientists, military commanders and arms control groups, Democrats
have threatened to bring the Senate to a standstill when Congress
returns next month from summer recess unless Republicans agree to
hold hearings this year on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, which
152 countries have signed.
</P>
<P>
   Without the treaty, Clinton warned this month, ``Countries all
around the world will feel more pressure to develop and test
weapons in ever more destructive varieties and sizes, threatening
the security of everyone on earth.''
</P>
<P>
   His administration's new push for the treaty has been prompted
in part by a raft of unsettling developments _ India's and
Pakistan's growing nuclear ambitions, the possible test-launching
of a long-range missile by North Korea, and the impact of stolen
American nuclear secrets on China's atomic arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   But Senate Republicans are balking, and before the Senate is
likely to vote on the treaty, the administration will need to
satisfy both the Republicans and the Russians on related
arms-control issues, pulling off the geopolitical equivalent of a
triple bank shot.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans say they do not want to go forward with any new
treaty until they are assured the country will quickly build a
limited defense against long-range missile attack. The Russians
will not go along with changes to a landmark treaty that bars such
a shield unless the United States agrees to slash its nuclear
arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   If these two conditions are met, it could free up the test-ban
treaty, which Republicans are holding hostage. Clinton signed the
treaty in 1996 and sent it to the Senate for approval in September
1997, but arms control advocates say he has not yet made
ratification a public issue or fought hard for it in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``There ought to be the makings of a grand deal in all this,''
said Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., the ranking member of his party on
the Foreign Relations Committee. ``But the president has to play a
major role. He could affect this more than he has.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials say that in the coming weeks, Clinton
and top foreign policy aides, like Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright and National Security Adviser Sandy Berger, will push the
treaty more publicly.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats' effort faces stiff Republican opposition. The
treaty is bottled up in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee,
whose chairman, Jesse Helms, R-N.C., is locked in a fight with the
administration over two other treaties that Helms wants to kill
before dealing with the test-ban pact.
</P>
<P>
   Those two treaties _ a pact to fight the dangers of global
warming that the United States signed last year and a set of
amendments negotiated two years ago to the 1972 Anti-Ballistic
Missile Treaty _ are unlikely to gain the two-thirds Senate support
needed for approval, administration officials conceded.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, citing reasons other than likely defeat, said that the
time was not ``ripe'' to send the agreements to the Senate.
Republicans say Clinton cannot pick and choose which treaties the
Senate acts on quickly. A stalemate has resulted.
</P>
<P>
   There are three possible paths around Helms and other foes,
test-ban treaty supporters say. One is to generate public pressure
by painting Republicans as reckless for blocking a step that would
encourage India and Pakistan to sign the treaty. This, in turn,
could force moderate Republicans to prod Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss.,
the majority leader, to overrule Helms.
</P>
<P>
   Only two Republicans, Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania and James
Jeffords of Vermont, openly support the test ban treaty. Other
Republicans, including Maine's two senators, Olympia Snowe and
Susan Collins, support holding hearings, but have not committed to
the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Another tactic, which Democrats have used successfully in the
past, would be to tie the Senate floor in knots until Lott relents.
Biden, along with the Democratic leader, Thomas Daschle of South
Dakota, and Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., say they are willing to wage
this kind of guerrilla warfare if needed.
</P>
<P>
   The final, and most ambitious route, involves a deal that hinges
on negotiating changes to the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty with
the Russians to allow a limited national defense. Such a deal would
almost certainly include a new strategic arms reduction treaty,
Start III, that the Russians want and that could reduce both sides'
nuclear arsenals to 1,500 warheads from about 6,000.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Russia President Boris Yeltsin, for the first time,
blessed such talks in June. Discussions started last week in Moscow
and will resume on Sept. 17, when Deputy Secretary of State Strobe
Talbott meets with a Russian deputy foreign minister, Georgi
Mamedov, in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Enormous hurdles still remain. The United States has said it
will not seriously negotiate a Start III treaty until Russia's
Communist-dominated Parliament ratifies the Start II pact, which
calls for reducing the level of nuclear warheads on each side. This
prospect appears increasingly dim.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has long opposed an American missile defense, fearing
that Washington would use it as an excuse to reprise the much
grander Star Wars system, which would be dauntingly expensive to
match. But Russia's strategic forces are declining and it lacks
money to pay for new systems. Striking a deal, even if it means
swallowing modifications to the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, may
be the only way for Moscow to maintain nuclear parity with
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides also see a narrowing political window of opportunity
before presidential election politics in Russia and the United
States next year make striking an accord extremely difficult.
Analysts say both Clinton and Yeltsin are mindful of their
arms-control legacies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot like a transatlantic flight,'' Robert Bell, the
president's senior director for defense policy and arms control at
the National Security Council, said about the nexus of issues.
``Landing is the critical phase. What we're trying to do is bring
all this in for a landing in the last year or so of the Clinton and
Yeltsin administrations.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if some grand deal can be struck, the test ban treaty
confronts several roadblocks. Even though 152 nations have signed
the accord, so far only 21 of the 44 nations whose approval is
required for the treaty to take effect, including Britain, France
and Japan, have ratified the pact. Even one holdout among the 44
nations _ like North Korea _ could prevent the treaty from taking
effect.
</P>
<P>
   Although the treaty sets up a global system of sensors to modify
compliance, critics contend that verifying the agreement would be
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Treaty proponents argue that it would lock in American
superiority achieved in 1,030 nuclear tests between 1945 and 1992,
when the United States agreed to halt testing. Failure to ratify,
supporters say, could open the door for emerging nuclear states,
like India and Pakistan, to conduct more tests, and may also weaken
support for other arms pacts, like the Nuclear Non-Proliferation
Treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Five current and former chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
support the testing ban, as do most arms control experts and the
directors of the nation's nuclear laboratories, which are
responsible for maintaining the safety and reliability of America's
nuclear arsenal through nonexplosive nuclear experiments, including
sophisticated computer simulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty,'' Paul Nitze, President
Reagan's chief arms control adviser, wrote Helms earlier this year,
``represents a unique and crucial opportunity to combat today's
greatest national security threat, the proliferation of nuclear
weapons.''

WELL-DESIGNED WEB SITE CAN HAVE A BIG IMPACT ON THE BOTTOM LINE 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As IBM positioned itself as an Internet leader last year, with a
marketing campaign that helped e-commerce gain mainstream currency,
a somewhat troubling reality emerged.
</P>
<P>
   The company wasn't minding its own e-business.
</P>
<P>
   On IBM's Web site, the most popular feature was the search
function, ``because people couldn't figure out how to navigate the
site,'' said Carol Moore, IBM's vice president for Internet
operations. The second most popular feature was the ``help''
button, because the search technology was so ineffective.
</P>
<P>
   IBM's solution was a 10-week effort to redesign the site, which
involved more than 100 employees at a cost Ms. Moore estimated ``in
the millions.'' As the redesign neared completion in February, IBM
consciously held off on promoting the Web site, so it could gauge
the effectiveness of the new design. The result: In the first week
after the redesign, use of the ``help'' button decreased 84
percent, while sales increased 400 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Internet users have for years complained about how difficult it
is to use most Web sites, frustrated by things like shoddy search
engines, Byzantine navigation schemes and long waits for pages to
download. But with e-commerce sites proliferating on the Web, those
shortcomings are increasingly recognized as grave threats to the
bottom line. And as more sites seek profitability by expanding
their product offerings _ and customers struggle to click their way
through complex product listings _ Web site design is looming as an
ever-more crucial facet of the business.
</P>
<P>
   ``The customer's experience on the Web can make or break a
business,'' said Mark Hurst, president of Creative Good, a
consulting firm that helps clients address what is known as Web
site usability. ``There was $3 billion lost on the Web last year
because of poor design _ sites not realizing that if they just make
it easier for the consumer to buy, they'll make more sales.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Moore said IBM's redesign focused not just on the ``Shop
IBM.'' section of the site, but on each of the more than one
million pages on that site (www.ibm.com). The project involved
several components, including information architecture _ or the
arrangement of information within a site _ navigation, graphic
design and the selection of words and photographs for each page.
</P>
<P>
   The first order of business, Ms. Moore said, was to create some
cohesion at the site, which had previously been split into three
segments: a software section, a PC section and a catalog site for
products like cables, printers and disk drives. Each section had
been designed by a separate team, she said, in conjunction with 60
so-called interactive agencies, which help companies develop their
Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   The fragmentation was apparent: Information was arranged
differently from section to section, search results were
inconsistent and pages loaded at different speeds. ``It may sound
obvious,'' Ms. Moore said, ``but things have to work the same
everywhere on the site for people to feel comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   The company assembled a team made up of people from several
departments, including programming, information technology and
marketing. The team then developed a plan to change the site's
navigation and improve its search technology. It also created
templates for each page, so the interactive agencies IBM works with
_ which the company winnowed to four from 60 _ could conform to a
single design standard. The templates helped decrease the time it
takes to load a page by 30 percent, Ms. Moore said, noting that the
average time spent per visit has fallen 28 percent since the
redesign, ``so we know people are getting what they want more
quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Hurst of Creative Good said e-commerce sites with enormous
inventories were particularly at risk for design flaws. ``If Amazon
adds 30 more shopping categories, and just puts 30 more tabs on
their home page, that would be a problem,'' he said. ``There could
be a way to design it so it's not too hard to find what you want,
but whatever way you go you're adding more work for the user.''
</P>
<P>
   In the future, he said, ``we may see that the customer
experience is better and faster on more focused sites, and the
superstores that get too big either die out or come back to a
better focus.
</P>
<P>
   ``If another store had the same books and service as Amazon and
you could get to the books right away, why wouldn't you go to that
store?'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   One site that has had to figure out how to manage an enormous
inventory is Travelocity, a travel site owned by the Sabre Group.
The site offers 95 percent of the available airline seats in the
world on any given day, the company said, along with listings from
40,000 hotels, 50 car rental companies and numerous cruise lines
and tour companies.
</P>
<P>
   Terrell Jones, Travelocity's president, said that when the
company began its online operations 13 years ago on Compuserve,
Prodigy and America Online, its system ``was easy, but not
simple.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd step you through everything, which was very supportive,
but it took a long time and lots of screens,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the company put a simplified ticket-buying system on
the site's front page, allowing users to immediately type in their
destination and the times they want to travel; the system then
returns nine different flight results. Notably, Jones said, the
company tested the feature with focus groups, ``with the marketing
and programming people behind the one-way mirror.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For it to work, the programmers need to hear people call their
baby ugly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said Travelocity also changed certain features based on
e-mail complaints from customers. The company values such comments,
he said, because many people don't bother to write. ``We were lucky
because on the Web site, if people don't understand it, they just
leave,'' he said. ``It's not like a corporation where people will
call to tell you what's wrong. So usability is exceptionally
important, because you don't have face-to-face contact with the
customer.''
</P>
<P>
   Jakob Nielsen, a usability consultant who publishes a column on
the topic at www.useit.com, said e-commerce sites were ``actually
getting much better than traditional sites, because there's such a
direct bottom-line impact'' from design.
</P>
<P>
   The legacy of first-generation non-e-commerce sites is, in fact,
partly to blame for the current state of e-commerce site design, he
said. ``A lot of sites started simply as informational sites, and
they've grafted e-commerce onto themselves, so they have split
personalities,'' Nielsen said.
</P>
<P>
   Companies are loath to part with Web pages they spent millions
of dollars to develop, he said, even if the pages do not add to the
site's functionality. ``It's a good excuse,'' he said, ``but the
user doesn't care about all that history.''

 &HT;    'Hurricane Hunters' ride out storm from above
 &HT;    (EDS: Photos from flight available.)
 &HT;    By Charles Seabrook
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   IN THE EYE OF HURRICANE DENNIS _ Unable to keep his footing,
Master Sergeant Tony Hlavac slammed hard onto the deck of the C-130
``Hercules'' as it bucked and twisted in severe turbulence over the
Atlantic. He pulled himself up from the metal flooring, unhurt and
grinning.
</P>
<P>
   A bumpy ride was expected. After all, this aircraft was flying
through Hurricane Dennis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people try to get away from hurricanes; we try to get
into the center of them,'' Hlavac quipped.
</P>
<P>
   Hlavac, who rode into Dennis's eye four times on Saturday, is a
member of the U.S. Air Force's 53rd Air Reconnaissance Squadron _
the famed ``Hurricane Hunters'' unit at Keesler Air Force Base,
Miss. Its mission is to make regular forays into the centers of
Atlantic hurricanes to gather ``real-time'' data on the fierce
storms.
</P>
<P>
   The crucial information is relayed immediately to the National
Hurricane Center in Miami, which enters the findings _ along with
weather data from satellites _ into a computer to help predict the
possible path and intensity of the storms. That information, in
turn, helps emergency management officials determine if an area
should be evacuated.
</P>
<P>
   The work is deadly serious. A typical hurricane warning costs
about $192 million due to preparation, evacuation and lost
commerce. Narrowing the warning area could save $640,000 or more
per mile of coastline, and lend greater credibility to forecasts
and foster more controlled and limited coastal evacuations.
</P>
<P>
   The National Hurricane Center estimates that the information
provided by the Hurricane Hunters increases the accuracy of storm
forecasters by as much as 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that what we're doing up here is helping save lives,''
said Maj. Christopher Patrie, the pilot of the huge C-130 that flew
Saturday's mission into Dennis. ``I've walked around towns after
they were hit by hurricanes, and it was a good feeling knowing that
I may have helped save people in those towns.''
</P>
<P>
   Patrie, a civilian airlines pilot, is an air reservist. He got
the call last week at his home near San Antonio, Texas, that he was
needed for Saturday's rendezvous with Dennis.
</P>
<P>
   The 10-hour trek began about 10:30 a.m. when the lumbering
aircraft, loaded with more than 60,000 pounds of fuel, took off
from Keesler and headed for the storm churning in the Atlantic
about 270 miles southeast of Jacksonville. Patrie flew the plane
over land until Ormond Beach, Fla., where he made a left turn and
headed over the ocean towards Dennis.
</P>
<P>
   The six crew members and a handful of reporters and
photographers aboard the noisy aircraft began feeling the
turbulence about 12:45 p.m., when the plane was flying on the edge
of the storm. Through breaks in the clouds, one could see the angry
sea below _ huge white caps and large patches of foam and spray,
each hinting at the power of the furious winds spiraling around the
dangerous storm.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty minutes later, the plane, flying at 10,000 feet and
battered by winds of more than 100 miles per hour, plunged through
the thick of the storm. A plane may free-fall 1,000 feet when it
hits this area.
</P>
<P>
   This is the so-called eyewall, a bright ring of thunderstorms
containing the most violent weather in the hurricane. The rain
hissed at the bucking and twisting plane's portholes, and stomachs
got queasy.
</P>
<P>
   But shortly afterwards, the dark clouds began to brighten, sunny
blue skies appeared and the rain suddenly stopped. The plane was in
the eye of Dennis.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis's eye, however, was ill-defined, and the weather experts
on board the plane had difficulty determining its precise contours.
In a well-defined hurricane eye, one can see what is known as the
``stadium effect,'' a wall of clouds surrounding the eye resembling
the seats of a stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before entering Dennis's eye, Hlavac was at his busiest.
He is the aircraft's ``dropsonde operator.'' A dropsonde is a tube
about two feet long jammed with sensitive weather monitoring
instruments that record temperature, pressure, humidity and other
vital information.
</P>
<P>
   The cylinders are ejected from the bottom of the aircraft
through a cannon-like device. As they plunge through the raging
storm, they deploy small parachutes to slow their descent before
plunging into the sea. The readings from the tubes are relayed to
the hurricane center.
</P>
<P>
   Hlavac sent six dropsondes _ each costing about $400 apiece _
into Dennis on Saturday. ``Miami wants us to try to find the exact
center of the storm,'' Hlavac said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, on the flight deck, Capt. John Gallagher, the
aircraft's weather officer, gathered minute-by-minute data,
including temperature and wind speed, from special sensors mounted
on the aircraft. In addition, he peered at the frothing waters
below and at his radar screen to estimate wind speed, sea surface
temperature and other characteristics of the storm. That
information also was relayed to Miami.
</P>
<P>
   During the six hours in which the plane flew through and around
Dennis, the storm increased slightly in intensity, with wind gusts
of up to 110 miles per hour. ``It's a strong storm, and it could
quickly gain strength or stay about the same,'' Gallagher said.
</P>
<P>
   At 6:45 p.m., the mission complete, Patrie turned the C-130
towards home. Another crew of Hurricane Hunters was flying out of
Keesler to continue the round-the-clock monitoring.
</P>
<P>
   Approaching the Florida coastline near Jacksonville, Patrie and
his crew on the flight deck were treated to a glorious sunset on
the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at that,'' Patrie said, pointing to a huge cloud
silhouetted against the orange sky. ``It looks like an angel. Our
angel.''

<P>
   With the fall recruiting season fast approaching, students and
new graduates are beginning to gear up to find their first serious
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The job search picture has changed a lot in the past five years.
The job market is stronger. Candidates are pickier and have more
access to information about companies and industries than ever
before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five years ago, people worried about getting a job,'' said
Steve Pollack, president of WetFeet.com in San Francisco. ``Now
they worry about getting the job they want.''
</P>
<P>
   Pollack has been charting the changes since founding a Web-based
company to help people avoid the kinds of pitfalls and
inefficiencies he first faced as a newly minted MBA on the job
market.
</P>
<P>
   Today's college seniors and MBA candidates are using Internet
tools not only to find openings, but to research potential
companies, he said. Although it doesn't list openings, WetFeet.com
links with sites that do and also works with more than 300
university career centers, providing information on companies and
industries to help students prepare for interviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet has shifted the power relationship between
employers and candidates,'' he said. Candidates can identify a much
wider range of openings and can do extensive research to decide
whether a particular company would be a good match for them. They
are no longer dependent on the recruiters who show up on college
campuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's already affected the dynamic,'' he said. ``We hear from
recruiters that candidates are more demanding and selective.''
</P>
<P>
   In a recent survey of student job-hunters, WetFeet.com found
they spent an average of 2.6 hours a day on job-search activity,
and 4.8 hours a week on the Internet looking for jobs, he said.
Job-hunters interviewed with an average of 10 companies and spent
an average of four months actively searching before accepting a
position.
</P>
<P>
   Job seekers who eventually accepted a position got an average of
three job offers. And 93 percent of searchers were able to find a
job in the industry of their choice.
</P>
<P>
   Students generally rated position attributes and company factors
higher than economic and environmental factors when assessing job
prospects, he said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a challenging assignment, good training for future
work, good colleagues and boss, and a company with a strong image
all rated higher than starting salary in employment decisions, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Younger job searchers are looking for different things in a job
than the people who are hiring them did when they first started
out, he said. ``People today see a career as a succession of
different jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   When assessing companies, both undergraduate and MBA job seekers
rated a team-oriented culture, high number of young employees,
attractive workplace and diverse work force higher than having
their own offices or being able to dress casually.
</P>
<P>
   And significantly more MBAs than undergraduates said flexible
hours were important to them.
</P>
<P>
   For both undergraduates and MBAs, the top five most-liked
industries were management consulting (82 percent liked),
investment banking (42 percent), venture capital (22 percent),
Internet-new media (17 percent) and advertising or public relations
(15 percent).
</P>
<P>
   The least-desired industries were accounting (37 percent didn't
like), insurance (26 percent), government or non-profit (20
percent), energy or utilities (19 percent) and aerospace or defense
(18 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Undergraduates were most interested in management consulting,
investment banking, advertising and law and least interested in
education, pharmaceuticals and biotech.
</P>
<P>
   MBAs, on the other hand, were most interested in Internet-new
media, consumer products, manufacturing and commercial banking and
least interested in accounting and law.
</P>
<P>
   Most job searchers pursued jobs in only one or two industries,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Within each of those industries, the best job-search advice,
hasn't changed all that much over the years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Find a place where you can function effectively, where you
feel passionate about the work,'' said Pollack. ``Whether that's a
small or large organization, conservative or aggressive, finding a
place where you have a good fit is where you'll be most
successful.''

 PROTESTANT OFFICIALS PROTEST EXPULSIONS BY IRA  (jw) 
 By WARREN HOGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Four Catholic teen-agers from Northern Ireland have
been forced into hiding to escape death threats by the Irish
Republican Army. The development provoked new calls from Protestant
officials for the expulsion of Sinn Fein, the guerrilla group's
political wing, from peace talks that are due to resume in a week.
</P>
<P>
   Protestant politicians in Ulster contended that the IRA order,
issued Thursday, was a result of the leniency of Britain's Northern
Ireland secretary, Mo Mowlam. Earlier that day she had issued a
disputed ruling that recent charges of IRA killings and gunrunning
did not constitute abandonment of the clandestine organization's
two-year old cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consequently the IRA now feel that they can be even bolder in
their breaches of the cease-fire,'' David Trimble, the leader of
the largest Protestant party, the Ulster Unionists, complained
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The four young men were told by their local priest Friday
morning that they had to leave their homes by midnight Saturday or
be killed. The priest, the Rev. Joseph Quinn of Dungannon, County
Tyrone, said he had been asked to convey the message by two masked
and armed IRA men who appeared at his home Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   The four targeted men _ Martin Groogan, 16, and his brother
Gerard, 18, and Barry McDonald, 15, and his cousin Paul McDonald,
16 _ took a ferry from Belfast to the western Scottish port of
Troon on Saturday and were said to be in the care of ``a Christian
organization'' in London on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mowlam branded the threats against the teen-agers as
``repugnant and unacceptable'' and reminded Sinn Fein that she was
keeping the cease-fire ``under close review.'' On Thursday she had
coupled the announcement of her ruling with the confession that she
had come ``very close to judging that the IRA cease-fire is no
longer for real.''
</P>
<P>
   Threatening young men that they must leave Northern Ireland or
face violence, known as ``exiling,'' is a common practice in the
conflicted British province, which Protestant paramilitary groups
use just as much in their working-class neighborhoods as the IRA
does in Catholic housing projects.
</P>
<P>
   Exiling and punishment beatings are committed in the name of
curbing antisocial behavior and ridding neighborhoods of persistent
troublemakers. They have actually increased during the two-year
period that the guerrilla armies have been on official truces and
have substantially reduced the number of organized attacks on one
another.
</P>
<P>
   Fearful that a peace settlement might cost them control of their
areas, the paramilitaries have directed brutal enforcement tactics
ranging from kneecapping to killings in their own neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   The parents of the Groogan brothers defended their sons in
television interviews Sunday night, saying that neighborhood rumors
that they were vandals, drug dealers and ``joy riders'' of stolen
cars were false. The boys' mother, Roseanne, said that the men who
had forced her sons from home were ``big men with masks, but with
masks off, what are they? Nobody.''
</P>
<P>
   Quinn told the BBC that people in the housing project where they
lived were happy to see the youths gone. ``The reaction in the
community when the news broke, I hear on the ground, was one that
it was overdue,'' he said. ``In no way am I justifying anything,
but the reaction in the community was surprising, that it was
overdue.''
</P>
<P>
   The faltering effort to put into effect the April 1998 peace
settlement was suspended last month when the Ulster Unionists
refused to join the new power-sharing Cabinet with Sinn Fein that
is called for in the accord unless the IRA began turning over its
weapons. A formal review of the situation will begin in Belfast on
Sept. 6 under the direction of George Mitchell, the former U.S.
senator who led the talks that produced the original settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Groups taking part in the talks are bound by pledges of
nonviolence known as the Mitchell Principles. Protestant
politicians contend that Sinn Fein has violated those conditions
and forfeited its place at the negotiating table because of fresh
acts of violence authorized by the IRA.
</P>
<P>
   In her ruling last week, Ms. Mowlam agreed that the IRA was
involved in two recent violent episodes _ the killing of a
22-year-old taxi driver accused of having been a police informer
and an illicit arms deal with suppliers in the United States. But
she concluded that they did not constitute an explicit decision by
the IRA to end its cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   Her decision was widely seen as an effort to keep Sinn Fein
involved in the search for peace. Trimble said Sunday that the
Ulster Unionists would meet Tuesday to determine whether they could
participate in the review if Sinn Fein remained a party to the
talks. ``The behavior of this summer, this week, shows that that is
impossible,'' he warned.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Ulster Unionists have urged Ms. Mowlam to call a halt to the
early release of paramilitary prisoners under the peace accord, and
Sinn Fein has warned that if that occurs, it will boycott the
coming review. The volatile atmosphere surrounding the peace talks
has been intensified by the keen sense of anticipation about the
report due Sept. 9 from a commission headed by the former Hong Kong
governor, Chris Patten, on the future of Northern Ireland's police
force, the Royal Ulster Constabulary.
</P>
<P>
   Protestant politicians want little change to the force, while
Catholics want it reformed because of its overwhelmingly Protestant
makeup and its record as a harsh enforcer of British rule and of
past Protestant domination of the province.
</P>
<P>
   The force's chief constable, Sir Ronnie Flanagan, Sunday
condemned the IRA action in Dungannon as ``absolutely barbaric,
disgusting and despicable.'' He said, ``There is no place for it in
society, and it has to be rooted out.''

 c.1999 Special for the Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here are Anne Stephenson's capsule book reviews:
</P>
<P>
   ``Isaac's Storm''By Erik Larson (Crown, $25) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was the turn of the century, a blustery time in an America
full of national pride and technical confidence. ``In this new
age,'' Larson writes, ``nature itself seemed no great obstacle.''
Then came tragedy in Galveston, Texas. On Sept. 8, 1900, the worst
hurricane ever to target America roared ashore from the Gulf of
Mexico, killing 8,000 men, women and children. The storm is still
the deadliest natural disaster in American history. Larson builds
his story around Isaac Monroe Cline, the chief meteorologist in
Galveston and the one man who might have saved the city. But
America's inflated self-image and rivalries among meteorologists
combined to downplay the storm's strength until it was too late
(Cuba's meteorologists, who had pioneered the art of hurricane
prediction, correctly judged the storm's scale and path, but their
warnings were ignored by the U.S Weather Bureau, which, Larson
says, ``wanted hurricanes all to itself''). Larson creates tension,
suspense and an ominous sense of impending tragedy as he follows
Cline through the days before the storm and then its ghastly
aftermath. The weatherman, who had thought of his own house as a
fortress, watched as water rose around it, first to his waist and
then to his neck, with tiny toads taking refuge on anything that
protruded above the surface. By the time the storm was over, Cline,
like thousands in Galveston, had lost someone he loved. ``This is
the story of Isaac and his time in America,'' Larson writes, ``the
last turning of the centuries, when the hubris of men led them to
believe they could disregard even nature itself.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
``The Last Survivor: In Search of Martin Zaidenstadt'' &QL; 
By Timothy W. Ryback (Pantheon, $21) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There are jarring moments in this book when Ryback quietly
reminds us that Dachau today is a charming and prosperous community
in the rolling hills of Germany, that it has citizens and shops and
a downtown, that it is picturesque. But who can think of Dachau
without imagining its ghosts? In 1992, editors at ``The New
Yorker'' asked Ryback to write a report on the town and its people,
who, as Ryback notes, live in the shadow of the notorious
concentration camp and ``have DACHAU stamped on their birth
certificates, carry DACHAU on their drivers' licenses and in their
passports, pay DACHAU electric bills, DACHAU water bills and DACHAU
gas bills.'' Ryback wrote his story and went on to other work, but
two months later found himself back in Dachau, driven to further
explore the moral issues that permeate the very air there. It was
at the camp in 1996 that he encountered Martin Zaidenstadt.
Zaidenstadt was 87, a former inmate of the camp who after his
liberation made his home in Dachau _ he married a German woman, had
three children and for years ``discarded'' his Jewish identity. Now
Zaidenstadt kept a daily vigil outside the camp's crematorium,
accosting visitors and tour guides and violating cordoned-off areas
to give impassioned demonstrations of how mass death was carried
out. To the people of Dachau, he was a tortured soul, a madman. To
Rybeck, he was an eyewitness urged on by moral righteousness,
astonishing memories, his own demons and the vanity of firsthand
knowledge. This look at Dachau is as thought-provoking as the old
man who became its living ghost, haunting the camp and haranguing
people with what he knows. ``Who's going to kick him out?'' Ryback
asks.``Who is going to tell him he can't go in there? Martin was
supposed to be gassed in that chamber, burned in that crematorium.
But the Nazis are gone, and the ovens are cold, and Martin is still
there. He has an historic claim like no one else in the world.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
``The Nest: An Artist's Sketchbook''By Maryjo Koch (ST&AMP;C, $35) &QL; 
The oversize format of this pretty book accounts for much of its
appeal, because Koch renders many birds, nests, eggs and feathers
in their actual size. This might not seem like such an endeavor,
but consider a peacock's feather, with the eyespot that Charles
Darwin called ``the most beautiful object in the world.'' Stretched
across two pages, it is 28 inches long and 10 inches high _ lazy,
lanky and delightful. Among the other pleasures are an array of
wrens and jay eggs, a tanager nest built inside a hornet's nest,
and an American robin's nest that incorporates, along with the
traditional mud and grass, a gum wrapper, a Q-tip, a cigarette
paper and a scrap of duct tape. Our favorite rendering: a selection
of impossibly tiny hummingbird nests, accompanied by words that
botanist Nehemiah Grew wrote in 1693: ``I saw one of these nests
made of cotton wool, in form and bigness of the thumb of a man's
glove, with the taper end downwards wherein were two eggs of the
bigness of a pea of oval form. Who can but admire to see the whole
body and all the parts of a bird folded up in an egg little bigger
than a pepper-corn?'' With a forward by Gretel Ehrlich. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``I Just Kept Hoping''By Gloria Stuart (Little, Brown, $24.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Quick, call Celine Dion so she can put us in the mood. Stuart
became famous when at age 87 she played the ancient-but-cute ``Old
Rose'' in James Cameron's film ``Titanic.'' We weren't sure we
wanted to read 306 pages about her, but we now admit that there are
some interesting moments, as when Stuart reveals that she is
addicted to expletives and quotes herself screaming obscenities _
really, really bad ones _ at Cameron and other members of the film
crew. But not to worry. Stuart is 89, so Cameron still loves her,
and her memoir can be called ``irreverent'' by the people who write
the jacket copy. We call it chatty, and would be willing to
overlook all the exclamation points if we could just get Celine to
hum a few bars. &QL;

U.S. OPEN TESTS STRENGTH OF PLAYERS' CHARACTER 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 By ROBIN FINN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   They will not be flying a Jolly Roger alongside the Stars and
Stripes when the U.S. Open begins Monday. But they do not need to.
The skull-and-crossbones is already there in the imagination of all
contestants, past and present.
</P>
<P>
   This is the one Grand Slam tournament where the season's most
spine-tingling tennis often coincides with the circuit's most
spine-chilling conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything about the place is a struggle, just impossible,''
said Martina Navratilova, a retired champion whose Open memories
remain frazzled, not warm and fuzzy, despite her four singles
titles.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be strong to win there,'' warned top-seeded
Martina Hingis, the 1997 Open champion, who learned that lesson
firsthand last year when she was outmuscled by Lindsay Davenport in
the women's final.
</P>
<P>
   Amateurs beware. This is, according to the experts who coach at
or play it, the toughest Grand Slam event to crack, and, according
to most of them, the one likeliest to break a player down instead
of providing him or her with a breakthrough. The booby traps are
abundant: Because matches at 6-6 in the final set are solved
sudden-death style with tiebreakers, the matches are cutthroat, and
unlike at other Grand Slams, the finalists receive no day off
between the semis and final.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the players, that's the worst thing in tennis,'' groused
top-seeded Pete Sampras, a four-time Open winner despite his
distaste for the CBS-geared Super Saturday format.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been through it _ you come out tired and the tennis isn't
great,'' said Sampras, who sees it as just one more example of the
Open's insensitivity.
</P>
<P>
   There is no coddling ambiance here, just atmosphere: Either go
with the flow and let the Open electrify you, or expect to be
electrocuted by it. Look what happened to Bjorn Borg, whose
legendary patience held up to the rigors of every Grand Slam but
this one.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. Open requires the most complete game of all the Grand
Slam tournaments; you've got to have everything, a strong serve, a
good volley, and great groundstrokes,'' said Bob Brett, who coaches
Germany's breakthrough-bound Nicolas Kiefer (seeded 15th) and
counts Goran Ivanisevic and Boris Becker, the 1989 Open champion,
among players he has coached.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the most exciting events a player will ever
experience, because it's not a case of just surviving it
physically, it's a matter of being able to put all the pieces in
this giant jigsaw puzzle together and keep taking yourself to the
next step. Particularly for the European players, it's important to
learn to use the fans for adrenaline instead of being irritated by
them. It's different from anything else they'll ever do. But you
have to make your peace with the place.''
</P>
<P>
   Can Kiefer, or other talents like Mark Philippoussis (No. 11),
Tommy Haas (No. 14), Marat Safin and Tim Henman (No. 6) use the
Open as their Grand Slam springboard?
</P>
<P>
   ``Being labeled a contender is one thing; being ready to beat
whoever and whatever's thrown at you for seven rounds is another,''
Brett said. ``It's going to be difficult for anybody new to break
through.''
</P>
<P>
   There's the hit-or-miss daily commute to unquiet Queens from
manic Manhattan, the milling masses on the claustrophobic
concourse; there's weather with mood swings that can cram two
seasons into one day, an unforgiving surface that pounds an
athlete's joints with all the tenderness of a jackhammer and when
the curtain finally does go up there's that quintessential
creation, the terminally verbose New York fan, lying in wait like a
horror-movie villain. No wonder the combatants tend to view the
Open akin to a two-week prison term _ and that's a perk only the
champions receive. The rest get tossed out, and occasionally booed
out, like yesterday's calzone.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, Wimbledon feels like a grass cocoon, Roland
Garros a sprawling clay playground, and the Australian Open, the
other Grand Slam that tests a player's hardcourts prowess, like a
sun-burnt dress rehearsal for the command performance that happens
hard by the highways in Queens each September.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the most difficult one to win, but that's what makes it
the biggest in the world, because it lends itself to the best level
of tennis at crunch time,'' said Brad Gilbert, the coach of the
1994 Open champion Andre Agassi, who actually expresses a
preference for this Grand Slam event and its frenetic locale.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally don't like it,'' Monica Seles, a four-time
finalist who captured back-to-back Opens in 1991 and 1992, said
about the gargantuan stadium, ``but you have to make yourself like
it.'' That's the trick of it, cozying up to a place that's been
described by a Who's Who of players over the years as everything
from a toilet bowl to a dumpster to the eighth ring of hell.
</P>
<P>
   In the city that never sleeps, neither does the Open: With the
beer flowing freely in the National Tennis Center stands and the
moths dive-bombing the spotlights, matches routinely creep past the
witching hour, and night-time encounters can assume a supernatural
aura.
</P>
<P>
   ''I do love the night matches,'' Seles admitted, ``because
there's something about them that almost doesn't feel like a tennis
tournament anymore. You're just in there surrounded by one big
buzz. There's nothing like it.''
</P>
<P>
   Though there's a lot not to like, here they are, 356 of the best
ball strikers in the world, all of them stoked, or pretending to
be, for the most grueling test of a player's mental and physical
stamina, the one that makes or breaks their Grand Slam year, and
occasionally, their reputation. The surface favors attackers and,
unless they're as cunning and creative as Hingis, rarely allows
counterpunchers the final say.
</P>
<P>
   The fans favor excitement, and woe is you if your match turns
out dull, said Patrick Rafter, the two-time defending champion.
Lacking a spectacle, spectators are quick to look elsewhere for
entertainment: They crank up their cell phones, sprint for fresh
hot dogs, chat with acquaintances 10 rows away and punish the
players by ignoring them.
</P>
<P>
   At the Open, concentration is a player's best friend.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the last one, so you have to make yourself come up with
the power for it, even if it's late in the year and you're tired,
you get a last energy for it,'' Hingis said. ``I look at the whole
tournament like a typical New Yorker: It's loud, it's confident,
it's a bit cocky, and it likes a challenge. It keeps you
concentrated.''
</P>
<P>
   Hingis expressed skepticism that anybody but hardened veterans
like herself could handle the Open challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost impossible for somebody new to come through at any
Grand Slam, but to keep your focus at this one for seven whole
rounds, and to keep yourself strong and fit the whole two weeks, is
very, very tough. We saw Alexandra Stevenson and Mirjana Lucic go
far at Wimbledon,'' she said of those unseeded semifinalists, ``but
I doubt anything like that can happen in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   So does Gilbert: ``There's no such thing as a surprise winner at
the U.S. Open. It's impossible; there's too many variables through
seven rounds. Even though Rafter was sort of a surprise in '97, he
came right back and showed that wasn't a fluke. If you can do well
at the Open, like Venus Williams did in '97, then you're top three
in the world; it's not like the French, where you can have an Iva
Majoli win it and then go nowhere.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Harold Solomon, who coaches Jennifer Capriati, said the excess
of everything at the Open _ weather, crowds, traffic, piggy-backed
matches _ tends to present too great a test to newcomers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Australian seems to be the slam where people can sneak in
there a little bit, but here at the Open, I think it's pretty hard
to come out of the pack and show up in the final. There are maybe
eight girls, including both Williams sisters, who could win it and
I wouldn't be shocked, but on the men's side, with Pete and Andre
and Patrick and even Kafelnikov all fired up on the hardcourts,
those are some pretty big obstacles,'' Solomon said. ``If you
aren't used to it, there's an air of electricity around the Open
and the city that can drain you just being there. And since the
surface is fair, it's going to give the edge to the better
players.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampras' coach, Paul Annacone, a former player who dealt the
four-time champion John McEnroe the only first-round Open loss of
his career in 1986, said the Open ``epitomizes the hustle-bustle
and hoopla of New York.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So many things go on that are out of your control, and you
just have to learn to adapt,'' he said. ``It's like coping with the
tiebreaker: Most players don't want to end a match like that, but
it just adds to the character of the place, a little metropolitan
roll of the dice. One day the place is a 99-degree cement jungle,
the next day there could be a hurricane. Pete's personality doesn't
fit in with the place, but I've learned not to use Pete as a
barometer. Pete adapts.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Open, that's a cue worth following.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ May 29, 1996, was brisk but brilliant, a splendid day
for celebration and champagne on Staten Island as Gov. George
Pataki and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani announced that the Fresh Kills
landfill _ the biggest dump in the world _ would finally close.
</P>
<P>
   There was one small problem.
</P>
<P>
   Until 48 hours before the announcement, no one in the mayor's
office had bothered to tell the Sanitation Department about the
timetable: that after Dec. 31, 2001, not a single old shoe, not a
single piece of rotting refuse would ever again be buried at Fresh
Kills. No exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   The department suddenly had to figure out what to do with the
13,000 tons of household garbage that are added each day to the
artificial mountain. Only a few months earlier, sanitation
officials were still counting on using Fresh Kills for 15 more
years.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, with just over two years to go, sanitation officials
still do not know where or how they will dispose of most of the
city's residential garbage.
</P>
<P>
   Few people would dispute that Fresh Kills is an environmental
nightmare. Designed when even the most dangerous substances were
routinely dumped in unlined pits, the landfill has for five decades
befouled the air of western Staten Island with noxious gases and
has polluted the ground water with cyanide, pesticides and toxic
waste.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Lhota, the deputy mayor for operations, said he was
confident that Fresh Kills would close on time. He pointed to
various interim steps, like exporting household trash from the
Bronx and Brooklyn to out-of-state landfills, that have cut the
daily flow to Fresh Kills to 8,500 tons from 13,000. Even without a
long-term solution, he said, the city will have plenty of
short-term options.
</P>
<P>
   The likeliest would be to send 600 sanitation trucks, each
lugging nine tons of trash, in daily caravans through the Holland
and Lincoln Tunnels to trash depots in New Jersey and elsewhere. In
addition, at least 240 18-wheelers crammed with garbage would head
directly to out-of-town landfills.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the city, it turns out, plenty of rural counties and
municipalities with modern landfills or costly incinerators are
eager to take the city's garbage _ and millions of dollars in fees.
</P>
<P>
   At least the city is finally grappling with a realistic
alternative to continuing to dump at Fresh Kills, said Chaz Miller,
a lobbyist for the National Solid Waste Association, a trade group
in Washington. ``Fresh Kills is an environmental obscenity,'' he
said. ``People lose sight of that fact.''
</P>
<P>
   On a recent sunny afternoon at the Staten Island Mall, one
shopper after another expressed doubts that the landfill would ever
shut.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've had like eight five-year plans to close it and they
keep pushing it back,'' said Samantha Jacobs, 19, who is studying
advertising in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Guy Molinari, Staten Island's borough president and a
Republican, is determined to prove her and other doubters wrong,
and to end Staten Island's status as the city's figurative and
literal dumping ground. He notes that around the time Fresh Kills
opened, six other dumps were operating in other boroughs. Over the
years, they all closed. Only Fresh Kills remained, growing so big
that it is visible to orbiting astronauts.
</P>
<P>
   The result has been an immense, smelly humiliation. Town houses
now encroach, and the landfill's odors reach the exclusive Todt
Hill neighborhood two and a half miles away.
</P>
<P>
   ``All other New Yorkers know is that their garbage goes
someplace,'' he said. ``We've been abused to hell and back.''
</P>
<P>
   To reassure constituents who doubted that Fresh Kills would ever
close, Molinari has demanded that the city's new trash plan include
steady reductions in the flow of garbage to Staten Island. And so
far the city has been able to do that, using truck and rail
shipments to carry garbage to private landfills, mainly in
Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   But as that flow grows and as the number of outbound trucks
increases, roads, bridges and tunnels leading out of the city will
be jammed, some officials and industry executives predict.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be no escape from traffic nightmares,'' said Ron
Klempner, president of American Marine Rail, a company bidding to
build a transfer station for household garbage in the South Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever solution finally emerges, it appears clear that Fresh
Kills, like an aging dinosaur, is ever so slowly coming to an end.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the activity there now centers on the installation of
pipes to capture leaking liquids and gases. Only 150 acres of the
3,000-acre landfill remain an active dumping area. No equipment is
being replaced, nobody is being trained and supervisors are
preparing to retire.
</P>
<P>
   Molinari said he was confident that the dump would close.
``We're going to have one hell of a big party,'' he said. ``We'll
have fireworks from one end of Staten Island to the other.''
</P>
<P>
   But if the dump does not close _ and close on time _ he promises
to be a very angry man.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would go back to secession,'' he growled. ``Or I would go
up on the roof of Borough Hall and shoot myself.''

BROAD AGENDA SEEN IN TALKS WITH TURKEY
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit of Turkey will
visit Washington on Sept. 28 for talks with President Clinton that
will probably lead to more American aid for earthquake relief,
diplomats said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is expected to broaden the agenda, however, and to
encourage his Turkish counterpart to push ahead with tentative
steps he has taken to improve Turkey's human rights record and to
build a positive relationship with Greece.
</P>
<P>
   In what may be his most difficult effort, Clinton will also try
to persuade Ecevit to seek a compromise with Greece over the
divided island of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both sides recognize that there is a need to correct past
abuses and broaden democracy in Turkey,'' said an American diplomat
who is helping to plan the meeting. ``In important ways, progress
in these areas affects how much we can do in other parts of the
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cyprus is also a limiting factor,'' the diplomat said. ``We're
not directly linking progress on Cyprus with other issues,
certainly not with help on earthquake reconstruction, but in the
long run a failure to address the realities there is not going to
serve Turkey's long-term interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Planning for the Washington meeting began before the Aug. 17
earthquake, which killed more than 13,000 people and devastated a
large area of northwestern Turkey. The meeting was originally
intended to give Clinton and Ecevit, who have never met, a chance
to discuss regional issues including the Middle East peace effort,
policy toward Iraq and American-backed plans to build an oil
pipeline from the Caspian Sea across Turkey to the Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
   Since the quake, the agenda for the meeting has been broadened.
Clinton has promised to listen sympathetically to aid requests like
those Ecevit will probably bring with him to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Turkey is our longtime ally, and the people of Turkey are our
friends,'' Clinton said in a statement issued Saturday. ``Now, with
many of them in desperate need, we must do all we can to help, and
we will.''
</P>
<P>
   Ecevit said Sunday that he would ask the United States to
guarantee a bond issue to raise money for reconstruction. Such a
guarantee would lower the interest rate Turkey would have to pay to
buyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can issue an earthquake bond backed by the United
States, it will be a help in rapidly overcoming the economic
problems caused by the earthquake,'' Ecevit said after a Cabinet
meeting. ``I hope the United States will approach this
positively.''
</P>
<P>
   Although American officials said they were still uncertain what
form additional earthquake relief might take, there is considerable
support in the administration for enough generosity to reflect the
value that the United States places on its friendship with Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   ``The earthquake and our response to it served to highlight the
excellent state of relations and the generally positive feelings
both sides have about each other,'' a senior American official
said. ``It's created a greater awareness of our importance to each
other. How far we can build on that to make progress in other areas
remains to be seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister Ismail Cem of Turkey said his government was
deeply grateful for American aid in earthquake relief, but he
suggested that Ecevit was not prepared to accept guidance from
Washington on political issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not really happy with the way the U.S. has been dealing
with the Cyprus issue, so we'll probably offer our views on that,''
Cem said in an interview. ``As for human rights, the meetings are
going to cover all issues, so that will probably come up, although
we don't have it as an agenda point.
</P>
<P>
   ``The important thing to understand is that we are not going to
Washington for some kind of inspection. It's a meeting between the
heads of two friendly governments at a very interesting and
positive moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Turkey is a member of NATO and has for decades been a close ally
of the United States. Military and security issues have
traditionally been at the core of their relationship. American
efforts to provide military aid to Turkey, however, have often been
blocked or modified by what some influential figures in Washington
say is Turkey's poor human rights record and its hostility to
Greece.
</P>
<P>
   Since the earthquake, spectacular progress has been made on
improving Greek-Turkish relations. In an interview published Sunday
in Athens, Foreign Minister George Papandreou of Greece said the
outpouring of Greek sympathy for earthquake victims ``has created a
new psychology'' and destroyed ``the myth that has been cultivated
that Greeks and Turks cannot live side by side.''
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright sent Papandreou a letter
praising Greece's attitude and encouraging him to ``build on this
to continue to improve the bilateral relationship.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Turkey has also made at least tentative progress on human rights
issues. In recent days, Parliament has passed two laws that could
lead to improvement in the human rights climate here.
</P>
<P>
   One is a ``repentance law'' that will allow the authorities to
offer amnesty to members of the Kurdish guerrilla army that has
been waging war against the Turkish state for 15 years. But the law
was watered down in Parliament so that it applies only to
low-ranking guerrillas who never took part in armed actions.
</P>
<P>
   The second law offers amnesty to thousands of prisoners in
Turkish jails. It is expected to lead to the release of several
rightist gunmen and, according to the Istanbul newspaper Milliyet,
``mafia gangs that have murdered, tortured and kidnapped.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Turks who supported the bill hope that it will also benefit
intellectuals imprisoned for making speeches and writing articles
deemed subversive. A clause inserted by rightist members of
Parliament, however, forbids the release of prisoners convicted of
``treason or crimes against the state.''
</P>
<P>
   That may mean that the law will not affect some of Turkey's
best-known prisoners, like the human rights advocate Akin Birdal;
Esber Yagmurdereli, a lawyer who is blind, and the Kurdish
politician Leyla Zana.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights groups in the United States have urged that all
three be released, and they are expected to urge Clinton to bring
up their cases with Ecevit when they meet.

   IN FRANCE, BANKING RIVALS COULD BE RIPE FOR TAKEOVER
</P>
<P>
   Now that French bank regulators have rejected a bid by Banque
Nationale de Paris to keep its shares in Societe Generale and
scuttled its effort to form a European giant, both banks could
become takeover targets.
</P>
<P>
   The big loser in the bank battle appeared to be the head of the
French central bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, who had strenuously
backed a three-way deal. The very French notion that the central
authorities could dictate the shape of the banking system was badly
wounded in the process as well.
</P>
<P>
   COPPER PRODUCERS RESIST HOSTILE BID
</P>
<P>
   Two merging copper producers, Asarco and Cyprus Amax Minerals,
said they were determined to fight a hostile takeover campaign by
Phelps Dodge.
</P>
<P>
   RECHECKING FOR YEAR 2000 FLAWS
</P>
<P>
   A growing number of companies and government agencies contend
that their vital systems are ready for any and all year 2000 dates,
but managers continue testing on the assumption that minor flaws
still exist in some systems. Previously unknown year 2000 defects
keep popping up in commercial software, and adding new equipment or
improving software carries the risk of inadvertently introducing
bugs into systems that have been cleaned up and tested.
</P>
<P>
   MERGER SEEN FOR FRENCH RETAILERS
</P>
<P>
   Carrefour and Promodes, France's two largest publicly traded
retailers, have scheduled a new conference for Monday amid
speculation that the companies will merge in a deal worth as much
as $14 billion.
</P>
<P>
   MAGAZINE CIRCULATION WAR IN BRAZIL
</P>
<P>
   Veja magazine, which boasts of having the largest circulation of
any weekly news magazine outside the United States, is involved in
a full-blown circulation war, forced to fend off two rivals intent
on breaching its dominance of the huge Brazilian market.
</P>
<P>
   DISNEY KEEPS LOS ANGELES MAGAZINE
</P>
<P>
   When Walt Disney announced the sale of its Fairchild
Publications unit to Advance Publications last week, Los Angeles
magazine was not part of the deal. Disney executives say that the
magazine is the company's hometown glossy and that it is more
closely aligned with its core businesses than the dozen or so
publications sold to Advance.
</P>
<P>
   IMPORTANCE OF WEB-PAGE DESIGN
</P>
<P>
   With electronic commerce sites proliferating on the Web, shoddy
site-search engines, Byzantine navigation schemes and long waits
for pages to download are increasingly recognized as grave threats
to the bottom line. And as more sites seek profitability by
expanding their offerings, Web-site design is looming as an ever
more crucial facet of the business.

VIDEOTAPES REVEAL SECRET UNION-NFL AGREEMENT ON DRUG LENIENCY
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Hawaii, Fla.)  (ms) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The cameras were rolling, and no one needed to yell, ``Action.''
There was plenty to go around over three days at the 1995 annual
meeting of the National Football League Players Association in
Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   There was bickering, infighting and union politics. There was a
union official offering to instruct players on how to beat the
salary cap. There was a lengthy debate about the implicit racism
some union members believed was behind the league's plan to ban
players from wearing bandannas. And there were candid discussions
of substance abuse, including an assertion by one official that
alcohol abuse was the biggest problem among players.
</P>
<P>
   Most startlingly, the union informed its membership that a
significant number of players had failed drug tests that year but
were not punished or suspended because of a secret agreement
between the league and the union.
</P>
<P>
   All of the proceedings at the union meeting four years ago in
Maui were captured on more than 40 hours of videotape by a Florida
company hired by the players association to film the meetings. The
intention was to create a promotional package that could be
distributed to players and perhaps improve the union's standing
with its constituents.
</P>
<P>
   After the videotapes were done, however, the NFLPA was sued by
the film company in a dispute over payment, and the union never
took full control of it. The videotapes were recently made
available to The New York Times at its request and viewed in their
entirety.
</P>
<P>
   A league official last week confirmed that players who should
have been penalized for failing drug tests under the old agreement
were not. The official, who requested anonymity, said that decision
was a concession the NFL gave to the union as part of the
negotiations in forming a more comprehensive drug policy. He put
the number of players who failed tests and should have been
suspended at 16; however, one owner put the number at ``more than
two dozen'' players.
</P>
<P>
   The videotapes offer a rare glimpse into the inner workings of a
major sports union. The activities _ from power struggles to
consensus building _ presumably take place behind the scenes at any
number of high-level meetings. Still, what unfolded frame by frame
at the 1995 NFLPA meeting was an often raucous ride through the
issues that define the landscape of the pro football labor front.
</P>
<P>
   Even though those present were told that the proceedings would
be videotaped, few of them held back or showed caution in their
words and actions. Of course, no one had any reason to believe the
film would be seen by anyone who was not at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Upshaw, the executive director of the union, said in an
interview last week that he was not defensive or ashamed about any
statements made on the tape. ``It is what it is,'' Upshaw said.
``We want players at the meetings to be open and speak their minds.
If we had something to hide, we would not have filmed it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Collins, formerly of the New York Giants, was a player
representative for 12 years, and despite recently retiring as a
player he remains a member of the union's executive committee.
Collins was present at the 1995 meeting and made it clear in a
recent interview that while much gets accomplished, there is
usually a tremendous amount of bickering. He said players had been
known to argue about whether to use Federal Express or the United
Parcel Service to mail documents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get a lot done,'' Collins said, ``but things get pretty
intense.''
</P>
<P>
   The starring role in the videotapes unquestionably belongs to
Upshaw. The tapes show various portraits of him, always
intelligent, sometimes charismatic, sometimes defiant and at other
times manipulative. Through it all, Upshaw weaves skillfully
through the internal politics and back room deals, making it easy
to understand why he has lasted almost two decades in the cutthroat
union world.
</P>
<P>
   Under Upshaw, players have recently seen salaries and benefits
skyrocket, and he assured labor peace into the next century with
last year's extension of the collective bargaining agreement
through 2003.
</P>
<P>
   But at the Hawaii meetings, Upshaw faced serious opposition to
his leadership from a small group of veteran players regarding his
contract. The executive board had voted him a raise and an
extension without gaining permission of the rank and file, players
say on the tape. There were fierce debates about Upshaw's future
among the 55 or so player representatives, lasting over six hours.
</P>
<P>
   The player who expressed the most outrage was Tim Irwin, a
6-foot-7-inch, 300-pound offensive lineman then with the Tampa Bay
Buccaneers. Irwin and Upshaw were involved in a heated conversation
when Upshaw, a muscular Hall of Fame offensive lineman, seated on a
stage just a few feet away, decided he had heard enough.
</P>
<P>
   Upshaw, who is black, leaned toward Irwin, who is white, and
said he was not going to let ``some redneck from Tennessee'' tell
him what to do. Irwin did not press the argument.
</P>
<P>
   Upshaw said last week he did not remember making the statement
but did remember that there was a lot of controversy about his new
contract. ``There were players who thought I had this secret deal
or the executive committee was under my thumb,'' Upshaw said. ``But
that just wasn't the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the biggest revelation from the videotape comes during
the discussion by Doug Allen, the union's assistant executive
director, about the differences between the league's old drug
policy and the new one that was to take effect later that year.
</P>
<P>
   The tape shows Allen saying the union was informed by the NFL
that a significant number of players had failed drug tests and
faced suspensions. Allen goes on to say that because of a private
agreement with the league office, the players would not be
suspended and in fact would be given another chance under the new
policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will tell you there were a number of players who were
notified of suspensions under the old policy and those suspensions
were held in abeyance until we got the new policy done,'' Allen
says on the tape. ``We convinced them not to suspend those
players.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen goes on to say that ``a number'' of those players would
have been suspended for one year.
</P>
<P>
   Reached by telephone last week, Allen declined to comment
because he said the tapes were confidential.
</P>
<P>
   The league official who insisted on anonymity said there were 16
players who faced suspensions, varying from four games to one year,
but who were not suspended. One of those players, the league
official said, is still active today. He would not name the player.
</P>
<P>
   An NFL owner disputed the league's accounting, saying that more
than two dozen players should have been suspended but were not. He
also said that at least two dozen more players failed their initial
drug test but were not required to undergo counseling or treatment
as is normally mandatory (first-time offenders are not suspended).
</P>
<P>
   The owner, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
league essentially canceled all of the positive tests. ``I was
concerned about the message we were sending,'' the owner said. ``We
were basically giving them an additional strike.''
</P>
<P>
   It took the union and the league two years to form the new
policy, which went into effect at the beginning of the 1996 season.
Much of the policy remains in effect today and is considered the
most comprehensive among the major sports.
</P>
<P>
   At the meeting, Allen also informed the player representatives
that there were a ``dozen alcohol situations'' from that year. He
was not more specific on the tapes, but his words fell into the
same portion of the meeting in which he discussed failed drug
tests. (The league does monitor its players for alcohol abuse.)
</P>
<P>
   On the tape, Allen said, ``Frankly the biggest problem we have
with substance abuse is not marijuana, or cocaine, but alcohol.''
</P>
<P>
   Privately, players and team officials have claimed for years
that alcohol abuse is far more problematic than illicit drug use.
But no union or league official has ever made such a statement
publicly.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The meetings continued with union leaders briefing the player
representatives on various salary matters. One union official, who
was not identifiable on the tape, told the representatives that if
they or other players wanted to find loopholes in the salary cap
system, union financial analysts would help.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to know how to beat the cap,'' the official said,
``come to me.''
</P>
<P>
   An intense portion of the meetings came during a nearly
four-hour discussion about a proposed rule that would have
prohibited bandannas, or ``do-rags,'' as the players call them,
popularized by the star cornerback Deion Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   Upshaw said on the videotape that the only reason the league
wanted to ban the bandannas was because black players wore them.
The league office did nothing to stop white quarterbacks from
wearing hats on the sidelines, Upshaw argued on the tapes, and the
hats are as prominent as bandannas. Upshaw made it clear he felt
the league's position was racist.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a black and white issue,'' Upshaw said on the tape.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Upshaw said: ``The black players did feel it was
racist. I just wanted to make sure their concerns were heard.''
</P>
<P>
   A league official denied race was a factor, but said some black
officials in the league were concerned that black players wearing
them perpetuated negative stereotypes. The league mainly wanted
uniform conformity, the official said. The NFL did allow players to
wear bandannas as long as they were tucked under the players'
helmet and mirrored the team's colors.
</P>
<P>
   At several points on the videos, players chastise fans for their
drunkenness at games. Players and union officials also berate
individual reporters from several news outlets by name. The news
media is a major concern of the players, and much of the talk is
about how to keep it under control.
</P>
<P>
   When players ask who leaks their salary information to the
press, various executives respond by saying that reporters steal
the information out of the players' lockers or bribe agents with
cash.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, a significant amount of salary information was then,
and is now, leaked by union officials, individual teams or the
players' agents. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Despite the raucous nature of this meeting, the NFLPA, after
surviving two strikes in the 1980s, is stronger than ever. The
average player salary is about $1 million, compared with $800,000
in 1995 and $352,000 in 1990. In a decade of labor contentiousness
in pro sports, pro football's labor front has been relatively calm.
</P>
<P>
   But even in those circumstances, being a union leader is often a
thankless job. Some players still believe the NFLPA does little to
help the players at the bottom of the rung.
</P>
<P>
   That feeling was worse in 1995, which was why the union
commissioned a Florida company, Sportsolution, to shoot a
documentary, ``The History of the NFLPA.'' The union hoped to
distribute the video to each of its members.
</P>
<P>
   According to a lawsuit filed in the United States district court
in Orlando, Fla., Sportsolution maintains that it was not
compensated by the NFLPA after filming approximately 500 hours of
videotape from union events between June 1994 and February 1997.
The video company also gave the NFLPA 11 hours of edited tape. The
union replied in court documents that the taping was done on a
trial basis and Sportsolution was owed nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the fiercer arguments at the 1995 sessions centered on
Upshaw and a budget overrun of $51,000. Upshaw faced his most vocal
opposition from Irwin, who objected to the length of Upshaw's
contract extension, which was scheduled to take him until 2000.
Upshaw's new salary called for him to earn $900,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin said on the tape, ``We may decide down the road we don't
want Upshaw back.''
</P>
<P>
   Upshaw, who repeatedly said on the tapes that he deserved even
more than the new agreement paid him, angrily retorted: ``I may not
want to come back. It's a two-way street.''
</P>
<P>
   Other players defended Upshaw at the meeting. ``Why can't we get
past this Gene issue and being $51,000 over budget?'' one
unidentified Broncos player said. ``Damn, $51,000? That's just two
Pontiacs.'' &QL;

CULTURAL CENTER FINDS BASKETBALL STAR'S $5 MILLION GIFT BRINGS
PRESSURES 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 By BRUCE WEBER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ One day in March 1997, David Robinson and his
wife, Valerie, paid a visit to the Carver Community Cultural
Center, the weather-beaten but enduring arts institution on this
city's neglected east side. They had been there previously to
discuss a donation to the center, which operates on a modest $1.4
million annual budget and was then preparing to open a capital
campaign for much-needed renovations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to create something that would still be here 100
years from now,'' said Robinson, best known as the center of the
San Antonio Spurs, the National Basketball Association champions,
who play in the Alamodome, a few blocks from the Carver. ``And we
wanted to do something on the east side. It's a sad neighborhood,
and that has always bothered me. It's mostly an African-American
neighborhood, and it's right down the street from my arena.''
</P>
<P>
   To those ends, the Robinsons made a decision that was remarkable
in its magnitude and abruptness. They chose to build a school for
neighborhood children on the grounds adjacent to the Carver, with
the Carver name.
</P>
<P>
   The school had been a wish of Jo Long, the Carver's longtime
director, as an appropriate crown for an institution she has
nurtured almost obsessively for 23 years. But she was unprepared
for the Robinsons' largesse.
</P>
<P>
   After the March meeting the Robinsons went to lunch, Ms. Long
recalled. ``And they called me an hour and a half later and said,
`OK, we're going to give you $5 million for this school.' I was
speechless. I got up and came home. And the next day they delivered
a check for $75,000 to start the master planning.''
</P>
<P>
   In recognition of the gift, on Wednesday Robinson, 34, is to
receive the Montblanc de la Culture Award, one of a series of
annual honors for philanthropy in the arts bestowed around the
world by Montblanc, the German pen makers.
</P>
<P>
   For the Carver, however, and for Ms. Long in particular, the
story has a ``be careful what you wish for'' element as well. The
ceremonial groundbreaking is take place Monday for a new
institution, the Carver Complex, encompassing a $6 million
renovation and expansion of the Carver Cultural Center and a
280-student independent elementary school to be known as the Carver
Academy, all of which has been set in motion by Robinson's $5
million.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Long, 49, who is something of a local legend, will not
be there. She is at home recovering from a breakdown, leaving the
Carver leaderless at a crucial time. It is uncertain when, or if,
she will return.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the stress of this effort contributed to her
disability,'' said Isaiah T. Creswell, the chairman of the arts
center board, known as the Carver Development Board. It was an
assessment with which Ms. Long, who spent a month in the hospital
this summer being treated for bipolar disorder, concurred.
</P>
<P>
   It was just after the delivery of the first $75,000, Ms. Long
said, that the Carver began acquiring the property for the academy.
Six months later as she was being named by the Texas Monthly
magazine as one of the 20 most influential Texans, the Robinson
gift was announced to the public. ``That,'' she said, ``was the
start of my anxiety.''
</P>
<P>
   The strain on Ms. Long and the Carver has to do with the problem
of what happens to a small institution when it faces the kind of
change that the Robinson gift has engendered. There is no precedent
in the Carver's history for the kind of fund-raising, money
management, land acquisition or capital construction required by
the new project.
</P>
<P>
   The general situation is complicated by the Carver's
idiosyncrasies: its historical significance to San Antonio's black
population (less than 8 percent of the city's approximately 1
million people), its current significance to the poor and
underserved area where it stands and its unusual relationship to
the city government, which finances more than half of its budget
through the city's social services arm, the Department of Community
Initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   The city would ultimately like to trim its financing of the
Carver, but any moves along these lines have been successfully
fought by the local community, and Ms. Long, who say the city pays
far too little attention to the east side as it is.
</P>
<P>
   The Carver is the east side landmark, a place where the likes of
Ella Fitzgerald and Paul Robeson performed. It began life in the
early part of the century as a segregated library and meeting hall;
the current building, erected in 1929, has an inscription over the
side door identifying it as the ``colored branch'' of the San
Antonio library. It served that function until the city was
desegregated in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Long arrived in 1976, just three years after the city, to
neighborhood outrage, threatened to demolish the building. (One
woman actually lay down in front of the bulldozers.) Under her
guidance the Carver has presented, mostly in its 650-seat, poorly
ventilated auditorium, a diverse series of dance, theater and
musical performances. The performance artist Danny Hoch, the jazz
pianist Ahmad Jamal and the Donald Byrd dance company were among
its offerings last season.
</P>
<P>
   The center also conducts workshops and classes in performing and
fine arts. And it is also still used for such varied activities as
meetings, beauty pageants, weddings and even the occasional
funeral.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Carver has always been the anchor for the African-American
community here,'' said Eduardo Diaz, who, as director of the city's
Office of Cultural Affairs, has often clashed with Ms. Long and
those in the Carver neighborhood, but who also takes classes at the
Carver in Latin and African drumming. ``And they've done so much in
terms of sharing with San Antonio. Alvin Ailey, McCoy Tyner, the
Harlem Boys Choir, A Traveling Jewish Theater: none of these would
have come here without the Carver.''

<P>
   For Robinson, the gift melds two aims: to help the neighborhood
and to establish a permanent ``ministry,'' as Robinson, who
describes himself as a devout Christian, is wont to call any
organization devoted to social service.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly absent from his thinking is any motivation to support the
arts. He had only been to the Carver once before he began talking
with Ms. Long, he said, for an event he cannot recall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not an arts guy,'' said Robinson, who graduated from the
United States Naval Academy with a degree in mathematics. ``My
thing is math, computers. And education.''
</P>
<P>
   The school he wants to build through the David Robinson
Foundation, which he finances personally and administers jointly
with his wife, will not be an arts school but one with a rigorous
academic (and secular) curriculum. It will not be a charter school.
It will have its own governance, a board separate from the Carver
Center that is now being formed and will shortly begin a search for
a headmaster. In essence, his wishes have been grafted onto the
Carver, with the result that the profile of the whole will be
enhanced, but changed forever.
</P>
<P>
   Carver officials say that the school is certainly in line with
the institution's historical mission to serve the needs of the
neighborhood, and that in any case the two will be governed
independently.
</P>
<P>
   The arts center is planning its own education program in visual
and performing arts as part of its renovations. But its program of
presentations is not to be significantly expanded, only improved by
the addition of wing and fly space, a new roof and a new
air-conditioning system and the construction of a small performance
space in an old church on the grounds. Robinson's $5 million was
given with his permission for it to be used by the Carver
Development Board, as challenge grants to attract other donors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the best opportunity this board has ever had to raise
money for the Carver and its programs,'' said Navarra Williams, the
president of the local cable television company, who, with Ms.
Long, has been the Carver's chief fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Long has been at the fulcrum of all this activity. In
addition to running the Carver she has been visiting independent
schools nationwide and otherwise educating herself about how a
school is built. And most pressing, she has been raising money.
</P>
<P>
   The Carver Development Board both is relatively young _ it was
formed in 1987 _ and has been reconstructed in the wake of the
Robinson gift to include the lawyers, bankers and capital projects
experts the new complex demands; it has yet to develop the unity
and financial clout to operate as an effective fund-raising body.
</P>
<P>
   ``Building a board takes time,'' said Charles O. Deriemer, the
retired chairman of the Southwestern Bell Corp. Foundation, who
served as a consultant in the Carver board reconstruction. ``Carver
does not have the social cachet'' of a an established mainstream
arts organization, he said. ``And it never will have.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the board members are African-Americans, influential
residents without financial resources, and you don't want to give
that up so you can have the wives of some CEOs. The board will
always have to balance roots in the east side with the new sprouts
that have to emerge.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus far Ms. Long and Williams have brought in $3.5 million of
the necessary $6 million, but both acknowledge that local corporate
support has been slow. Most of the money has come from the federal
Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Doris Duke
Charitable Foundation and the Kronkosky Charitable Foundation, a
new local fund.
</P>
<P>
   And most of that was raised by Ms. Long. ``She was involved in
every dollar we've raised,'' Williams said. ``It's a lot of
pressure when it's not what you're used to doing every day.''
</P>
<P>
   The Carver sits on North Hackberry St., sharing an intersection
with a mortuary in a mostly residential neighborhood, its homes
aging, many of them not well. A model of the future Carver Complex,
a campus of several buildings filling four square blocks, sits on a
table in the Carver center now, a plywood embryo.
</P>
<P>
   Designed by a local firm, Lake/Flato, it shows a handsome series
of low-lying brick and glass structures surrounding plots of
greensward. It would take the place of 16 private homes, many of
which will be moved, with their residents, to vacant lots on nearby
streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a real challenge for them,'' said Palmer Moe,
the executive director of the Kronkosky fund. ``Developing a
private school from scratch and filling it with kids who won't be
able to pay tuition won't be easy.''
</P>
<P>
   But after a pause, he expressed a sentiment that could be used
as a mantra around here. ``If people don't dream, things don't get
done,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The city has put on hold its effort to cut back on its funds for
the Carver, and it is helping with the acquisition of property. In
another good sign, the Robinson gift has already stirred
neighborhood development; just around the corner, a vast, eroding
structure, long ago the home of the Friedrich Refrigeration Co., is
now being renovated for a mixed-use complex to include residences,
business offices and light manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
   Planning and financing are on schedule for construction of the
Carver Complex to begin next spring, and for full programming in a
renovated Carver Center to resume in the fall of 2001, the same
time that the first class of students is to enter the Carver
Academy.
</P>
<P>
   In Ms. Long's absence, the assistant director of the city's
Department of Community Initiatives, Henry Ross, is serving as
interim manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost all of us associated with the Carver are trying to
fulfill the vision Jo Long has had,'' said Creswell, the Carver's
board chairman. ``All of us are protective of Jo. But it may get to
a point where we have to say, `We've got to move on.'
</P>
<P>
   ``So I'm worried about two things. The continuity of leadership,
finding a person with some vision, who can operate nationally and
be sensitive to the people who live within four blocks of here.''
</P>
<P>
   He paused. The second thing? ``I guess that's the second thing,
too,'' he said.

 &HT;    Report on college hazing issued today
 &HT;    By Susan Vinella and Marty Williams
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ While other colleges across the country may have
problems with upperclassmen hazing freshman athletes, coaches
report that their teams are too busy preparing for games to take
time out for pranks.
</P>
<P>
   Today, a nationwide survey will focus on hazing in college
athletics. Officials from the NCAA and the Alfred University
Presidential Commission on Athletics will announce results of a
comprehensive survey about hazing among athletes. The survey
results are based upon a random sampling of 3,000 NCAA coaches and
10,000 NCAA athletes from 224 colleges and universities in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Hazing is any humiliating, degrading, abusive or dangerous act
expected of a person who joins a group regardless of whether the
person is willing to participate.
</P>
<P>
   The survey was designed to gauge the prevalence of hazing, how
colleges deal with such incidents, the extent to which alcohol is
involved and the type of hazing activities that occur.
</P>
<P>
   As they prepare for tough seasons during which they will be
defending winning records, football coaches and players at Ohio
State University and Miami University say hazing is not a problem
on their teams.
</P>
<P>
   OSU coach John Cooper said he hasn't dealt with hazing incidents
at the schools where he has coached. Cooper, in his 12th year at
OSU, also has coached at the University of Tulsa and Arizona State.
</P>
<P>
   At OSU, he said, there has been some ribbing of freshmen, but he
wouldn't characterize it as hazing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't call it hazing or even harassment, but our freshmen
used to get up and sing a song or mimic the coaches in a skit,''
Cooper said.
</P>
<P>
   He said occasionally a freshman player would be ordered to sing
the Buckeyes' fight song on the spot.
</P>
<P>
   But over the past few years, the annual freshmen skits have been
``phased out,'' Cooper said.
</P>
<P>
   Fifth-year senior fullback Matt Keller said that's because the
performances of skits ``got so bad,'' and too little thought put
into them was poor. He said more and more freshmen are playing
their first year now, too, so there's less of a differentiation
between them and upperclassmen.
</P>
<P>
   When he arrived at OSU, he said, the skits still were a part of
a sort of freshmen initiation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just harmless fun,'' he said. ``All they would say was,
'You need a skit ready by this date.'''
</P>
<P>
   Sophomore running back Jonathan Wells said he heard stories
about freshmen hazing while he was in high school but he never
experienced it at Ohio State.
</P>
<P>
   ``We might have had a few jokes like, 'Carry a helmet out to
practice,' but that's it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Hoeppner is in his first year as Miami's head football
coach. He was an assistant coach at the school for 13 seasons
before being named as Randy Walker's replacement on Jan. 27.
</P>
<P>
   In more than a decade at UM, he said hazing hasn't been a
problem for the RedHawks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We discourage that (hazing) because it adds nothing to what
we're trying to build with our program,'' he said. ``There's a lot
of hard work involved in (preseason) camp and you don't have much
time to get the new players up to speed. You have to make every
minute count and that kind of thing (hazing) doesn't help.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoeppner said the closest thing to hazing is when some players
are asked to sing their high school fight song.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, that practice has paid unexpected dividends for the
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``By doing that, we may have discovered a young man who has
missed his calling,'' Hoeppner said. ``We have a freshman defensive
lineman from Dayton Dunbar named Trey Manuel. We call him Trey
because his full name is Richard Manuel III. He was so good that we
asked him to sing at a couple of our team functions and everybody
loved him. We're hoping to have him sing the National Anthem before
one of our games.''

ADVERTISING: TENNIS GROUP AIMS CAMPAIGN AT DIVERSE AUDIENCE 
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Ore.) (lb) 
 By JANE L. LEVERE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Organizers and sponsors of the U.S. Open tennis
tournament are aiming their advertising for this year's event,
which begins Monday in Flushing Meadows, Queens, at a younger, more
diverse audience than tennis has traditionally attracted.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigns by both IBM and American Express, sponsors of the
Open, feature people of differing races and ages. And the U.S.
Tennis Association, which owns and operates the Open, is running an
irreverent, humorous campaign for the tournament that is clearly
designed to democratize the image of the sport.
</P>
<P>
   Observers say this strategy is crucial now for the USTA. In the
past 20 years, Nielsen ratings for the U.S. Open have plummeted
from a high of 5.8 in 1981 to a low of 2.3 in 1997; they were 2.8
last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Open is competing with major-league baseball, pro
football, college football,'' said Rick Burton, director of the
Warsaw Sports Marketing Center of the Charles H. Lundquist College
of Business at the University of Oregon in Eugene. ``And it's got
image issues. Its positioning is staid _ it's Pete Sampras and
Lindsay Davenport. They're talented athletes, but they're not very
exciting to non-tennis aficionados. Tennis needs more people like
the Jensen brothers, the Williams sisters, to bring it a distinct
personality.''
</P>
<P>
   To develop a more dynamic image for the sport, the tennis
association hired Fallon McElligott New York City, a unit of Fallon
McElligott, which is known for its irreverent advertising. The
agency's executive creative director is Jamie Barrett, who
previously worked at Wieden &AMP; Kennedy in Portland, Ore., on
advertising for Nike, the pre-eminent sports marketer that is also
famously irreverent.
</P>
<P>
   Budgeted at a record $2 million, the association's new campaign
is meant to make the Open ``inclusive to all kinds of fans, not
just the hard-core tennis enthusiast,'' said John Gerzema, managing
partner of Fallon McElligott New York City.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign includes pictures on New York City buses of
different groups of people seated in rows of stadium seats; the
side of one bus shows a row of society matrons wearing hats and
holding tiny dogs, while the other side of the bus shows punk
rockers. The ads say the Upper East Side and the East Village,
respectively, are ``going to the U.S. Open,'' and ask ``Are you?''
</P>
<P>
   Advertising appearing in commuter trains in the New York
metropolitan area repeats this theme, illustrating it, in one case,
with a man who could hardly be described as fit leading a step
aerobics class. The copy says the regular step aerobics instructor
at Equinox, a Manhattan health club, ``will be out at the U.S. Open
next Thursday'' and adds: ``You may want to do the treadmill that
day. Almost everyone's going to the U.S. Open. Are you?''
</P>
<P>
   On cable, network and local television, the association is
running four humorous 30-second spots depicting fictitious tests
that compare tennis with various sports: For example, one
commercial shows a pair of figure skaters unsuccessfully trying to
complete a routine on a hard-surface tennis court. All spots claim
nothing beats ``the excitement of U.S. Open tennis.''

   Like the tennis association, IBM is aiming its U.S. Open
advertising at a relatively young group, in this case
technologically oriented, Internet-savvy consumers who are
potential IBM customers. The advertising is an extension of IBM's
ongoing ``e-business'' campaign, which uses a red ``e'' logo to
promote Internet-related products and services.
</P>
<P>
   IBM's Open campaign features striking black and white
photographs of youngsters playing tennis in New York City streets.
Also in each ad are an inspirational one-word headline, the red
``e'' logo and a statement that www.usopen.org, the tennis
association's Web site, is ``an IBM e-business.''
</P>
<P>
   One ad, headed ``e-believe,'' shows children playing tennis on a
sidewalk, a row of garbage cans serving as their net. Another,
headed ``e-venus,'' shows two young black girls, seated on a stoop,
emulating Serena and Venus Williams by braiding their hair with
beads.
</P>
<P>
   IBM's ads are running on the No. 7 subway line, which serves
Flushing and on outdoor posters in Queens and Manhattan. IBM is
also running related advertising, promoting the tennis
association's Web site, on radio in New York and six other cities,
in tennis publications, and on a variety of Web sites. All work is
by Ogilvy &AMP; Mather, part of WPP Group.
</P>
<P>
   American Express, another client of Ogilvy &AMP; Mather, is adapting
its campaign featuring celebrity card holders for the Open. The
advertising, which is running in tennis magazines and newspapers
like The Wall Street Journal, on the No. 7 subway and on billboards
in Queens and Manhattan, depicts card holders Venus Williams,
Lindsay Davenport, Murphy and Luke Jensen, John McEnroe, and Althea
Gibson, who won both Wimbledon and the U.S. Open in 1957 and 1958.
</P>
<P>
   Describing the U.S. Open as a ``demographic hit rather than a
mass dump,'' Abraham Madkour, editor in chief of The Sports
Business Daily, a newsletter, said the event gives American Express
an ``affluent audience that's a very good fit'' and ``allows IBM to
show off its technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Burton of the University of Oregon said that although he found
the American Express campaign ``tired,'' he saw IBM's strategy as
``brilliant, because it allows them to marry their e-commerce
interests with a new way of looking at tennis.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Showing gritty, inner-city visuals instead of
country clubs and crisp tennis whites speaks to how things are
different. They've got to be cutting-edge for the way e-commerce is
moving to reach their target audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Solomon, president of national broadcast for SFM Media
LLC, which is owned by Havas/Media Planning, suggested that the
U.S. Tennis Association, with its campaign, is ``trying to bring
the U.S. Open down from the elite to the common folk, without
losing the elite.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Burton questioned whether that would be possible. ``The
USTA could be caught in a crossfire, as it tries to reposition
itself to a broader audience,'' he said. ``Down the road, companies
like American Express might possibly pull out of their sponsorships
if the Open no longer delivers upscale, high-end people.''

WEAPONS FOR BATTLE AGAINST TUBERCULOSIS 
AIMING ADS AT USERS OF STREAMING AUDIO  
A SPECIAL POUCH HELPS LONG HAIR DRY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., N.Y.)   (jw) 
 By TERESA RIORDAN

<TEXT>
<P>
   In the last two decades, the world has seen a resurgence in
tuberculosis, a scourge that was previously thought _ like smallpox
and diphtheria _ to have been conquered in developed countries.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for this resurgence of TB is rapidly mutating strains
of the mycobacterium tuberculosis. Different antibiotics are
effective against different strains of the bacteria. But to figure
out which strain has infected a patient, the bacteria must be grown
in culture _ a process that takes up to 10 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doctors will give a patient a pile of different kinds of
antibiotics hoping that the mycobacterium will be sensitive to at
least one of the antibiotics,'' said Dr. Robert Ledley, a National
Medal of Technology winner who has just patented a new TB test.
``The trouble with that is that it makes for more resistant
mycobacteria.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, if the patient goes untreated until the lab
results come back, he walks around coughing up sputum for two
months and is very likely to infect others.
</P>
<P>
   Ledley, whose background is in medical imaging, said he
approached the problem of diagnosing TB in a way that was vastly
different from the way a bacteriologist would.
</P>
<P>
   The result, he contends, is a test that can determine within
minutes the best treatment for a TB patient.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bacteriologists are trained to make cultures,'' he said.
``It's what they do. I'm not trained that way. So I said to myself,
let's not grow them. Instead, let's use the bacteria themselves as
little test tubes.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Ledley says he independently hit upon a novel idea that
was, unbeknownst to him, also being developed by Dr. William R.
Jacobs and Dr. Barry R. Bloom, two microbiologists at the Albert
Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   The idea? To develop a quicker TB test by using the same
substance that makes fireflies glow.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of growing the bacteria in culture as Jacobs and Bloom
did, Ledley decided to deposit them directly on a special
microscope slide in which small depressions hold tiny pools of
different antibiotic.
</P>
<P>
   Every pool has a little drain into which the TB bacteria from a
given patient can be squirted. A special mesh keeps the bacteria
from flowing out of the individual pools.
</P>
<P>
   ``They might move around slightly in the pool, but essentially
they're stuck there,'' Ledley said.
</P>
<P>
   Before the TB bacteria are put on the microscope slide, they are
injected, through a process called electroporesis, with a gene that
produces luciferase, the same enzyme that helps to illumine
fireflies.
</P>
<P>
   As long as a bacterium is metabolizing _ that is, as long as it
is alive _ it keeps lighting up. But when it dies, the luciferase
gene becomes inactive and the light goes out.
</P>
<P>
   An automated pattern-recognition microscope monitors the
luciferase activity and can distinguish within minutes which
antibiotics douse the TB bacteria's lights and thus will work best
against that strain of TB.
</P>
<P>
   Ledley acknowledged that a test being developed by Jacobs might
work better in places where sophisticated microscopes are hard to
come by. In that test, the bacteria are inserted into tubes that
are then enclosed in a dark box that contains a piece of Polaroid
film. Within 12 days, bacteria that are drug-resistant will grow
large enough in quantity that they will appear as small, glowing
spots on the film.
</P>
<P>
   ``But my way is the fastest way,'' Ledley said. ``You can't do
it any faster.''
</P>
<P>
   Ledley is seeking drug company funding to further refine the
test. He received patent 5,922,282.
</P>
<P>
   AIMING ADS AT USERS OF STREAMING AUDIO
</P>
<P>
   Many people listen to music while sitting in front of their
computers, using so-called streaming audio technology. After
selecting a variety of songs from a music site, a computer user can
let the audio stream while he visits other Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Wolfe, a lawyer in New Rochelle, N.Y., received a patent
this month that he said covered the practice of inserting
interactive advertising into streaming audio.
</P>
<P>
   ``This kind of delivery of a message is something the public is
accustomed to,'' Wolfe said. ``What's different is that the user
will be selecting the music or genre of music and the advertiser
will be delivering an ad that is specific to that user.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolfe, whose fledgling company, Music Booth, plans to license
the patent, said it did not cover the type of advertisements
carried by traditional broadcast radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't include pure broadcast _ that is to say the kind of
advertising where everyone hears the same thing,'' Wolfe said.
``Our patent covers only the interactive area.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolfe received patent 5,931,901.
</P>
<P>
   A SPECIAL POUCH HELPS LONG HAIR DRY
</P>
<P>
   Extravagantly long tresses may look heavenly. But getting those
soggy locks to dry after a thorough shampooing can be devilish.
</P>
<P>
   Pamela Esposito, of Deltona, Fla., has invented a hair pouch
that is supposed to help long hair dry while also keeping it from
dripping all over the place.
</P>
<P>
   The pouch is made of an absorbent material like terry cloth and
edged with elastic at the opening. The hair is inserted into the
pouch and the opening is secured at the hairline.
</P>
<P>
   The pouch is especially handy for wet-headed commuters, the
patent notes. Once the commuter arrives at work and parks, the
pouch can double as a steering wheel cover, protecting it from the
sun and keeping it cool while the car is parked.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Esposito received patent 5,890,229.
</P>
<P>
   Patents may be viewed on the Web at www.uspto.gov or may be
ordered through the mail, by patent number, for $3 from the Patent
and Trademark Office, Washington, D.C. 20231.

MICROSOFT BRINGS IN TOP TALENT TO PURSUE THE TABLET COMPUTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hoping to fulfill a dream that has eluded the industry for
nearly three decades, a team of designers from the Microsoft Corp.
is trying to create a so-called tablet computer. The portable,
wireless, keyboardless device would be about the size and weight of
a writing tablet and be intended to serve most of a person's
everyday computing and Net-surfing needs.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, which has no set timetable or manufacturing plans for
the tablet computer, knows that success is far from certain. ``This
is a long-haul effort and the road in the past has been fraught
with conspicuous failures,'' said Dick Brass, the company's vice
president for emerging technologies.
</P>
<P>
   But betting that past computer-tablet stumbles, like AT&AMP;T's Eo
and Apple Computer's Newton, were simply ideas too far ahead of
their technological times, Microsoft has bolstered its team with
two legendary computer innovators, Butler Lampson and Chuck
Thacker.
</P>
<P>
   The pair were part of a group that helped pioneer some of the
most important ideas in the personal computer industry back in the
1970s as researchers at the Xerox Corporation's Palo Alto Research
Center in California. It was at PARC that such innovations as the
computer mouse, the Ethernet PC networking system and the
what-you-see-is-what-you-get screen display for word processing
were developed _ although it would be other companies, like Apple,
the 3Com Corp &UR; .  &LR;  and Microsoft that would turn those ideas into
commercially viable products.
</P>
<P>
   One PARC concept from that era that has yet to bear commercial
fruit, however, is the tablet computer, though no one is blaming
Lampson and Thacker.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they're going to take another whack at this, there aren't
two better guys to do it,'' said John Shoch, a former member of the
Xerox PARC team who is now a venture capitalist. ``Butler and Chuck
are superb designers in the broadest sense of the word.''
</P>
<P>
   Thacker, for his part, says that idea of a tablet computer may
now be ripe enough to bear fruit. ``This has been something that
people have been taking runs at for almost 30 years now,'' he said.
``But the confluence of technologies is happening that may finally
make it possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Thacker, 56, and Lampson, 55, were part of a group, led by the
computer scientist Alan Kay, that set out in 1971 to build a
portable computing machine they called a Dynabook that would enable
a user to stay wirelessly connected to a world of information. As
graduate student at the University of Utah, Kay had written his
doctoral thesis about such a machine, which he then called the
Sketchpad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember people telling Alan he was crazy,'' said Adele
Goldberg, who helped manage the Xerox PARC effort and is now a
Silicon Valley software developer and consultant. ( Kay is now a
researcher at the Walt Disney &UR;  &LR; Co. imagineering laboratory.) ``We
look back and think, well, we were just a little too early,'' Ms.
Goldberg said.
</P>
<P>
   The PARC group developed a programming system called Smalltalk
and a series of prototype computers that they referred to as
``interim Dynabooks.'' But these efforts, like commercial flops
that followed, were hampered by limitations of the software and
hardware arts at the time.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few years, however, the success of the 3Com's
hand-held Palm Pilot ``digital assistants'' _ which use simple
handwriting recognition, perform simple computing and have
rudimentary communications capabilities _ have helped revived
industry hopes for a more powerful, full-fledged tablet computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to see if we can produce a tablet PC and the
software for it that will be sufficiently powerful and intuitive
and inexpensive to capture the imagination and the marketplace,''
said Brass, who formed the Microsoft tablet team in March and last
month recruited Lampson and Thacker from other parts of the
company.
</P>
<P>
   A portable tablet computer might finally be able to replace the
keyboards of today's portable machines with either handwriting or
speech input, Brass said.
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged past commercial failures, including Apple's
Newton, the Go Corp. (whose technology was used in the abortive
AT&AMP;T Eo) and even a Microsoft project of a decade ago called Pen
Windows. But Brass said the time might now be right to build a kind
of computer that many computer executives, including Microsoft
Chairman Bill Gates, have said will eventually replace the current
desktop standard.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of things have changed,'' Brass said. ``Display
technology has gotten cheaper and the processors are now probably
fast enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Brass _ who was an early software developer in the personal
computer industry and then a vice president at the data-base
software giant, the Oracle &UR;  &LR; Corp. _ joined Microsoft two years ago
to lead an electronic book effort. Part of that work has included
the company's recently introduced Cleartype, a software approach to
improving the readability of fonts on flat panel computer displays
_ whether electronic books or portable computers.
</P>
<P>
   With Microsoft set to announce its electronic book plans this
week at the Seybold Publishing Conference technology conference in
San Francisco, Brass said that he had been shifting his focus
recently to the company's effort to design a new class of computer
embodying many of the features envisioned in the original Xerox
Dynabook.
</P>
<P>
   It was only late last month that he asked Lampson and Thacker to
join the tablet team.
</P>
<P>
   Thacker, who left a position at the Digital Equipment Corp.
laboratory in Palo Alto to join Microsoft two years ago, has been
working at a new Microsoft research laboratory he helped set up in
Britain. Lampson, who also previously worked at Digital Equipment,
came to Microsoft four years ago to work with Nathan Myhrvold, who
recently took a leave of absence as the company's head of research.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has no plans to begin manufacturing computers, Brass
said. But if the tablet effort succeeds, he said, the company will
probably form partnerships with hardware companies to build and
sell the systems.
</P>
<P>
   The new tablet project is small by Microsoft standards, said
another Microsoft developer who spoke on condition that he not be
identified. He said it was not yet clear whether the research
project would garner the resources that Microsoft throws at major
projects, which frequently involve hundreds of developers.
</P>
<P>
   But Thacker, who was one of the two principal hardware designers
of the Xerox Alto, a prototype computer that was the first
``interim Dynabook,'' does not seem concerned about whether
Microsoft is committed to this effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always wanted this kind of device,'' he said, ``and in
systems research one of the most motivating things is that you want
the device yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   And now, many people in the computer industry and at Microsoft
believe that there is a convergence of a number of technologies,
including display, processing, battery and storage that will
finally pave the way for commercial tablet computers.
</P>
<P>
   Tablet computing will be pervasive, Lampson said. ``I think this
will be the way most people interact with the Net and with the rest
of the computing universe as well.''

   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone _ A dark cloud was spreading out against
the sky above John Crowther's house the other morning as he sat
alone on his porch, kicking a pile of sand at his feet.
</P>
<P>
   The cloud would burst _ it is the rainy season in this corner of
West Africa _ and Crowther, 68, could go inside his house. But that
would do no good. The house has no roof and few walls, just the
porch, a shack and rubble.
</P>
<P>
   Within a few minutes last January, anti-government rebels burned
down the house in which Crowther had lived the second half of his
life and for which he had saved during the first half. They tried
to chop off his head with a machete, threatening to hurl his head
into the same fire that burned to death his sister and one of his
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just have to forget, really, we just have to forget,''
Crowther said, even as he showed the gashes on his neck. ``Nothing
else. I have no power. Our leaders say we must forget. Am I going
to refuse our leaders? We just have to unite together and build the
country back up together. Finished, finished, that is all.''
</P>
<P>
   The rebels who tried to decapitate Crowther, a former car
mechanic who now survives by crushing the remains of his house into
sand that he sells for 12 cents a bucket, were given amnesty under
a peace agreement signed in July.
</P>
<P>
   The deal angered Mary Robinson, the U.N. human rights
commissioner, who described the atrocities committed here as worse
than those seen in Kosovo. The rebels killed or maimed thousands of
civilians, hacking limbs off scores of them.
</P>
<P>
   In few other places on earth have the ideals of justice and the
realities of an elusive peace clashed with such intensity as in
Sierra Leone, ravaged by eight years of an indiscriminately savage
civil war. The rebel leader, Foday Sankoh, escaped a death sentence
and was given the reins of a commission that will oversee the
country's rich mineral resources; his commanders will occupy four
top Cabinet positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The atrocities reported in Sierra Leone are the worst
atrocities in recent years outside the genocide in Rwanda,'' said
Peter Takirambudde, executive director of the Africa division of
Human Rights Watch, the New York-based organization that has been
one of the most vocal critics of the agreement. ``But this most
ruthless rebel group and its leaders have walked out with one of
the best deals,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations, the United States and Britain, which oversaw
the peace talks, could have applied more pressure to get a tougher
deal against the rebels, Takirambudde added. ``Amnesty sends a
message both in Sierra Leone and elsewhere in Africa that
atrocities can be committed without consequences,'' he said, noting
that similar deals in Angola have perpetuated an ever more brutal
war there.
</P>
<P>
   But here in the capital, Sierra Leoneans and foreigners alike
say such views overlook the prime importance of stopping the war
and ignore the hard political reality: that Sierra Leone remains
marginally significant, at best, to the international community.
What is more, the new civilian government in Nigeria, which has
been leading a West African force supporting the Sierra Leone
government, was eager to withdraw its troops.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the government had been right in granting amnesty
to the rebels, Maj. Paul Aghimien, a spokesman here for the West
African force, smiled. ``When you are sick, you must take medicine
that is very, very bitter,'' said Aghimien, a Nigerian.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In Crowther's neighborhood, Calaba Town, the residents all
express grudging support for the agreement. Calaba Town, on the
eastern outskirts of Freetown, appears to have been built over the
past three decades by people seeking cheaper and more spacious
land. In January, much of Calaba Town was destroyed when the rebels
tried to seize Freetown.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays the people in Calaba Town are busy rebuilding.
</P>
<P>
   From the money he has saved crushing his house to sand, Crowther
has built a concrete bed inside a shack that had escaped damage. He
would have preferred a bed made of wood, he said, but that was too
costly.
</P>
<P>
   Up a hill, Saido Bangura, 32, a carpenter, was making a wooden
bed for someone able to afford one.
</P>
<P>
   ``By giving them amnesty,'' Bangura said, ``the rest we can
solve. We are going to support that. I will not be happy, but peace
is really the greatest achievement. I only want peace. Where there
is an atmosphere where people will not come and harm us, I can
work.''
</P>
<P>
   Standing next to a shed, Bangura was teaching two boys how to
make the bed frame. The pounding of a hammer punctuated the music
from a small radio that was playing ``Killing Me Softly'' by the
Fugees.
</P>
<P>
   Bangura rented two rooms from Saido Turay, 84, who had built
four houses on the flank of a hill over the years. The rebels had
made all but one uninhabitable. ``He cries every day,'' Bangura
said of his landlord.
</P>
<P>
   But Turay said he was ``very glad'' about the peace agreement.
Of the amnesty and punishment, he said, ``That is left to God.''
</P>
<P>
   A neighbor, Amado Sesay, 43, who was guarding his older
brother's burned-out house, put it this way: By insisting on
punishment, the government would simply prolong a war it could not
win. And ordinary Sierra Leoneans would continue to be the victims
of mutilations, rapes and killings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The millionaires, when fighting comes, go away,'' Sesay said.
``I have nowhere to go. I need the peace for my land.''
</P>
<P>
   The cloud burst, finally. The rain fell so suddenly and
violently that people scattered for cover inside their broken
homes. The carpenter ducked under the shed, joining his two
apprentices, who kept working.
</P>
<P>
   The rain fell all over Calaba Town, perhaps even all over
Freetown, fell on the carpenter's shed with such clamor that it
drowned out the music from the radio, though not the pounding of
the hammer.

DOCTORS, HMOs FACE OFF OVER MANAGED -CARE BILLS 
<TEXT>
<P>
   By BENNETT ROTH &QL;
</P>
<P>
   c. 1999 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle Washington Bureau
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Doctors say HMOs are shelling out millions to kill
legislation that would give patients better access to needed
medical care. HMOs suggest they are defending the average consumer
against trial lawyers who would make health care unaffordable.
</P>
<P>
   Those are the contradictory messages being peddled across the
nation this month as powerful special interests jockey for an
advantage in the fight over patient rights legislation. The House
is expected to debate a measure this fall.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate approved a managed-care measure earlier this year,
but it has been attacked by most Democrats and even some House
Republicans who believe it did not go far enough in giving patients
the ability to challenge their HMO decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Before they left for summer break, a bipartisan group of House
members led by Rep. Charles Norwood, a Republican dentist from
Georgia, and Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., unveiled legislation that
covers far more people than the Senate bill, makes it easier to
appeal HMO decisions and gives consumers the right to sue their
medical plans.
</P>
<P>
   This week the powerful American Medical Association threw its
endorsement behind the Norwood-Dingell bill and announced a
newspaper advertising campaign to promote the measure.
</P>
<P>
   The advertisement, entitled ``What are HMOs so Afraid of?''
accuses the health insurance industry of spending $100 million to
defeat measures that would give patients more rights to appeal
health plan decisions and give doctors more authority to make
medical decisions.
</P>
<P>
   The AMA officials clearly hope their $140,000 campaign will
place pressure on GOP House leaders to get behind the
Dingell-Norwood effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope the Republican leadership wakes up and listens to their
constituents,'' said AMA president Dr. Thomas Reardon.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, the top House Republicans have been tiptoeing around
the measure, particularly a provision that would amend a federal
law to allow consumers enrolled in employer-sponsored health plans
to sue their providers for punitive and compensatory damages.
</P>
<P>
   They claim that such suits would increase costs for insurance
companies and leave employers who offer health plans liable to
lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   A Congressional Budget Office analysis of a Senate Democratic
managed-care plan that included the right to sue, concluded that
mandates of the bill would cause health care premiums to rise 4.8
percent.
</P>
<P>
   But Reardon said patients wouldn't mind paying a few more
dollars to ensure that they were getting better medical care.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Medical Association also argues the liability costs
are exaggerated. They point to their own analysis showing that HMO
premium rates in Texas have gone up less than the national average
even though the state has granted consumers the right to sue their
health plans. So far three lawsuits have been filed against
managed-care plans in Texas since the law was passed in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, citing the fear of increased costs and litigation,
a well-financed coalition of HMOs, insurance and business groups
opposing the managed-care legislation have been working to defeat
the measure.
</P>
<P>
   This week the American Association of Health Plans, which
represents HMOs, launched a new television campaign that claims the
managed-care plans will enrich trial lawyers at the expense of
working Americans, who could lose their health care if costs
skyrocket.
</P>
<P>
   The association plans to spend $5 million during the current
congressional session to defeat the Dingell-Norwood managed-care
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Merritt, vice president and chief of strategic planning and
public affairs for AAHP, called the managed-care legislation ``a
political rip-off.''
</P>
<P>
   Merritt said he doesn't believe voters are so upset with their
health plans that they are demanding that Congress make changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the real world this is a second-tier issue. Only in
Washington is it a first-tier issue,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A Harris poll released this week found that health care ranked
fourth among voters' concerns, behind education, taxes and crime
but ahead of Social Security, gun control and the economy.
</P>
<P>
   But one influential segment of the population _ medical
professionals _ is extremely unhappy with managed care, according
to recent survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation and Harvard
University of Public Health.
</P>
<P>
   In the survey of 1,053 physicians and 768 nurses, most said
their patients have experienced some type of denial of coverage for
health services in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all of those surveyed said managed care had increased
their administrative paperwork and decreased time spent with
patients. One of the few positives of managed care cited was the
increased use of preventive services by patients.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Leavitt, an official with the Kaiser Family Foundation,
said that considering the frustration with managed care it is not
surprising that doctors would get behind the toughest managed-care
bill.
</P>
<P>
   He predicted that the AMA support would boost its chances of
passage.
</P>
<P>
   ``AMA brings a great deal of political clout and money and
credibility. Doctors are still very trusted professionals,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   And holding only a slim majority in the House, GOP leaders may
have difficulty blocking efforts to pass a managed-care bill that
is significantly stronger than that passed by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Already a number of Republican lawmakers, including several who
are doctors, have attacked the Senate bill as not doing enough to
protect doctors and patients.
</P>
<P>
   They have been particularly critical of an external appeals
provision in a Senate plan that lets the health plan, not
physicians, decide whether a procedure is medically necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, they want any legislation to apply to the 161
million Americans covered by all health plans. The Senate measure
only applied to 48 million people in health plans that are
regulated by federal, but not state, laws.
</P>
<P>
   The measure also includes less controversial items, such as
guaranteeing that patients are taken to the nearest emergency room
and ensuring consumers the right to see specialists.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Rep. Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., has said he expects
his chamber will take up the managed-care measure in September.
</P>
<P>
   His office has been working with GOP Rep. Tom Coburn, an
Oklahoma physician, and Rep. John Shadegg, R-Ariz., who have
drafted a version that grants consumers only limited right to sue
HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   But Hastert spokesman Pete Jeffries said the speaker has not yet
endorsed their bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, it is a work in progress,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Texas doctors will be watching what the House does because the
ability of the state to carry its own managed-care law may depend
on whether Congress amends federal laws.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge in Houston last year threw out the mandatory
appeals procedure included in the state law, saying that federal
law supersedes the state regulations. However, the judge affirmed
the ability of consumers to sue their HMOs. Both decisions have
been appealed.

   Evacuations ordered along Carolina border as Dennis churns in
Atlantic
</P>
<P>
   By Chris Burritt
</P>
<P>
   WRIGHTSVILLE BEACH, N.C. _ Tens of thousands of people fled
North Carolina's barrier islands Sunday under mandatory evacuation
as Hurricane Dennis skirted Georgia and South Carolina and churned
toward Cape Fear.
</P>
<P>
   In what's become a summertime tradition along the North Carolina
coast, officials declared a hurricane warning from Little River,
S.C., at the North Carolina line to Oregon Inlet on the Outer
Banks.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasters said winds approaching hurricane force could reach
the Cape Fear area near North Carolina's southernmost tip by early
this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Packing top winds of 105 mph, the Category 2 storm was traveling
northeast at 13 mph. Late Sunday, it was 170 miles south of
Wilmington.
</P>
<P>
   It's possible, forecasters said, that Dennis' most punishing
winds could skirt the coast, sparing the Cape Fear region hammered
by Hurricane Bonnie a year ago and hurricanes Fran and Bertha in
1996. Still, as it turns toward the northeast and possibly gains
strength, the large storm wouldn't necessarily need to strike land
to cause extensive damage from winds and flooding.
</P>
<P>
   If Dennis' eye ''goes through one of those cycles where it
contracts, it certainly could intensify, and that would bring it
closer to the coast and even over the coast,'' said Jerry Jarrell,
director of the National Hurricane Center in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, emergency officials were glad to see Dennis stay
clear of the state's the coast, though they were hoping to see some
rain showers to ease drought-stricken areas in the south part of
the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we get some rain across Georgia, it would be a blessing,''
said Gary McConnell, director of the Georgia Emergency Management
Association. ``If we can get some rain without 100 mph wind, it
would be more of a blessing.''
</P>
<P>
   Between 10-15 inches of rain was expected in coastal areas, and
some flooding was likely in low-lying areas such as Savannah,
McConnell said.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Gov. Roy Barnes told emergency officials on Sunday that
a mobile communications vehicle was being sent to Statesboro, Ga.,
as a precautionary measure. The vehicle can handle emergency
communications like 911 if they are knocked out in hard-hit areas.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes also pledged to send disaster teams and equipment to
North Carolina and South Carolina if those states suffer damage
from the storm.
</P>
<P>
   On Tybee Island east of Savannah, hundreds of locals turned out
at high tide before noon to wave-watch from the new pier and
pavilion. Confident the Georgia coast was safe from Dennis, people
crowded the rails, many with cameras and video equipment, to watch
and film dozens of surfers and a few sea kayakers battle big waves
pushed to their peak by storm swells and the recent full moon.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a party atmosphere,'' said Mike Duck, one of the
managers of Rip Tide, the pavilion's snack shop. ''I love it. It
just amazes me that people are here just to look at waves.'' As it
spun out in the Atlantic in recent days, the storm kicked up seas
from Florida to the Carolinas. Sunday, Dennis brushed the South
Carolina coast with squalls, flooding streets and creating rip
currents that kept many people out of the surf.
</P>
<P>
   Few homes on Folly Island, near Charleston, were boarded up. All
are new since Hurricane Hugo blasted the barrier island 10 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Along North Carolina's southeastern coast, which juts like a jaw
into the ocean at Bald Head Island, emergency management officials
warned that Dennis could follow a similar devastating course as
Bonnie, Fran and Bertha. Those storms plowed up the Cape Fear River
to the port city of Wilmington before unleashing their most brutal
northeastern winds and rains up the coast toward Morehead City and
the Outer Banks.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before noon Sunday, officials of three Wilmington-area
towns, Wrightsville Beach, Carolina Beach and Kure Beach, declared
a state of emergency.
</P>
<P>
   Up and down the coast, schools are closed today, and the
American Red Cross is opening emergency shelters.
</P>
<P>
   In South Carolina, Gov. Jim Hodges said after meeting with
emergency preparedness officials that he did not think an
evacuation order was necessary. However, people living in beach
homes and in low-lying areas should be cautious because of the
possibility of flooding and wind damage, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials planned to open 13 shelters around Charleston for
people who wanted to leave low-lying areas.
</P>
<P>
   The emergency steps prompted many residents of the
Wilmington-area beaches to heed the evacuation order, despite
Sunday's muggy but relatively calm weather. During the day, people
walked along Wrightsville Beach and surfers rode the pounding waves
near what remains of Johnnie Mercers Fishing Pier, destroyed by
previous storms, but being rebuilt.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm leaving because they're telling me to leave,'' said Sue
Bridge, 73, a Wrightsville Beach resident for 46 years. ''People
are a lot more careful now.''
</P>
<P>
   The American Red Cross opened emergency shelters in two
Wilmington-area schools. But officials urged residents to seek
refuge inland with relatives or families because shelters can be
uncomfortable, especially if electricity outages knock out air
conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   By 5 p.m. Sunday, about 10 people had checked into one of two
Wilmington shelters. Nobody had come to the one in Dorothy B.
Johnson Elementary School.
</P>
<P>
   ''People are going to wait until the last minute,'' said Leslie
Buis, one of more than a dozen volunteers at Johnson Elementary.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday afternoon, traffic backed up temporarily at a police
checkpoint at the Intracoastal Waterway bridge from Wilmington to
Wrightsville Beach. Police said the evacuation order caught some
property owners off guard, and they were rushing back to make final
preparations.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the evacuation of people away from Wrightsville Beach
seemed to go smoothly. Some had already left following storm
warnings last week, and some beach-goers canceled weekend travel
plans.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Hegele at North Carolina's emergency operations center in
Raleigh said hotels and motels on the barrier islands were at 40
percent occupancy earlier in the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the reaction is going to be a lot calmer than it has
been in the past because people have had time to prepare,'' Kure
Beach Mayor Mary Medlin said.
</P>
<P>
   In a last-minute rush to beat Sunday's 8 p.m. evacuation order,
Wrightsville Beach homeowners and business owners nailed up plywood
over windows and doors, secured storm shutters and moved furniture
and other belongings to higher ground. Dozens hauled boats out of
the water and pulled them inland.
</P>
<P>
   ''One hundred mile an hour winds - that is powerful,'' said Paul
Horning, 35, as he secured plywood over the windows of Brown Dog
Grill, his restaurant between Wilmington and Wrightsville Beach.
</P>
<P>
   As it spun out in the Atlantic, the storm kicked up seas from
Florida to the Carolinas. Sunday, Dennis brushed the South Carolina
coast with squalls, flooding streets and creating rip currents that
kept many people out of the surf.
</P>
<P>
   Few homes on Folly Island, near Charleston, were boarded up. All
are new since Hurricane Hugo blasted the barrier island 10 years
ago.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ He faced down the rampaging mobs in the streets of
Beijing last spring. But it took a lesser adversary to incapacitate
James Sasser, the former Democratic senator from Tennessee who has
just returned home after three and a half tumultuous years as the
American ambassador to China.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had survived thousands of Chinese screaming for my head,''
Sasser explained. ``And then about two days after I get home to
Washington, I'm walking down the steps to my house and I step on
the cat that my daughter had brought home from China. And I tumbled
head over heels down a flight full of steps.''
</P>
<P>
   Sasser broke his left arm in the fall. It has been only a few
days since the cast came off. As he takes a seat at a small corner
table in a Washington coffee shop, he has to lift his still weak
left arm into place with his right hand. ``It's getting better,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The healing is also under way, he hopes, in the relationship
between the United States and China, scarred by the mistaken
American bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, Yugoslavia,
accusations of Chinese espionage and tensions over Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Sasser, a courtly 62-year-old politician-turned-diplomat,
insists that the violent anti-American demonstrations that trapped
him in the embassy in Beijing for four days last May were an
aberration. The demonstrations were a result of the missile strike
in Belgrade, which killed three Chinese journalists.
</P>
<P>
   Sasser knows that the most striking visual image of his tenure
in China may be the widely reprinted photograph of him staring
somberly through the jagged remains of a window in the battered
U.S. Embassy compound. ``I think that is unfortunate,'' he said.
``We can't quite forget what happened in May,'' he said of the
embassy siege in Beijing, ``but it ought to be put in context.''
</P>
<P>
   In the months since the demonstrations, Sasser said, he has
become convinced that senior leaders of the Chinese government did
not encourage the violence and that they were unaware that police
had lost control of the mob outside the embassy.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did not know the extent of it,'' he said. ``What they
were seeing on television _ Chinese television _ were peaceful
student demonstrations. They weren't seeing the rocks being thrown,
the Molotov cocktails.''
</P>
<P>
   When a junior Foreign Ministry official finally drove to the
embassy, ``he got out of his car, and he saw what had happened and
his jaw just sort of fell,'' Sasser said. ``The Foreign Ministry
just didn't have any idea, I don't think, of what was going on.''
</P>
<P>
   The situation became so dangerous that Sasser ordered that all
sensitive papers in the embassy be destroyed, including his private
journals, which would have been the raw material for the book he is
now thinking of writing.
</P>
<P>
   About a quarter of a mile from the embassy, his wife, Mary, and
their 29-year-old son, Gray, were trapped in the ambassador's
residence, facing their own rock-throwing demonstrators. It took a
frantic call by Sasser to his Chinese counterpart in Washington to
have Beijing police protect his family.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Sasser, he said, was jarred. The Chinese have a saying, he
said, ``that if you do something they disapprove of, that you've
hurt the feelings of 1.3 billion Chinese. Well, Mary says that 1.3
billion Chinese hurt her feelings.''
</P>
<P>
   Sasser said he never received a formal apology for the attacks.
But at a rare private dinner in the home of President Jiang Zemin
in the week before he left China, Sasser said, ``He said to me that
`things happened that we did not intend to happen and should not
have happened.''' It was, Sasser said, ``the closest anyone ever
came'' to an apology.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the recent strains, Sasser said he was convinced that
the Chinese leaders and most of the Chinese people were eager for a
good relationship with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came back from China with a very optimistic view about our
long-term relationship, and I say that because there were a lot of
pro-American feelings there within the leadership,'' said Sasser,
who is considering joining an international law firm that could use
his expertise on China.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as the Chinese were concerned, the Americans were the
people they liked the best,'' he said. The bombing ``may have a
chilling effect on that,'' he added, but it won't last.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The road to Beijing began for Sasser in the back roads of
Memphis, Tenn., where he was the first child born to a federal
agricultural official and his homemaker wife. Two daughters
followed. After Vanderbilt University, the younger Sasser settled
on a career in law and then in Democratic politics. He was elected
to the Senate in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Sasser had been chairman of the Senate Budget Committee and
seemed poised to become his party's Senate leader, but he was
forced into political retirement when defeated in the Republican
avalanche of 1994. He does not hide the pain of the defeat. ``My
feelings were hurt,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president called me as I was leaving the Senate and asked
me if I wanted another job in government and I said absolutely
not,'' he said. ``I was tired of being in government, tired of
trying to live on a government salary. And he said, `Well, how
about an ambassadorship?' And I said, I'm not interested _ except
maybe China.''' The Beijing offer came about 10 days later.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as I got to China, it felt as if my batteries had been
recharged,'' Sasser said. Despite persistent human rights abuses,
he said, China is a much freer, more prosperous nation than many
Americans imagine.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chinese are now able to make their own decisions about
what kind of job they want, where they want to work, where they
want to live,'' he said. ``They can travel abroad, they can go into
business. None of these things were possible in the China of the
1950s or 1960s or even the early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the Chinese do criticize their government _ in private,''
he said. ``What you can't do is stand out on a street corner and do
it.''

E-COMMERCE VENTURE HAS $130 MILLION
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)   (jw) 
 By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A new ``incubator'' for Internet companies that
was recently set up by the former head of Walt Disney Co.'s Web
operations has already assembled a war chest of $130 million from
investors that include Disney and George Soros.
</P>
<P>
   The incubator, which is known as eCompanies, was started in June
by Jake Winebaum, who quit as head of Disney's Internet businesses,
and Sky Dayton, the founder and chairman of Earthlink Network Inc.,
one of the nation's largest Internet service providers. The idea is
to provide office space, expertise and support services needed to
quickly nurture fledgling Web-oriented companies.
</P>
<P>
   The new $130 million venture capital fund, which is to be
announced on Monday, will invest in some of the companies hatched
by the incubator, as well as in other Internet-related companies.
The speed at which the money was raised _ about 60 days _ attests
to the reputation of Winebaum and Dayton and to investors' desire
to put money into Internet-related firms.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, Disney and Earthlink invested in the fund, as did
the Sprint Corp., the long distance company that owns a stake in
Earthlink. Other investors include KKR, the buyout firm; Soros Fund
Management; SunAmerica, the financial services company; Times
Mirror Co., which publishes The Los Angeles Times; Accel Partners,
a Silicon Valley venture capital firm; and two investment banks, CS
First Boston and Goldman Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   All the investors made equal investments, Winebaum said, and
will be in a position to provide the incubated companies with
additional financing, technology, distribution or investment
banking services. The venture fund will be run by Steven Ledger,
the earliest venture backer of Earthlink, and Timothy Spicer, a
former chief financial officer of Hambrecht &AMP; Quist, the investment
bank.
</P>
<P>
   Based in Santa Monica, Calif., eCompanies already has 22
employees to provide support for entrepreneurs and a few companies
in development, but none that it is willing to talk about yet,
Winebaum said.
</P>
<P>
   With the Internet business being so fast-paced, Dayton said,
there is a need for an ``assembly-line'' process to launch new
companies. Winebaum agreed: ``Basically, any idea you have, you
have to assume it's not original, that there are six other guys
working on it,'' he said. ``How do you get the idea to market
quickest, with the best management team?''

WHY DISNEY IS ATTACHED TO ITS HOMETOWN MAGAZINE 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By CHRISTIAN BERTHELSEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When the Walt Disney Co. announced the sale of its
Fairchild Publications unit to Advance Publications Inc. for a
reported $650 million last week, the magazine industry was left to
wonder why Los Angeles magazine was not part of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Why, some asked, would Disney want to keep one magazine while
selling off the rest in the face of shareholder pressure to refocus
on the company's central enterprise?
</P>
<P>
   Disney executives say the reason is simply that Los Angeles,
which has about 225,000 readers, is the company's hometown glossy
and that it is more closely aligned with its core businesses than
the rest of the dozen or so titles sold to Advance.
</P>
<P>
   They say there is no plan for a synergistic relationship between
the magazine and the company's entertainment units like that
between Talk magazine and Miramax, in which articles published in
the magazine may be developed into movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``L.A. magazine is a successful city magazine that is about
things to do, things to see,'' John Dryer, a Disney spokesman,
said. ``It's about entertainment. I'd like to tell you there's some
grander scheme, but no.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike New York, Los Angeles has been anathema to magazine
publishers. The 1990s have seen a shakeout from L.A. Style to
Angeles to Buzz, the city's other leading glossy. Buzz was closed
last year, and Disney bought its subscriber list and some of its
trademarks and has absorbed some of its features in its own
magazines.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few years, Los Angeles magazine has wavered between
aggressively covering the city and dutifully recording its glamour.
Some news articles last week suggested that Disney's desire to keep
the magazine was partly based on the company's wanting to keep a
lid on an independent media, or at least to keep out a new owner
that might be more inclined to run critical articles about Disney.
</P>
<P>
   Disney denies this was the reason to keep the magazine. In early
1997, Los Angeles published a story on executive compensation that
listed Michael D. Eisner, the Disney chairman, as one of the most
overpaid executives in Los Angeles; the magazine's editor in chief,
Michael Caruso, was dismissed shortly after.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick McCarthy, Fairchild's editorial director, would not say
whether the dismissal was related to the compensation article. He
denied that Disney had kept Los Angeles to ward off criticism and
said the company greatly valued the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Bob Roe, a former executive editor of the magazine and
now a senior editor at Sports Illustrated, said the atmosphere at
Los Angeles did not inspire hard-hitting journalism, especially
about Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   He said Spencer Beck, the editor of the magazine, ``made it
clear that we weren't going to do anything that had the tiniest
chance of offending anybody at Disney.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In an editorial meeting,'' Roe said, ``Spencer said plainly,
`We don't want to offend anyone in Hollywood.''' Beck denies making
such a comment.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, the magazine has focused on celebrity, fashion
and design coverage and offered dining and night life guides and
service articles, like the finding the best spas in town. But
writers in Los Angeles sense that the magazine is again trying to
augment the soft material with some hard-hitting work.
</P>
<P>
   The September issue, which has as its cover story ``Charlize
Theron, Hollywood's `It' Girl,'' has an article on a state
narcotics agent accused of stealing 300 kilograms of cocaine from
an evidence vault and another on potentially rough political waters
for the Los Angeles police chief, Bernard Parks. There is also a
piece that favorably contrasts the Disney concert hall being built
in downtown Los Angeles with its rundown surroundings and a report
on the involvement of big studios in the independent film industry,
which notes that Miramax, since being acquired by Disney, has been
accused of ``buying'' Oscars.
</P>
<P>
   Beck said there was no pressure to publish positive articles
about Disney or scuttle negative ones, pointing to the mention of
Miramax. He said revenue rose 27 percent this year and that growing
advertiser interest was reflected in two consecutive 220-page
issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``My understanding is, the reason it wasn't put on the table is
because Disney loves it the way it is,'' Beck said.  &QL;

AS BRAZIL'S CHIEF WAVERS, HE'S DELUGED WITH LABOR PROTESTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By LARRY ROHTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRASILIA, Brazil _ Strikes and protests are proliferating, and
support for the government is slipping, both in the polls and in
Congress. The statistics may say that the Brazilian economy is
already pulling out of recession, but the political pressures on
President Fernando Henrique Cardoso continue to mount.
</P>
<P>
   After a truck drivers' strike last month paralyzed major
highways for several days, one group after another has descended on
the normally sedate Brazilian capital to demand relief. Ranchers
and farmers were still camped out around the Esplanade of
Ministries, demanding a $10 billion bailout on their debts and
burning their tractors even as landless peasants and leftist
parties, their traditional antagonists, were marching on Brasilia.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters of every stripe appear to have been emboldened by the
way the government handled the dispute with truckers. After saying
he would not cede to their demands and threatening to call out the
armed forces to unblock roads, Cardoso approved an accord that not
only rolled back a planned 15 percent increase in federal highway
tolls but actually lowered some rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gave in,'' said Alexandre Barros, publisher of a widely
read political newsletter here. ``In fact, the government has made
a lot of concessions when it shouldn't have'' and has responded to
the ranchers' demands with a counterproposal that would forgive up
to 30 percent of what they owe to banks.
</P>
<P>
   The surge in protests and the government's uncertain response to
them have contributed to the renewed weakness of the Brazilian
currency, the real, which suffered a 40 percent devaluation in
January but had recovered and was trading recently at 1.75 to the
dollar. Earlier this month, though, the real's value fell briefly
to 2.00, forcing the Central Bank to intervene to push the rate
back up to 1.90.
</P>
<P>
   Cardoso's popularity has suffered a similar decline. He won
election to a second four-year term last October with a comfortable
majority, but the most recent public opinion polls give him an
approval rating of only 12 percent, with 59 percent of those
surveyed saying he was doing a ``bad or awful'' job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never in a civilian regime has a Brazilian president attained
levels of popularity so abysmal at the beginning or in the middle
of a term,'' the news magazine Veja commented this week. To no
one's surprise, most of the complaints about Cardoso's performance
focus on the economy, which had been the strong point of his
government in its first term.
</P>
<P>
   Market analysts believe that Brazil will have little difficulty
this year in complying with the terms of the $41.5 billion economic
rescue package signed last November with the International Monetary
Fund. But questions are now arising about the government's ability
to meet next year's demanding targets.
</P>
<P>
   Since returning from its monthlong July winter recess, Congress
has shown little enthusiasm for following through on the measures
that Cardoso has said he needs to complete the ``structural
reforms'' he promised the IMF and other international lending
organizations. These include an overhaul of the tax and social
security systems as well as a ``fiscal responsibility'' law that
would limit spending by states and municipalities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Members of Congress spent 30 days at home and really got an
earful,'' said David Fleischer, a professor of political science at
the National University of Brasilia. ``Their constituents are tired
of austerity and recession and high unemployment and interest
rates, and since the president's popularity is not coming up
quickly, they are distancing themselves from him.''
</P>
<P>
   That move has been led by Antonio Carlos Magalhaes, the canny
71-year-old president of the Senate, who is also an aspirant to
succeed Cardoso in 2002. Magalhaes was the president's most
important political ally during his first term in office, but
served notice as soon as Congress reconvened this month that his
support for additional austerity legislation could no longer be
taken for granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economy is tight and requires some bitter measures, but we
think that some of these bitter measures can be less bitter,''
Magalhaes said early this month. ``We are aware that many things
have proven successful and that others, including in social policy,
have not.''
</P>
<P>
   To the dismay of Cardoso's economic advisers, Magalhaes made a
promise that gasoline prices, which have been raised several times
since the real was devalued, will increase no further this year. He
has also proposed a new federal tax that would generate billions of
dollars to be directed to a ``Fund to Erradicate Poverty.''
</P>
<P>
   That suggestion was popular among Magalhaes' fellow legislators,
who would love to have more money to spend in advance of next
year's municipal elections and the 2002 presidential and
congressional vote. But it also led to an embarassing public
exchange of insults with Pedro Malan, the tight-fisted minister of
finance who negotiated the IMF agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The most likely outcome to the legislative standoff, analysts
predicted, is that Cardoso will be able to cobble together some
sort of reform package, but one that falls short of what he really
wants. ``When Congress senses the president is indecisive, it
charges a higher price for its support,'' in the form of
concessions, Barros said.
</P>
<P>
   The government's vulnerability also seems to have made it
unusually sensitive to normal manifestations of opposition. Malan,
for instance, compared Sunday's ``March of the 100,000'' protest,
organized by a coalition of opposition parties and labor unions, to
``an assault on the Winter Palace to overthrow a democratically
elected government.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Cardoso has seemed unable to decide just how
serious a threat the protests pose. He first accused the opposition
of seeking a coup d'etat, but then, after editorials and speeches
criticized his remarks, angered his critics further by dismissing
their demonstration as a protest not of the landless, but ``the
march of the directionless.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the one who has no direction,'' retorted Cesar Paiva, a
postal worker from the northern state of Maranhao who rode a bus
with colleagues for 36 hours to attend the march. ``People are
losing their jobs left and right, the health system is falling
apart, the country is falling into chaos, and he is not doing
anything to stop it.''

FRANCE'S GREENS PUSH JOSPIN ON NUCLEAR POWER POLICY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: This story, held on Aug. 23, is now released.) 
(DW/lb) 
 By MARLISE SIMONS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ France's Green Party, emboldened by a good showing in
the recent elections for the European Parliament, has threatened to
pull out of the government coalition if Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin approves a new generation of nuclear power stations to
replace old ones.
</P>
<P>
   The Greens, who joined Jospin's government in 1997, have always
insisted that the nuclear energy issue is at the center of their
policy concerns. But even though the Green leader, Dominique
Voynet, serves as environment minister, the party says it is being
ignored on vital questions inside the government coalition.
</P>
<P>
   The issue at hand is the coming debate on energy policy. Its
central question is whether France will reduce its dependence on
nuclear energy and turn to other sources. France's 57 nuclear
reactors provide 78 percent of the country's energy, one of the
highest rates in the world.
</P>
<P>
   But as those plants become obsolete in the coming years, France
will face the choice of phasing them out or replacing them with a
new type, the so-called European Pressurized Reactors. These
reactors, developed in a Franco-German project, are expected to be
ready to go into operation around 2010.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-nuclear campaign planned in France may cause some
turbulence, but even if the Greens walk out this is not likely to
threaten the fate of the government coalition, which includes the
Communists and would still retain its majority in Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   As Greens have elsewhere in Europe, those in France have
strongly campaigned against nuclear energy, and they say a straight
replacement plan is not acceptable. They insist they cannot
compromise on this point, which they see as a cornerstone of their
agreement with the Socialists before joining the coalition
government.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very fundamental question for us,'' said Denis Baupin,
the Green Party spokesman. ``Do we replace the decommissioned
plants with new ones or do we start to opt out of nuclear energy,
like Belgium and Germany? If the decision is for new plants, we
will pull out of the government.''
</P>
<P>
   The Greens have also renewed their demand that a national
referendum be held on the country's energy strategy and the future
of nuclear power. To make sure they will be heard, the Greens say
they are planning a series of protests against nuclear power _
matching the campaign of Germany's Greens, who have been pressuring
the government of Gerhard Schroeder to phase out nuclear energy use
more quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The French environmentalists see the experience of their German
counterparts as a warning sign. German Greens have become angry and
frustrated as Schroeder's promised effort to shut down nuclear
power stations has stalled after pressure from business leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say privately that an informal consensus is forming
that France will reduce, though not abolish, its nuclear power
stations. They say that if the matter heats up, the government can
afford to postpone any key decisions until after the presidential
elections of 2002 _ for which the Socialists want to keep the
Greens as allies.
</P>
<P>
   But the tension over the issue underscores the rising influence
of the Green movement here. After long seeming indifferent to
environmental questions, France is now among the European countries
where Greens have gained support and moved from the political
fringes closer to the center of power.
</P>
<P>
   As their neighbors fared better, France's Greens had remained
marginal in political life because of in-fighting and splits over
ideology. Their position improved after Mrs. Voynet took charge in
1993. Among other changes, she allied the Greens with the
Socialists.
</P>
<P>
   But unexpected success came in the European parliamentary
elections in June, when the vote for the Greens surged to close to
10 percent from less than 3 percent in the last European election,
in 1994. In the Paris area alone, the Greens scored almost 20
percent. The increases have prompted them to fight for greater
influence in future local elections.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, to their annoyance, their new popularity has
not translated automatically into more political power. Mrs. Voynet
and other party members have openly said that their 10 percent vote
should have earned them more seats in the Cabinet than the one they
now have.
</P>
<P>
   Party leaders also sound clearly frustrated that they have not
gained greater say over policy decisions.

THE TIMES AND GRANADA IN DOCUMENTARY DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Great Britain)  (mk) 
 By DOREEN CARVAJAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Granada Media, the British television production company, and
The New York Times have announced an agreement to create television
documentaries exploring topics in science, travel and current
affairs.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, television producers will be posted in the
newsroom to generate ideas for documentaries that could be expanded
into a series of programs, which could then be sold in the United
States and in international markets, said Richard Flaste, general
manager of television enterprises for The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   Two Granada producers will start working in the newsroom in
September, said Flaste, who noted that they will then meet with
reporters and editors to develop potential documentaries. ``We will
start relatively small,'' Flaste said. ``We don't know exactly how
many we will produce. We don't want to overuse our resources or do
too much.''
</P>
<P>
   The Times has already prepared several documentaries through its
own wholly owned television unit and is working with a Chicago
production company to produce a two-hour special program on the
millennium that will be shown in December. The company's agreement
with Granada is part of a broader effort to develop an ``audience
strategy'' that offers information from The New York Times in a
variety of different forms from Web sites to books, Flaste said.
</P>
<P>
   Granada's arrangement with The Times will help it expand its
presence in the United States. Granada's production companies in
London currently provide most of the programming to the British
commercial network ITV. But it also has a production company in the
United States and a newly formed production company in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Simon Shaps, director of programs for Granada Television, said
in a news release that the deal with the Times would give his
company journalistic resources that would provide ``new ideas and
contacts.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Granada has produced such documentaries as ``42
Up,'' the latest in a series of films following a group of English
schoolchildren through their lives. It has also created science
programs and popular television programs, like ``Prime Suspect'' on
``Masterpiece Theater,'' featuring the actress Helen Mirren.

PANCHO GONZALES' REMARKABLE RALLY AT THE U.S. OPEN

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As the year 2000 approaches, here's a look at some
of the interesting anniversaries that will occur this week in Los
Angeles sports history (followed by the ranking of the event from
the book ``Unforgettable: The 100 Greatest Moments in Los Angeles
Sports History'' in parentheses, where applicable):
</P>
<P>
   Aug. 31, 1959: The Dodgers' Sandy Koufax strikes out 18 against
the San Francisco Giants _ fanning 15 of the last 17 batters _ in a
5-2 win before 82,074 at the Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   Sept. 2, 1969: The Dodgers' Willie Davis hits a game-winning
double in the bottom of the ninth to beat the New York Mets to
extend his club-record hitting streak to 31 games.
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    Cincy again falters in Canada; awaits a visit from the Atlanta
Braves
 &HT;    By Hal McCoy
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ Manager Jack McKeon is as worried about his team's
decade-long problems with the Atlanta Braves as he is about where
his next cigar will come. What furrows his brows right now is the
health and well-being of his own team, which at the moment is on
the critical list.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the Scourge of Dixie, the Atlanta Braves, are in Cinergy
Field the next three nights and McKeon puts the match to another
Dominican and says, ``We can't worry about the Braves, we have to
do it on our own, we have to control our own destiny, take care of
our own business.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking care of their own business was not what the Cincinnati
Reds did north of the border over the weekend in carbon copy
back-to-back losses to the Montreal Expos.
</P>
<P>
   What Brett Tomko did Saturday, Pete Harnisch did Sunday _ failed
to protect an early big lead and the Reds lost, 8-6. Tomko tripped
over a four-run lead in the fifth inning Saturday and the Reds also
lost, 8-6.
</P>
<P>
   Harnisch pitched four no-hit innings Sunday, then the royal blue
roof of Parc Olympique fell on his head _ eight runs and eight hits
in the fifth and sixth, denying him his 100th career victory and
dropping his team 1 1/2 games behind Houston in the National League
Central.
</P>
<P>
   And Harnisch blamed only himself in an expletive-infested
postgame analysis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a (expletive) embarrassment, a (expletive) embarrassment,
simple as that,'' Harnisch said. ``The team gave me a five-run
(expletive) lead and scored six runs I should be able to win the
(expletive) game. It's just (expletive) embarrassing and I know no
other way to (expletive) say it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why? I don't know. I don't know what happened, I don't know
why it happened, I just know I'm more ticked off than I've been
this year,'' Harnisch added. ``Five minutes. It was just five
(expletive) minutes and everything goes from good to horrible and I
don't know why. There was no excuse for (Saturday) or today.
Embarrassing. I don't know a better word. It's all on me. The team
as a whole played well and you have to just throw it all on me.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, the offense did provide five runs and seven hits in the
first two innings, but only one run and three hits from the third
through the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the Reds' wheels spinning backwards, the Braves barge
into town and McKeon says, ``Sure, we have to pick it up against
the Braves. We know that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Reds lost all six games this season in Atlanta's Turner
Field, but they aren't any more comfortable at home against them _
3-8 the last two seasons. Overall, they've won only four of 26
games the last three years against Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   With Sunday's astonishing flop, the Reds went 2-2 north of the
border and come home with only its second losing road record (2-5)
after losing three straight in Atlanta. Their only other losing
road trip was in late April-early May and, of course, the Braves
were involved. The Reds won two of three in Philadelphia, then lost
three straight in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't had a streak like this since early in the year, but
we got through that,'' McKeon said. ``It happened so quick. Pete
had a no-hitter, then ... well, same as (Saturday), we got the
early big lead and quit, then couldn't hold on. Rarely do we give
up eight runs in back-to-back games and lose both. We're in a rough
little streak and we have to get out of it and we're the only ones
who can do it. We'll rebound and be in good shape. We've done it
before.''
</P>
<P>
   The Reds scored four in the first on five hits, including a
two-run single by Jeffrey Hammonds, subbing for injured center
fielder Mike Cameron. They added one in the second inning on Barry
Larkin's second double to right field to give Harnisch a 5-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   He held the Expos hitless (two walks) for four innings before
they exploded for five runs on five hits in the fifth to tie it,
5-5, the third time this year the Reds have blown leads of five
runs or more.
</P>
<P>
   Hammonds put the Reds back in front with his 11th home run in
the sixth, but after Harnisch retired the first two in the bottom
of the sixth, the next three Expos reached base, including Geoff
Blum, whose two-run triple pushed Montreal in front, 7-6, and
concluded Harnisch's day.
</P>
<P>
   After watching Harnisch give up five runs in the fifth, then a
double and a walk with two outs in the sixth, McKeon gambled by
permitting the well-cooked Harnisch to face the left-handed Blum
and paid a monstrous price. Harnisch gave up eight runs, most in
his 59 starts for the Reds and most since he gave up eight to
Houston on August 11, 1997 while pitching for Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   What did he say? Oh, yeah. Embarrassing.
</P>

THE OPEN MAY SEE A HAPPY HINGIS
</HEADLINE>
   (With TEN-USOPEN) 
(ms) 
 By ROBIN FINN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   No doubt the sublimely talented Martina Hingis never thought she
would have to live down that cliche about acting your age, not your
shoe size. But she has.
</P>
<P>
   After spoiling her French Open final by throwing a tantrum the
velocity of the terrible twos and wrecking her Wimbledon campaign
by turning invisible in the first round, Hingis has emerged from
the summer of her discontent just in time to eyeball the U.S. Open
like the final phase of a reclamation project.
</P>
<P>
   What needed to be reformed was the 18-year-old whiz kid herself.
Her shattered self-control at Roland Garros shocked even Steffi
Graf, who thought she had seen it all when it came to Grand Slam
meltdowns. And her misguided approach to Wimbledon, where she
pointedly expelled her mother/coach, Melanie Molitor, from her
support team, compounded the self-destruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing could go worse than that time,'' said Hingis, whose
typical Grand Slam experience before this year's debacles was to
show up and, more often than not, make off with a trophy. She had
begun the year by collecting her fifth Grand Slam singles crown at
the Australian Open before things went downhill. ``It was for sure
a big lesson for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Hingis went underground for a few weeks after her premature
Wimbledon exit. But first she traveled back to Switzerland, olive
branch in hand, to make peace with her mother, without whom, she
said, she felt like an amputee. ``We kind of complete each other,''
Hingis said.
</P>
<P>
   After taking a seaside tanning timeout, she got back on the
treadmill and did hard time in preparation for the hardcourts
season, which will be her proving ground. Naturally Hingis, who
regained the No. 1 ranking on Aug. 9 after ousting Venus Williams,
6-4, 6-0, in the TIG Classic final in Carlsbad, Calif., passed the
test.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody knew how I was going to come back,'' she said last week
from her new home at the Saddlebrook Resort in Tampa, Fla., ``and I
wanted to show everybody that I can still play pretty good tennis.
Sometimes you're not sure if your work will pay off, but after
three weeks back at the tournaments, I've won two titles and made a
semifinal, so I think I've proved I'm still here. I feel confident
and I believe in myself again.''
</P>
<P>
   Hingis went into the French Open, the only Grand Slam event she
has not won, determined to win, and when her plans went awry in the
final against Graf, her composure had more leaks than a sieve. In
retrospect, she said her trespass to Graf's side of the net to
argue a line call, her petulant underhand serves at match point and
her refusal to attend the award ceremony without being dragged back
on court by her flustered mother, were the aggregate product of her
distress over falling short of her goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's going to stick with me for a lifetime,'' Hingis said.
``I think I'll always remember what happened. But sometimes you
learn more from a loss than a win, and what I learned about myself
from that match was all about self-control, that I need more of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've started to play golf a little bit, because there you have
to have control over yourself or you won't hit anything right.''
</P>
<P>
   The Swiss teen-ager was less traumatized by Wimbledon, where her
one-round-and-out performance taught her another lesson.
``Sometimes you have to make your own experiment, and make your
mistakes, so that you kind of get slapped and wake up,'' she said
of the squabble with her mother. ``I don't see it as a major thing.
It just shouldn't have happened at Wimbledon.''
</P>
<P>
   Since her two lost Grand Slams, Hingis said, she has taken a
cram course in maturity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've grown up a lot,'' she said. ``I still have some ideas
that are different from my mother, but you have to learn to
compromise.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Hingis is beatable at the Open, where she won the title
in 1997 but was dethroned by Lindsay Davenport in last year's
final, is up for debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's four or five girls that can beat her, depending on
who's playing well,'' said the fourth-seeded Monica Seles, whose
four-year reign at the Canadian Open was ended by Hingis' 6-4, 6-4
victory in their Aug. 22 final.
</P>
<P>
   But Hingis narrows the field of potentially troublesome
opponents down to the two powerhouses she has not beaten lately:
17-year-old Serena Williams and Davenport, who are both on the
other side of the draw.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty confident with the draw,'' said Hingis, who takes a
1-0 record against Kveta Hrdlickova onto the Arthur Ashe Stadium on
Monday night. ``One thing is that I can really focus on taking care
of business in my singles, and I won't be tired from anything since
I won't be playing doubles. And the real power players are all on
the other side, except Venus.''
</P>
<P>
   Power, Hingis said, is the only tactic she cannot always debrief
and debunk, but she believes it will take perfectly administered
power to beat her at this Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what makes me the No. 1 player, that that's the only
way you can beat me, I guess,'' Hingis said. ``Otherwise it's
almost like I have to be sick or break a leg or something, because
I think my game is better than someone else's from the back if
somebody doesn't kill me right away.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Now here's an even-handed approach to the debate between
creationism and science. Newprayer.com is offering to use a
``directional radio transmitter'' to beam prayers to the part of
the universe ``where we know God resided.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the Newprayer.com Web site, God's last-known
approximate whereabouts have been determined as follows:
</P>
<P>
   ``What do we know about the location of God? We know that God
was at the birth of His universe. We know how the universe began _
with a `Big Bang.' We know where the oldest part of the universe is
located. We can transmit radio messages to this precise location.''
</P>
<P>
   And what is the going rate for this convergence of e-commerce
and evangelism? Five dollars will send one prayer on its way, with
bulk rates of $25 for six prepaid prayers and $75 for 20. Major
credit cards accepted.
</P>
<P>
   As precisely as Newprayer.com may have pinpointed God's last
known whereabouts, though, finding the company is a bigger
challenge. The site does not say where Newprayer.com is based,
provide any contact information or otherwise indicate who is behind
this venture.
</P>
<P>
   So doing business with Newprayer.com may require a leap of
faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really helpful for consumers to be able to check
something out, but sometimes it's impossible on the Web,'' said
Susan Grant, director of Internet Fraud Watch for the National
Consumers League.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Grant said her organization was deluged with complaints
about fraud on the Net, having received 7,700 last year and 6,000
through the first six months of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   As for Newprayer specifically, she declined to say whether her
organization had received any complaints about it. But she added,
``Consumers might be right to be skeptical about these claims.''

   XEROX AND ADOBE TO UNVEIL ANTI-PIRACY TECHNOLOGY
</P>
<P>
   As companies seek a way to prevent the rampant piracy that has
plagued the digital music industry from overtaking digital
publishing, the Xerox Corp. plans to introduce software that
protects books and documents distributed online from being
illegally copied. The technology, called Content Guard is to be
announced Monday at the Seybold 21st Century Publishing Conference
in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Xerox plans to announce a pact with Adobe Systems to integrate
the new technology with Adobe's existing PDF format for
distributing documents on line. Xerox also intends to announce
publishers that have agreed to adopt the technology, including
Thomson Learning, a publisher of educational materials; the
National Music Publishers Association, which distributes sheet
music online, and Haymarket Publications, a European business
publisher.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with offerings from other companies, including
Intertrust, that have produced their own types of digital rights
management software, the Xerox tools are based on an industry
standard: Java, an Internet programming language developed by Sun
Microsystems.
</P>
<P>
   The flexibility of Java would allow users to read Xerox
protected documents on various types of software operating systems
using any of the standard Web browser programs. Publishers,
corporations or individuals could specify who had access to the
document, set a time frame for protection and even designate the
type of authentication (like a password or a fingerprint) needed to
read the document. If a secure document was e-mailed to a person
not authorized to view it, that person would have to go to the
publisher's Web site to obtain permission before the document could
be viewed.
</P>
<P>
   Netty Douglass, director of rights management for Thomson
Learning, based in Stamford, Conn., said the Xerox technology would
be appealing not only for its security features but because it
would allow Thomson to track the use of its documents. That
information would be useful both for marketing purposes, she said,
and for tallying usage fees for images owned by other companies
included in their documents.

</P>
<P>
   MONKEYING AROUND WITH COMPANY NAMES
</P>
<P>
   The letters that form the name Boeing can be rearranged to spell
``big one.'' Time Warner can be converted to ``mean writer.'' And
the title of Rupert Murdoch's sexy London tabloid The News of the
World is an anagram for ``tender, hot flesh _ wow.''
</P>
<P>
   These are just a few of the possibilities in business anagrams,
a game being played by office workers throughout the
English-speaking world.
</P>
<P>
   To play, contact the Internet Anagram Server at
www.wordsmith.org/anagram, which provides immediate answers, or
another site called Anagram Genius Server at
www.anagramgenius.com/server.html, which gives a more considered
response and replies by e-mail after a few minutes or hours,
depending on traffic volume.
</P>
<P>
   At no charge, these sites will attempt to create anagrams from
any word or phrase, not just company names. But somehow there's a
special mischievous thrill to plugging in your employer's name and
learning, for example, that New York Times can be reconfigured as
``monkeys write.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Anagrams never lie,'' insists Anu Garg (his real name, not an
anagram). He and his wife, Stuti, have just founded a Web service,
called Namix, (www.namix.com), that uses anagrams and other
techniques to help companies come up with names and trademarks.
Namix which also links to the Internet Anagram Server, offers an
archive of its ``Business Anagram of the Day.''
</P>
<P>
   In his day job, Garg is a computer specialist in Columbus, Ohio,
with AT&AMP;T Laboratories _ whose letters also happen to spell ``a
sailboat retort.''

<P>
   STROUD, Okla. _ When the good news finally came to this tiny
town grown accustomed to bad news, a collective exhale of relief
swept Main Street. For a place left for dead, perhaps it was
fitting that the source of jubilation was the arrival of a factory
that would build grave markers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank goodness,'' said Stroud's beleaguered city manager, Earl
Burson, after two entrepreneurs announced plans to employ 300
people to produce bronze cemetery markers. ``You realize there is
hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Until the announcement earlier this month, Stroud had seemed a
likely candidate for a headstone of its own. Perched on the
Interstate halfway between Oklahoma City and Tulsa, Stroud,
population 3,100, had been a thriving community before a band of
tornadoes swept through the state more than three months ago,
killing 44 people, injuring hundreds more and destroying or
damaging more than 8,000 homes. The town was actually spared the
worst of the devastation: There were no deaths, no serious injuries
and damage to homes was fairly modest.
</P>
<P>
   But the tornadoes touched down with the precision of smart bombs
and served as a sudden, bitter reminder of the tenuous nature of
prosperity in most small towns, even in flush times. The outlet
mall, the source of nearly half the city's tax receipts, was
destroyed. The hospital, one of only two in the county, was badly
damaged. A food distribution center, the city's biggest employer,
was leveled. It was a devastating economic blow made nearly fatal
when the three out-of-town corporations that owned or managed the
buildings all announced that they would not rebuild.
</P>
<P>
   ``The percentages of that happening to you is like lightning
striking three times in the same place at the same time,'' said Joe
Sykora, 79, a retired merchant who volunteers at the chamber of
commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, Stroud had lost nearly 600 full-time and part-time
jobs. Losing the outlet mall meant that 60 percent of the city's
$1.3 million in annual sales taxes was gone. Without a hospital,
the city took over ambulance services and began rushing patients to
a smaller hospital farther out in the county. The city slashed its
budget and canceled orders for a fire truck and a police cruiser.
There wasn't even enough money to pay the $2,000 to put flowers in
the planters on Main Street. Merchants had to pick up the tab.
</P>
<P>
   ``To walk around and look, it looks like nothing has really
happened to the town,'' said Debbie Henley, a secretary at the
First Baptist Church. ``It's just now hitting people for them to
realize that economically we are in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Danny Beltz, 58, the municipal judge and town historian, said
Stroud's problems underscored the boom-and-bust cycles endured by
many small towns, which often depend on one or two large employers.
</P>
<P>
   More than a hundred years ago, Beltz said, Stroud was a famous
whisky town with 16 saloons attracting patrons from the nearby
Creek Indian reservation, which was dry. But early this century,
Stroud went dry as well, and Beltz said poverty followed.
</P>
<P>
   Cotton was then king until prices went bust in the 1920s.
Luckily, oil was soon discovered nearby. Until it closed in the
1980s, a local refinery had employed 500.
</P>
<P>
   ``This town just very nearly died after the refinery went out,''
Beltz said. ``We were sort of a one-industry town. The only thing
that helped us was when they built the outlet mall.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, the loss of the mall and the food distribution center has
brought criticism from some merchants who blame city officials for
failing to diversify the local economy. ``It's one of those deals
where they put all their eggs in one basket,'' said Judith
Walkingstick, who owns a real estate agency with her husband.
</P>
<P>
   But Burson said Stroud was in the process of diversifying. The
town had passed a one-cent sales tax to pay for water and sewer
infrastructure at a new industrial park. Now, with the loss of the
mall, Burson said the project had been postponed because there was
not enough money to pay for it. Instead, the city has applied for a
$2 million federal grant. State officials, prompted by Gov. Frank
Keating, are also working on incentive packages to lure a
replacement for the mall.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the announcement that a start-up company, Superior
Bronze Corp. of America, plans to build a factory on the site of
the destroyed food distribution center has lifted the spirits of
Stroud's residents.
</P>
<P>
   Burson cautions that the deal is far from finished; the
financing is not completed, nor is the sale of property. But
officials at Superior rushed out with their announcement earlier
this month because they were concerned that potential employees
were moving away in search of other work. The jobs will pay $10 an
hour, a solid wage by local standards, and Superior officials
predicted that 75 people would be put to work by November and 300
by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   People are still bracing for leaner times. City officials are
negotiating to bring in another health care company to rebuild and
operate the hospital. But Debbie Wilson, co-owner of Stroud True
Value Hardware, said people had greeted the news of the grave
marker factory ``like it's a miracle.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The spirit of the town is 100 percent better,'' Ms. Wilson
said. ``There were a lot of people in the dumps. Of course, all the
old people have said: `Don't worry about it. We'll be fine.'
</P>
<P>
   ``They said, `Stroud always bounces back.'''

A LAST LOOK AT TEAMS LOOKING TO NEXT SEASON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ September is for pennant races. But before
we started, here's a final August look at the those who won't be
involved.
</P>
<P>
   Mariners: They need to upgrade their pitching in the off-season
or Ken Griffey Jr. and Alex Rodriguez could be traded before July
31 next year.
</P>
<P>
   Angels: Disney is fed up with baseball and the in-house
bickering. Disney could sell the team or just fire general manager
Bill Bavasi.
</P>
<P>
   White Sox: They've done a credible job rebuilding, particularly
with some good young pitching coming from Triple A. But it's time
to finish the job by trading Frank Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Royals: There's some decent young talent here, but they
desperately need their ownership situation resolved. Even then it's
going to take a long time to rebuild.
</P>
<P>
   Tigers: Moving into Comerica Park will help. Look for them to
pursue a big bat and a front-line pitcher in the off-season, but
they need Justin Thompson to be a big winner. It's 50-50 whether
manager Larry Parrish will survive.
</P>
<P>
   Twins: They have some pretty good young talent, but it's time to
let Tom Kelly go manage a contender and turn this team over to a
more patient manager.
</P>
<P>
   Orioles: What a mess. Manager Ray Miller has to be gone, doesn't
he? Phil Garner is a possibility here. General manager Frank Wren
could get the job done if owner Peter Angelos would leave him
alone.
</P>
<P>
   Devil Rays: They've got a pretty good farm system, but there's
little at the major-league level to get excited about. There are
serious concerns about attendance, and the money put into
renovating Tropicana Field could have gone to waste.
</P>
<P>
   Padres: The best of their young talent _ Matt Clement, Ruben
Rivera _ just wasn't as good as they'd hoped. But they do have a
new stadium coming, which provides some hope.
</P>
<P>
   Rockies: Manager Jim Leyland is about to endure his sixth losing
season in seven years, and the new general manager _ Gary Hughes?
Dan O'Dowd? _ has much work to do. There are no easy answers to the
Coors Field pitching problem.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers: Another big mess. General manager Kevin Malone looks
overwhelmed. Manager Davey Johnson gives the impression he has lost
interest. The next step in the overhaul will likely start with Raul
Mondesi being traded.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals: They need pitching. Rich Ankiel needs to be as good
as advertised, and they need Matt Morris (elbow) healthy next year.
</P>
<P>
   Cubs: Manager Jim Riggleman is likely gone and Triple-A boss
Terry Kennedy is the likely successor. But they really need Kerry
Wood back.
</P>
<P>
   Pirates: They need their young pitching _ Jason Schmidt, Kris
Benson, Francisco Cordova _ to move to the next level. But they
hurt their rebuilding effort by mishandling outfielder Jose
Guillen.
</P>
<P>
   Brewers: This could be a good situation with the new ballpark.
But the new general manager and field manager will have much work
to do with a mangled pitching staff. Don Baylor could resurface
here as manager.
</P>
<P>
   Phillies: Losing Curt Schilling cost them dearly. General
manager Ed Wade and manager Terry Francona have done a good job
here, especially putting together a decent rotation. But they need
one more big bat in the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Expos: There is still no sign they can get a stadium deal done
and keep the franchise from moving to Northern Virginia. A great
city but a bad baseball situation.
</P>
<P>
   Marlins: Signing pitcher Josh Beckett, the second overall pick
in the draft, was a big step. General manager Dave Dombrowski has
done a nice job acquiring raw talent; now they need to mold it into
a competitive major-league team.

MOM'S DREAM COMES TRUE 
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Tim Crabtree was lucky if his family made it
to a major-league ballpark more than once a year.
</P>
<P>
   There was never much money growing up in Jackson, Mich., a town
of 38,000 people located 77 miles west of Detroit. His dreams took
hold in the family kitchen while a mother and her son listened to
Detroit Tigers games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can still see that old radio sitting above the kitchen
sink,'' Crabtree said. ``I'd be at the kitchen table doing my
homework, and my mom would be listening to Ernie Harwell on the
radio. She never missed a Tigers game. She'd keep score.''
</P>
<P>
   Mom grew up with Hank Greenberg and Rudy York. Crabtree rooted
for Larry Parrish, Chet Lemon and Kirk Gibson. The common bond was
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``She took it personally when they tried to fire Ernie,''
Crabtree said. ``She made a big stink about it. She'd cheer when
the Tigers did well, and she'd sit there and yell at the radio when
something bad happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Crabtree's mother _ now Mrs. Eunice Zakrzewski _ harbored her
own silent hopes in her heart during those hot summer nights.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of my dreams was always to have one of mom's babies to be
a major-league pitcher,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Dreams do come true, even if your son never pitched in high
school and was just eight days away from joining the Marines before
being ``discovered.'' He might still be shining his boots,
screaming ``Semper Fi'' and running the obstacle course at Camp
Pendleton if tiny Grass Lake High hadn't won the 1988 Class D
Michigan state baseball championship.
</P>
<P>
   But it did, and a proud mother was watching on satellite
television on June 2, 1995, when Crabtree walked out of the bullpen
at Yankee Stadium to make his major-league debut with the Toronto
Blue Jays.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Oh my God, that's my boy,''' she said. ``Tears
started coming down my cheeks. I almost had to pinch myself.''
</P>
<P>
   She still does when she sees the youngest of her five children
pitching for the Rangers. But tonight she won't be listening on the
radio or watching on television. She'll make the drive to Tiger
Stadium as the Rangers begin a four-game series with the Detroit
Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be at all four games,'' said Zakrzewski.
</P>
<P>
   ``A wonderful lady,'' said Joe Bechtel, Crabtree's coach at
Grass Lake High. ``She always gave him tremendous support and
encouragement and made sure he had every opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Crabtree, ``If she missed a game of mine in high school,
Little League or even at Michigan State, when we were at home, she
had to be deathly sick. She loved the game of baseball, and I got
that love from her. I owe her everything. Whatever I needed growing
up, she got it for me.''
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't always easy in Jackson, where the unemployment rate
is 9.9 percent because many of the old factories have closed.
Crabtree's father worked 15 years for Clark Equipment Industries
until his job moved to New Mexico. It was either move or quit. He
quit and took a job with Oldsmobile up in East Lansing, 40 miles
away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was 7 years old when I first started playing baseball,''
Crabtree said. ``I remember my mom took me down to the local fire
barn. There were two fire trucks and an ambulance and a little desk
where you signed up. I was the second kid drafted. Somebody must
have been scouting me.''
</P>
<P>
   His mother played catch with him, but was left-handed and didn't
have a glove.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to stop when he started throwing too hard,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   That was in Little League. Crabtree threw hard but was wild.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad said, `You're wilder than mountain scenery,' ''
Crabtree said. ``One day, when I was 12, I hit a kid in the ribs,
and he went down crying. The kid on deck started crying, too. He
wouldn't go up to bat until they took me out. I had to play
shortstop while he hit, then they put me back in.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't pitch in high school. He was an all-state catcher and
had already enlisted in the Marines when Michigan State coach Tom
Smith saw him throw out four baserunners in the state semifinal
game. After Grass Lake won the state title, Smith approached
Crabtree about a college scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   ``They held up the team bus while Tim's father and I went up to
the coaches office to talk to them,'' Zakrzewski said. ``We
couldn't believe it. A full scholarship to a Big Ten school.''
</P>
<P>
   He got his release from the Marines, but spent two years on the
bench at Michigan State because he couldn't hit. He did pitch
batting practice, and the coaches noticed that their own hitters
were having trouble. They started using him in relief.
</P>
<P>
   As a junior, he was Michigan State's No. 1 starter, pitching in
the Big Ten championship game. As a senior, he threw a one-hitter
to beat Iowa. The stands were filled with scouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were radar guns all over the place,'' Crabtree said. ``I
think that's the game that got me drafted.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cleveland Indians told him the night before the 1992 draft
they would take him in the second round. He was wearing their cap
for a newspaper photographer when the phone rang. The Toronto Blue
Jays were on the other end.
</P>
<P>
   That was good enough for mom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh God, I was in a dream land,'' she said. ``I thought, oh
well, at least Toronto is close to home. Five hours, that's not too
far. I remember the first time I walked into SkyDome and looked
down on the field, I said, `This is fantastic.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Crabtree's parents separated when he was in high school, and his
mother has remarried. His father has drifted out of his life. His
mother has not.
</P>
<P>
   She won't miss a game at Tiger Stadium. Thursday, a chartered
bus will take her and 50 friends to Detroit for a group outing.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom organizes the trip every year,'' said Crabtree, traded
to the Rangers a year ago in spring training. ``She has it down to
an exact science.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a little more complicated than Little League, when her
duties were to bring the Kool-Aid and popcorn. But her son is
pitching in the major leagues, and that's all that matters.

TEAM MARK FALLS TO PALMEIRO'S AUGUST RUN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ Right fielder Juan Gonzalez established the standard
by which all months once were measured for the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Designated hitter Rafael Palmeiro raised the bar yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro established the club record for runs batted in during a
month with his 39th in August in the Rangers' 4-2 victory against
the Toronto Blue Jays at SkyDome.
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro's game-tying, fourth-inning single off right-hander Roy
Halladay secured the most prolific month in terms of run production
for the Rangers since Gonzalez drove in 38 in July 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez kept the Rangers afloat through that oppressive month
by hitting .407 with 15 home runs and 38 RBI in 27 games, and the
American League chose the outfielder as its player of the month in
a unanimous vote. The Rangers went on to capture their first AL
West title, and Gonzalez won the first of his two league Most
Valuable Player awards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt he was going to drive in a run every single time he
stepped to the plate _ even when no one was on base,'' manager
Johnny Oates once said of Gonzalez's July. ``I've been in the game
for 30 years, and I've never seen anyone have the kind of month
like he had in July.''
</P>
<P>
   The manager cannot say that anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel the same way about Raffy right now,'' Oates said. ``I
feel like he's going to hit a ball hard every time he goes to the
plate.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro, who Friday matched Gonzalez's record for home runs in
a month with his 15th, will enter this afternoon's contest at Tiger
Stadium in Detroit hitting .346 (36-for-104) since Aug. 1.
</P>
<P>
   That lengthy streak leaves Palmeiro with a legitimate
opportunity to become the major leagues' first Triple Crown winner
since Boston's Carl Yastrzemski in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro trails Boston's Nomar Garciaparra by 11 points in
batting average, Seattle's Ken Griffey Jr. by one home run and
Cleveland's Manny Ramirez by six RBI.
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro could not recall a better stretch in his career, but
don't attempt to make him explain it. Palmeiro cannot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just hitting the good pitches they make,'' he said, ``and
I'm doing something with it when I get my pitch.''

PREPARATIONS CONTINUE AS HURRICANE BRUSHES COAST 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   WILMINGTON, N.C. _ People along the North and South Carolina
coasts braced for the worst Sunday, as Hurricane Dennis made its
way north. Hurricane warnings were issued late Sunday afternoon for
parts of coastal South Carolina, North Carolina and Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   After days of pleasant beach weather, rain and wind began to hit
the coastal Carolinas Sunday, the first evidence of more to come.
Tens of thousands of people were forced to evacuate from barrier
islands in the Wilmington area and the Outer Banks.
</P>
<P>
   The National Hurricane Center in Miami predicted that the
hurricane would turn northeast at some point Sunday night, raising
the possibility that it would miss a direct hit on the coast. But
if a turn comes later, the hurricane could head directly toward the
North Carolina beaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are confident in our predictions that it will turn,'' said
Bob Chartuck, spokesman for the National Hurricane Center. ``We
just don't know when or how fast. It could barrel into North
Carolina and then turn. But there are steering wind currents and we
expect those to come down and push the storm out to sea.''
</P>
<P>
   He said they issued the warnings in case the storm does not turn
in time to miss a direct hit on the coast. ``We want to make sure
they're warned that there's the potential that they'll get some of
the storm _ either the full brunt of it or the fringes of it,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Andre Mallette, a spokesman for the New Hanover County Emergency
Management Agency in Wilmington said in this county, about 10,000
people were evacuated Sunday from Carolina Beach, Wrightsville
Beach, Kure Beach and Figure Eight Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if we don't get a direct hit,'' he said, ``we are
expecting hurricane force winds, so we issued the mandatory
evacuation of our barrier islands at noon today to avoid nighttime
evacuations.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of possible storm surges that can cause flooding and
close off roads, more than 20,000 people were evacuated from
Ocracoke and Hatteras Island to the north of here as well Sunday,
said A.C. Joyner of the North Carolina Highway patrol. ``If we have
20,000 people and the road is closed, there won't be time to open
the road before the storm hits.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Carver, a spokesman for the North Carolina Division of
Emergency Management said, ``Nobody knows exactly where this storm
is going. We are trying to find a happy medium between
over-reacting and not reacting appropriately.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Two county-run emergency shelters were opened at 3:30 p.m in
Wilmington. All city and county offices, courts and all public
schools will be closed Monday in the Wilmington area.
</P>
<P>
   Even though people along most of the South Carolina coast were
assured that they would dodge a direct hit from the storm, South
Carolina Gov. Jim Hodges urged coastal residents Sunday morning to
be aware of the damage that could be caused even if the storm blows
by the state. With the potential for high wind and water damage, a
tropical storm warning was issued for the South Carolina coast.
</P>
<P>
   Shelters opened in northern South Carolina coastal counties
Sunday afternoon as well.
</P>
<P>
   In Litchfield, S.C., south of Myrtle Beach, property manager
Bobby Warner oversaw precautionary measures at the Litchfield By
the Sea resort, a 4,500-acre resort community on the ocean, with
450 houses and condominiums.
</P>
<P>
   Workers were busy Sunday afternoon boarding up buildings and
securing outdoor furniture. ``We are being very careful,'' he said,
``we have been through this many times before and have learned to
err on the side of caution. We've pretty much got this own to a
science.''
</P>
<P>
   At Alligator Adventure in North Myrtle Beach, S.C., the
management was also being cautious. The 15-acre facility houses
more than 800 alligators. To ensure that no alligators will escape
during the storm, workers reinforced the fence surrounding the
park, with a 1 1/2 inch steel fence. ``The worst-case scenario,''
said manager Matt Burmeister, ``is that some may get out of their
individual pens, but they are not getting out of our park.''
</P>
<P>
   But for a crew of college students from Clemson University,
driving four hurricane research vans to Wilmington Sunday, the
object was to get as close to the eye of the storm as possible.
Their vans were pulling trailers carrying towers that they hope to
place in the hardest hit areas on land to measure the wind speed of
the strongest part of the hurricane. ``We are trying to get an
accurate measure of wind speed on the ground,'' said civil
engineering student Don Key, 22. ``Typically winds are measured at
high levels, but we are trying to see the wind speeds at house
level so we can write more accurate building codes.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida and Georgia coastal residents began to relax, as threat
of a direct hit there from Dennis began to dissipate. Georgia Gov.
Roy E. Barnes announced Sunday that the state is prepared to render
aid to the Carolinas if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Pamela Swanson of the Georgia Emergency Management Agency said,
``We could be getting a lot of the evacuees coming here for shelter
and assistance.''

PATRICK RANCE, 81, BRITISH CHEESE CRUSADER 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By WILLIAM GRIMES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Patrick Rance, a crusader for traditional British farmhouse
cheeses and the author of the authoritative ``Great British Cheese
Book,'' died on Aug. 22. He was 81.
</P>
<P>
   From his small shop in Streatley, near Henley-on-Thames, Rance
waged a determined and ultimately successful battle to raise public
awareness of the traditional, raw-milk cheeses produced in
cylinders and wrapped in cloth.
</P>
<P>
   Alarmed at the rise of mass-market, industrially made cheddars,
red Leicesters and Wensleydales that were being sealed in plastic
and sold in supermarkets across Britain, he diligently sought out
small, tradition-minded cheese makers and provided a showcase for
their efforts at his little shop, where customers could buy dog
food and shoelaces along with farmhouse cheddars, single
Gloucesters, Swaledales and nearly 150 other cheeses.
</P>
<P>
   His life's passion culminated in ``The Great British Cheese
Book,'' published in 1982. Widely praised, it led to a companion
volume on French cheese, ``The French Cheese Book,'' published in
1989.
</P>
<P>
   Rance was born in Southend-on-Sea, where his father was a vicar,
and grew up in Westcliff-on-Sea, where he was taken with his mother
after his father's death in 1923. He attended Christ's Hospital
but, told that he was not university material, he enrolled at
Sandhurst, the military academy, in 1936. Two years later he
received a commission in the Northamptonshire Regiment.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II he served as adjutant of a battalion and
rose to the rank of major. He took part in the Anzio landings and
after the war did intelligence work in Vienna, Austria.
</P>
<P>
   After retiring from the army, he worked for the Conservative
Central Office, where he helped start its public opinion research,
but he and his new wife, Janet, nourished a peculiar ambition, to
run a village shop. In 1954 the couple took over Wells Stores,
which sold precisely three cheeses. By 1960 the number had swelled
to 16 international cheeses, and by 1980 the shop was offering 150
cheeses, many of them the traditional British farmhouse cheeses
that Rance had ferreted out on visits to farms all over Britain.
</P>
<P>
   In 1973 the national tourist board commissioned Rance to write
an article on British cheese. His research so disturbed him that he
decided to write a book in defense of traditional cheese. ``The
hard cheeses of England and her firm-crusted blues are the finest
in the world,'' he wrote. ``Apart from Stilton, they are also the
least known.'' This held true even of Cheddar, which he called
``our most generous gift to humanity,'' because only one in 100
consumers ever bit into the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Great British Cheese Book,'' Rance offered a
region-by-region survey that traced the history of cheeses like
Cheshire, Gloucester and Cheddar and the traditional way of making
them. Each chapter included a list of farms still producing the old
varieties.
</P>
<P>
   Rance brought high drama to the subject. His search for a
genuine Blue Vinney, Dorset's greatest cheese, reads like a
thriller, with Rance unmasking frauds, following threadlike leads
to remote farmhouses, and slashing away with great energy at the
enemies of cheese _ notably the Milk Marketing Board and the
industrial-scale dairies, whose block cheeses, he believed, had all
the flavor of Plexiglas.
</P>
<P>
   With the publication of ``The Great British Cheese Book,'' which
was hailed by food authorities like Elizabeth David and Jane
Grigson, Rance, who presided over his shop wearing a monocle,
became a national figure. He was Britain's leading expert on
traditional cheese, the man who helped rescue such endangered
species as Montgomery's Cheddar, Keene's Cheddar and Appleby's
Cheshire.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, he and his wife bought a stone farmhouse in
Fontvieille, Provence, where he wrote ``The French Cheese Book.''
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by seven children.

TWO COPPER PRODUCERS TO FIGHT PHELPS DODGE BID
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Colo., Ariz.)   (jw) 
 By JOSEPH B. TREASTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Battling for greater market share in the copper industry, two
merging rivals said Sunday that they were determined to fight a
hostile takeover campaign begun on Friday by the Phelps Dodge
Corp., the world's fourth-largest producer.
</P>
<P>
   In a joint statement, the chief executives of the companies,
Asarco Inc. of New York and the Cyprus Amax Minerals Co. of
Englewood, Colo., urged shareholders to ignore overtures by Phelps
Dodge of Phoenix and approve their merger in a vote scheduled for
Sept. 30.
</P>
<P>
   Accusing Phelps Dodge of ``unreasonable tactics,'' and
``inflammatory public statements,'' Francis McAllister of Asarco
and Milton Ward of Cyprus Amax said that Phelps Dodge's main
interest was ``to break up our merger.''
</P>
<P>
   No response was received from a message left Sunday afternoon at
the office Douglas Yearley, the chief executive of Phelps Dodge.
</P>
<P>
   Phelps Dodge has offered $2.66 billion to buy the two companies.
Asarco and Cyprus Amax immediately rejected the bid, made on Aug.
20. Five days later the two companies said they would be willing to
talk with Phelps Dodge providing it raised its offer to $3.3
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Phelps Dodge responded that the counteroffer was ``totally
unreasonable.'' Then on Friday, Phelps Dodge took steps to woo
Asarco and Cyprus Amax shareholders and sued executives of the two
companies on the grounds that they were not acting in their
shareholders best interests.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts said that Phelps Dodge certainly would not like to
see Asarco, the sixth-largest copper producer, and Cyprus Amax, the
eighth largest, join forces because the new company would become
the world's second-largest copper company behind Codelco, the
government-owned mining company of Chile.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the analysts say, if Asarco and Cyprus Amax persist in
opposing a combination with Phelps Dodge, it would be to Phelps
Dodge's advantage to see a break-up of the merger. Then, the
analysts say, Phelps Dodge could try to buy the companies
separately.
</P>
<P>
   Executives of Asarco and Cyprus Amax say their merger will save
$250 million in operating costs, suggesting greater future profits
and higher stock prices. They have also promised to give each
shareholder of the new company a bonus of $5 a share after the deal
closes.
</P>
<P>
   The analysts said neither Asarco nor Cyprus Amax would be able
to make as compelling a case to their shareholders against
individually being taken over by Phelps Dodge.
</P>
<P>
   If Phelps Dodge could buy the two companies, it would become the
world leader in copper.

COMMENTARY: A COMMITTED REALIST 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ANTHONY LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRETORIA, South Africa _ ``We are battling with the problem of
too much spending on the wages and salaries of public employees,''
President Thabo Mbeki said. ``It takes 90 percent of our health
budget, for example, leaving 10 percent for drugs, building
hospitals and so on. We can't go on like that.''
</P>
<P>
   He was explaining, in an interview, why his government had taken
a step that The Sunday Times of South Africa said represented ``a
watershed moment in our political life.'' The government said no to
a wage claim by teachers, firefighters and other public employees;
then it withdrew from negotiations and unilaterally imposed a
smaller wage increase.
</P>
<P>
   The striking quality of that decision was that it came from a
government of the historically left-wing African National Congress,
one that includes members of the Communist Party and is formally
allied to the labor union federation. The government gave the
unions only 1 percent less than they were asking: a 6 percent raise
instead of 7. But the symbol was powerful.
</P>
<P>
   When the National Party won power, in 1948, it set out to uplift
poor whites _ especially Afrikaners _ by giving them civil service
jobs. By 1991 a third of all employed whites had jobs with the
state or state corporations. The bureaucracy, still heavily white,
is notoriously overmanned and inefficient.
</P>
<P>
   ``We underestimated the problem,'' Mbeki said. ``We had a
program of voluntary severance, to downsize public employment. But
it failed because we did not count on the need to add to the public
service.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you say you have to bring clean water to the rural areas,
you find that the only thing the civil servants know how to do is
to sit in an office. You have to bring in new people to lay the
pipes!'' (Since 1994 the government has brought clean water to 2.5
million rural people, one of its premier accomplishments.)
</P>
<P>
   The unions reacted angrily to the government's decision, holding
one-day strikes and threatening more. They foresaw that the
government's next steps would be to lay off public employees and
tie wage increases to performance.
</P>
<P>
   None of this should come as a great surprise to those who knew
Thabo Mbeki in his exile years, when he was the ANC's chief
diplomat. He always was a realist, with a powerful intellect.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the ANC, he questioned the idea that the apartheid system
had to be overthrown by military force. In 1988-89, despite severe
criticism by ANC colleagues, he met with Afrikaner intellectuals
and South African business leaders, allaying their fears about the
ANC. After President F.W. de Klerk released Nelson Mandela and
others in 1990, Mbeki persuaded an ANC conference to suspend armed
struggle and go for negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   His stand on public-employee pay is not union-busting but a
decision on where priorities lie: in spending on education,
encouraging investment to create jobs, and changing the country's
gross inequalities of wealth.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you can see,'' he said in an interview last week in the
presidential residence, ``racial separation is in the past. But in
socioeconomic terms the divisions remain. We've got to build a
nonracial society. That means everything: economics, education, the
creation of nonracial towns. The legacy of apartheid has
consequences _ poverty, the low skills level, corruption, the
difficulties we're having with crime.''
</P>
<P>
   One factor in crime, he said, was ``a very serious problem of
police corruption: white police. The level of rot that set in. ...
Some police are involved in crimes themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki will come to the United States at the end of September. He
will address the United Nations, but investment will be much on his
mind. He expects to meet President Clinton and business and
financial leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in the fortunate situation,'' he said, ``that poor
people understand how long it takes for us to get them out of
poverty. That's why the ANC did so well in the election in June.
They have seen progress. They're convinced that more was not done
because there are constraints.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our people understand the extent and nature of the challenge.
We will move faster in the next five years. I'm convinced that the
economy will grow, and that we'll deal better with crime and
corruption.''
</P>

 &HT;    Ohio State falls to Miami 23-12
 &HT;    By Susan Vinella
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Ohio State coach John Cooper said last
week a loss in the season opener would not be devastating to him or
his team.
</P>
<P>
   So how did it feel after his ninth-ranked Buckeyes were upset,
23-12, by 12th-ranked Miami (Fla.) in the Kickoff Classic Sunday?
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, I'm very disappointed,'' Cooper said. ``I'm not as
disappointed in losing the ball game as I am in the way we played.
I don't feel we played as well as we're capable of playing.''
</P>
<P>
   OSU kicker Dan Stultz, who missed an extra point and a 44-yard
field goal, put it a little more grimly: ``I think overall we're a
little shell-shocked.''
</P>
<P>
   Miami racked up nearly twice as many offensive yards (398 to
220) as the Buckeyes and at times, ran through their defense like
it was paper. Its defense sacked OSU quarterback Austin Moherman
three times and intercepted two of his passes.
</P>
<P>
   But those numbers aside, it was the Hurricanes big plays _ and
the Buckeyes' lack of them _ that was the difference in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The play right before halftime, when they threw a jump ball,
was probably the biggest play in the game,'' Cooper said.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State was trailing 15-9 with less than 45 seconds remaining
in the first half. Miami had first and 10 on its own 33-yard line.
UM sophomore quarterback Kenny Kelly, making his first collegiate
start, faked a handoff and then looked deep for wide receiver
Santana Moss.
</P>
<P>
   Moss, blanketed by first-year starting cornerback Nate Clements,
was sprinting down the right sideline. About twenty-four yards from
the goal line, he stopped, cut back _ momentarily losing Clements _
caught Kelly's pass and sprinted into the end zone. OSU safety Gary
Berry and cornerback Ahmed Plummer, within arm's length or so of
Moss after the catch, couldn't stop him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soon as it came out of my hand, I thought, 'Oh man, I
underthrew him,'' said Kelly, named the game's Most Valuable
Player. ``But he (Moss) just made a great play back to it. I think
it was the turning point in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The last-second strike _ there were eight seconds left in the
half when Moss scored _ certainly dug OSU into a deeper hole.
Instead of trailing by a touchdown, the Bucks were down by two plus
a couple of extra points. It was not where they wanted to be with a
first-year quarterback running the offense.
</P>
<P>
   Moherman struggled a bit before the break, completing 5-of-12
passes and throwing one interception. His 6-yard touchdown pass to
tight end Steve Wisniewski in the first quarter was OSU's only
touchdown of the game. He finished 10-of-22 for 107 yards, a
performance he called ``OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Midway through the second quarter, Cooper gave sophomore
quarterback Steve Bellisari a chance to lead the offense, in hopes
he might provide a spark.
</P>
<P>
   But Bellisari completed just one pass for minus three yards and
had two fumbles, one of which resulted in a turnover. He never
returned to the game.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State had its chances in the second half but it couldn't
capitalize on Miami's mistakes. Early in the second half, the
Buckeyes recovered a UM fumble only to fumble themselves and turn
the ball back over.
</P>
<P>
   Then, after Plummer intercepted a Kelly pass on the next series,
OSU drove to the Hurricanes 4-yard line only to be denied a trip
into the end zone after a series of penalties and miscues. The
Bucks had to settle for a field goal.
</P>
<P>
   With this kind of production, the Buckeyes desperately needed a
big play or two. But besides Wiley's 69-yard run in the first
quarter, which set up OSU's first field goal, there were none.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't do anything after that in terms of any home runs,''
Cooper said. ``Our wideouts didn't make big plays, our running
backs didn't make big plays. Our offensive line didn't give our
young inexperienced quarterback enough time to set up and throw the
football. The kicking game was not very good.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a lot of work.''

AMERICANS DOMINATE TEST FOR SWIMMERS IN OLYMPIC POOL 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms)  
By JOHN SHAW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ The United States won three of four events
Sunday on the final day of the Pan Pacific swimming championships
and emerged as the top team in the first major test of the ``fast''
pool where Olympic events will be swum next year.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven world records were set during the eight-day, 12-nation
meet at the Sydney International Aquatic Center.
</P>
<P>
   The American team _ led by the sprinter Jenny Thompson and the
backstrokers Lenny Krayzelburg and Brooke Bennett, who among them
won 11 medals _ edged out the host nation in medals, 35-32, and in
points, 391-372.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Australians, led by Ian Thorpe, Michael Klim and
Susie O'Neill, matched the American gold medal tally of 13. The
last time Australia bested the United States in total medals at a
swimming competition was in 1956, at the Olympics in Melbourne.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, for the first time in these championships, no world
records were set. Thompson earned her fifth and sixth gold medals,
winning the 50-meter freestyle and swimming the butterfly leg in
the women's medley relay. The American men's medley relay also won.
</P>
<P>
   In the men's 1,500 freestyle, 19-year-old Grant Hackett of
Australia won in 14 minutes 45.60 seconds, the second-fastest time
ever.
</P>
<P>
   The brightest star of the championships was Penny Heyns, the
24-year-old South African breast-stroke specialist who lives in
Canada. Heyns set four world records at distances from 50 to 200
meters, bringing her haul of world records to eight in the last six
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Swimming's oldest record survived the onslaught. Mary T.
Meagher's 2:05.96 in the 200 butterfly, set in 1981, withstood a
strong challenge last Thursday by O'Neill, the defending Olympic
champion. O'Neill, 26, fell 0.64 of a second short.
</P>
<P>
   However, the second butterfly record Meagher set in 1981 was
finally broken. Thompson, 26, clipped five-hundredths of a second
off Meagher's 18-year-old record in the 100 butterfly.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese team was conspicuous for being almost invisible.
Chinese swimmers qualified for only one final and finished last in
that.
</P>
<P>
   China originally named 20 swimmers for the meet, but sent only
five. The reason given by Chinese authorities was the ``conflicting
domestic schedule'' of the All-China Games in October.
</P>
<P>
   Officials here were suspicious of the Chinese explanation. A
series of Chinese female swimmers have been suspended for using
performance-enhancing drugs in recent years.

AMID A TINY CROWD, NORTH KOREAN IS SURPRISE WINNER IN WOMEN'S
MARATHON
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   SEVILLE, Spain _ On Saturday night, when Abel Anton of Spain
raced into the Estadio Olimpico on his way to victory in the men's
marathon at the world track and field championships, more than
50,000 spectators, most of them Spaniards, greeted him with a roar
of approval.
</P>
<P>
   But the morning after, when Jong Song Ok of North Korea ran
through the same tunnel and onto the same track for the final lap
of her unexpected victory in the women's marathon, there were only
about 1,000 fans _ none of them waving a North Korean flag _ and
the applause never threatened to become a roar.
</P>
<P>
   Jong's gold medal Sunday was the first medal of any kind for
North Korea in track and field in a world championships or
Olympics, and it was as big a surprise to her opponents as it was
to the historians of the sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was new to me, and when you don't know an athlete, it's
difficult to guess what their tactics will be,'' said Ari Ichihashi
of Japan, who won the silver medal in the closely contested race.
</P>
<P>
   Jong's winning time was 2 hours 26 minutes 59 seconds, just
three seconds better than Ichihashi, who stayed with the Korean
until shortly before they reached the stadium. The bronze medal
went to Lidia Slavuteanu-Simon of Romania in 2:27:41.
</P>
<P>
   Jong said that she had spent much of the race thinking of her
country's president.
</P>
<P>
   ``The course was difficult because of the heat, but I was
ready,'' Jong said, speaking to one of her coaches, who interpreted
her comments. ``In our country, all the people wait for our
results, especially our dear leader Kim Jong Il. He gives much care
to athletes taking part in international competition and wanted me
to win because it would give pleasure to the hard-working people of
our country. I imagined in my mind the image of our leader, and
this inspired me today. This was the source of my power.''
</P>
<P>
   Jong, who gave her age as 25, was one of two North Korean
athletes to compete here. The other, Kim Chang Ok, also a women's
marathoner, finished 10th Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, Kim had had greater international success in the
marathon, finishing second in the Asian Games last year. At the
1996 Olympics in Atlanta, Jong finished 20th and Kim 26th. But this
was their first appearance in the world championships.
</P>
<P>
   Her coach, Tae Dong Hak, said Jong regularly runs up to 25 miles
on a single day when she trains in a mountainous region in the
northern part of her country. Asked if it was difficult to train in
a country where there are food shortages, she did not answer
directly and reiterated that she dedicated the victory to her
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even when the leading group was still together at about two
hours, I was confident that I could break away successfully and
take the gold,'' Jong said.
</P>
<P>
   Enrico Arcelli, an Italian who gave a three-day clinic to North
Korean coaches last year in the capital of Pyongyang, said that,
despite the country's isolation and their lack of success
internationally in track, he had been surprised by the expertise he
encountered.
</P>
<P>
   ``The level of coaching is much higher than one might expect,''
Arcelli said. ``They are used to training a lot in quantity instead
of for quality, but to me it was clear that this woman was very
well coached. She has a good, economical running style.''
</P>
<P>
   Asian women _ particularly the Japanese _ have had considerable
success in the marathon in recent years. In 1993, Chinese runners
Wang Junxia and Qu Junxia, who like Jong ran enormous distances
during their daily training sessions, smashed the established world
records in the most prestigious middle distance races. Another
Chinese runner, Jiang Bo, broke the world record in the 5,000
meters in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Jong's performance set a national record and was a personal best
by nearly three minutes. But several of the event's leading
performers were missing.
</P>
<P>
   The Kenyan world record-holder, Tegla Loroupe, opted to run the
10,000 here instead. Naoko Takahashi, the pre-race favorite from
Japan who ran the fastest time in a women-only marathon last year,
withdrew an hour before the start with leg injuries. Japan's Hiromi
Suzuki, who won the last world title, chose not to compete here so
she could train for the Tokyo marathon in November.
</P>
<P>
   Jong still had to contend with the reigning Olympic champion,
Fatuma Roba of Ethiopia, who also has won the Boston Marathon three
times. Roba took the lead at about the 19-mile mark and began to
pull away, but she had made her move too early. At the 24-mile
mark, she was overtaken: first by Ichihashi and then by Jong.
</P>
<P>
   Roba finished fourth in 2:28:04. Afterward, Jong toweled off,
took a drink and jogged a victory lap.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I am a new marathon runner in the eyes of the rest of the
world,'' Jong said. ``Hopefully, they will know me better in the
future.''

<P>
   SEVILLE, Spain _ Maurice Greene and Michael Johnson have yet to
square off this season to determine the title of the world's
fastest man.
</P>
<P>
   But Greene and Johnson each earned a place in World Championship
history Sunday night in leading the U.S. 400- and 1,600-meter relay
teams to world-leading efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Greene anchored the United States 400-meter relay team to
victory in 37.59 seconds to win his third gold medal on the final
day of the nine-day meet. Greene, the world 100 record holder,
became the first man to capture the 100 and 200 in the same World
Championships, and tied Carl Lewis and Marita Koch as the only
athletes to win three titles in one championship.
</P>
<P>
   After failing to reach the men's 400-meter relay finals
following baton-exchange mishaps in the 1995 and 1997 World
Championships, the U.S. team of Jon Drummond, Tim Montgomery, Brian
Lewis and Greene produced the fifth-fastest mark of all time. ``We
had a great relay team and the bottom line is that we knew if we
passed the stick around we would win,'' Greene said.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, world 200 record holder and winner of the 400-meters
Thursday night in a world-record 43.18, anchored the U.S.
1,600-meter relay team, which included USC's Jerome Davis on the
first leg to a runaway triumph in 2:56.45. The win boosted
Johnson's career gold medal total to nine to surpass Lewis' record
total of eight won over a span of five World Championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a testament to what I've been trying to do my whole
career in going to all the world championships at the top of my
game and ready to go in and win,'' said Johnson, 32, a veteran of
five World Championships.
</P>
<P>
   Regina Jacobs, a 1981 Argyll Academy (Campbell Hall) graduate,
placed second in the women's 1,500 meters in a lifetime-best
4:00.35. The U.S. women captured another silver medal in the
1,600-meter relay.
</P>
<P>
   The men's relay victories boosted the U.S. total to a
nation-best nine gold medals and 17 overall. Russia and Germany
finished with 13 and 12 medals each.

Greene enjoying golden moments
<TEXT>
<P>
   By FRAN BLINEBURY
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   SEVILLE, Spain _ The first time anybody outside the state of
Kansas really heard of Maurice Greene was at the 1995 Texas Relays
when he stepped up and surprised Carl Lewis in the 100.
</P>
<P>
   These days, nobody is surprised by Greene, the world-record
holder at 100 who joined Lewis on Sunday night as the only men in
history to win three gold medals in a single edition of the World
Track and Field Championships.
</P>
<P>
   Greene closed the meet the same way he opened it, by blazing
down the straightaway at the Estadio Olimpico and hitting the
finish line first, this time as the anchor leg on the American
4x100 relay team.
</P>
<P>
   It only makes perfect sense. A country known for its fast food,
fast cars and even a fast president should have the fastest man in
the world living within its borders.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was one of my main goals coming here, and it has been all
along in track and field,'' Greene said. ``I wanted to restore the
reputation of American sprinting to its rightful place on top of
the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were too many years there where other people from other
countries were winning medals that used to be ours and should be
ours. Not only did they win them, but then they did a lot of
talking about how the American team was a thing of the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the kind of talk that has always motivated me. What do
they all have to say now after this? Tonight the world couldn't
touch our team and all year long, there hasn't been one of them who
can touch me and they know it.''
</P>
<P>
   What the world knows for sure is when the U.S. men can manage to
hang on to the baton in the 4x100, it is virtually impossible to
beat them to the wire. But in the two previous World Championships
_ at Goteborg in 1995 and Athens in 1997 _ baton disaster struck,
and the Americans took themselves out of the picture.
</P>
<P>
   In Athens, as at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, Canada ran away
with the gold and Donovan Bailey, the former world-record holder in
the 100, ran at the mouth.
</P>
<P>
   But this time Canada was disqualified Saturday in the
preliminary heat for running out of the passing zone.
</P>
<P>
   Which was irrelevant to the Americans, who had traveled to
Monaco for nearly a week of relay workouts before arriving in
Spain, and were ready to atone for their previous problems. In
Athens, Greene had been standing at the far end of the track,
waiting to run the anchor leg that night, only to see the baton hit
the track on the first exchange, and never got to do anything but
walk dejectedly back through the tunnel.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I was telling the guys and telling myself all week long
was, `Just get it to me, baby. Just give me a chance to do what I
do,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So they did. Jon Drummond rocketed the U.S. team off to a
healthy lead, and the U.S. delegation held its collective breath as
he made the handoff to Tim Montgomery. Cleanly.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery held the lead and slipped the stick nicely to Brian
Lewis. The British, running inside of the Americans, pushed
slightly in front on the third leg and Greene had about a half-step
to make up on Dwain Chambers as the last exchange was made.
</P>
<P>
   It was like batting practice to Mark McGwire or Sammy Sosa. Was
there ever a doubt?
</P>
<P>
   Greene fired up his jets, caught Chambers with 30 meters left
and went by easily to win by a full step in 37.59 seconds, the
fastest time in the world this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew if we got the stick to our man, then we were going
home with the gold,'' Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   It is amazing that in just two years, Greene has gone from being
a long shot at Athens to the two-time world champ in the 100, the
world-record holder at 9.79 and, with his win in the 200, joins
Carl Lewis in the record books. Not to mention the lead horse who
has pulled the American sprint wagon back to world prominence.
</P>
<P>
   Even on a night when Michael Johnson anchored the U.S. 4x400
team to another victory, becoming the first athlete to win nine
World Championship golds, and having finally run down the world
record in the 400, this was still a week that belonged to the
muscular 5-9 bullet who calls himself ``the phenomenon.''
</P>
<P>
   It was red-hot times in Seville's blazing weather.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Maurice came to me (in 1997) he already had everything he
needed to become a world champ,'' said John Smith, Greene's coach.
``He has a great work ethic and attitude. He told me all the things
he wanted to do and from what I can see, he's done them. He put
himself in position to become a world champion and that doesn't
surprise me. He knows how to prepare himself and he knows how to
handle every situation, even the big ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maurice has it in his head that the track belongs to him. This
track, the one he trains on in LA, every track he steps on. It's
his place of business.''
</P>
<P>
   For the phenomenon these days, business is good.

HELDER CAMARA, 90, DEFENDER OF BRAZILIAN POOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By LAURIE GOODSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Archbishop Helder Pessoa Camara of Brazil, an early proponent of
liberation theology and an outspoken critic of his country's
military dictatorship, died late Friday at his home in Olinda,
Brazil. He was 90.
</P>
<P>
   He served as archbishop of Olinda and Recife, in the parched and
impoverished northeast of Brazil, the world's largest Roman
Catholic nation. He pushed the Catholic Church to move beyond mere
charity for the poor and to advocate fundamental social changes
like land redistribution and access to education.
</P>
<P>
   Articulated by leaders like Camara, liberation theology swept
through Latin America in the 1970s and 1980s. Some accused it of
lending philosophical legitimacy to the armed revolutionary
movements then under way.
</P>
<P>
   Camara was denounced as ``the Red Bishop'' and ``Fidel Castro in
a cossack.'' To that, he once retorted: ``When I fed the poor, they
called me a saint. When I asked, `Why are they poor?' they called
me a communist.''
</P>
<P>
   He was born in Fortaleza, a port city in northeast Brazil. He
told an interviewer he was one of 13 children, only four of whom
survived childhood.
</P>
<P>
   He entered a seminary at 14 and was ordained at 22. He soon
became an active member of the Integralist movement, a Brazilian
outgrowth of fascism. He later said he left it after several years
because he came to see the faults in its authoritarian message.
</P>
<P>
   He rose through the church's ranks to become auxiliary bishop of
Rio de Janeiro in 1952. He soon befriended an official in the
Vatican Secretariat of State named Giovanni Battista Montini, who
allowed him to organize the National Conference of the Brazilian
Bishops. His Vatican contact went on to become Pope Paul VI.
</P>
<P>
   Camara served as secretary-general of the national conference
for 12 years, a position that put him in regular contact with
Brazil's political bureaucracy and three presidents.
</P>
<P>
   When the Second Vatican Council was meeting in Rome in 1963,
Camara called on his fellow bishops to drop such titles as
``excellency'' and ``eminence'' and to exchange their silver and
gold pectoral crosses for bronze or wooden ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let us end once and for all the impression of a bishop-prince,
residing in a palace, isolated from his clergy whom he treats
distantly and coldly,'' he wrote in a paper to the bishops.
</P>
<P>
   When he arrived in Recife as archbishop in 1964, he put the
archbishop's traditional gilded throne in storage and replaced it
with a simple wooden chair. He chose not to live in the palatial
official residence. He lived instead in a sparsely furnished room
behind a church.
</P>
<P>
   Clerics like Camara helped create a radical transition in the
Roman Catholic Church in Latin America, from an ally of the
military and wealthy land-owning elite to an advocate for the poor
and landless. Thousands of peasants met in small Bible-study groups
in which they were urged to abandon their traditional fatalism and
read the Gospel as a blueprint for social action.
</P>
<P>
   Camara was among the leaders who guided a pivotal meeting of
Latin America's bishops in Medellin, Colombia, in 1968 that
produced a set of documents calling for the church to stand in
solidarity with the poor.
</P>
<P>
   When Brazil's military regime began a campaign of repression,
many church lay leaders and clerics were among the victims. Camara
traveled abroad denouncing the torture and killing of priests, nuns
and seminary students. His phone was tapped, he received death
threats by phone and mail, and, in 1969, a hail of bullets pierced
the walls of his living quarters. He was out of the country at the
time.
</P>
<P>
   He became an international hero of the Catholic left and was
nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize. But in his own country the
military government banned news media coverage of him.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, Pope John Paul II went to Recife and met with Camara,
then considered a ``nonperson'' by the military government. On live
television broadcast nationally and internationally, the pope
embraced him and said: ``This man is a friend of the poor. He is my
friend.''
</P>
<P>
   He retired as archbishop in 1985 but continued to criticize the
role of multinational corporations and industrialized nations in
the Third World. He also criticized communist powers for imposing
their will on smaller countries, and said that although he found
humanism in Marxism, he was not a Marxist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let none try to confine me to one group or link me to any one
party, insist that his friends be my friends and his enemies
mine,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Pope John Paul II has steadily curbed the influence of
liberation theologians, appointing conservatives to replace them.
Camara was replaced by a man who moved into the official
archbishop's palace and began emphasizing saving souls over social
action. Many critics have blamed liberation theology for alienating
Brazil's Catholics, who have converted by the tens of thousands to
evangelical Protestant and Pentecostal churches.
</P>
<P>
   After his retirement, Camara still took part in services at his
church, Igreja das Fronteiras, where he lived until his death.
Thousands of Brazilians flocked to the city of Olinda on Saturday
for a daylong wake and citywide procession.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, President Fernando Henrique Cardoso called Camara ``a
blessed man who dedicated his life to ecumenical human rights,''
and declared three days of national mourning, beginning Monday.

SPORTS COLUMN: SO MANY HITS, SO MUCH TIME FOR JETER
</HEADLINE>
   (ms) 
 By IRA BERKOW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was a beautiful, butterscotch day, Yankee Stadium was bathed
in sunlight and Derek Jeter, who seems to move in perpetual
sunshine, was at bat. Jeter cocked his bat in his customary stance,
the bat held in such a high, unorthodox manner that it appears he
is sprouting an antenna from his helmet. It was the third inning,
runners on first and third, none out and the Yankees were behind,
2-0, to Seattle pitcher Paul Abbott. Abbott, a right-hander, threw,
and Jeter, a right-handed hitter, whipped the bat around with the
speed of a mongoose attacking a lizard, and lined a single to right
field, the 762nd base hit of his major league career.
</P>
<P>
   The myriad statistics that baseball elicits can give one a
headache, but a particular number that Jeter is fashioning is
remarkable. It places him in a category with the greatest hitters
in baseball history. With his two singles Sunday in the Yankees'
11-5 victory over the Mariners, he has more hits in the first four
full years of his career, 751 (he had 12 in 1995), than hitters
like Ted Williams (749 in his first four seasons), Cal Ripken
(745), Lou Gehrig (736) Ty Cobb (729), Pete Rose (723) and Henry
Aaron (718) had. If Derek Sanderson Jeter continues at his present,
league-leading pace of hits (175) _ he is batting .348, third in
the American League to Nomar Garciaparra's .350 and Bernie
Williams' .349 _ Jeter projects to 220 hits this season and 796
hits for his first four full years. He will have passed Stan Musial
(792) and Joe DiMaggio (791).
</P>
<P>
   ``If,'' said Jeter, seated at his locker before Sunday's game.
``Man, if's a big word. Baseball's a game of failure. Obviously you
fail more than you succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   His track record as well as his persona portray anything but the
concept of failure. At age 25, he appears the most level-headed of
athletes. He is approachable and, as Yankee management has learned,
coachable. ``He's not one of these young guys who thinks he's got
it all figured out,'' the Yankee coach Jose Cardenal said.
</P>
<P>
   In the other clubhouse, Jamie Moyer, a Seattle pitcher, said
Jeter had made ``huge adjustments at the plate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When he first came up,'' said Moyer, ``it was obvious he had
talent, but he also had some glaring holes. For one thing, you
could pitch him up and in, get him out on his front foot _ that is,
get him to shift onto his front foot before he swung. You did that
with change of speed, and it took a lot of sting out of his bat.''
But, added Moyer, Jeter adapted. ``That hole no longer exists.''
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't exist because Jeter spends good chunks of his time at
his craft. While his reputation of dating stars like Mariah Carey
may be earned, it has not proved a debilitating distraction to his
occupational chores.
</P>
<P>
   Over last winter, he regularly appeared on the Yankees' Tampa
spring-training grounds to work on driving inside pitches to left
field, instead of fighting them off and slicing them to right. He
didn't find this kind of diligence extraordinary. ``I live in
Tampa,'' he said, with a shrug. ``I work on my game all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Don Zimmer, the Yankees' dugout coach, who has been in
professional baseball for 51 years, said that unlike some superb
hitters, like Rose and Wade Boggs, Jeter hits with power, and to
all fields. ``How do you think he hits balls over the right-field
fence _ tapping them?'' Zimmer said. ``He's got a big swing, and
for him to have so many hits is phenomenal.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeter is also a good-size shortstop, at 6 feet 3 inches, 195
pounds, bigger and with greater range and richer than Johnny Pesky,
whom Zimmer remembers as having a terrific major league start.
Pesky was a Red Sox shortstop in the 1940s, and had 779 hits in his
first four seasons. Pesky got 208 hits in his second season with
Boston, in 1946, and batted .335. He dropped slightly in 1947,
getting 207 hits with a .324 batting average.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they made him take a cut in pay after that season,''
Zimmer said. ``He was a coach for me when I managed the Red Sox,
and Johnny told me he's never forgotten that he went from something
like $7,000 a year to $6,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeter, to underscore a difference in eras, went from $750,000 in
his third year to $5 million this year, after arbitration. But he
says there are no hard feelings about that between him and George
Steinbrenner, the team's principal owner. ``But he gets upset when
Michigan beats Ohio State in football,'' said Jeter, who is from
Michigan while Steinbrenner is from Ohio, ``and I do get on him
about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeter, who grew up a Yankee fan in Kalamazoo, said that his
favorite player was Dave Winfield, who was not one of
Steinbrenner's favorites. ``I thought Winfield was the greatest
all-round athlete there was,'' Jeter said. And as far as Winfield's
being Mr. May, as Steinbrenner had disparaged him, Jeter said, ``He
must have got a lot of hits in May then, to get 3,000 for his
career.''
</P>
<P>
   As for his career numbers, Jeter said: ``I just want to be
consistent and play as long as I'm having fun. I hope to have a lot
of great years left. After all, I'm still the youngest guy on this
team.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking around the clubhouse of the defending World Series
champion Yankees, it turned out he was right. Only 25. Just a babe.
Which gives rise to yet another agreeable, if plump, historical
baseball image.

LEMON DROP KID GAINS RESPECT  
 STEINBRENNER AT SARATOGA 
BAFFERT'S BIG DAY AT DEL MAR
</HEADLINE>
   (ms)

<P>
   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. _ Who is the leading 3-year-old horse in
racing? On the day after Lemon Drop Kid won the Travers, and three
months after he won the Belmont Stakes, the memory of Charismatic
hung over the question.
</P>
<P>
   Charismatic, the onetime claiming horse who won the Kentucky
Derby and the Preakness, then fractured his leg while running third
in the Belmont, was retired in June. But his trainer, D. Wayne
Lukas, recalled Sunday that his colt had nearly swept the Triple
Crown and said that his achievements remained, even while other
colts tried to overtake him in the second half of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't equate the Derby and the Preakness with the Belmont
and the Travers,'' Lukas said. ``The Derby is the premier race and
everyone was in it. Now, if Lemon Drop Kid goes on to win the
Breeders' Cup Classic, or even the Jockey Club Gold Cup, then it's
a different scenario.''
</P>
<P>
   Lukas got little argument from Scotty Schulhofer, who trains
Lemon Drop Kid and who has not yet declared that his colt should be
the presumptive champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a lot to do,'' Schulhofer said. ``He'll have to beat
Behrens and some of those older horses. But he came back from the
race beautifully. It was just a summer stroll for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Three milestones still loom on the road to the championship: the
$500,000 Woodward at a mile and an eighth at Belmont Park on Sept.
18, the $1 million Jockey Club Gold Cup at a mile and a quarter at
Belmont on Oct. 10 and the $4 million Breeders' Cup Classic at a
mile and a quarter at Gulfstream on Nov. 6.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll skip the Woodward and wait for the Jockey Club Gold
Cup,'' Schulhofer said. ``That will give him plenty of time to
rest. If all goes well, it will be on to the Breeders' Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   Cat Thief, Lukas' ace in the hole, set the pace in the Travers
before fading to seventh. Lukas reported he had displaced his soft
palate and had trouble breathing. ``He'll run one more time before
the Breeders' Cup,'' the trainer said, ``but I haven't picked any
specific race yet.''
</P>
<P>
   STEINBRENNER AT SARATOGA
</P>
<P>
   George Steinbrenner, the principal owner of the Yankees, signed
autographs and starred in the winner's circle after his 2-year-old
filly, Dream Supreme, not only made a winning debut in the sixth
race Sunday but also equaled the track record for 5{ furlongs set
53 years ago by Tea Olive. The dark bay daughter of Seeking the
Gold and Spinning Round, who is trained by Linda Rice, won by one
length under Jorge Chavez and covered the distance in 1:03 2/5.
</P>
<P>
   In the $300,000 Saratoga Breeders' Cup Handicap, the 5-year-old
trans-Atlantic traveler Running Stag scored another coup when he
swept through the homestretch to win by half a length over
Catienus. It was the second flying success for Running Stag, who
crossed the ocean in the spring and lost the Massachusetts Handicap
to Behrens by half a length before winning the Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a real phenomenal horse to be able to go back and forth
across the ocean like he does,'' said Shane Sellers, who rode
Running Stag. Richie Schosberg, the trainer of Catienus, said:
``Three more jumps and he might have won. But Running Stag is an
awfully good horse.''
</P>
<P>
   Philip Mitchell, who trains Running Stag, said his star would
not make the Breeders' Cup Classic on Nov. 6 but would keep flying.
After running in the Woodward at Belmont next month, he will return
to Europe to prepare for an even longer trip to the Hong Kong Cup
in December.
</P>
<P>
   He ran the mile and a quarter in 2:01 and paid $4 for a $2 bet
to win.
</P>
<P>
   BAFFERT'S BIG DAY AT DEL MAR
</P>
<P>
   The Pacific Classic at Del Mar might have lost Silver Charm,
Real Quiet, Victory Gallop and Mazel Trick through injuries, but it
proved a gold mine Sunday for Bob Baffert, who ran first with
General Challenge and second with River Keen.
</P>
<P>
   Malek, who inherited the favorite's role, failed to finish in
the money as General Challenge took the lead in the homestretch
under David Flores and won by three lengths. General Challenge ran
the mile and a quarter in 2:00 2/5 and paid $7.20. &QL;

UNHERALDED CHAMPION STEPS INTO THE CHESS LIMELIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ROBERT BYRNE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The chess world woke up Sunday morning with a new champion,
33-year-old Russian grandmaster Aleksandr Khalifman, who emerged
from obscurity to win the International Chess Federation's version
of the title late Saturday night on a stage at Caesar's Palace in
Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   By engineering a 40-move draw against Vladimir Akopian of
Armenia, 27, Khalifman gained not only the half-point necessary for
victory in the match but also a higher place on the world ratings
list and an international celebrity that will be new for him.
</P>
<P>
   The title series, a month of preliminary matches followed by a
weeklong final match, was played under a no-frills knockout system
that eliminated several players better known than Khalifman and
caused others to stay away. But the federation, known as FIDE, is
the only worldwide chess organization and the title Khalifman won
is a traditional one.
</P>
<P>
   The Las Vegas match featured ingenious endgame play, mastery in
defense and relentless slogging in the trenches. There were no
points of dazzling brilliancy, no grand combinations. The players
might be out of work if it were not for solid positional play. Of
the six games in the finals, three were drawn, two were won by
Khalifman and one by Akopian.
</P>
<P>
   The winner's share of the prize money was $660,000 and the
loser's $396,000, less the 20 percent all players were required to
contribute to FIDE. The total prize fund, distributed among the
hundred players from all over the globe who took part in the event,
was almost $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   There may be more championship chess on the horizon. Anatoly
Karpov, the previous FIDE champion, is suing the organization for
$1 million for not seeding him into the finals. He is also
demanding a match with Khalifman. In addition, Garry Kasparov of
Russia, who is still generally regarded as the strongest player in
the world, has accepted a challenge from the brilliant Indian star,
Viswanathan Anand. Their match may be held before the year is out.
And the winner might get together with Khalifman for still another
title match.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night's encounter was typical of the Las Vegas games.
Akopian chose an adventurous formation for handling the black
pieces, and Khalifman immediately set out to prove it was a
misadventure, massing his forces against the enemy king. But once
again, defense triumphed _ even though it allowed Khalifman to get
the vital half-point that gave him the series _ and Akopian could
be pleased with his virtuosity as a defender.
</P>
<P>
   The Benoni Defense, introduced by 3...c5, is sharp and risky,
but appropriate for use in a must-win situation. After White seizes
space with 4 d5, the exchange with 4...ed 5 dc unbalances the pawn
position, so that White has a kingside majority and Black a
queenside majority. The basic strategy is for each to attack on
opposite sides of the board.
</P>
<P>
   One might think Khalifman would veer away from belligerence with
4e3 or 4 Nf3, but it seems he relishes the struggle. Either that or
he is following the old rule that the best defense is a good
offense.
</P>
<P>
   The development with 13 Ra3 was not irrelevant; 12 moves later
the rook shifted across to take a pivotal role in a mating attack.
</P>
<P>
   The common advance with 15 a5 prevents Black from mobilizing
with...b5; the uncommon 15...g5 runs the danger of weakening the
black king position, but it prevents Khalifman from creating an
attacking center with f4.
</P>
<P>
   After the thematic 16 Nc4, Akopian had to leave the e4 pawn
alone because 16 ...Ne4?! 17 Ne4 Qe4 18 Qe4 Re4 19 Bd3 Rd4 20 Be3
Rd5 21 Be4 Nf6 22 Bd5 Nd5 23 Nd6 yields Khalifman a favorable rook
for bishop-plus-pawn endgame.
</P>
<P>
   After 16...Ne5 17 Ne5 Qe5 18 f4!?, it would have been wrong to
play 18...gf 19 Bf4 Qe7 (19...Qd4 20 Kh2 Ne4? loses a piece to 21
Ra4) 20 Qc1! Ne4 21 Ne4 Qe4 22 Bd6 Ra8 23 Bh5 because White has
very strong attacking chances.
</P>
<P>
   But after 18...Qd4 19 Kh2 b5! 20 ab Rb6, Akopian was still
alive. Khalifman broke the kingside open with 21 e5! de 22 fg hg 23
Bg5, but after 23...e4!, the defense was still in business.
</P>
<P>
   After 25 Rg3, Akopian fearlessly captured with 25...Nd5 and
after 26 Bh5 Rf8 27 Nc3! Kh8!, he was still holding things
together.
</P>
<P>
   After 28 Rf7 Rf7 29 Bf7 Be5! 30 Nd5 Rd5 31 Bd5 Qd5 32 Qd2, both
players had run out of steam.
</P>
<P>
   And after 40...Bg2, they agreed to a draw.

U.N. ENVOY PUSHES FOR KOSOVO DEMOCRACY 
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Kosovo _ The new American ambassador to the United
Nations, Richard Holbrooke, met Kosovo's ethnic Albanian leaders
Sunday and urged them to help build the free, law-abiding and
democratic society they say they want and that the NATO alliance
went to war to provide.
</P>
<P>
   And he encouraged the U.N. officials trying to run this new
protectorate, including its leader, Bernard Kouchner, to worry less
about the world organization's infamous bureaucracy in New York and
do what they think is necessary to make Kosovo a success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't always ask _ just do it,'' Holbrooke told them at a
private lunch, a U.N. official said, stressing the importance of a
successful outcome in Kosovo to the reputation and future of the
United Nations itself.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke's meeting with the political leader of the Kosovo
Liberation Army, Hashim Thaci, 29, was both pointed and important,
American officials said, with the future role of the ``army's''
members being negotiated now and a deadline for its
``demilitarization'' on Sept. 19.
</P>
<P>
   While the army will be ``transformed,'' foreign negotiators say,
it will not become a Kosovo ``national guard,'' an outcome that
American officials originally held out to Thaci. Current
negotiations, at a sensitive stage, are about issues like the name
of the new group, its numbers and the number of weapons it will be
able to retain, perhaps as a sort of army reserve.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations is also trying to move Thaci and his
followers into active politics, but Thaci is said to be reluctant
to give up his status in many Albanians' eyes as the leader of a
liberation movement that helped drive the Serbs out of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   He is said to oppose the idea of leading a new party, fearing
that it would turn him into ``just another politician,'' an
official said, which is part of what the United Nations would like
to achieve.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke, who will meet Thaci again on Monday, was said Sunday
to have expressed understanding of the Albanian's hesitations. But
he demurred publicly when Thaci, after their long meeting at his
office, told waiting reporters that the two men agreed on every
point of demilitarization and transformation of the Liberation
Army, and that both agreed that ``Kosovars should be the ones to
decide for themselves the future of Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke said simply: ``I'll let Thaci speak for himself and
his colleagues,'' adding: ``We see progress and problems. But at
least we are in a free Kosovo, and with NATO to provide security,
it allows the creation of a pluralistic democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Thaci ``assured me of his commitment to those
principles,'' and said they had discussed another important point,
unmentioned by Thaci, ``the issue of corruption, which is a cancer
that can destroy a regime.''
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke also met Ibrahim Rugova, 55, the traditional leader of
the Kosovo Albanians, whose nonviolent opposition to Belgrade
produced few results. But Rugova remains popular among many older
and rural Albanians, and Kouchner has worked hard to bring both
Thaci and Rugova together on a Transitional Council that might take
some executive responsibility for running Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke praised the sometimes vague Rugova for his courage and
urged him to stay the course, saying: ``The war is over, but
forging a democracy here is a difficult process. NATO has to
provide security, but it's up to the political leaders to provide
the political democracy, and that is the message we hope to
convey.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Holbrooke met with Veton Surroi, the publisher of the
newspaper Koha Ditorer and a politician-in-waiting. Surroi caused a
ruckus 10 days ago when he published a stinging article titled
``The Sounds of Shame,'' about the disgrace of Albanian revenge
attacks against Serbs and Gypsies, many of them elderly or in their
teens, who were clearly not guilty of atrocities against Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to say that I feel ashamed to hear that for the first
time in the history of Kosovo, now the Kosovar Albanians are
committing monstrous atrocities,'' he wrote. ``I cannot stop myself
from saying that it should deeply concern our people that for the
first time our moral code of untouchability of women, children and
elderly has been broken.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   More importantly, Surroi said, ``We must deal with one or more
organized systems of violence, which are viciously directed toward
the Serbs. And we also have to deal with a system of thinking that
lurks behind the violence and assumes that every Serb must be
punished for what happened in Kosovo. That system of thinking is
called fascism.''
</P>
<P>
   Even more controversial, he suggested that this organized
violence would, in the absence of Serbs, be turned against other
Albanians, and asked: ``Is this what we fought for?''
</P>
<P>
   Thaci, entering the Transitional Council meeting a week ago, is
said to have commented that if anyone there called him a fascist he
would leave the room.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke's meeting with Surroi was private.
</P>
<P>
   After a meeting with Kouchner, asked about the responsibility of
NATO troops and the United Nations for the Serb exodus, Holbrooke
decried hatred on both sides and called Kosovo ``a mess for a long
time.'' Kouchner said he was unsatisfied with the security provided
the few Serbs who remain, but said it was improving, and said
plaintively: ``How can you change the mentality of the people in so
short a time? It's not only impossible, it's childish to believe it
can be done in so short a time.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps 25,000 to 30,000 Serbs remain in the province, down from
an estimated prewar population of perhaps 180,000.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Lt Gen. Sir Michael Jackson, the commander of the
NATO-led peacekeepers here, told Holbrooke and reporters that ``the
frequency of security incidents continues to go down, the serious
crime rate continues to go down.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the remaining Serbs felt under pressure, ``but I do not
believe that we are seeing a big exodus now and indeed we are
seeing continually small numbers of Kosovo Serbs returning to
Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke, who visited a mass grave site of murdered Albanians
on Saturday, has another day of talks on Monday before leaving
Kosovo.

 &HT;    DOLPHIN NEWS: Johnson finds reasons to smile
 &HT;    By Mark Woods
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAVIE, Fla. _ They looked at the x-rays Saturday night, saw a
crack in Cecil Collins' right ankle and prepared for a major
setback.
</P>
<P>
   But by Sunday morning, the prognosis had changed _ enough so
that Dolphins coach Jimmy Johnson was joking during his traditional
day-after-game news conference.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't that the crack in his rookie running back's ankle had
magically disappeared overnight. It just had transformed into
something less menacing.
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, that crack is two years old, a remnant from the
fracture that ended Collins' freshman season at Louisiana State.
</P>
<P>
   So while there is swelling and bruising near the crack _ the
Dolphins say Collins severely sprained the ankle during a 31-10
victory against Detroit _ Johnson had reason to be happy Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most positive news of today and maybe the most positive
news we can have for a long, long time is that Cecil Collins just
aggravated an old injury,'' he said. ``Whereas before we thought it
would be at least two or three weeks, now there is a possibility he
might be ready after this week.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins will miss the preseason finale Thursday night at Green
Bay. But neither the Dolphins nor Collins has given up hope that he
will be ready to play in the regular-season opener Sept. 13 at
Denver.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always get in trouble if I start predicting how long an
injury is going to take,'' Johnson said. ``We know he's going to be
out this week. We've got our fingers crossed for next week.''
</P>
<P>
   After undergoing more tests Sunday, Collins left the Dolphins'
training facility on crutches, a cast on his right ankle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be back for Denver, man,'' he said with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   In other running back news:
</P>
<P>
   _ J.J. Johnson, the team's top draft pick in 1999, isn't
expected to play this week. Although Johnson said Sunday that he
would ``love to see him get some action this week,'' the rookie
from Mississippi State likely won't be ready until the season
opener _ at best.
</P>
<P>
   _ Starting fullback Stanley Pritchett, who suffered a sprained
left knee against the Lions, will miss this week and be
questionable for the opener.
</P>
<P>
   The injury update didn't change one postgame prognosis: When the
season opens, Dan Marino most likely will be handing the first ball
to Karim Adbul-Jabbar.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Johnson loaded up on running backs in the offseason,
opening training camp with 12 on his roster, there has been
speculation that Abdul-Jabbar, the starter for three previous
seasons, would end up as trade bait.
</P>
<P>
   And although the Dolphins have received trade inquiries, what
has happened in the last few weeks only served to illustrate why
Johnson believes that would have been a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're in a situation where you're going to have a mediocre
team and you're building for the future, it might make sense with a
guy whose in the last year's of his contract and you've got young
players,'' he said. ``I did that with Terry Kirby a couple years
ago. But if you feel like your team has a chance to have some
success in the playoffs, you are very reluctant to trade away
players who can win for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Adbul-Jabbar never has been the flashiest player. It took him
three NFL seasons to produce a run of 30 yards or more. He has
never averaged more than 3.6 yards a carry in a season. And so far
this preseason he has averaged only 2.1 yards a carry.
</P>
<P>
   And while Johnson will hint that he wishes Abdul-Jabbar had the
ability to make something out of nothing _ a talent Collins has
shown repeatedly during the preseason _ the Dolphins' coach also
will defend the incumbent starter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Karim has been put in some difficult situations,'' Johnson
said. ``It just so happens that some of his carries have been when
we've had some of our offensive line breakdowns. You'd like to see
him be able to overcome that, but he hasn't been able to overcome
it. Karim has been a very good back for us, but we've got to block
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson pointed to one play in particular from Saturday's game.
Faced with a fourth-and-inches play from Lions' 36-yard line, the
Dolphins decided to go for it. They called a handoff to
Abdul-Jabbar. He made it a couple steps toward the line of
scrimmage before being hammered by Lions rookie Chris Claiborne,
who might have been the star of the game, for a one-yard loss.
</P>
<P>
   The problem there, Johnson said, was that veteran guard Kevin
Gogan missed a blocked.
</P>
<P>
   ``We bust the assignment and we've got an outstanding talent
hitting Karim in the backfield for a no gain,'' Johnson said.
``That wasn't Karim's fault.
</P>
<P>
   The perception has been that if Collins had remained healthy, he
would have replaced Abdul-Jabbar in the starting lineup in Denver.
Running backs coach Joel Collier said Sunday that was a
possibility, but hardly a certainty.
</P>
<P>
   ``If all things were equal, health and everything, I'm sure
Cecil would get more carries (in Denver),'' he said. ``That aside,
I would still feel more comfortable going into a Monday Night game
with Karim Adbul-Jabbar starting the whole thing out. Then as you
get into the flow, Cecil could be in there in a heartbeat. It might
be like that ...''
</P>
<P>
   Collier snapped his fingers and continued.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you just want to have it set up so that as you start the
game things won't go bad,'' he said. ``I don't think they will,
even with Cecil starting.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins, realizing he had put Collins in the starting lineup,
quickly rephrased the sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, I don't think they would,'' he said. ``But that's
going to be big lights, lot of noise. It would be a heckuva place
for a rookie to start. I think he'd handle it. But it's going to be
a non-issue if he's not healthy.

 &HT;    As Outer Banks evacuates, residents and vacationers seek higher
ground
 &HT;    By Travis Fain

<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, N.C. _ Under cloudy skies they came to Greenville
Sunday, because it was west.
</P>
<P>
   Some left their homes. Others suspended family vacations. All
were leaving the potential path of Hurricane Dennis, which spun
counter-clockwise over the Atlantic Ocean as came, keeping experts
and residents guessing when, where and if it would make landfall.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are you going to do?'' Bill Davidges said of the
mandatory evacuation that sent him out of the Outer Banks. ``You
gotta look at it this way: this is hurricane season. You take that
chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Evacuation orders were in effect throughout the Outer Banks and
southern barrier islands of North Carolina by Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Davidges likes to vacation in August and he and his family of 13
left homes from Boston to Baton Rouge, La., arriving at the beach
Saturday afternoon, he said. A day later, they were back in their
cars, on a 2 1/2-hour trip to Greenville that included a stop for
ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vacation isn't over,'' said Davidges' 81-year-old mother,
Jean. ``It might miss us and we'll go back. I've lived through a
good many hurricanes and hurricane watches. It doesn't bother me
that much.''
</P>
<P>
   Hotel rooms filled slowly but surely Sunday afternoon and
evening, hotel staff said. A deluge of calls came in from the
coast, with more people asking about vacancies than making
reservations, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I work every Sunday and it's dead,'' said Katrina Holland,
working the front desk at Fairfield Inn. ``But it won't be
tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Holland and inn manager Michelle Duncan said they expected to
sell out the inn's 114 rooms, if not tonight then probably by
tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   At the Holiday Inn, 49 of 119 rooms were full or reserved by 8
p.m. Sunday, staff members said. One extra employee was brought in
to work the front desk. Several extra housekeepers were expected to
be called in Monday and Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could handle a tropical storm every Sunday,'' Duncan said,
happy for the extra business. ``Wouldn't hurt my feelings a bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Others were less enthusiastic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to question your brochures that have all that
sunshine,'' said MonalisaBissonnette, unloading luggage and kids
alike in the Holiday Inn lot. ``I think that's just to lure stupid
northern tourists. I think it's a ploy. I think you have fake
sun.''
</P>
<P>
   Bissonnette and her family live in Michigan and have been to
North Carolina twice in the last year, she said. It rained both
times.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Ferguson and his family insured their vacation, too. This
is the first time in 10 years of visiting North Carolina beaches
they did so and the New York state family of four said they were in
good spirits Sunday, despite trading a beach house and a seafood
supper for a two-bed hotel room and dinner from McDonald's.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's part of life,'' Ferguson's 16-year-old son, Chris, said
as his mom and dad eating french fries off a double bed.
</P>
<P>
   The family picked Greenville because it was the first
medium-sized city due west, they said. Sunday was their first night
here and they, like a lot of people uprooted by the hurricane, said
they had no immediate plans.
</P>
<P>
   The Davidges are new to Greenville too, they said. They picked
it off a map, because there were chain hotels here and it was
closer than other options like Rocky Mount and Raleigh.
</P>
<P>
   And because it was West.

HIGH OZONE LEVELS SERVE AS A REMINDER OF PROBLEMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MANSUR  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ A dense haze that enveloped downtown Kansas
City last week exceeded federal limits for ozone, a lung irritant
and the metropolitan area's most significant air pollutant.
</P>
<P>
   The ozone often develops on sunny days, especially if there is
little wind.
</P>
<P>
   That summer haze should remind the area, local officials say,
that it has a long-term pollution problem that must be solved _
soon.
</P>
<P>
   The key to that solution, those officials said, is reformulated
gasoline, known as RFG.
</P>
<P>
   The need for the new fuel should not be lost amid the recent
controversy in which the area was threatened with the loss of
highway funds because of air- pollution problems. The need was
established long before the highway money became an issue, federal
environment regulators said.
</P>
<P>
   The area is under federal order to propose a major new program
to curb air pollution in response to violations in 1995 and 1997 of
the federal ozone limit, said Wayne Leidwanger, chief of air
planning and development at the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency's regional office in Kansas City, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City earlier promised the EPA that if such violations
occurred, it would start some new program to reduce the pollution,
Leidwanger said.
</P>
<P>
   After the 1997 violation, EPA regulators told regional leaders
to craft a strategy to reach a specified pollution-control target.
The target is a reduction of about 8.4 tons per day of volatile
organic chemicals, a type of chemical prone to react in the
atmosphere to form ozone.
</P>
<P>
   At first the Mid-America Regional Council chose a
vehicle-inspection program to reduce the emissions of the
ozone-creating chemicals. But faced with concerns from state
officials about the political hurdles such a program would face,
the regional council switched to reformulated gasoline. It would
not reduce emissions quite as much as the vehicle-inspection
program, but it would cost less.
</P>
<P>
   ``RFG is the most cost-effective option and will have the
biggest long-term impact,'' said David Warm, the regional council's
executive director.
</P>
<P>
   The program is expected to reduce the emissions of volatile
organic chemicals by 18.5 tons per day, the regional council said.
</P>
<P>
   The ozone-creating chemicals are emitted from vehicle tailpipes,
as well as industry smokestacks and a variety of other sources. In
total, an estimated 318 tons per day of these chemicals will be
released in the metropolitan area in 2000, according to the
regional council's 1997 analysis.
</P>
<P>
   The ozone levels are expected to continue increasing as the area
grows and more residents commute longer distances, often in larger
vehicles that produce more pollution. Other polluting activities,
such as lawn mowing, painting and laying asphalt, will increase
with local growth. By 2010, the regional council predicts, the
area's emissions of ozone-creating chemicals may climb to 334 tons
per summer day, unless some major control program is instituted.
</P>
<P>
   Regional council officials caution that these projections could
change as they recalculate the area's sources of ozone-producing
emissions.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the high ozone levels last week, this summer has not
produced a major new air-pollution episode. But federal officials
say that doesn't take away the need to start a major new
air-pollution control program here.
</P>
<P>
   Nor does it matter, they say, that recent calculations for the
area's transportation plans show that reformulated gasoline is not
necessary for those plans to comply with federal clean-air
requirements.
</P>
<P>
   The transportation plans are a separate issue from the clean-air
violations that led to the original decision to bring in RFG.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, a development in the transportation-plan issue
complicated matters. This occurred when regional council officials
adjusted their transportation-plan models this summer, plugging in
a new program they had not accounted for earlier. It is called the
National Low Emission Vehicles Program, which in 2002 will place
new pollution-control devices on the nation's vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The recalculation showed that taking credit for the low-emission
vehicle program would allow the area's transportation plan to
conform, just barely, with federal clean-air requirements.
</P>
<P>
   That meant that reformulated gasoline was not necessary for the
transportation plan. But for the much larger issue of how the area
will respond to its past air-pollution violations, the effect of
low-emission vehicles falls far short, federal officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would not be adequate to address the recent ozone
violations,'' Leidwanger said. ``It does nothing to address the
recent ozone violations and the requirement to implement a major
control strategy now.''
</P>
<P>
   Warm, of the regional council, explained that his staff wanted
to add the national low-emission vehicle program to the plan as
insurance. The oil industry has filed a federal lawsuit to block
reformulated gasoline from coming to Kansas City. If the oil
industry succeeds in its lawsuit, the region needs the low-emission
program to ensure that the transportation plan passes muster and
keep regional highway projects from being threatened again.
</P>
<P>
   This summer the Federal Highway Administration ruled that the
area's transportation plans did not conform to federal rules. The
plans relied on reformulated gasoline, but the governors of
Missouri and Kansas had not made an official request to bring the
new fuel here.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were just amending the transportation plan for insurance,''
Warm said.
</P>
<P>
   In this summer's highway crisis, highway officials told Missouri
and Kansas officials that the governors had to request the fuel by
July 28 if they wanted to avoid any delays in area highway
projects. So the governors sent letters to EPA Administrator Carol
Browner, requesting to opt into the federal reformulated-gasoline
program.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas Gov. Bill Graves has expressed frustration about being
forced to opt into the program. His spokesman, Mike Matson, has
said the governor would have preferred an alternative, such as the
national low-emission vehicle program.
</P>
<P>
   Warm explained that the program was never an option for solving
the short-term highway crisis. It would have taken months to obtain
federal permission to take credit for the low-emission vehicle
program. At the time, only days remained before the July 28
deadline.

SPORTS COLUMN: FOR THREE RANKED TEAMS, A COSTLY WEEKEND 
</HEADLINE>
 (rk) 
 By JOE DRAPE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Football in the summertime plays
something like this: 31 turnovers, five blocked kicks and as many
as seven missed place kicks. Those were the combined totals of the
10 teams, six of them ranked, that played this weekend, long before
the arrival of the crisp autumn afternoons that are synonymous with
the college game.
</P>
<P>
   The players and coaches of Arizona, Ohio State and Texas
probably wish they had waited for the chill of fall air. They were
the most flagrant offenders of these self-inflicted casualties and
will pay for it when the polls are released and their rankings
plummet.
</P>
<P>
   For Arizona and Ohio State, respectively ranked No. 4 and 9 in
The Associated Press preseason poll of writers and broadcasters,
the long-term repercussions of their losses are far more
devastating. Both had national title aspirations; now both must win
their 11 remaining games and watch the scoreboard week after week,
hoping for upsets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know today how Dick Tomey felt yesterday,'' Ohio State's
John Cooper said, referring to the Arizona coach. Cooper's Buckeyes
lost Sunday, 23-12, to Miami in the Kickoff Classic at Giants
Stadium, done in by four fumbles, a missed field goal and a missed
extra point. Toomey's Arizona Wildcats lost Saturday, 41-7, in the
Pigskin Classic at Penn State.
</P>
<P>
   The risks coaches talk about in opening early against dangerous
opponents showed themselves in this game and throughout this
college football weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Summer practices are geared toward conditioning and teaching new
players the complicated wrinkles of offensive and defensive
schemes. The teaching comes at the expense of concentrated,
full-speed hitting and scrimmaging.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State, Arizona and Texas, No. 17 in the preseason poll,
looked ill-prepared to bang all-out against equally pumped-up
opponents before more than 70,000 fans. It showed most clearly on
special teams, where new players and backups are expected to
execute precise snaps, kicks and coverages.
</P>
<P>
   Very few of the teams did so over the weekend.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Andy Crosland of Miami and Dan Stultz of Ohio State missed three
of five field goal attempts Sunday. On Saturday, Notre Dame
deflated Kansas by blocking a second-half field-goal attempt that
could have cut its lead to 20-16. Instead, the 18th-ranked Fighting
Irish drove 34 yards for a touchdown and went on to a 48-13 rout.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's loss started to get out of hand because of
special-teams errors. Arizona had answered Penn State's opening
touchdown with a 63-yard drive, but Mike McDonald missed a 40-yard
field goal attempt _ the first of two misses for the day. In the
second quarter, the Nittany Lions blocked a punt that led to a
touchdown and put them up, 24-0. It was an awful item on a laundry
list of mistakes, but it pretty much told Tomey what he was in for
the rest of the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were very poor in the kicking game,'' he lamented. ``We
were a poor tackling team. They outhit us. They were tougher, more
physical. Everything that is good in football and you want to be,
they were better at.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas blew its game against unranked North Carolina State in the
final three and a half minutes when the Wolfpack's Terrence Holt
blocked a punt and Eric Leak returned the ball 48 yards for a
touchdown and a 23-20 victory. It was Holt's second block of the
night and North Carolina State's third. Leak batted one that was
recovered for a safety.
</P>
<P>
   Miami Coach Butch Davis had special teams and turnovers in mind
when, after his No. 12 Hurricanes upset the Buckeyes in a victory
for his resurrected program, he grimaced about his team's two
missed field goals and four turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't play better next week than we did today, this will
be a short-lived happiness,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   This opening weekend was not a total loss for highlights. The
Hurricanes' Santana Moss caught three passes for 115 yards,
including a spectacular 67-yard touchdown to end the first half.
Two other wide receivers headlined the trailers for what shapes up
to be another topsy-turvy season.
</P>
<P>
   Florida State's Peter Warrick ran for 41 yards and a touchdown
and caught nine passes for 121 yards in the top-ranked Seminoles'
41-7 victory over Louisiana Tech. Penn State's Chafie Fields ran
three reverses for 110 yards and a touchdown and caught three
passes for 76 yards and another score.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, last weekend was mainly a stumbling, bumbling affair
played in the heat of summer. But a couple of things did occur that
were predictable. Penn State coach Joe Paterno warned the faithful
not to be too ebullient about the team's dominating performance
against a top five team.
</P>
<P>
   The Nittany Lions play a tough Akron team next, he reminded
them.
</P>
<P>
   And on the airwaves and in the press boxes, the first argument
has been passionately engaged. The compound question is urgent and
divisive: was Penn State's 41-7 victory more impressive than
Florida State's 41-7 victory? Should the Nittany Lions replace the
Seminoles as No. 1?
</P>
<P>
   It may have been welcomed in with lemonade rather than with hot
buttered rum, but make no mistake _ college football 1999 is upon
us.

MISSOURI LEGISLATURE BRACES FOR POLITICAL SHOWDOWN OVER ABORTION
BILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL SENTELL  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. _ Missouri veto sessions are usually obscure
legislative get-togethers that barely cause a ripple.
</P>
<P>
   Not this year.
</P>
<P>
   The legislature's seemingly endless debate over abortion has
turned this year's meeting into the biggest political showdown in
years and could help shape next year's U.S. Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   Abortion foes have launched a campaign to override Missouri Gov.
Mel Carnahan's veto of an anti-abortion bill.
</P>
<P>
   Backers of the bill have taken the unusual step of running radio
and newspaper ads before a veto session. They are buying billboard
ads in districts of some wavering lawmakers. And they hope to
attract people from throughout the state for a rally when the
session starts Sept. 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a fight,'' said Rep. Connie Cierpiot, an
Independence Republican who is working to override the veto.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Carnahan is meeting regularly with lawmakers to stave
off the override of a bill he considers dangerous. An override by a
Democrat-controlled legislature also would be embarrassing to
Carnahan, a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The veto is the governor's No. 1 priority,'' said Jerry
Nachtigal, Carnahan's press secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Abortion-rights groups in Missouri, with financial and other aid
from their national affiliates, plan their own campaign to convince
the public that the bill is intrusive. They say it could be the
legal vehicle for a higher court ruling that eventually might
topple the 1973 ruling that legalized abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   Top officials of the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights
Action League met with Carnahan last week to discuss battle plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as we are concerned, this is one of the biggest
political battles we are facing right now,'' said Gloria Totten,
the league's political director.
</P>
<P>
   Backers and opponents of the override also are considering TV
ads, another unusual development. Both camps may spend hundreds of
thousands of dollars in the fight over a two-page bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two sides have dug their trenches,'' said Ken Warren, a
professor of political science at the University of Missouri-St.
Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Veto sessions are held so that lawmakers can consider whether to
override vetoes that are made since adjournment in May. Only six
vetoes have been overridden in state history, and the gatherings
usually amount to little more than minilegislative reunions. They
are limited to 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   Override attempts also are possible on an anti-crime measure and
on a bill that would make safety helmets optional for motorcycle
riders 21 and older.
</P>
<P>
   The bill in dispute would criminalize a late-term abortion
procedure, which critics call a ``partial birth'' abortion, by
classifying it as infanticide. It passed the House 127-29 and the
Senate 27-6.
</P>
<P>
   Backers said the bill would outlaw a barbarous procedure that
was never medically necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan said he vetoed the measure because it was a deceptive
attempt to outlaw most abortions, including those in the first
trimester.
</P>
<P>
   The governor also says that the bill would allow people to use
violence to stop the procedure. Carnahan hopes that point will
cause some lawmakers who backed the bill in May to change sides in
September.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's claim has triggered political and legal
arguments. Even state prosecutors disagree on whether his concerns
are justified.
</P>
<P>
   Anyoverride requires two-thirds majorities in both chambers,
which is 23 in the Senate and 109 in the House. A Senate bid to
override a similar veto two years ago failed by one vote. This
year's outcome is considered too close to call.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas passed a bill in 1998 that backers said would ban
``partial birth'' abortions, but there was confusion over the
measure, and backers said they would rewrite it. State officials
said this year that abortions supposedly banned by the 1998 law
were being performed.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-six other states have passed laws to ban the procedure,
but they have been tied up in courts or struck down in 19 states.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides in the latest Missouri debate say their opponents are
resorting to lies.
</P>
<P>
   Some backers of the bill say Carnahan is trying to entice
lawmakers to his side by offering state jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Cierpiot noted that Missouri's term-limit law was forcing many
legislators to leave office soon. Some of those legislators who
need a job ``would look for a position in exchange for a vote to
sustain his veto,'' Cierpiot said.
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan heatedly denied that he had made any such offers. Aides
have said that any such accusations should be backed up by
specifics. Cierpiot said she did not have firsthand knowledge of
any job offers.
</P>
<P>
   Roy Temple, executive director of the state Democratic party,
said those and other charges by the Independence Republican ``cross
way over the line of reasonable political debate.''
</P>
<P>
   Backers of the bill are just as infuriated by Carnahan's claim
that the legislation could allow anti-abortion zealots to literally
get away with murder.
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan said the bill would allow those who thought the bill
was being violated to use ``lethal acts'' against doctors, nurses
and mothers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not trying to frighten people,'' he said. ``We are
telling people the truth about this bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Backers of the bill said the governor's argument was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the scare tactics are appalling,'' said state
Republican Party Chairwoman Ann Wagner.
</P>
<P>
   The debate is especially sensitive because it comes on the eve
of next year's Senate showdown involving Carnahan and Republican
Sen. John Ashcroft. Abortion is one of the key differences between
the two contenders.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Carnahan's veto prevails, Ashcroft is expected to use
the issue to try to paint the governor as an abortion-rights
extremist.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft's office says Carnahan's veto shows he is out of step
with the majority of Missourians.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is carrying water for the national abortion lobbies,'' said
Steve Hilton, Ashcroft's spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Temple labeled Hilton's comments ``an absurdity.''
</P>
<P>
   Warren said that while polls showed a majority of Missourians
favored abortion rights, the governor could face political fallout
if he was perceived as opposing the ban on a procedure that even
many abortion rights supporters considered abhorrent. _ The Kansas

STRYCULA'S HOLDING ON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Holders are quarterbacks. Holders are backup
quarterbacks. Sometimes, they're punters. Or receivers. But holders
are never starting safeties ... except at UCLA, where good-hands
man Joey Strycula roams a suspension-depleted secondary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is probably unusual,'' Bruins coach Bob Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   A former walk-on from Covina, Strycula took a peculiar path to
playing time. He was kicker Chris Sailer's roommate in 1996, when
Sailer needed a holder and Strycula needed a way to contribute.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never came here expecting to be the holder,'' he said. ``But
Chris asked me about it and I figured, `Why not?' It was a way to
get on the travel squad.''
</P>
<P>
   Strycula also played 25 snaps as a reserve safety in 1997 and a
few last year. He was a regular on the kickoff and punt coverage
last year and earned a scholarship after the season. When the
Bruins broke spring practice, Strycula was listed as the No. 2 free
safety behind Ryan Roques.
</P>
<P>
   Then the disabled-parking suspensions claimed Roques for two
games and cornerback Marques Anderson for the season; Strycula was
the starting free safety before the first play of training camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured that suspensions or not, I'd have a chance to
compete for the starting job,'' Strycula said. ``The suspensions
kind of sped up the process.''
</P>
<P>
   Quick return: Freshman defensive tackle Rodney Leisle probably
will redshirt this season, which means he'll play on the dreaded
scout team. It won't be worse than rehabilitating a broken foot
suffered in a summer all-star game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was going to do anything to get off that exercise bike,'' he
said. ``That thing was awful. I rode 21 miles a day.''
</P>
<P>
   Leisle was expected to miss training camp. Instead, he missed a
couple of days.
</P>
<P>
   Sibling teamwork?: Cornerback Lovell Houston's brother, Marcus,
is one of the nation's top tailback recruits. UCLA, Notre Dame,
Florida State, Michigan, Colorado and Texas are on his short list.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's considering UCLA with heavy thought,'' Houston said.

MICKELSON MAKES WOODS FIGHT FOR HIS LATEST VICTORY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio)   (jw) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   AKRON, Ohio _ Victories are rarely easy in professional golf,
not with so many good players, not with so much pressure on Sunday.
Ask Tiger Woods, who started Sunday with a five-stroke lead, then
birdied the first hole to go ahead by six strokes. At that point
Woods' lead looked more comfortable than grandpa's favorite rocking
chair. But to Phil Mickelson, it was a signal to get busy.
</P>
<P>
   With one hole left in his brilliant round Sunday, Mickelson tied
Woods during a pressure-packed final round battle at the World Golf
Championships NEC Invitational.
</P>
<P>
   But a crucial bogey by Mickelson on No. 18, followed by a huge
16-foot birdie putt by Woods on No. 17, made the difference.
Shooting a final-round 71, just enough to offset Mickelson's 65,
Woods left Firestone Country Club with a one-stroke victory and the
hefty winner's check of $1 million. Woods finished at 10-under par
for the tournament (270), one stroke ahead of Mickelson (271), and
five strokes ahead of Nick Price and Craig Parry, who tied for
third place at 5-under par.
</P>
<P>
   It was the fifth PGA Tour victory for Woods this year, and his
sixth victory worldwide, continuing his most torrid five-month
stretch since turning professional three years ago. Woods is a
better player than he was two years ago, with better mechanics and
more experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winning never gets old,'' said Woods, who captured his 12th
career victory on the PGA Tour, against an elite 41-man field that
featured the top 10 players in the world ranking. ``This week, we
had some of the best players assembled, and it gives you even more
satisfaction to beat the best.''
</P>
<P>
   With the victory, Woods reached a number of milestones,
including:
</P>
<P>
   _ At 23 years, 8 months, 30 days, Woods became the youngest
player to win five times on tour during a single season since Jack
Nicklaus won five times during the 1963 season at exactly the same
age to the day.
</P>
<P>
   _ Woods is the first five-time winner on tour since Nick Price
won five times in 1994. Woods' other victories were the Buick
Invitational, the Memorial Tournament, the Motorola Western Open
and the PGA Championship.
</P>
<P>
   _ Woods leads the tour's 1999 money list with more than $4.26
million and became the first player to surpass $4 million in a
single year.
</P>
<P>
   _ Woods won for the ninth consecutive time when he either held
or shared the lead after 54 holes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Including his victory at the Deutsche Bank Open in Germany,
Woods has won five times in his last eight starts.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't the decisive victory that Woods had hoped for when the
day began, but in a way, that made it more satisfying. He weathered
another back-nine challenge, he earned a victory at one of the
world's most respected golf courses and he virtually assured
himself of winning the tour's player of the year award, if he had
not done that already.
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson made the day exciting, continuing his brilliant play
at Firestone, where he won in 1996 and where he has finished second
each of the last three years. Starting the day seven strokes behind
Woods, Mickelson had no choice but to play aggressively.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pleased I put myself in contention, disappointed with the
way I finished up,'' Mickelson said. ``I need to get a little
tougher on the last few holes. I'm disappointed with the way I've
finished tournaments this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing four groups in front of Woods, Mickelson made his
intentions known early, making birdies on five of the first seven
holes and shooting a five-under-par 30 on the back nine. But the
final two holes were decisive for both players. Mickelson birdied
the par-4 17th, tying Woods at 10 under.
</P>
<P>
   But on the par-4, 424-yard finishing hole, Mickelson got himself
in trouble with a poor tee shot that drifted into the left rough
into a difficult lie. And his second shot was even worse, clipping
a tree that knocked the ball down after it had traveled only about
50 yards. That left Mickelson with a difficult 4-iron third shot
that went into the left rough, about 25 feet from the cup.
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson, who has one of the world's best short games, almost
saved par with a deftly played chip, but the ball just rolled past
the cup as the gallery moaned. Mickelson made the five-foot putt
coming back for par, and he went into the scorer's tent at nine
under par, one stroke behind.
</P>
<P>
   That left the outcome up to Woods, and he delivered with his
crucial 16-foot birdie putt at No. 17 that gave him a two-stroke
lead heading to the difficult final hole. When the putt fell, Woods
gave four quick pumps of his fist as the gallery roared. It was the
kind of putt that champions make, reminiscent of the six-foot putt
to save par at No. 17 during the final round of last month's PGA
Championship.
</P>
<P>
   Woods still made things interesting at No. 18, hitting a poor
2-iron tee shot into the right rough. His next shot was a 7-iron
that landed about 20 yards short of the green, but he hit a poor
chip shot on his next shot that barely made the green, still 45
feet from the cup. The next putt was crucial, because a three-putt
would have meant a double-bogey and a playoff with Mickelson. But
from 45 feet, Woods hit an excellent lag putt that stopped
three-feet from the hole, and when he made the next putt for bogey,
another victory was his.  &QL;

MIAMI LOOKS LIKE ANCESTORS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Ohio State doesn't have much trouble
with the other 25 letters of the alphabet. But when the Buckeyes
face teams that start with ``M,'' they seem to forget their A-B-Cs.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, Miami joined the ``M'' list. The ninth-ranked
Buckeyes played as if the Hurricanes were Michigan or Michigan
State. Miami controlled the last three quarters and limited Ohio
State to one touchdown in a 23-12 Kickoff Classic victory.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, Ohio State coach John Cooper sounded a lot like
Arizona coach Dick Tomey after Saturday's Pigskin Classic loss to
Penn State.
</P>
<P>
   ``You name it, we need to work on it,'' he said. ``We need to
tackle and block better; we weren't very good in the kicking game.
We just need a lot of work.''
</P>
<P>
   The Buckeyes have a lot of holes to fill. Miami, though, appears
to have the types of game-breaking skill players who made the
Hurricanes a national power in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really good; we're very good,'' said sophomore
quarterback Kenny Kelly, who balanced three turnovers with 245
yards passing and a game-turning touchdown pass. ``But for us to be
in the same league as the Miami teams of the past, we have to
finish 13-0. If we do that, I'll tell you we're back.''
</P>
<P>
   Miami scored first when running back James Jackson _ who before
the season proclaimed Miami was the best team in the country _
scored on a 44-yard run. Trailing 9-7, Kelly gave the Hurricanes
the lead with a seven-yard run 3:14 before halftime. Then, with
eight seconds remaining, Kelly hit Santana Moss with a 67-yard
touchdown pass for a 23-9 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called timeout, and that gave them the chance to make that
play,'' Cooper said. ``They made the big plays, and we didn't. That
play was the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly's pass was short and Moss broke back for it, beating Ohio
State cornerback Nate Clements, then racing the final 20 yards
untouched.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kenny told me thanks for coming back for the ball,'' Moss
said. ``I just told him thanks for throwing it to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State got a Dan Stultz field goal late in the third
quarter, but the Buckeyes never threatened. Miami had a 79-yard,
16-play game-clinching drive in the fourth quarter that resulted in
Andy Crosland's second missed field-goal attempt. Thirteen of the
plays on the drive were runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't have that drive, it's a different game,'' Miami
senior guard Richard Mercier said. \Ntagtop:Wendell Barnhouse,
(817) 390-7238 \Ntagbottom:wbhoops\Nstar-telegram.com
Quick hits Miami sophomore quarterback Kenny Kelly was named the
game's most valuable player. ... Miami has won 123 of its past 124
games when leading going into the fourth quarter. ... The loss was
the Buckeyes' first in a season opener since 1986, when they lost
to Alabama in the Kickoff Classic. It was the first season-opening
loss for Ohio State under John Cooper in the past 11 seasons. ...
The third quarter produced three points, four penalties and three
turnovers in an eight-play span. ... Ohio State played without
starting linebackers Chris Kirk and Courtland Bullard. Kirk is
academically ineligible, and Bullard was suspended for breaking an
unspecified team rule. ... Ohio State sold nearly 21,000 tickets
for the game; Miami sold about 7,500 tickets. ... Each team was
guaranteed $650,000 (or 30 percent of the gross receipts) for
participating in the game. Other profits go to the National
Association of Collegiate Athletic Directors.

HURRICANES LOADED, IF NOT JUST RELOADING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Most programs rebuild. The best programs
reload. Miami used to be on the short list of the latter.
</P>
<P>
   But, thanks to NCAA probation in 1995 that included crippling
scholarship limitations, the Hurricanes' rebuilding process was
different from most. The legacy that started in 1983 with the first
of four national championships dictated that the winning continue
even though the NCAA sheriffs had slapped the 'Canes in handcuffs.
</P>
<P>
   No. 12 Miami's grind-it-out 23-12 victory against No. 9 Ohio
State in the Kickoff Classic yesterday does not prove the theory
that Miami Is Back. One game, as Ohio State coach John Cooper
hopes, does not make or break a season. But the Hurricanes proved
they are one of the nation's better teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's changed things here a lot and all for the better,'' Miami
senior kicker/punter Andy Crosland of Dallas Highland Park said of
head coach Butch Davis. ``He's changed the whole image, on and off
the field. It took a while, and we struggled, but now we're back.
Miami is going to start to dominate again. If not this year, then
in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   The immediate future brings two more Big Games. Penn State
visits Miami on Sept. 18. The weekend's results here and in State
College, Pa., where the Nittany Lions buried Arizona, 41-7,
Saturday, indicate that game could be interesting. And on Oct. 9,
the Hurricanes play at bitter rival Florida State.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not worrying about showing anybody anything; we're just
playing hard football,'' said wide receiver Santana Moss, who had
three catches for 115 yards and a touchdown. ``Whatever people
think of us, oh well. Some people might be impressed by this game.
It's '99, and it's time to shine.''
</P>
<P>
   What Davis found out yesterday is that his team has a
quarterback and running backs who are more than capable of
replacing the players who filled those positions last year. Kenny
Kelly for Scott Covington and James Jackson/Najeh Davenport for
Edgerrin James at running back appear to be even deals.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly, a sophomore making his first start, was impressive. He
completed 17 of 22 passes (including 10 consecutive completions)
for 245 yards and a touchdown. Off a slick play fake, he also ran
for the touchdown that gave the Hurricanes the lead for good.
Jackson scored Miami's first touchdown on a 44-yard dash and had
another touchdown called back by penalty. He gained 89 yards on 24
carries; Davenport gained 81 yards in 13 carries.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, the former Dallas Cowboys assistant, is in his fifth
season in Miami. When Davis took over, the Hurricanes' talent level
slipped because of scholarship limitations. The NCAA maximum number
of scholarships per year is 25. In 1995, 1996 and 1997 Davis signed
18, 12 and 14 players. There are just 14 seniors on this roster,
which has a full boat of 85 on scholarship. Of those, 56 are
freshmen, redshirt freshmen or sophomores.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're starting the second year out from under all of the
sanctions and the probations,'' said Davis, a typically cautious
football coach. ``It's going to take another year or two.''
</P>
<P>
   These are not the Hurricanes of Jimmy Johnson and Dennis
Erickson. No military fatigues. No on-field showboating. No
drug-test coverups and few off-field scandals. What is similar is
that Miami has talent and speed. Now, the 'Canes just play hard. In
fact, the players wear T-shirts that say NCO _ New 'Canes Order.
They're confident, not cocky. They don't strut.
</P>
<P>
   That's what Davis wants.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the captain of this ship,'' said fifth-year senior guard
Richard Mercier. ``But the whole crew has to be on board and rowing
in the same direction. It's been a slow, grueling, sometimes
heartaching process. In the five years here, the victories that
stand out are the Ohio State game and last year's UCLA game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, it's payday. Payday.'' / nn

MIAMI'S TEAM SPEED DOES NOT ALLOW OHIO STATE TO CATCH UP 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ So much for Ohio State's march toward an
undefeated season and a possible national championship. The Miami
Hurricanes closed the book on those dreams Sunday afternoon with a
23-12 victory in the Kickoff Classic at Giants Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Hurricanes, No. 12 in the Associated Press poll, and the No.
9 Buckeyes both entered this game with grand ideas of what the
season held. Miami left with its plans intact, and with one of its
biggest victories since it was put on probation in 1995 and began a
long climb back to the top ranks of college football.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State will have to go back to the drawing board and find a
way to eliminate mistakes, turnovers and a lack of execution around
the goal line.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a lot of work,'' Ohio State coach John Cooper said.
``We've got a long way to go before we can have the type of
football team we're accustomed to having at Ohio State.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper cited poor tackling, poor pass protection, poor execution
in the running game and ineffectiveness in the kicking game. Ohio
State's first four trips inside the Hurricanes' 20-yard line
produced one touchdown, two field goals and a missed field goal. On
an afternoon when both teams were committing mistakes in bushels,
those missed opportunities for more touchdowns haunted the
Buckeyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't play better, we're not going to beat UCLA,''
Cooper said, speaking of the Buckeyes' next opponent. ``The good
thing is we have two weeks to prepare for UCLA.''
</P>
<P>
   Miami's young quarterback, Kenny Kelly, who made his first start
before a crowd of 73,037, was able to shake his opening-game
jitters and overcome his mistakes _ four turnovers _ with some big
plays in crucial situations. He completed 17 of 25 passes for 245
yards, with two interceptions and a touchdown pass, and rushed for
a touchdown on a beautifully executed bootleg.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State rotated between two young quarterbacks, Austin
Moherman and Steve Bellisari. Moherman seemed to get settled in
during the first quarter, but his rhythm was broken after he was
replaced by Bellisari in the second period.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor was Miami's team speed. Safety Al Blades chased
down Buckeyes running back Michael Wiley after a 69-yard gain and
tackled him at the 10-yard line. Ohio State had to settle for a
field goal. On offense, Hurricanes receiver Santana Moss made an
adjustment on an underthrown pass near the end of the first half,
caught the ball and outran the entire Ohio State secondary for a
67-yard touchdown play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those guys were fast in spots,'' Moss said of the Buckeyes.
``We're an explosive team with speed everywhere, linebackers,
offensive linemen, defensive backs, running backs, receivers. We
killed them with a whole team chemistry of speed.''
</P>
<P>
   That was one thing that pleased Miami coach Butch Davis. Some
others: his young quarterback had held his poise and come out fine
against a big-time, Big Ten defense in a nationally televised game.
His lead running back, James Jackson, had rushed for 102 yards and
the backup, Najeh Davenport, had picked up 83 yards. His defense,
under the new defensive coordinator, Greg Schiano, had shut down
Ohio State's vaunted rushing attack, holding Wiley to 81 yards on
nine carries _ even though Wiley picked up 69 yards on the one run.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami defense also kept Moherman and Bellisari in check.
Moherman was sacked three times and threw two interceptions against
one touchdown pass, and Bellisari was 1 for 1 for minus-3 yards
passing, fumbled a snap and had two carries for minus-11 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly, who plays in the Tampa Bay Devil Rays' minor-league
system, threw two interceptions and twice lost fumbles after being
hit from the blind side. But he managed to shake off the mistakes
long enough to come up with some crucial plays when the Hurricanes
needed them.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a great learning experience for Kenny Kelly,'' Davis
said. ``There's no substitute for going out and playing. I think he
learned more today than he did in his previous two years at
Miami.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper and Davis agreed that the key play was the touchdown pass
to Moss. Holding a 15-9 lead and with a first down at the
Hurricanes' 33-yard line, Kelly fired a deep pass. The wind caught
it and it hung in the air. After running past the Ohio State safety
and cornerback on the right side of the field, Moss came back for
the ball and caught it. The rest was a blur, as he cut up field and
ran into the end zone. With eight seconds to play in the half, the
Hurricanes had a 23-9 lead and Ohio State was sunk.
</P>
<P>
   Miami came out in the second half and made an adjustment,
running right at the Buckeyes' defense, which was one of the
toughest against the run last year. But the Buckeyes were missing
two starting linebackers for this game: Chris Kirk, who was
academically ineligible, and Courtland Bullard, who was suspended
for one game for violating team rules.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth quarter the Hurricanes had a Buckeye-like 17-play,
79-yard drive that consumed 7 minutes 39 seconds and sapped Ohio
State's energy. They missed a field goal at the end of the drive,
but it did not matter. Ohio State was out of the game by then.

view of the world of professional sex in Manhattan.''
</P>
<P>
   The publisher of a Salon online competitor, Scott Moore of
Slate, criticized Salon for publishing a fictional piece without
clearly labeling it as such, although there is a small headline
alongside each article that leads to an explanation that the
account is fictional.
</P>
<P>
   Talbot defended the column as ``clearly fictional,'' noting the
icon explanation and adding: ``From the overall tone and the
characters, you can see the piece is clearly fictionalized.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Quan said the column, since it is based closely on her
experiences, describes prostitution more truthfully than most
nonfiction accounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I was some journalist who posed as a prostitute for six
months, it wouldn't be as realistic,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Quan said she became a prostitute after running away from
home at age 16 and that she took up writing several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Quan, who said she is in her 30s, has worked as a prostitute
for 10 years, but has taken time off to concentrate on the column.
She said she had no intentions of giving up her night job forever.
She says she works alone, by appointment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm on sabbatical right now, but it will be very easy for me
to get started again,'' Ms. Quan said. ``I still have what it
takes.''

   AN INTERNAL TIMES MEMO TURNS INTO A NEWS ITEM &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was never true. It was never published. But a slip-up in a
New York Times internal memo became news last week, as two media
outlets blithely repeated information without checking it.
</P>
<P>
   It began on Wednesday when The Times' preliminary noon news
budget, which lists stories that are being pursued for the
following day's editions, mistakenly said that Ted Turner's face
would appear on a large clock to be built on a new Atlanta stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Around 2 p.m., that list was wired to hundreds of newspaper
clients of The New York Times Syndicate.
</P>
<P>
   No more than two hours later, the clock-face-that-wasn't had
been published as fact in The Drudge Report, the gossipy Web site
run by Matt Drudge, who said in an interview Friday that ``I have
access to all your internals.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the bogus clock-face report was reprinted as fact,
without direct attribution, in The New York Post's gossip column,
Page Six.
</P>
<P>
   A Post spokesman, Pat Smith, said that the Page Six editor got
the news from a paper copy of the Drudge Report dropped on her
desk. ``It was a relatively minor gossip item,'' he said of what
appeared on Page Six.
</P>
<P>
   Drudge's defense for reporting the contents of preliminary
internal memos from newspapers is simple. ``My theory is that if
things are moving out on wire services, it's pretty much public
information. The future is all wires. Once something is literally
typed and sent out over any network, it's going to be hard to hold
any of it back.''
</P>
<P>
   For The Times' national editor, Dean Baquet, the spread of
unchecked, unpublished reports ``is going to be one of the most
difficult issues for the news media in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
   ``No longer is something a story when you have it and when you
make the decision what to publish,'' he added, ``We're at the point
now where those early steps in the process of putting together a
newspaper become news.'' People, he said, ``get to watch the
development of stories in the most raw form, including silly
mistakes.''

   _ FELICITY BARRINGER
</P>
<P>
   MODERATOR IS NAMED FOR PBS POLITICAL SHOW
</P>
<P>
   The first time Gwen Ifill was offered one of PBS' plum jobs _ as
moderator of ``Washington Week in Review'' _ she turned it down.
That was in February, when WETA, the public television station in
Washington that produces the program, was ousting Ken Bode, the
program's longtime moderator, and a friend of Ms. Ifill's. The
decision not to renew Bode's contract caused a stir, with some
fearing that ``Review'' would become like the commercial networks'
screaming-head political shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't like the way they handled that, and I didn't like
what they were doing with the show at the time,'' Ms. Ifill, chief
congressional and political correspondent for NBC News, said 10
days ago, just before leaving on vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Times have changed. WETA and MacNeil/Lehrer Productions are
expected to announce this week that Ms. Ifill will take on two new
PBS jobs _ as moderator of ``Washington Week in Review,'' and as a
senior correspondent for ``The News Hour with Jim Lehrer,'' the
weeknight news-analysis program.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ifill, who was a correspondent for The New York Times before
joining NBC News in 1994, said ``The News Hour'' and NBC News had
worked out an amicable arrangement to let Ms. Ifill out of her
recently signed NBC contract to join PBS. She will continue to
appear on NBC News from time to time as a commentator and will be
identified on the air as a PBS correspondent.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ifill said she was confident that the producers at WETA were
not going to push ``Washington Week in Review'' to become like the
other talk shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm part terrified, part excited,'' said Ms. Ifill, ``as you
always are when you try something new.''

   Here are Anne Stephenson's capsule book reviews:
</P>
<P>
   ``Isaac's Storm''By Erik Larson (Crown, $25) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was the turn of the century, a blustery time in an America
full of national pride and technical confidence. ``In this new
age,'' Larson writes, ``nature itself seemed no great obstacle.''
Then came tragedy in Galveston, Texas. On Sept. 8, 1900, the worst
hurricane ever to target America roared ashore from the Gulf of
Mexico, killing 8,000 men, women and children. The storm is still
the deadliest natural disaster in American history. Larson builds
his story around Isaac Monroe Cline, the chief meteorologist in
Galveston and the one man who might have saved the city. But
America's inflated self-image and rivalries among meteorologists
combined to downplay the storm's strength until it was too late
(Cuba's meteorologists, who had pioneered the art of hurricane
prediction, correctly judged the storm's scale and path, but their
warnings were ignored by the U.S Weather Bureau, which, Larson
says, ``wanted hurricanes all to itself''). Larson creates tension,
suspense and an ominous sense of impending tragedy as he follows
Cline through the days before the storm and then its ghastly
aftermath. The weatherman, who had thought of his own house as a
fortress, watched as water rose around it, first to his waist and
then to his neck, with tiny toads taking refuge on anything that
protruded above the surface. By the time the storm was over, Cline,
like thousands in Galveston, had lost someone he loved. ``This is
the story of Isaac and his time in America,'' Larson writes, ``the
last turning of the centuries, when the hubris of men led them to
believe they could disregard even nature itself.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
``The Last Survivor: In Search of Martin Zaidenstadt'' &QL; 
By Timothy W. Ryback (Pantheon, $21) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There are jarring moments in this book when Ryback quietly
reminds us that Dachau today is a charming and prosperous community
in the rolling hills of Germany, that it has citizens and shops and
a downtown, that it is picturesque. But who can think of Dachau
without imagining its ghosts? In 1992, editors at ``The New
Yorker'' asked Ryback to write a report on the town and its people,
who, as Ryback notes, live in the shadow of the notorious
concentration camp and ``have DACHAU stamped on their birth
certificates, carry DACHAU on their drivers' licenses and in their
passports, pay DACHAU electric bills, DACHAU water bills and DACHAU
gas bills.'' Ryback wrote his story and went on to other work, but
two months later found himself back in Dachau, driven to further
explore the moral issues that permeate the very air there. It was
at the camp in 1996 that he encountered Martin Zaidenstadt.
Zaidenstadt was 87, a former inmate of the camp who after his
liberation made his home in Dachau _ he married a German woman, had
three children and for years ``discarded'' his Jewish identity. Now
Zaidenstadt kept a daily vigil outside the camp's crematorium,
accosting visitors and tour guides and violating cordoned-off areas
to give impassioned demonstrations of how mass death was carried
out. To the people of Dachau, he was a tortured soul, a madman. To
Rybeck, he was an eyewitness urged on by moral righteousness,
astonishing memories, his own demons and the vanity of firsthand
knowledge. This look at Dachau is as thought-provoking as the old
man who became its living ghost, haunting the camp and haranguing
people with what he knows. ``Who's going to kick him out?'' Ryback
asks.``Who is going to tell him he can't go in there? Martin was
supposed to be gassed in that chamber, burned in that crematorium.
But the Nazis are gone, and the ovens are cold, and Martin is still
there. He has an historic claim like no one else in the world.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
``The Nest: An Artist's Sketchbook''By Maryjo Koch (ST&AMP;C, $35) &QL; 
The oversize format of this pretty book accounts for much of its
appeal, because Koch renders many birds, nests, eggs and feathers
in their actual size. This might not seem like such an endeavor,
but consider a peacock's feather, with the eyespot that Charles
Darwin called ``the most beautiful object in the world.'' Stretched
across two pages, it is 28 inches long and 10 inches high _ lazy,
lanky and delightful. Among the other pleasures are an array of
wrens and jay eggs, a tanager nest built inside a hornet's nest,
and an American robin's nest that incorporates, along with the
traditional mud and grass, a gum wrapper, a Q-tip, a cigarette
paper and a scrap of duct tape. Our favorite rendering: a selection
of impossibly tiny hummingbird nests, accompanied by words that
botanist Nehemiah Grew wrote in 1693: ``I saw one of these nests
made of cotton wool, in form and bigness of the thumb of a man's
glove, with the taper end downwards wherein were two eggs of the
bigness of a pea of oval form. Who can but admire to see the whole
body and all the parts of a bird folded up in an egg little bigger
than a pepper-corn?'' With a forward by Gretel Ehrlich. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``I Just Kept Hoping''By Gloria Stuart (Little, Brown, $24.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Quick, call Celine Dion so she can put us in the mood. Stuart
became famous when at age 87 she played the ancient-but-cute ``Old
Rose'' in James Cameron's film ``Titanic.'' We weren't sure we
wanted to read 306 pages about her, but we now admit that there are
some interesting moments, as when Stuart reveals that she is
addicted to expletives and quotes herself screaming obscenities _
really, really bad ones _ at Cameron and other members of the film
crew. But not to worry. Stuart is 89, so Cameron still loves her,
and her memoir can be called ``irreverent'' by the people who write
the jacket copy. We call it chatty, and would be willing to
overlook all the exclamation points if we could just get Celine to
hum a few bars. &QL;

INTERSTATE 35 CONSTRUCTION LEAVES SOME RESIDENTS, BUSINESSES
UPSET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT A. CRONKLETON  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Jerry Cicero looks at the partly completed
Antioch Road interchange in northern Johnson County, Kan., and sees
broken promises.
</P>
<P>
   City and state officials had pledged that most of the project
would be completed by July, providing a new interchange at Antioch
and Interstate 35.
</P>
<P>
   During construction, however, a pier for a bridge over the
Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railroad tracks shifted, delaying the
completion of that bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the work would be completed this fall, officials assured.
</P>
<P>
   Now Cicero has learned that under a worst-case scenario, delays
could stretch until late next spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew that they were going to build the bridge and there
would be anywhere from 14 to 18 months of interruption,'' said
Cicero, president of Cicero Graphic Resources of Overland Park,
Kan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We understood the importance and value of what they were
doing,'' he said, ``but that is still an inconvenience _ 18 months'
worth of inconvenience we knew going in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we are hearing it may be until next June (before they
finish). That will be 29 months of inconvenience.''
</P>
<P>
   Until then, his employees, customers and vendors must take a
three-mile round-trip detour to get to and from his company. When
you consider he employs 45 workers and has more than 30 customer
deliveries, that quickly adds up to about 225 miles a day people
are forced to go out of their way to get to his building.
</P>
<P>
   Cicero is not alone in his frustration. Other business owners
are getting irritated too.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did their best to disrupt our business as little as
possible,'' said commercial photographer Bruce Bandle of Amberlight
Photography in Merriam, Kan.. ``But I am really disappointed in the
problems that they are having.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is starting to become an inconvenience, and I am getting
tired of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Merriam and Kansas Department of Transportation officials said
they are doing their best to make sure the project is completed
this year, but they concede that an early winter could force them
to delay work until next spring.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, they point out that part of the $15.6 million
project is finished, allowing I-35 traffic to exit and go south on
Antioch.
</P>
<P>
   But traffic heading north on Antioch still faces detours because
work has stopped on the bridge over the railroad tracks, limiting
access to northern Overland Park and Merriam.
</P>
<P>
   When the project started in the spring of 1998, Merriam
officials readily acknowledged that there was not a good alternate
route for the 9,000 cars a day that used the Antioch bridge.
</P>
<P>
   On the main detour, which relies on Merriam Drive and Johnson
Drive, drivers face trains traveling through the area.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, work on Johnson Drive near the Merriam Town Center
last summer added to the frustrations.
</P>
<P>
   Because the work was not completed on time, the contractor,
APAC-Kansas Inc., faces a fine of $3,000 a day.
</P>
<P>
   Ruben Noguera, field engineering administrator for the
Transportation Department, said officials still were trying to
figure out why one of the two piers for the bridge over the
railroad tracks moved.
</P>
<P>
   While preliminary reports showed the bridge is stable and a
solution had been found, Merriam officials decided to hire a
consultant to get a second opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were concerned that this may happen again, so we wanted a
report to assure us that this wouldn't happen again and to see if
we needed any other necessary steps to prevent it from happening
again,'' said Shawn Gotfredson, city engineer for Merriam.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main concern we have is that we don't want to have the
same thing happen in Merriam that happened to 151st Street in
Olathe,'' he said. ``We want to make sure it is built right and we
do a good job.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently the Transportation Department discovered that it must
make $3 million in repairs to the 151st Street bridge over I-35 in
Olathe, Kan., after the bridge's abutments shifted. That work will
require the bridge to be closed for about four months next year.
</P>
<P>
   APAC-Kansas also built the 151st Street bridge. Officials,
however, said they had yet to determine who was responsible for the
problems with both bridges.
</P>
<P>
   Gotfredson said the city's consultant should issue a report this
week detailing what needs to be done to repair the Antioch bridge
problem. Work on the bridge should start again shortly thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope to get it done this fall,'' Gotfredson said. ``The
worst case is that it will be done in the spring.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, he expects calls from businesses and residents
in the area to continue.
</P>
<P>
   People will be asked to remain patient, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The bridge over the railroad tracks replaces a grade crossing
that tied up traffic headed north on Antioch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody wants that bridge done more than I do,'' Gotfredson
said. ``However, we want to get it done right.''

TWO FAMILIES SHARE BLOODY HISTORY OF EAST TIMOR
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By INDIRA A.R. LAKSHMANAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DILI, East Timor _ It is hard to imagine two families more
closely linked by tragedy, yet more widely divided by this island's
wrenching history, than the Pintos and the Monteiros.
</P>
<P>
   In a simple aluminum-sided home and a rickety shack just 10
minutes apart, the two clans live unaware of each other's existence
and unsympathetic to each other's cause, though they share the same
pain.
</P>
<P>
   Their stories mirror one another and the bloody fight over East
Timor. Both have lost nearly every male relative _ the latest
victims just days ago _ to the struggle over who should rule this
undeveloped territory the size of Connecticut on the eastern side
of the Indonesian island chain.
</P>
<P>
   To this day, the battle lines between the two sides remain
uncrossable, the schisms more permanent after the deaths of 200,000
people _ a quarter of the population _ in the civil war, starvation
and disease that ravaged East Timor from 1975 to 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds have perished in sporadic uprisings and massacres
since. Scores have been slain in the seven months since Indonesian
President B. J. Habibie said he would let East Timor choose between
autonomy within Indonesia and full independence.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Today &LR; , East Timor's 800,000 people will decide their future,
but most people have known exactly how they would vote for years,
even generations.
</P>
<P>
   For the Pintos, the thirst to join neighboring Indonesia has
been unquenchable as long as the oldest surviving family member can
remember. The Portuguese, the former colonial power, were so
callous and exploitative in the centuries they ruled East Timor
that a generation of Pinto men rose up against them in the 1950s to
fight for union with the new Indonesian republic.
</P>
<P>
   For the Monteiros, the answer to Portuguese oppression and
neglect was not another big brother, but to go it alone. A
generation of Monteiro men joined guerrillas who took to the hills
in 1975 to fight for an independent state. The more that Indonesian
forces battered them, the more fervent they became.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides are so polarized and the grievances so deep-seated
that it is hard to picture the victors and losers reconciling once
results are announced next week. No one here thinks that one day of
voting will wipe the slate clean.
</P>
<P>
   It is like that for the Pintos, a family of farmers and civil
servants who live in Kampung Alor, a middle-class community at the
edge of the capital. On Saturday, sisters of the dead emitted
ear-piercing wails as they buried two more victims of their
family's decades-long struggle to be part of Indonesia. The fresh
graves at Santa Cruz cemetery were just a few yards away, but a
world apart, from the memorials to two independence supporters
whose 1991 funeral ended in a police massacre of 200 unarmed
mourners.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was my husband's destiny. I don't blame anyone,'' said a
stoic Ermensiana Pires, clad in widow's weeds and staring ahead
blankly from underneath a black scarf. She said she believes in her
cause even more strongly after her husband's death.
</P>
<P>
   Pires's husband, Apolinario Pinto, 45, a farmer and former civil
servant, was dragged from his car and slaughtered Thursday along
with his cousin, Virgilio Martins Pinto, 46, a district official.
The two were beaten, slashed with swords and axes, stripped naked,
nearly decapitated, family members said. One arm, several fingers
and an ear were sawed off. The bodies were so mutilated that they
couldn't dress the corpses. The relatives believe the men were
victims of a mob seeking revenge against those who back the
pro-Indonesia cause.
</P>
<P>
   The two Pintos had a red-and-white Indonesian flag dangling from
their rear-view mirror and wore caps supporting autonomy. Earlier
on Thursday, they had rallied at a pro-autonomy march, and they
were headed home when their car was stoned at a bridge. Virgilio
Pinto's 13-year-old son, Francisco, fled when attackers shouted for
him to leave. Others yelled, ``Kill him, too!''
</P>
<P>
   Mourning quietly in the yard of their modest home, relatives
said neither man was a member of the brutal pro-Indonesia civilian
militias that for months have terrorized the majority of the
population that is believed to favor independence. They were just
two men who shared the ideals of their fathers.
</P>
<P>
   ``For over 450 years, Portugal colonized East Timor and didn't
do anything for East Timor people _ no schools, no roads, no
electricity, no phones,'' Armando Pinto, Virgilio's and
Apolinario's uncle, said bitterly. ``Only elites got education. The
first paved road I remember was the street in front of the
Governor's House in the 1950s.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They stole chickens, animals. They didn't want East Timorese
to become clever. They forced us to work farms and didn't pay
anything,'' he continued. His family turned to Indonesia as a
savior, because they heard from people in West Timor that life was
better in the newly independent and developing nation.
</P>
<P>
   The brothers took up swords, lances and stole guns from the
Portuguese, launching a failed revolt in July 1959. Virgilio's and
Apolinario's fathers were killed. Virgilio's mother later died of
grief. A third brother was captured in the uprising and sent to
Angola, then a Portuguese colony, where he died a prisoner. The
only surviving brother, Armando, now 60, was held prisoner for six
months.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Portuguese did nothing for us _ only stole, stole, stole.
They were fascists,'' spat out Alda Fernandes, 70, Armando's
sister, who became a young widow when her husband was killed in the
1959 uprising.
</P>
<P>
   When Indonesians took over two decades later, Armando said, they
``built schools, streets, hospitals. It was a gradual process.
Everything you see, they did for us.'' The family acknowledges that
the Indonesians rewarded them with high-paying civil service jobs.
</P>
<P>
   As for the 200,000 East Timorese who died following the 1975
Indonesian invasion and its aftermath, Paulo Sarmento Pinto, 40,
Apolinario's brother, blames it on fellow East Timorese.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was our own fault, because we made civil war and attacked
each other,'' said Paulo, a civil servant.
</P>
<P>
   Paulo's wife, Yulitta, 30, said autonomy within Indonesia is the
best choice, because it is a compromise between independence and
full integration with Indonesia. ``If we want independence, we'd
have to start from the beginning _ a new currency, everything.''
She also admits they are worried about reprisals against families
like theirs if independence wins.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have now, it took a long time to achieve,'' Paulo
Pinto said. ``Should we give this all up based on one day? That's
impossible. Maybe they'll have more votes (for independence), but
we don't have to surrender.''
</P>
<P>
   That is precisely what observers are afraid of. A secret
Indonesian military document leaked last month called on
pro-Jakarta militias to wage a scorched earth campaign and destroy
essential facilities if independence wins. Practically everyone
here fears civil war whichever way the vote goes.
</P>
<P>
   Less than 10 minutes from the Pintos' comfortable home is Bidau,
a shantytown in eastern Dili. Through a dirt courtyard that is home
to a lone chicken is the tin-roofed wooden shack of Helena
Monteiro. Her brother, Verissimo Dias Quintas, nearly 70, was
killed Thursday. He had allowed his home in Los Palos, 80 miles to
the east, to be used as a local office by independence supporters.
His son and wife are missing, the UN said.
</P>
<P>
   Monteiro, 54, a cook, could not stop weeping. ``I don't know who
killed him.'' An independence leader ``said it was the militias. I
believe it was Indonesian police. . . . I'm afraid to even go to
see the body,'' she cried.
</P>
<P>
   Monteiro's family history in many ways mirrors that of the
Pintos. Before independence, her brother, the local ``liurai,'' or
traditional chief, was a wealthy buffalo farmer and textile trader.
He lost everything after the Indonesian invasion, and in his last
days, he was cooking for UN observers.
</P>
<P>
   Monteiro's husband, Jose Monteiro, then 41, and her three
brothers were members of the guerrilla group Falintil, which has
waged a battle for independence in Timor's craggy hills for more
than 20 years. All four were slain in the mid-70s. Her two sisters
are also widows; their husbands were seized from their homes at
night by soldiers and never returned.
</P>
<P>
   In 1975, Monteiro and her two daughters fled to the hills, where
they lived until Sept. 27, 1978, when they were captured by the
military.
</P>
<P>
   To Monteiro, who speaks Portuguese but not Indonesian, the idea
that Indonesia has done anything for East Timor is laughable. The
territory is hardly better off than it was in the '70s, she said;
it has been paralyzed by constant war and unable to develop or
industrialize. Independence is so obviously the choice for her that
she finds it hard to explain why.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is our right, we're East Timorese,'' she said simply. No
matter how many of her relatives she has lost, she added, ``we have
to stand by this war to win our victory.''

<P>
   HAUPPAUGE, N.Y. _ This is late-summer relaxing, Hillary Rodham
Clinton style:
</P>
<P>
   Hold private indoor meetings with supporters near sun-drenched
beaches while your husband plays golf and snacks on doughnuts with
his pals.
</P>
<P>
   Scope out a potential dream house in Westchester County as
scores of reporters gawk and ask embarrassing questions of your
potential neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Listen to ear-splitting music by the hip-hop performer Wyclef
Jean in an East Hampton airplane hangar in front of a crowd of
mostly youthful contributors, many of whom seem to be wondering
whether you really like the stuff or are just faking it with your
head nodding and arm waving. And along the way raise $400,000 for
the U.S. Senate campaign you have not officially started but that
already seems to be in fourth gear.
</P>
<P>
   That pretty much sums up Mrs. Clinton's weekend visit to the New
York City metropolitan area, a two-day trip that somehow got billed
as a vacation but which had about as much down time for the first
lady as a military invasion.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons ended their Long Island stay Sunday night with _
what else? _ a $25,000-per-couple dinner at the Bridgehampton home
of a longtime Democratic fund raiser, Craig Hatkoff, where about
100 guests dined on lobster salad and listened to music by the rock
star Jon Bon Jovi. The event was expected to raise $900,000 for the
Democratic National Committee, party officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The final fund-raising tally for the weekend: $2 million from
four events, which included the money for Mrs. Clinton's campaign.
Among the rich and famous donors at the events were the singer
Billy Joel, the actors Chevy Chase and Lorraine Bracco, and Martha
Stewart, the doyenne of good housekeeping.
</P>
<P>
   From here, the Clintons are scheduled to travel on Monday to the
Syracuse area, where Mrs. Clinton is to partake in that oldest of
New York state campaign rituals: visiting the state fair.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the weekend, Mrs. Clinton sounded every bit the
Senate candidate as she thanked her contributors at each event.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a lifetime spent on behalf of issues and causes and
candidates that I believed in, and even after, yes, the last
six-and-a-half years, I still believe in public service.''
</P>
<P>
   And as he has throughout the past two weeks, the president
repeatedly offered gushing endorsements of his wife, calling her
during one event on Saturday night ``the most passionate, the most
committed, the most able, the most consistent public citizen I have
ever known.''
</P>
<P>
   ``New York would do well to send her to the United States
Senate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons began their New York adventure on Saturday by
spending two hours inspecting a 110-year-old house in the
Westchester town of Chappaqua. From there they flew to Long Island,
where they were the guests of the film director Steven Spielberg at
his sprawling estate in East Hampton. No sooner had they dropped
their bags than they were off via motorcade to the home of Liz
Robbins, a lobbyist and family friend, for a $1,000-per-person
fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   Sounding very much like a woman eager to break out of her
husband's shadow, Mrs. Clinton told the 300 donors, ``Like most of
you, I've always been somebody who's supported other people. And
now I'm stepping forward and asking you for your support and your
help.''
</P>
<P>
   Later Saturday night, the Clintons attended a $250-per-person
event at the East Hampton airport.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   There, several hundred guests nibbled on curried duck and sipped
local Chardonnay and beer, including Presidential Pale Ale, which,
according to Philip Markowski, the brewmaster of the Southampton
Publick House, is ``a moderate, not too bitter, not too assertive''
brew _ a description that might befit a typical Long Island
Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   The comedian Jon Stewart was master of ceremonies for the event,
which was intended to draw younger contributors with its lower
price tag and with Jean performing. Jean welcomed the Clintons onto
the stage with a Jimi Hendrix-like rendition of ``The Star Spangled
Banner'' on solo guitar. ``Have I bridged the generation gap?'' he
asked the crowd later, before getting a hearty handshake from
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone in the crowd was so thrilled with the show. Two
women sought out a reporter to complain that the president had been
``humiliated'' by having to sit onstage during the loud performance
by a singer who used foul language too many times for their tastes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought this was so thrilling to come and hear the
president,'' said Debbie Howe, 41, of Dutchess County. ``And I've
had to endure this assault.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Mrs. Clinton attended a $5,000-per-person fund-raiser
at the Southampton home of the designer Vera Wang, and then sped
off in a van for private visits with supporters and potential
contributors.
</P>
<P>
   While Mrs. Clinton worked, Clinton had his photograph taken for
the October issue of George magazine, which is dedicated to its
late founder, John F. Kennedy Jr. Then, after grabbing a dozen
doughnuts at Dreesen's Market in East Hampton, the president was
off for 18-holes of golf.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``He keeps dropping balls,'' said one of his partners, Jon
Eisen, the club pro, referring to the president's habit of
replaying shots.
</P>
<P>
   The president seemed to be truly enjoying his Long Island stay.
At the event at the airport Saturday night, he lamented to the
crowd that he was not running for anything. ``I kind of hate it,
actually,'' he said of being a lame duck.
</P>
<P>
   Then, when the event was over, he worked the rope line as
assiduously as a candidate would, lingering over each handshake so
long that even his wife _ the family member who is running for
office _ departed the hall ahead of him.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, a young woman standing on a chair and swaying to
recorded music shouted at Clinton, ``Dance with me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I could,'' the president shouted back.

 SENATOR SEEKS OUTSIDE INQUIRY ON WACO AND FBI 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DAVID STOUT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Charles Schumer on Sunday called for ``a full,
independent, outside investigation'' into federal agents' use of
incendiary devices at a cult compound in Texas in 1993 and the six
years of official denials that followed.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike other lawmakers who have called for inquiries into
the matter, Schumer, D-N.Y., did not imply that there might have
been a cover-up in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer, a junior member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said
that without an independent inquiry into the events of April 19,
1993, when about 80 people died as agents moved against the Branch
Davidian compound near Waco, ``like the Kennedy assassination
conspiracy theorists, you're going to have people for 50 years
still debating this.''
</P>
<P>
   The senator appeared on the NBC News program ``Meet the Press''
to discuss recent revelations that two heat-generating tear-gas
canisters were fired near the Davidian complex on the morning of
April 19, hours before an FBI force moved in to end a siege that
had begun 51 days earlier in a shootout that killed four agents of
the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and two cult members.
</P>
<P>
   Hours after the heat-generating canisters were fired, a wooden
building occupied by cult members burned to the ground. The cult
leader, David Koresh, and scores of his followers died.
</P>
<P>
   Autopsies showed that some died from gunshots (which the
authorities have said were self-inflicted), others from smoke
inhalation or flames. Investigators said an examination of the
ashes showed that gasoline, camp-stove fuel and charcoal lighter
fluid had been spread through the interior.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI said last week that the heat-generating gas canisters
were used because less powerful tear-gas devices had been
ineffective against a concrete bunker. The heat canisters bounced
harmlessly off the bunker and had nothing to do with the fire that
erupted six hours later, the bureau said.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer said he believed that Koresh set the fire. ``I don't
believe the facts will change,'' the senator said. He also
expressed faith in the integrity of Attorney General Janet Reno,
who has acknowledged that the disclosure that heat-generating
devices were used _ despite repeated denials _ had undermined her
credibility.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI said last week that internal documents shortly after the
Branch Davidian operation mentioned the use of the devices almost
in passing. The agency said a closer examination of the paperwork
in recent preparation for lawsuits arising from the raid had made
it clear that the devices were indeed used.
</P>
<P>
   The bureau said it would investigate its own lapses in
communicating facts to the public, but Schumer said the
self-examination would be inadequate. ``The FBI had a chance to do
this investigation on its own,'' he said. ``They clearly muffed
it.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said last week that the Senate
Judiciary Committee, which he leads, would conduct an exhaustive
inquiry into the matter. Appearing on ``Fox News Sunday,'' Hatch
said he knew of nothing ``so far'' to indicate that government
agents rather than the Davidians themselves had started the fire.
</P>
<P>
   But when asked whether he thought any information was still
being withheld, he replied, ``My experience with Attorney General
Reno is that she never really quite comes out in a forthright way
with anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., chairman of the House Committee on
Government Reform, has said he too will press for congressional
hearings. Burton's panel, along with the House Judiciary Committee,
held hearings on the siege in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers were highly critical of the FBI and the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms but said there was no evidence that
agents had touched off the fire.

MARINERS ARE ALL TOO HUMAN IN LOSS TO YANKEES 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A desperate Lou Piniella pulled most of the Seattle
lineup out of his hat before Sunday's game against the Yankees, and
so it followed that the Mariners played like rabbits: without
thumbs.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners committed three errors and were guilty of
negligence in several other instances, and by the ninth inning of
their 11-5 loss to the Yankees Sunday, Piniella's teeth were
showing as he vented to a coach. Ricky Ledee had an inside-the-park
home run, and the 52,493 at Yankee Stadium were far more pleased
than Piniella, having seen the Yankees complete a three-game sweep
of a team that once presented a frightening challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle has lost eight consecutive games against the Yankees;
the Mariners were outscored by 21-6 over the weekend, including
Sunday's embarrassment. ``That was a sloppy game,'' Piniella said.
``We showed we were outmanned, plain and simple. If there's a
lesson to be learned, it's that, plain and simple.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, who begin a four-game series Monday night with the
visiting Oakland Athletics, are 80-49, the best record in the
American League, and they are doing a lot of things very well these
days. Roger Clemens and Orlando Hernandez combined to allow one run
over 16 innings Friday and Saturday, striking out 22, and the
Yankees have made just two errors in their last nine games. At
their current rate, they will finish the year with 100 victories.
</P>
<P>
   But Sunday's blowout had as much to do with Seattle's
sleepwalking as with the Yankees' ability to capitalize on the
mistakes. Piniella, whose temper fluctuates according to victories
and losses, had grown so frustrated by the Mariners' lack of
offense that he decided to pull most of his lineup out of his hat _
literally _ to shake things up. Before the game, Piniella filled
out four slots in his lineup, No. 3 to No. 6, and pieces of paper
were picked out of his cap to fill out the other five slots. Billy
Martin, Piniella's former manager with the Yankees, was known to do
the same sort of thing.
</P>
<P>
   Russ Davis, a slow-footed third baseman, batted leadoff _ for
the first time since he was in Little League, he said. The
light-hitting Rafael Bournigal batted seventh, scant protection for
the No. 6 batter, Jay Buhner.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners (63-66) took the lead against Andy Pettitte (12-9)
and the Yankees, two runs scoring on Dan Wilson's double in the
second. But Davis blew a double-play ball in the third, costing
Seattle two runs, and Ledee's home run in the fifth gave the
Yankees a sizable 6-3 advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Griffey Jr. did not have a good weekend in Yankee Stadium.
Roger Clemens jammed him with fastballs Friday night, and Griffey
responded by striking out on a head-high pitch. On Saturday, the
Mariners' center fielder reiterated that he would never play for
the Yankees because when he was a child, the Yankees' principal
owner, George Steinbrenner, told him to stay out of the clubhouse,
and Griffey implied that this could be a reason for signing with
the Mets; Griffey apparently has no statute of limitations, or
limits, on his grudges.
</P>
<P>
   Ledee provided closure for Griffey's visit in the fifth when he
smashed a line drive to center. Griffey, a Gold Glove winner, read
the flight of the ball and recognized it was headed near the wall.
He sprinted to the center-field wall, measuring his strides,
preparing for a leaping catch. If Ledee's drive stayed in the park,
Ledee figured Griffey would catch it _ just as he had run down so
many balls before.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey slightly misjudged the play, however, and the ball
crashed into the wall behind him as he slammed into the fence. He
stood at the base of the wall and did not chase after the ball that
had caromed at an odd angle, in the direction of the Yankees'
bullpen beyond the wall in left-center field. Later, Griffey
explained that he did not see where the ball had gone.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Hunter, the Seattle left fielder, is among the game's
fastest players, and had he backed up the play, then Ledee would
probably have had either a double or triple. But Hunter, often
reduced to a contortionist by the glaring sun during the weekend,
had not moved. Ledee was racing around the bases, seeing the
excitement of the third-base coach, Willie Randolph, as Randolph
windmilled his arm and sent Ledee home.
</P>
<P>
   Finally Buhner, the right fielder, retrieved the ball and heaved
it to Bournigal, who relayed it homeward _ far too late to nail
Ledee, who slid across home stylishly, swiping at the plate with
his left hand. Ledee's was the first inside-the-park home run by a
Yankee at the Stadium since Deion Sanders hit one on July 17, 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Ledee returned to the dugout exhausted. He had not run that far
in years, he guessed; he had been part of a mile relay team in high
school.
</P>
<P>
   The next inning, Joe Girardi broke for second base on a steal
attempt, beginning a domino of blunders by the Mariners, all on the
same play: the throw from Dan Wilson, the catcher, bounced in the
dirt; Alex Rodriguez, the shortstop, was unable to knock down the
ball; the ball skipped over the head of Bournigal, who was backing
up the play.
</P>
<P>
   Girardi ran toward third as Bournigal went to recover the ball
in short right field, and as Girardi slowed coming around the bag,
Bournigal inexplicably lobbed toward home.
</P>
<P>
   The ball skidded off the edge of the infield grass, skittered
between the legs of Wilson and to the backstop; Todd Williams, the
pitcher, was between home and third, out of position to back up the
play, and Girardi scored. Laughter was appropriate, unless you were
Lou Piniella; then you might have been chewing on the hat that was
supposed to bring you some good luck. &QL;

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A roller-coaster car climbing skyward at a New Jersey shore
amusement park lost its traction near the peak of its ascent
Saturday night and, plunging 30 feet backward onto a sharp curve,
hurled a woman and her 8-year-old daughter out to their deaths as
dozens of horrified witnesses looked on.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, as investigators focused on a bizarre double mechanical
failure on the Wild Wonder roller coaster in Ocean City, N.J.,
witnesses gave chilling accounts of the deaths of Kimberly Bailey,
39, and her daughter, Jessica, of Pomona, N.Y., in the state's
first amusement-ride fatalities in a decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw the car going up,'' recalled Tammy Matcyak, 38, of
Tylersport, Pa., whose two children were waiting to board the ride.
``Then something let loose, and the car came slamming back
downward, slamming down. I saw two bodies fly, incredibly. It was a
woman and a child. The woman slammed into a beam. The child just
flew. I knew right away they had to be dead.''
</P>
<P>
   After a day of intense preliminary investigation, William
Connolly, director of the state's Division of Codes and Standards,
which regulates and inspects amusement rides, said the fatal plunge
occurred about 10 p.m. as the car bearing the mother and daughter
was being drawn up by a chain to the highest point of the tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the 41-foot pinnacle, Connolly said, the drag chain is
supposed to let go automatically, allowing gravity to take over as
the freewheeling car picks up speed and hurtles down on a looping,
whipping, zigzag course that takes 60 seconds and has been
described by riders as exciting to terrifying.
</P>
<P>
   But for reasons that were unexplained Sunday, Connolly said at a
late afternoon news conference, the drag chain ``released
prematurely'' and the car plummeted backward. At the same time, he
said, an anti-rollback device similar to an emergency brake,
intended to prevent a car from falling backward, also failed for
reasons not yet determined.
</P>
<P>
   After the two failures, Connolly said, there was nothing the
ride's operator could do as the car rushed back toward a 90-degree
curve at the base of the ride's initial ascent. It is a curve that
the cars pass slowly going up, and was never intended to be
negotiated by a car going backward at high speed.
</P>
<P>
   While the car remained on the tracks _ gripped by wheels
designed to hold them from above, below and on the sides _ the
powerful centrifugal force of the car rounding the curve hurled the
mother and daughter out, Connolly said. He noted that a safety bar
across the riders' laps failed to hold them in, apparently because
it was designed to prevent forward, not backward, movement.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he said, the car, decorated to look like a puppy or a
teddy bear, had no door to prevent an ejection, just an open side,
apparently to facilitate the loading and unloading of riders. The
victims, who apparently struck the roller coaster's walls and
column supports, fell about 10 feet down from the elevated curve,
and about 7 feet from the base of the ride.
</P>
<P>
   Paramedics and the Ocean City police rushed to the scene, but
the victims were pronounced dead at Shore Memorial Hospital in
nearby Somers Point. Autopsies were to be performed there Monday,
but officials said Ms. Bailey and her daughter had apparently died
of extensive blunt-trauma injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the empty roller-coaster car, after swinging
around the curve, struck another car at the loading platform, and
two people in it were slightly injured. Irit Taub, 25, of
Clementon, N.J., suffered cuts and a neck strain, and Michael
Barteld, 7, of Pine Hill, N.J., suffered a bump on the head. Both
were treated at Shore Memorial Hospital and released.
</P>
<P>
   Expressions of sorrow for the victims and a willingness to
cooperate with investigators were voiced Sunday by Jay Gillian,
whose family has owned Gillian's Wonderland Pier, the site of the
roller coaster, since 1930 on the boardwalk at Ocean City, a resort
10 miles south of Atlantic City.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is every park owner's nightmare,'' he said. ``We are
deeply saddened by this tragedy and our hearts go out to the
family. Our family has been in this business for 70 years and
safety has always been our first concern. This is the first major
accident in the park's history.''
</P>
<P>
   The park, a collection of rides and arcades just off the north
end of the 2.3-mile boardwalk in Ocean City, was ordered closed by
Gillian after the accident out of respect for the victims and their
families. He said the park would remain closed ``until we have some
answers.'' The roller coaster, and one like it in Wildwood, N.J.,
were closed on orders from state inspectors.

</P>
<P>
   Gillian said the new Wild Wonder roller coaster, with four cars
that each hold four passengers on rides featuring sharp curves, was
manufactured by an Italian company, Zamperla, which has an American
sales and service office in Parsippany, N.J. He said the
manufacturer would send engineers to participate in the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The ride was opened on July 1 at ceremonies attended by Gov.
Christie Whitman, who pressed a button to start the ride but balked
at trying it herself, acknowledging that she was afraid of roller
coasters. Before being put into operation, the ride was inspected
by state officials on July 1, and it was inspected again on July
21, the authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Connolly said no problems were found on either inspection, and
in particular no problems were found with the drag-chain or
anti-rollback mechanisms. Other officials said the state would
study the possible hazards thoroughly in an inquiry that might take
weeks. Among other things, they said, the investigators would look
for possible design flaws, such as a restraining bar that would not
prevent rearward ejections or lower sides to the cars.
</P>
<P>
   The state of New Jersey cracked down on amusement park rider
operators in 1997 after a series of accidents. Among other things,
inspections and other regulatory functions were transferred from
the State Labor Department to the Division of Codes and Standards,
part of the Department of Community Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The state also increased inspections from one to as many as four
a year for each ride, increased penalties for safety violations
from $500 to $5,000, and made it a crime for riders who to ignore
rules on rides.

   The tighter safety regulations have reduced serious accidents on
the 1,600 amusement park rides in New Jersey by 20 percent this
year, according to E.J. Miranda, a spokesman for the codes and
standards division. He said there had been 443 reported incidents
and 12 serious injuries on rides through Aug. 26, down from 548
incidents and 16 serious injuries in the same period last year.
Moreover, he said, the deaths in Ocean City were the first on an
operating amusement ride in the state in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   The state's experience has run counter to a national trend,
however, he said. In the nation, accidents and serious injuries
have increased by about 20 percent in the past year. And there has
been a surge of fatal accidents in the nation this summer,
including four deaths on rides last week alone _ one each in
California and Virginia, in addition to the two in New Jersey on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   As state inspectors examined the tracks, cars and structure of
the roller coaster Sunday, the Ferris wheel and other rides at
Gillian's Wonderland were silent, the end-of-summer rhythms of
Ocean City's boardwalk went on.
</P>
<P>
   The wide beach of silky off-white sand was crowded with bronzed
sunbathers and swimmers; surfers were catching the big waves;
arcades rang with artificial gunshots, and awning-draped stands
sold hot dogs, fried clams and oysters.
</P>
<P>
   It was a teen-age crowd, mainly, too preoccupied to sense the
tragedy in the wings. But for those who had witnessed the accident
_ like Ms. Matcyak, a day-care worker, her husband, Mark, a
machinist, and their children, Andrew, 12, and Breanna, 8 _ this
August would be unforgettable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd just come for the weekend,'' Ms. Matcyak said. ``I've
been coming to this park since I was a child. I and my children
rode it the night before. It wasn't like a typical roller coaster.
It had quick turns. It made you feel like you were going to go off
the top.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was waiting on line with the kids,'' Mr. Matcyak recalled.
``My daughter had loved it so much the night before. She wanted me
to come with her. I was like, oh, all right.''
</P>
<P>
   Then it happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``The car was making a ratcheting noise coming down,
quickening,'' he said. ``It just came down and, wham! It was
sickening. Just wham! Those people just flew. They just launched
out of the car.''

SEARCH ENGINES WORK TOWARD WORLD WIDER WEB
<TEXT>
<P>
   BY DEBORAH SOLOMON
</P>
<P>
   &LR; c &LR; .1999 San Francisco &LR;   &LR; Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   Finding information on the Web has always been frustrating, and
as the amount of data on the Web explodes, the search is only going
to get harder.
</P>
<P>
   But a new breed of search engines is aiming to ease the
aggravation.
</P>
<P>
   Some are searching ever-larger portions of the Web. Others are
employing staffs of editors to hunt down the best sites for
particular queries. A few are even running ``popularity'' contests,
letting Web surfers and Web-page designers guide one another to the
best sites.
</P>
<P>
   Always eager for the next best thing, Internet users are heading
to the new sites in droves, giving veteran search engines a run for
their money. LookSmart, Ask Jeeves and GoTo _ all fairly new sites
_ ranked among the top 10 search sites for July 1999, according to
Media Metrix.
</P>
<P>
   To use the new technologies, it helps to understand the old
ones.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional search engines such as Excite and AltaVista use
software programs that search for Web sites containing whatever
keywords the user has entered into the search bar.
</P>
<P>
   These programs _ known as ``spiders'' or ``crawlers'' _ visit a
Web page, read it and record the words on each page. The spider
then makes a list of which words appear on which pages and returns
those pages whenever a user types in that keyword. Generally, the
more times a keyword appears on a page, the higher it ranks on a
list of results.
</P>
<P>
   But search engines don't always produce the best results.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, many Web site designers ``wallpaper'' their
pages, loading them up with keywords so they'll jump to the top of
a search-results list.
</P>
<P>
   Also, unless you're a skilled searcher, you'll get thousands of
irrelevant results. For example, if you type the word ``weddings''
into a search engine, you're likely to get photos of people's
weddings, wedding photographers in Iowa and men looking for wives.
</P>
<P>
   Another type of search site _ called a directory _ separates
search results into user-friendly categories.
</P>
<P>
   For example, type ``weddings'' into Yahoo, a directory, and
you'll get choices such as wedding rings, gowns and even movies
(including ``The Wedding Singer'').
</P>
<P>
   Some of the new sites are search engines and some are
directories, but all claim to go a step beyond the existing
technology.
</P>
<P>
   AlltheWeb, which launched in May, aims to access more of the Web
than any other search engine. It was the first to break the 200
million Web-page barrier and claims that it will access ``all the
Web'' _ 800 million pages _ in six months.
</P>
<P>
   Google of Palo Alto, Calif., is a search engine that ranks Web
sites based on how popular they are with other Web authors. For
example, the more sites that include links to a particular page
like Joe's Home Page, the more likely it is that Joe's Home Page
will pop to the top of Google's search results.
</P>
<P>
   Google's founders say it's a democratic process that lets the
Web community determine which pages are worthy.
</P>
<P>
   It was created by two Stanford University students, Sergey Vrin
and Larry Page, who were frustrated by the existing choice of
search engines.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a number of other companies like Excite and Infoseek
and they have search components, but primarily, they are media
companies,'' said Vrin. Google is a no-frills search engine that
aims to do one thing well.
</P>
<P>
   Direct Hit also uses a ``popularity engine'' to deliver Web
sites. When users key in a search, Direct Hit anonymously monitors
which sites they access and how much time they spend there. The
more often a site is accessed and the longer it is used, the higher
its ranking.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Jeeves of Berkeley, Calif., lets users pose questions in
plain English. Ask Jeeves then directs users to sites that provide
the best answers. (For a complete explanation, go to
www.askjeeves.com, click on ``Popular Questions'' and then ``What
Is Ask Jeeves.'')
</P>
<P>
   Ask Jeeves does a good job answering simple, common questions,
such as ``What is the capital of New Hampshire?'' or ``How high is
the Empire State Building?'' But often it's stumped by more
difficult queries.
</P>
<P>
   LookSmart of San Francisco is a directory that has more than 200
editors who scour the Web, search out the best sites and add them
to a growing directory of more than 800,000 unique pages in 60,000
categories.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way we differentiate ourselves is in the actual size and
quality of our site,'' said Val Landi, senior vice president of
marketing and media. ``We believe we have the largest staff of
editors, and the assumption is that, as opposed to our robotic
brethren out there, if you have intelligent, professional editors,
they can select the best quality Web sites.''
</P>
<P>
   While there are no scientific studies that prove which type of
search engine produces better results, industry watchers say the
Googles and LookSmarts of the world do a good job.
</P>
<P>
   The competition from these upstarts has not gone unnoticed. In
recent weeks, some of the original search engines have announced
planned improvements.
</P>
<P>
   Excite announced plans to access more Web pages _ up to 43
percent of the Web, compared with about 6 percent now _ and is
pairing with LookSmart to provide a directory.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape announced that it would use Google's technology to
power its search function.
</P>
<P>
   AltaVista's new owner, CMGI Inc., vowed to improve the search
function and turn the site into a ``megaportal'' where users can
also do things like buy a car and trade stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft also plans to announce a major revamping of its
MSN.com search site in early fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are developing a next-generation search engine that
leverages a lot of our experience in making software easier to use
to deliver a search experience that is everything you never thought
search could be,'' said Rob Bennett, director of marketing for MSN.
</P>
<P>
   Industry watchers say members of the old guard need to improve
their search functions if they want to keep users coming back.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no allegiance out there,'' said John Corcoran, an
analyst with Stephens Inc. in Boston. ``Consumers are saying, `If I
can get the information with only three clicks on Yahoo, fantastic.
But if I can get it with two clicks on a newer search engine, I'll
use that one.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Getting repeat customers is crucial if Net companies want to
attract advertising and e-commerce partners.
</P>
<P>
   ``Search is a business. It clearly generates revenue because
it's one of the best opportunities to reach people who are looking
for something in particular,'' said Barry Parr, who tracks search
engines for International Data Corp.
</P>
<P>
   While some of the older search sites have transformed themselves
into portals, some of the newer ones, including AlltheWeb and
Google, plan to make money by licensing their technology to other
search engines and to companies that want a search tool on their
Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our focus is narrow: We want to do core search technology
better than anyone else in the world, then take that technology and
sell it to big companies,'' said David Burns, president and CEO of
Fast Search &QL; 
&AMP; Transfer, which operates &QL; 
AlltheWeb.com.
</P>
<P>
   With all the choices out there, Web searchers may be more
confused than ever. Here's a piece of basic advice:
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't know where to begin, directories are good places
to start,'' said Danny Sullivan, editor of SearchEngineWatch.com in
London.
</P>
<P>
   When the hunt is for something very specific or obscure, like
information on a rare medical condition, then a search engine may
be the better choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``A search engine is good because you're getting into the nooks
and crannies of the Web,'' Sullivan said.
</P>
<P>
   A recent study published in the journal Nature prompted some &LR; 
debate when it revealed that most search sites access just a tiny
fraction of the Web. Northern Light accessed the most: 16 percent
of the Web, compared with just 5.6 percent for Excite. AlltheWeb
searches 25 percent but was not included in the study.
</P>
<P>
   But unless you're looking for something rare, chances are you
don't need to access much more than 15 percent of the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people don't say, `I wish I had another 1 million pages
to look through,' '' Sullivan said.
</P>
<P>
   Parr of IDC agreed. ``If you're doing a general search and you
get 1 million pages back instead of 150,000, you're only going to
look at the first 20 anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the number of search sites will stop growing and
begin to shrink.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market will have a shakeout,'' Corcoran said. ``Why do we
need 45 search engines? We don't. The big ones now will continue to
get bigger and will continue to spend large amounts of money
growing their subscriber base. And the end result will be a couple
of really big, really good sites.''

SAMPRAS STRAINS BACK AT OPEN PRACTICE
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As he made his final preparations Sunday for the U.S.
Open, top-seeded Pete Sampras sustained a minor back injury during
a practice session at the National Tennis Center.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras, the four-time Open champion who will be seeking a
career record 13th Grand Slam title, was practicing with
fifth-seeded Gustavo Kuerten when he felt a pain in his lower back
while reaching for an overhead.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, a grimacing Sampras went to the side of the court,
sat down and then left to seek an opinion from the Open's medical
director, Dr. Brian Hainline, who said the problem should be solved
by rest and was unlikely to disrupt Sampras' bid.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Hainline said: ``Pete suffered a mild back
strain this morning during a practice session. This should not
interfere with his play.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampras, who tweaked his right hip two weeks ago while leaping
to make a shot in the quarterfinals at Indianapolis, was not on
Monday's opening-day schedule, and could receive a Wednesday start
to give him an extra day of recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras has a 1-0 record against his first-round opponent,
unseeded Marat Safin of Russia, who won his Open tune-up at the Pro
Championships in Boston Sunday with a 6-4, 7-6 (11-9) victory over
Greg Rusedski.

BURKETT DELIVERS FOR RANGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ The Rangers' Johnny Oates delegates authority among
members of his staff, and yesterday the manager gave Dick Bosman
the responsibility no pitching coach could possibly want.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto's Carlos Delgado had just delivered home yesterday's
first run with his first-inning, bases-loaded single, and it
appeared that Rangers right-hander John Burkett might not retire a
batter before being dismissed for impersonating a pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what you're going to tell him,'' Oates advised
pitching coach Dick Bosman, ``but go tell him something.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays did not score another run during Burkett's
62/3-inning appearance, and the Rangers moved 27 games above .500
for the first time in the franchise's 28-year history with a 4-2
victory yesterday at SkyDome.
</P>
<P>
   Burkett (5-7) retired shortstop Tony Batista on strikes and got
an inning-ending, double-play ground ball from designated hitter
Willie Greene to escape the bases-loaded jam without further
damage, and third baseman Todd Zeile delivered the afternoon's
crucial blow with his two-run, fourth-inning home run off
right-hander Roy Halladay that gave the Rangers a 3-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a nice win,'' Burkett said. ``It could have been ugly.
I know everybody else was thinking, `Here we go again,' but I have
confidence in myself. To me, it's a waste of time to think about
anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Bosman suggested that Burkett utilize his curveball more often
instead of relying on the fastball, and that philosophy produced
the desired effect. Burkett threw a 3-2 curveball in a fastball
count that Batista swung through and missed, and a 2-1 curveball to
Greene produced a one-hopper to the mound that resulted in a 1-2-3
double play.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't all that good of one,'' Burkett said of the
curveball to Batista. ``That one took some \Rguts\S. That was a 3-2
pitch. If I miss there, I'm probably out of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Oates said Burkett would have pitched to at least seven hitters
before summoning right-hander Danny Kolb from the bullpen. The Blue
Jays, though, sent only six to the plate that inning.
</P>
<P>
   Burkett pulled the rabbit out of his glove after falling behind
in the count to Greene with three consecutive fastballs. Burkett
responded with a 2-1 curveball in yet another fastball count.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure he was looking for a fastball, but I had as much
confidence in my curveball as I did anything,'' Burkett said. ``I
threw a pretty good one, and he bounced it back to the mound.''
</P>
<P>
   Inning over.
</P>
<P>
   Burkett retired 19 of the final 23 batters before Oates summoned
right-hander Tim Crabtree from the bullpen after a two-out,
seventh-inning single by third baseman Casey Blake.
</P>
<P>
   ``I struggled with my fastball pretty much all day long,''
Burkett said. ``Boz told me to trust my curveball.''
</P>
<P>
   Just like Oates advised.

LAYOFFS IN HIGH-TECH INDUSTRY ARE AT ODDS WITH BOOMING ECONOMY &HT;    BY HENRY NORR
 &HT;    c.1999 San Francisco   Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Although the economic sun continues to shine
brightly on most of the San Francisco Bay Area, dark clouds have
appeared on the horizon in recent weeks, as a string of technology
companies has announced plans to lay off workers and close
facilities here.
</P>
<P>
   Are these clouds the first signs of an impending storm that will
mark the end of the region's long season of prosperity, or just
minor disturbances?
</P>
<P>
   In terms of the number of jobs and the range of companies
involved, the toll is anything but trivial. Just this month,
workstation-maker Silicon Graphics announced a restructuring plan
that's expected to mean pink slips for 1,000 to 1,500 employees.
Raychem, a supplier of electrical and electronic components, said
it will trim 646 jobs locally as part of a corporate consolidation
that will reduce worldwide employment by 2,200.
</P>
<P>
   The data-storage industry has been especially hard hit. Quantum,
the volume leader in hard-drive manufacturing, said it will lay off
750 to 800 people, including 600 from its Milpitas facilities. And
Komag, which supplies magnetic disks to other drive-makers, said it
is closing two local plants and eliminating 480 more Bay Area jobs,
on top of the 900 it axed earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Even the software industry, where layoffs are less common, has
been hit. Last week, Autodesk, which makes programs for designing
everything from buildings to Web sites, said it will cut employment
by 350, about 10 percent of its workforce.
</P>
<P>
   Severe as these cuts are, though, experts say they don't add up
to an overall downturn for the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``The California economy is doing very well in 1999,'' said
Stephen Levy, director of the Center for the Continuing Study of
the California Economy in Palo Alto, Calif. ``We're outpacing the
rest of the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Levy cited a slew of numbers to back up his rosy outlook:
</P>
<P>
   --Employment in the state has grown by roughly half a million
this year, the largest annual increase this decade.
</P>
<P>
   --Unemployment here was only 5.2 percent last month, the lowest
rate since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   --Wages were up 9 to 10 percent in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Looking to the future, Levy said, ``The fundamentals continue to
look very positive.''
</P>
<P>
   The best indicator, he said, is the influx of venture capital,
the seed money that can turn a promising startup into a major
employer, and on that score the region has never been in better
shape: Both overall levels of venture funding and the share going
to the Bay Area _ now 40 percent _ are at record levels, he said.
</P>
<P>
   How then to explain the misfortunes that recently have forced so
many companies to trim their payrolls?
</P>
<P>
   Part of the answer is a continuing decline in manufacturing
employment in the region. Long term, that trend is driven largely
by the high cost of producing goods here, but it was spurred by the
collapse of East Asian economies in 1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Now Asia is beginning to recover, and U.S. demand for computers,
consumer electronics and telecommunications products is strong. In
many Western states, high-tech manufacturing employment has turned
upward. But in the Bay Area, the decline continues, according to
Western Economic Developments, a publication of the Federal Reserve
Bank of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The latest layoffs result mostly from strategic stumbles on the
part of company management or, in the case of data storage, from
dynamics that have plagued the industry for almost two decades.
</P>
<P>
   Take SGI, for example: There, the problem appears to be the
company's inability to develop and follow through on a coherent
product strategy. Like other makers of workstations and servers,
the company has lost part of its traditional business to PC-makers,
whose high-end systems now deliver nearly as much computing power
at much lower prices.
</P>
<P>
   But SGI rival Sun Microsystems is subject to the same
competitive pressures, yet it is prospering as never before, mainly
by focusing on opportunities created by the Internet. In fact, Sun
currently has more than 1,400 open positions in the Bay Area _
almost exactly the number SGI plans to cut.
</P>
<P>
   Autodesk's problems are in some ways similar: Both company
President Carol Bartz and analysts who follow it seem to agree that
the firm failed to keep up with customers shifting their focus to
the Web.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Raychem, layoffs were the predictable result of
consolidation. The company was acquired in May by Tyco
International, a fast-growing conglomerate that just a few months
prior had bought another leading electronics-component
manufacturer, AMP.
</P>
<P>
   Although company officials said the product lines of Raychem and
AMP directly overlapped in only a few areas, they were close enough
to make integration with AMP feasible _ at the cost of some 2,200
jobs worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   As for the storage companies _ Komag and Quantum _ the latest
cuts reflect pressures generated by the accelerating shift toward
low-cost PCs, not only in the consumer and small-business markets
but also among corporate customers. But these problems are
compounded by the peculiar dynamics of the hard-drive market, where
the leading competitors traditionally battle without mercy for
market share _ whatever the effect on their bottom lines.
</P>
<P>
   Quantum, in particular, has been suffering since June, when
rival Seagate Technologies introduced a new low-end drive with
especially aggressive prices. What followed, according to Jim
Porter, president of Disk/Trend, a storage-market research company
in Mountain View, was a ``bloodbath.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry produces more and better drives every year,'' he
said. ``The end user is getting a great deal. The only thing
missing is profit.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet, he said, another battle is brewing. In the coming
month, all the leading drive manufacturers will adopt new disks _
the kind of component Komag makes _ with double the storage
capacity of the previous generation.
</P>
<P>
   That advance, according to Porter, almost certainly will trigger
yet another round of ferocious price cutting. ``The players are
headed for the O.K. Corral again,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Among top-tier storage companies, Porter said, only IBM has had
the self-discipline to stay out of the desktop PC market, choosing
instead to focus on market segments where competition is not quite
so ferocious, such as miniature drives for notebooks &LR;  and
high-performance ones for servers and workstations &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   ``They believe in selling things for more than it costs to make
them,'' he said. ``A revolutionary idea.''
</P>
<P>
   In short, this summer's cutbacks are probably not the first
signs of a larger downturn, though companies trying to continue
manufacturing in the Bay Area are likely to face continuing
challenges.
</P>
<P>
   More than anything else, the cuts are a reminder that most of
the high-tech industry remains relentlessly competitive, and when
management fails to steer a safe path through such shoals, no job
is safe.

<P>
   MARIETTA, Ga. _ Tom Sims did not hesitate. When he heard, at the
last minute, that Texas Gov. George W. Bush was about to make an
appearance at a social services center here on Friday, he hiked out
into the 90-degree heat, crossed a busy street separating his
office from the center and stood under a withering sun to catch a
glimpse of _ and maybe snatch a word with _ Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not every day you get a chance to talk to the potential
president of the United States,'' said Sims, a health care
consultant who generally votes for Republicans and is pleased about
Bush's chances of winding up in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Surely, then, Bush had Sims' vote sewn up?
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Sims hastily interjected. ``It's ridiculous to make a
decision at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Sims said that with the first wave of Republican primaries more
than four months away and the general election seven months after
that, he was still looking, still learning. His vague, visceral
fondness for Bush was not connected to any detailed knowledge of
where Bush stood on an array of issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really couldn't tell you,'' Sims said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush's record-breaking yield of campaign contributions
and his alpine perch in polls convey the impression of an
irreversible groundswell of support for his candidacy for the
Republican presidential nomination, interviews with dozens of men
and women who attended his campaign events this week told a
different, less emphatic story.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of $1,000-a-head fund-raising events, Bush's
appearances in a three-day swing through South Carolina, North
Carolina and Georgia drew voters who, as often as not, said that
their affinity for, or curiosity about, Bush had not yet turned
into rock-solid support. Many of these people had favorable but
diffuse impressions of him and wanted to know more, but were in no
hurry, saying the election still seemed very, very far away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't even tell you who else is in the running at this
point,'' said Karen Davis, the finance director of the social
services center that Bush visited here.
</P>
<P>
   Many voters who had already decided on Bush or were leaning
sharply in that direction had difficulty articulating why, and
usually cited either their respect for his father, the former
president, or their determination to put a Republican in the White
House. Gov. Bush, they said, has developed enough momentum that he
seems to be the Republican with the best shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to go with the front-runner, otherwise you're
wasting your vote and betting on a losing horse,'' said Jack
Hamilton, a retired military officer who attended a speech by Bush
on Thursday morning in Myrtle Beach, S.C.
</P>
<P>
   The comments of Hamilton and others who had taken the time to
attend a Bush campaign event suggested that Bush had not struck
some deep, resounding chord with Republican voters or swept them
off their feet with his magnetism. To a significant extent, he was
simply the candidate with a name that they recognized, and he was
surfing a tidal wave of outsized expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing really that I see in him that impresses me
more than anybody else,'' said Will Buddin, a real estate agent who
showed up to hear Bush speak in Goose Creek, S.C., on Wednesday
afternoon. ``He's just got a good bandwagon right now. The general
media push makes you feel there might be something there.''
</P>
<P>
   Only a few people mentioned Bush's catch phrase of compassionate
conservatism as part of his appeal or even seemed familiar with the
term. If it had penetrated their awareness, it was mostly as a way
of pegging Bush as a moderate Republican, which was what many of
them said they wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of Republicans are conservative on fiscal issues
but more liberal on social ones,'' said Ed Barns, a manager for a
textiles manufacturer who also listened to Bush in Goose Creek.
</P>
<P>
   Barns said he got the feeling that Bush was of a like mind, but
he said he also got that feeling about Elizabeth Dole, one of
Bush's rivals for the Republican nomination, and was intrigued as
well by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., another candidate in the crowded
field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just haven't decided yet,'' Barns said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Without being asked about it, many voters volunteered that they
did not care whether Bush had ever used cocaine as a younger man, a
question that had dogged the Texas governor throughout the previous
week and had received considerable attention from the news media.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever he did in the past, he has recent accomplishments to
be proud of,'' said Cynthia Hudson, another person in the audience
at Goose Creek.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hudson, who had brought her two small children with her and
proudly identified herself a soccer mom, added that many people she
knew were reckless or wild in their youths. ``I'm surprised I
survived college,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She said that she liked what she had seen of Bush so far but
that she had not seen enough, or paid close enough attention, to
decide which of the Republican hopefuls was her favorite.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want somebody who's going to make a strong showing against
Democrats, and he could be the one,'' she said. But, she added, ``I
haven't done my homework yet. We've got a lot of time.''
</P>
<P>
   That last sentence was a common refrain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's sad that polls are taken so seriously so soon,''
said Tom Brown, a pension consultant who had come to hear Bush
speak at a Rotary Club luncheon in North Charleston, S.C., on
Wednesday. As for Bush's potent showing in those surveys, Brown
said, ``He's a name everybody knows.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown noted that many of the candidates were still waiting
before unveiling their policy proposals on important issues and
that he, in turn, was waiting to decide which of them had his vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far, all we have is political gobbledygook,'' Brown said.
``I need more information.''
</P>
<P>
   That many people were not devoting much thought to the
presidential race and did not know much about Bush's actual
political record could be read two ways, with different
implications for Bush's candidacy. One was that his numbers were
softer than the polls made them seem, and more subject to change as
the primaries drew nearer.
</P>
<P>
   The other interpretation was that voters were generally
distracted and disconnected and simply wound up gravitating toward
a candidate with a familiar name and face, factors that were not
only working in Bush's favor now but would continue to help him in
the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's all name recognition,'' said Clare Majorossy, a
retiree at the Myrtle Beach event, who added that voters were moved
by fickle and not always sensible impulses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes,'' she said, ``people say, `Look, wouldn't it be
nice for the father if the son got elected?' People get dumb
sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   She herself was undecided, as was her husband, George Majorossy,
who said that they were attending Bush's speech at the Myrtle Beach
Convention Center because the president of their homeowners'
association, an active Republican, had told them there would be a
free breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was expecting bacon and eggs,'' Majorossy said as he waited
for Bush to deliver his remarks. Instead, Majorossy got pastries
and coffee. ``I was a little disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   Majorossy asked his interviewer if Bush's speeches were
generally good.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it worth hanging around?'' he said. ``Because I've got a
racquetball game waiting on me.''

FIVE TEENS DIE IN PLUNGE OFF CLIFF AFTER RAVE PARTY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY ROBERT MONROE   AND HARRISON SHEPPARD  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANGELES NATIONAL FOREST, Calif. _ Four girls and a boy were
killed Sunday morning when their car plummeted down a cliff off
Angeles Crest Highway, apparently after leaving an all-night
``rave'' party that drew anywhere from 5,000 to 10,000 people,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   A motorist following the eastbound car told officials it went
across the road toward a dirt turnout, but kept going and fell some
1,200 feet down the cliff near Mile Marker 68.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the teen-agers were thrown from the car. Los Angeles
County firefighters found the fifth body inside. The victims'
identities weren't released.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all grieving over this. It's senseless,'' said Sgt. Bill
Hutton, of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department's Cresenta
Valley Station which patrols the Angeles National Forest.
</P>
<P>
   CHP Officer Lou Aviles said the cause was a mystery. ``There
wasn't any abrupt movement and it doesn't appear from any
preliminary indication that the driver fell asleep.''
</P>
<P>
   The motorist who saw the car go over called authorities at 7:32
a.m. Sunday and waited until they arrived.
</P>
<P>
   The crash took place on a remote stretch of the highway in
extremely rugged, pine-tree covered mountains due north of the San
Gabriel Valley, about 10 miles east of the party site.
</P>
<P>
   The motorist told investigators that the Toyota sedan was
traveling between 30 and 40 mph, said California Highway Patrol
Officer Ed Aragon, who added that there was no sign of drugs or
alcohol in the car.
</P>
<P>
   The identities of the crash victims had not been released late
Sunday. Aragon said an identification card from Colton High School
in San Bernardino County was found on the male victim.
</P>
<P>
   Also found in the car were ticket stubs to the rave, said
Aragon.
</P>
<P>
   The outdoor marathon dance party drew thousands on the last
weekend before school begins for many Southern California
teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   Among the first firefighters at the crash site was Los Angeles
County fire Capt. Mike Ponder, who went to the scene from the rave
which was scheduled to last from 8:30 p.m. Saturday to 8:30 a.m.
Sunday at the Snowcrest ski lift near the Kratka Ridge Ski Area. He
was there because of a 5:30 a.m. report of a medical emergency.
</P>
<P>
   Fire Capt. David Plucinski said that during the morning
paramedics had flown three people by helicopter from the rave to
area hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   The first flight was at 1:30 a.m. for an unspecified medical
problem. Two more were at 9:15 a.m. and 9:45 a.m. to treat drug
overdoses. Plucinski said the helicopter was used because it would
take too long for an ambulance to get the victims to hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   One young man who went to the rave estimated the crowd size at
8,000. The man, who did not wish to be identified, said a number of
people were taking drugs and the drug he saw most was Ecstacy, a
synthetic hallucinogenic often associated with raves.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that some of the people he encountered told him
they were taking in the rave on their last weekend before returning
to school.
</P>
<P>
   The young man said parking on the winding mountain road
presented a major problem and that several motorists' cars were
towed.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of kids got stranded,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Aragon said the U.S. Forest Service had issued organizers a
permit to hold the rave at the site, which is below Mt. Waterman
and above the Buckhorn Campground, popular with families who pitch
tents by a winding creek through the forest.
</P>
<P>
   The mountainsides are so steep at the crash site that
firefighters had to rappel down to the wreck on ropes to find the
bodies.
</P>
<P>
   The California Highway Patrol closed the highway just after the
call and kept it closed throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
   In a process that took hours Sunday afternoon, a sheriff's
helicopter helped Los Angeles County coroner's deputies extract the
bodies.
</P>
<P>
   The manager of a mountain inn near the rave said she saw a
number of tow trucks in the area, but didn't know if there were
linked to motorists involved in the rave.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had at least eight tow trucks out here and they all have
cars on them,'' said Linda Duprey, manager of Newcomb's Ranch Inn
nine miles west of the rave site.
</P>
<P>
   Duprey said she was horrified by the amount of trash left in the
forest by partygoers. ``I used to party when I was young too, but I
wouldn't destroy a forest.''
</P>
<P>
   She said there was a smaller rave in the area a couple of weeks
ago.
</P>
<P>
   She also said a number of the partygoers stopped by her
restaurant the night before and in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   One girl told her ``My mom and dad are going to kill me _ my car
got stolen,'' Duprey said.

GENERAL CHALLENGE WINS PACIFIC CLASSIC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEL MAR, Calif. _ Just as owners John and Betty Mabee dreamed,
General Challenge looked like a new Best Pal as he ran away with
the Pacific Classic on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Better yet, he acted like a new General Challenge.
</P>
<P>
   On his toes (but not nervous) in the warmups, eager (but not
rank) in the first turn, the gelding displayed overdue maturity in
an authoritative, three-length victory that made him the first
3-year-old to win Del Mar's $1 million race since Mabee-owned Best
Pal in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's more relaxed. He's more mature,'' jockey David Flores
said after winning in front of 27,570 fans _ including many of
Flores' relatives from Tijuana, Mexico _ in perfect beach weather.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you saw today is just the tip of the iceberg,'' said
trainer Bob Baffert. ``This horse is going to get better.''
</P>
<P>
   Baffert horses ran 1-2 as River Keen and Chris Antley chased
General Challenge in the stretch without denting the winner's
three-length margin. Barter Town was third, and heavy favorite
Malek never kicked and came in fifth in the eight-horse field.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine what Baffert might have achieved if his Real Quiet
hadn't been forced to the sidelines during the spate of August
injuries that knocked a succession of favorites out of the Pacific
Classic.
</P>
<P>
   But the story, for once, wasn't Baffert. It was General
Challenge, the strapping Santa Anita Derby winner, taking a giant
stride toward fulfilling his promise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob has been saying the horse is a freak for about 10
months,'' John Mabee said during a ``toast to the winners''
ceremony on the grandstand roof. ``Today he ran to that. He is
special.''
</P>
<P>
   Normally, winning a Pacific Classic would automatically stamp a
horse as special. Not this year, after the injuries to Real Quiet,
Victory Gallop and Mazel Trick weakened the race, leaving an
all-local field.
</P>
<P>
   A horse would have to win in style to earn applause Sunday. The
son of General Meeting did that.
</P>
<P>
   After breaking ``half a step slow,'' by Flores' measurement,
from the inside post, General Challenge had his maturity tested
when he was momentarily caught in tight quarters behind leaders
Smile Again and Barter Town in the first turn. Flores wrestled him
back off their heels.
</P>
<P>
   ``It got a little tight, but he took it well,'' Baffert said.
</P>
<P>
   General Challenge was between horses on the backstretch when
Flores let him roll. By the far turn _ a half-mile from the wire _
they were knifing between the front-runners and in command.
</P>
<P>
   After that, the only question was whether General Challenge, a
troubled 11th in the Kentucky Derby, could keep the lead for the
rest of the 1\ miles. He answered it resoundingly, covering the
final quarter in a solid 25.38 seconds on his way to a good 2:00.57
clocking.
</P>
<P>
   The victory was worth $700,000, including a $100,000 bonus from
the ``NTRA Champions on Fox'' series. That lifted General
Challenge's 1999 earnings to $1,517,900, third in the nation behind
Charismatic and Behrens.
</P>
<P>
   It was worth more than that to the Mabees, who bred General
Challenge at Golden Eagle Farm in nearby Ramona, where Best Pal was
born and died.
</P>
<P>
   ``The original was something special,'' John Mabee, chairman of
Del Mar Thoroughbred Club, said of Best Pal's win in the inaugural
Pacific Classic. ``Maybe there was a little less joy and tears
(Sunday). Though Mrs. Mabee cried and I might have shed a tear,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Bob Baffert and David Flores made it a stakes double
Sunday, when leading 2-year-old filly Chilukki won the Vinery Del
Mar Debutante over on-rushing Spain and Gary Stevens. The 7-furlong
race was Chilukki's longest and the one-length margin was the
narrowest of her five consecutive victories. Chilukki drew $567,639
of the $635,711 bet to show. Princes Melissa jumped the rail early
in the 7-furlong race. She suffered cuts on her right shoulder.
Jockey Garrett Gomez appeared unhurt.... The pick-six paid $52,762
to each of 20 perfect tickets as Chilukki ($2.40) was the only
winning favorite in the sequence. Del Mar guaranteed a $1.5 million
pool and drew more than $1.8 million in pick-six bets.... Stevens
won the first race aboard Distant Venture in the Hall of Fame
jockey's return to Del Mar after riding in England for 2{ months.

A PICTURE IS WORTH 1,000 WEB SEARCHES
</HEADLINE>
  BY CAROLYN SAID &HT;    c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Doing research on jungle cats?
</P>
<P>
   Type ``jaguar'' in any standard Web search engine and you'll get
several hundred thousand hits, the top ones all about a certain
zippy sports car. You can scroll through pages of URLs, poring over
the text descriptions until you find some that are about wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   Or you can use a visual search engine that shows results as a
collection of thumbnail-size photos and illustrations. You'll see
at a glance which ones are the cat or the car.
</P>
<P>
   Visual searching isn't just for finding specific pictures,
though it is the best way to go if you need a certain image _ say,
the cover of the Beatles' ``White Album'' or a map of Australia.
It's also a way to cut through the clutter when you're searching
for information on concrete topics.
</P>
<P>
   ``A visual search is a much more effective and friendly way of
searching the Web,'' said Alexis Girard, president of Future Image
Inc., a San Mateo, Calif., firm that tracks digital imaging trends.
``With visual feedback, you know quickly whether you found what
you're looking for. With text searches, you can be overwhelmed by
the results.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, image-only searches can screen out some sites that
have terrific information but no graphics. And it won't work too
well if you're looking for information on abstract ideas.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest use of image searching is expected to be e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you search for a book on Amazon.com, you just see text
(on the search results page). If you saw the jacket front, it might
click with you more _ this is the book I want,'' said Bonnie
Brooks, an analyst with Creative Strategies in Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get catalogs in the mail, how many do you get that
are all text?'' said Bob Goldstein, author of a forthcoming report
on visual search for Future Image.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein used visual searching to help find a specific guitar
amplifier he wanted to buy. ``I was able to find exactly what I was
looking for in a faster and more elegant way by using images.
Seeing visual information is much better than reading through
endless lists,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Visual search, of course, also is the best way to find that
perfect picture: a daguerreotype of Abraham Lincoln for a book
report, a picture of a Harley for your personal Web page, a photo
of Janis Joplin for the invitation to your '60s-themed party.
</P>
<P>
   But once you find an image you like, all the visual search
engines say you should contact the picture's originating Web site
for permission to use it.
</P>
<P>
   Realistically, your daughter is unlikely to get in trouble for
pasting a picture of the Great Pyramids into a school report. But
if you take a photo of the Golden Gate Bridge and put it in your
company newsletter without permission, you're stealing copyrighted
material. And even putting an image you find on your personal Web
page is considered piracy.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for artists and photographers, the ease of digital
copying has led to an ``everything goes'' attitude about using
images found on the Web. ``It's like Xerox culture,'' said Barry
Parr, an analyst with International Data Corp. ``Lots of stuff is
getting used without attribution.''
</P>
<P>
   Visual search engines work by indexing the keyword tags that Web
masters put on their pictures; some also have staff members review
the pictures and add additional keywords.
</P>
<P>
   Three leading contenders offer visual searches of the Web. Each
has a somewhat different focus.
</P>
<P>
   AltaVista (www.altavista.com) offers visual search as an option
from its regular search page _ just click the word ``images''
directly above the query window. (You also can search for audio or
video files.)
</P>
<P>
   AltaVista takes an industrial-strength approach to cataloging
the Web. ``It's the best visual search engine for general-purpose
searches like cars or something else you want to buy,'' said
Goldstein.
</P>
<P>
   AltaVista has a ``strategic relationship'' with Corbis, the
image-collection company owned by Bill Gates. So it's likely to
give prominent display to the collection, which is strong on
historic and celebrity photos, as well as fine arts images. The
Corbis site will walk you through the process of buying rights to
use an image _ many start at $3 for personal use.
</P>
<P>
   AltaVista offers a ``family filter'' option for all its
searches. If you turn on the family filter, it will attempt to
screen out pornography.
</P>
<P>
   Ditto (www.ditto.com) also offers a comprehensive index of Web
images, with a special emphasis on family and education users.
``It's big on the things you would use in classrooms _ science,
historical material,'' said Goldstein.
</P>
<P>
   The site promises that its results will be G-rated. In other
words, if you search for ``Bambi'' or ``bunny,'' you won't see
pictures of Miss December.
</P>
<P>
   Besides keyword search, Ditto lets you browse images by 26
themes, from agriculture to travel, or by commonly searched words
like Britney cq  &LR; Spears.
</P>
<P>
   Snap (www.snap.com) offers the Ditto search engine on its site,
too.
</P>
<P>
   Scour (www.scour.net), backed by Hollywood superagent Michael
Ovitz, is a media-search tool for the Gen-X crowd. It lets you
search for MP3 files and video, as well as images. ``If you want
Nine-Inch Nails, or sports, go to Scour,'' Goldstein said.
</P>
<P>
   Scour search results are returned in small fish-eye-lens windows
that can be hard to see. In several informal tests, it returned
more ``broken'' links than its rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Two other contenders:
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo Image Surfer (ipix.yahoo.com) is surprisingly lean on
images, considering that Yahoo is the leading directory site. It
offers a keyword search and a browsable directory of six
categories: Arts, Entertainment, People, Recreation, Science and
Vehicles. For some mysterious reason, the keyword ``toaster''
brought up two images of a Yugo. ``Giraffe'' got four hits versus
100 on Ditto. And ``Abraham Lincoln'' got zero results on Yahoo
Image Surfer.
</P>
<P>
   Lycos (www.lycos.com/picturethis) lets you search the Web for
images but shows results as text. Talk about unclear on the
concept. The same URL also lets you search the Lycos Image Gallery,
a collection of photos that are free for personal or classroom use,
and available for a fee for commercial use.

   LOS ANGELES _ USC began installing its game plan for Hawaii by
holding a Sunday night practice in the Coliseum, and it's not a
moment too soon for quarterback Carson Palmer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're definitely not ready to play a game,'' Palmer said.
``We've got to smooth some things out. I think we need to focus on
the penalties, mental errors and stuff like that.''
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere of the game is something that concerns coach Paul
Hackett. He felt the Trojans were distracted by too many activities
in El Paso during the Sun Bowl and believed it contributed to the
embarrassing loss to Texas Christian. That's one reason USC will
not leave for Honolulu until Thursday, two days before kickoff.
Social events also will be limited when USC arrives in Hawaii, with
a trip to Pearl Harbor the only officially planned event.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be weird going there. We're not going there for
leisure activities,'' Palmer said. ``I think (at the Sun Bowl) it
was more that nobody wanted to be there. Nobody wanted to be in El
Paso. People were bored.''
</P>
<P>
   No captain, no problem: One name conspicuously missing from
USC's list of team captains is R. Jay Soward. But the senior wide
receiver said he didn't mind being overlooked by his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not to say I don't want to be a captain, but I didn't deserve
it,'' Soward said. ``I wasn't always here in the summer with the
team. I understand. I can respect my teammates' decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Play-calling: After calling plays on his own almost exclusively
last season, Hackett said there will probably be more give-and-take
between himself and offensive coordinator Hue Jackson this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach Hackett and Coach Jackson are going to be on the headset
together,'' Hackett said. ``We will be one year better at that
whole process. I imagine the natural process will be where Hue will
do more and more, and I will do less and less.''
</P>
<P>
   Who's playing?: Hackett said he would like to play seven or
eight freshmen. So who made the cut?
</P>
<P>
   Wide receivers Marcell Allmond, Kareem Kelly and Steve Stevenson
will all play. Defensive tackle Bernard Riley and defensive back
Darrell Rideaux are also guaranteed playing time. The big surprise
is defensive end Omar Nazel, who is expected to share playing time
with sophomores Lonnie Ford and Kori Dickerson.

campaign contributions and his alpine perch in polls convey the
impression of an irreversible groundswell of support for his
candidacy for the Republican presidential nomination, interviews
with dozens of men and women who attended his campaign events this
week told a different, less emphatic story. ``It's ridiculous to
make a decision at this point,'' says Tom Sims, a health care
consultant who generally votes for Republicans. ``I couldn't even

SPORTS COLUMN: FOR THREE RANKED TEAMS, A COSTLY WEEKEND 
</HEADLINE>
 
(CORRECTS to Tomey in 4th graf.) (rk) 
 By JOE DRAPE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Football in the summertime plays
something like this: 31 turnovers, five blocked kicks and as many
as seven missed place kicks. Those were the combined totals of the
10 teams, six of them ranked, that played this weekend, long before
the arrival of the crisp autumn afternoons that are synonymous with
the college game.
</P>
<P>
   The players and coaches of Arizona, Ohio State and Texas
probably wish they had waited for the chill of fall air. They were
the most flagrant offenders of these self-inflicted casualties and
will pay for it when the polls are released and their rankings
plummet.
</P>
<P>
   For Arizona and Ohio State, respectively ranked No. 4 and 9 in
The Associated Press preseason poll of writers and broadcasters,
the long-term repercussions of their losses are far more
devastating. Both had national title aspirations; now both must win
their 11 remaining games and watch the scoreboard week after week,
hoping for upsets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know today how Dick Tomey felt yesterday,'' Ohio State's
John Cooper said, referring to the Arizona coach. Cooper's Buckeyes
lost Sunday, 23-12, to Miami in the Kickoff Classic at Giants
Stadium, done in by four fumbles, a missed field goal and a missed
extra point. Tomey's Arizona Wildcats lost Saturday, 41-7, in the
Pigskin Classic at Penn State.
</P>
<P>
   The risks coaches talk about in opening early against dangerous
opponents showed themselves in this game and throughout this
college football weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Summer practices are geared toward conditioning and teaching new
players the complicated wrinkles of offensive and defensive
schemes. The teaching comes at the expense of concentrated,
full-speed hitting and scrimmaging.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State, Arizona and Texas, No. 17 in the preseason poll,
looked ill-prepared to bang all-out against equally pumped-up
opponents before more than 70,000 fans. It showed most clearly on
special teams, where new players and backups are expected to
execute precise snaps, kicks and coverages.
</P>
<P>
   Very few of the teams did so over the weekend.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Andy Crosland of Miami and Dan Stultz of Ohio State missed three
of five field goal attempts Sunday. On Saturday, Notre Dame
deflated Kansas by blocking a second-half field-goal attempt that
could have cut its lead to 20-16. Instead, the 18th-ranked Fighting
Irish drove 34 yards for a touchdown and went on to a 48-13 rout.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's loss started to get out of hand because of
special-teams errors. Arizona had answered Penn State's opening
touchdown with a 63-yard drive, but Mike McDonald missed a 40-yard
field goal attempt _ the first of two misses for the day. In the
second quarter, the Nittany Lions blocked a punt that led to a
touchdown and put them up, 24-0. It was an awful item on a laundry
list of mistakes, but it pretty much told Tomey what he was in for
the rest of the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were very poor in the kicking game,'' he lamented. ``We
were a poor tackling team. They outhit us. They were tougher, more
physical. Everything that is good in football and you want to be,
they were better at.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas blew its game against unranked North Carolina State in the
final three and a half minutes when the Wolfpack's Terrence Holt
blocked a punt and Eric Leak returned the ball 48 yards for a
touchdown and a 23-20 victory. It was Holt's second block of the
night and North Carolina State's third. Leak batted one that was
recovered for a safety.
</P>
<P>
   Miami Coach Butch Davis had special teams and turnovers in mind
when, after his No. 12 Hurricanes upset the Buckeyes in a victory
for his resurrected program, he grimaced about his team's two
missed field goals and four turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't play better next week than we did today, this will
be a short-lived happiness,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   This opening weekend was not a total loss for highlights. The
Hurricanes' Santana Moss caught three passes for 115 yards,
including a spectacular 67-yard touchdown to end the first half.
Two other wide receivers headlined the trailers for what shapes up
to be another topsy-turvy season.
</P>
<P>
   Florida State's Peter Warrick ran for 41 yards and a touchdown
and caught nine passes for 121 yards in the top-ranked Seminoles'
41-7 victory over Louisiana Tech. Penn State's Chafie Fields ran
three reverses for 110 yards and a touchdown and caught three
passes for 76 yards and another score.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, last weekend was mainly a stumbling, bumbling affair
played in the heat of summer. But a couple of things did occur that
were predictable. Penn State coach Joe Paterno warned the faithful
not to be too ebullient about the team's dominating performance
against a top five team.
</P>
<P>
   The Nittany Lions play a tough Akron team next, he reminded
them.
</P>
<P>
   And on the airwaves and in the press boxes, the first argument

divisive: was Penn State's 41-7 victory more impressive than
Florida State's 41-7 victory? Should the Nittany Lions replace the
Seminoles as No. 1?

   The fringes of Hurricane Dennis began lashing the Carolina coast
with gusts and rain Sunday, prompting the pre-emptive evacuation of
more than 30,000 vacationers and residents from North Carolina's
barrier islands and forcing swimmers out of the water as far north
as Long Island, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   With the center of the storm and its 105-mile-an-hour winds 150
miles off the coast of Wilmington, N.C., on Sunday night, residents
and officials were bracing for the worst, and North Carolina's
governor, James Hunt, declared both a state of emergency and a
state of disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``What that does is activate our state emergency operations
plan,'' said Tom Loree of the state Division of Emergency
Management.
</P>
<P>
   The National Weather Service predicted that the storm would turn
toward the northeast in the night and said it could miss the coast.
But if a turn came later, the hurricane could head directly toward
the North Carolina beaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are confident in our predictions that it will turn,'' Bob
Chartuck, a spokesman for the National Hurricane Center, said
Sunday afternoon. ``We just don't know when or how fast. It could
barrel into North Carolina and then turn. But there are steering
wind currents, and we expect those to come down and push the storm
out to sea.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, preparations continued up the coast, with Virginia
Beach and two beaches on Long Island's South Shore closed to
swimmers, and more rescues of swimmers than usual reported in rough
waters off Ocean City, Md.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday afternoon, the hurricane was bearing down on North
Carolina at 13 mph. But by 9 p.m., state emergency officials said,
it appeared to be losing momentum.
</P>
<P>
   ``The storm has stalled and stalled and stalled,'' said
Catherine Henry, a spokeswoman for the state Emergency Response
Team. ``In the past two hours, it has moved only five miles.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, a hurricane warning remained in effect for the North
Carolina coast from the South Carolina state line to Oregon Inlet,
near Nags Head. A tropical storm warning extended from Oregon Inlet
north to Chincoteague, Va., and south as far as Savannah, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasters were predicting up to 5 inches of rain for the
Carolinas as the storm neared land, with higher amounts possible on
the coast. They said that tides would most likely rise several feet
higher than normal even if the storm veered off.
</P>
<P>
   Because of possible storm surges, which can cause flooding and
block roads, more than 20,000 people were evacuated from Ocracoke
and Hatteras, the delicate barrier islands of the Outer Banks north
of Wilmington, said A.C. Joyner of the North Carolina highway
patrol.
</P>
<P>
   Farther south, near Wilmington, more than 10,000 people were
evacuated from Carolina Beach, Wrightsville Beach, Kure Beach and
Figure Eight Island, said Andre Mallette, a spokesman for the New
Hanover County Emergency Management Agency in Wilmington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if we don't get a direct hit,'' Mallette said, ``we are
expecting hurricane-force winds, so we issued the mandatory
evacuation of our barrier islands at noon today to avoid nighttime
evacuations.''
</P>
<P>
   Up and down the Carolinas, residents and business owners went
through the familiar drills of boarding up houses and stores.
Thousands of tourists who had hoped to spend the second-last
weekend of the summer season at the beach packed up their cars and
reluctantly headed home, taking their dollars with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a bunch of cancellations today and we've lost 10 to
12 thousand dollars,'' Keli Black, a hotel employee in Charleston,
S.C., told CBS News.
</P>
<P>
   Businesses in North Carolina complained that the state was
overreacting by ordering the evacuations, but Robert Carver, a
spokesman for the Division of Emergency Management, said officials
would rather be safe than sorry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody knows exactly where this storm is going,'' Carver said.
``We are trying to find a happy medium between overreacting and not
reacting appropriately.''
</P>
<P>
   For Mike Murphy, a state environmental program manager in
Virginia, it was the second straight year that a storm forced the
family to evacuate during a vacation in North Carolina. Last year's
culprit was Hurricane Bonnie.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very disappointed,'' Murphy, 45, said as he and his wife
and twins arrived in Wilmington after being evacuated from Topsail
Island, about 30 miles to the north. Around noon Sunday, their
rental company called and said they had to be off the island by 8
p.m. While Murphy and his wife packed, the children watched videos.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did this last year, so they know what to expect,'' Murphy
said. ``I guess they're hurricane veterans now.''
</P>
<P>
   Farther north, red flags prohibiting swimming flew over Virginia
Beach, although the beaches stayed open, the police said. The
authorities also canceled a fireworks display that is a regular
fixture at the beach in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   In Ocean City, beaches remained open Sunday, but rough water
kept the beach patrol busier than usual, with more than 200
rescues, said Lt. Mike Stone of the Ocean City Beach Patrol.

<P>
   In the New York metropolitan region, the sun was out, but the
combined forces of Hurricane Dennis and Hurricane Cindy, which is
more than 400 miles east of Bermuda, caused waves big enough to
prompt the state Parks Department to close two Long Island beaches
_ Jones Beach and Robert Moses State Park _ to swimmers, though
sunbathing was allowed.
</P>
<P>
   By 1 p.m., 5-to-7-foot swells had calmed enough that some
beaches allowed wading up to the waist, but no farther, said George
Gorman, a director of recreation services for the Parks Department.
</P>
<P>
   High tides also washed out a beach road used by fishermen at
Democrat Point in Robert Moses State Park, Gorman said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the restrictions, the crowds were actually about 10
percent to 20 percent above normal for this time of year, Gorman
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We put up signs at the toll plazas warning people, but they
didn't turn around,'' he said. ``It turned out to be a great beach
day.''
</P>
<P>
   In North Carolina, two county-run emergency shelters were opened
at 3:30 p.m. Sunday in Wilmington. All city and county offices,
courts and all public schools will be closed Monday in the
Wilmington area.
</P>
<P>
   Even though people along most of the South Carolina coast were
assured that they would avoid a direct hit from the storm, Gov. Jim
Hodges urged coastal residents to be aware of the damage that could
come even if the storm blew by.
</P>
<P>
   With the potential for high wind and water damage, a tropical
storm warning was issued for the South Carolina coast. Shelters
opened in northern South Carolina coastal counties on Sunday as
well.
</P>
<P>
   In Litchfield, S.C., south of Myrtle Beach, a property manager,
Bobby Warner, oversaw precautionary measures at the Litchfield By
the Sea resort. Workers were busy boarding up buildings and
securing outdoor furniture.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are being very careful,'' Warner said. ``We have been
through this many times before and have learned to err on the side
of caution. We've pretty much got this down to a science.''
</P>
<P>
   At Alligator Adventure in North Myrtle Beach, the management was
being cautious. The 15-acre park houses more than 800 alligators.
To ensure that none would escape in the storm, workers reinforced a
fence surrounding the park with steel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst-case scenario,'' said the alligator park's manager,
Matt Burmeister, ``is that some may get out of their individual
pens, but they are not getting out of our park.''
</P>
<P>
   But for a crew of students from Clemson University, driving four
research vans to Wilmington, the object was to get close to the eye
of the storm. Their vans were pulling trailers carrying towers that
they hoped to place in the hardest-hit areas on land to measure the
wind speed of the strongest part of the hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to get an accurate measure of wind speed on the
ground,'' said Don Key, 22, a civil engineering student.
``Typically, winds are measured at high levels, but we are trying
to see the wind speeds at house level so we can write more accurate
building codes.''

<P>
   What's with this ``Enjoy'' business? It's getting to the point
where a person can't stop at the neighborhood lunch counter for a
simple BLT without the waitress serving it up with an exhortative
``Enjoy!''
</P>
<P>
   From a patronizing little French bistro to the local takeout,
there's no escaping it.

<P>
   ``Bagel with a schmear and a decaf to go. Enjoy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Your salad of field greens with vinaigrette, madam. Enjoy.''
</P>
<P>
   The pretzel vendor on the corner: ``Here ya go, lady. Enjoy.''
</P>
<P>
   The other night we went to a diner for dinner. A diner! The
grilled chicken and Caesar salad was set down in front of me with
the obligatory ``Enjoy.'' I asked the waitress for a cup of tea _
she brought an empty cup and saucer, a chrome pot of hot water and
a tea bag with string hanging down the side. It came with a slice
of lemon and an ``Enjoy.'' Later she stopped by to refill my cup
with hot water. No clean cup and saucer. No fresh lemon slice.
Nevertheless, over my shoulder she called out the ubiquitous
``Enjoy.''

   It was at the entrance to the platform of an uptown E train, Art
Samansky says, that much to his amazement he saw a well-dressed
woman, probably in her late 50s or early 60s, kneel, slip under the
turnstile, walk casually onto a train and take a seat. He was
standing in front of her, holding on to the overhead bar, as she
reached into her handbag and took out a Bible. She crossed herself
and began to pray. He's still wondering whether it was for the sin
just committed or insurance for future infractions.

   It was Sunday, and Lee J. Hilton was driving to a West Side flea
market to look for an antiquelike end table. After circling for
some time he finally found a parking space opposite the Museum of
Natural History. As he got out of his car, a car with Connecticut
plates pulled alongside. The driver lowered his window and said:
``I'll give you $100 for your parking space. I've been driving
around for over an hour to park and my family is inside the museum
waiting for me. It's worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Hilton was dumbfounded, he thought: Why not? ``Show me
the money,'' he said. The man took out a $100 bill. Hilton
inspected it _ why, he didn't know, because he couldn't tell
whether it was counterfeit. Still, what did he have to lose but the
parking space? He took the money and drove off. First thing Monday
he was at his bank. The bill was good. It hasn't happened since.

   The death of Victor Mature earlier this month and the mention of
his wry humor reminded Bix Janni of an incident that occurred about
10 years ago in Saks Fifth Avenue. It was early morning, the store
was practically empty and Janni realized that the only other
occupant of the elevator he was in was Mature.
</P>
<P>
   Janni smiled. Mature smiled back. Neither spoke. Just before the
doors closed, a well-preserved woman of a certain age rushed in.
She spotted Mature and without a second thought addressed him.
``You look just like Victor Mature, but you can't be him because
he's dead,'' she said.

   NEW YORK _ There was little doubt who the Liberty's emotional
leader was when watching Teresa Weatherspoon prod the crowd along
with her teammates at Madison Square Garden on Sunday night. But as
much as the Liberty got from Weatherspoon's enthusiasm, maybe it
received just as much of a lift from a quietly emotional Kym
Hampton. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hampton could not hide her fear before Game 2 of the Women's
National Basketball Association's Eastern Conference finals against
the Charlotte Sting, with the Liberty having lost the opener and
Hampton faced with the reality that this could be the final game of
her career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was talking to Kym about it, and she kind of got tears in
her eyes,'' Crystal Robinson said. ``This could be her last game.
We don't want the season to end like this.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the final minutes, Hampton, the 36-year-old center, came up
with just about every big play. Scoring six of the Liberty's final
nine points, drawing a crucial offensive foul and blocking one of
the Sting's final shots into the seats, Hampton enabled the Liberty
to live for another night with a 74-70 victory in front of 13,510
in the best-of-3-game series.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The decisive game will be played Monday night at the Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton finished with 11 points and 10 rebounds against the
talented and physical frontline of the Sting. It was Weatherspoon
who got the Liberty to the final minutes, scoring a season-high 19
points and handing out nine assists. Andrea Stinson, Charlotte's
5-foot-10-inch guard, led all scorers with 27 points. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, who had carried the Liberty through much of the first
game, had just six points in the first half. But as the game
appeared to be slipping away, she began to make her presence felt
once again. She delivered a 3-pointer to snap a 5-0 Sting run,
cutting the Liberty's deficit to 65-63. Then Weatherspoon tied the
score with a jumper with 3 minutes 45 seconds to play, and Hampton
scored in the paint to give the Liberty the lead. With the Liberty
leading by 71-70, Hampton then followed a miss by Robinson with 57
seconds left. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Liberty had placed itself on the brink of elimination by
fading in the second half of Game 1, a 78-67 loss at the Charlotte
Coliseum on Friday night, after securing first place in the East
and home-court advantage in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   If the pressure seemed to hang over the Liberty before Sunday
night's game began, it only intensified in the second half as what
looked like an early celebration turned into an affair that was far
too close for comfort down the stretch. After a questionable call _
a jump ball that was awarded when Hampton hammered Vicky Bullett to
the floor _ the Liberty appeared to have the Sting on the ropes.
Charlotte coach Dan Hughes was called for a technical foul, which
the Liberty could not convert. Even though the Liberty won the jump
ball, it turned the ball over on the other end, missing a chance to
increase its 47-37 lead. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Sting recovered to run off a 13-4 burst to close
the gap to 51-50 with 10:31 remaining. And Dawn Staley, who had
missed her first five field-goal attempts, hit a 3-pointer from the
left corner to tie the game at 58-58 with 7:58 to play, the first
time that the Sting had pulled even since 2-2.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberty had controlled the action for most of the first half
in Game 1 and was able to do that again. Weatherspoon, who had been
hampered by foul trouble in the second half of the opening game as
things slipped away, picked up her first foul 44 seconds into this
game and had her second before the game was five minutes old. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Liberty coach Richie Adubato left her on the floor for 18 of
the 20 minutes in the first half and it paid off as she scored a
team-high nine points, knifing through the defense for three layups
and then connecting from beyond the arc with 1:45 left to help the
Liberty gain a 39-29 advantage.
</P>
<P>
   She also was able to contain Staley, who had just one point in
the half, shooting 0 for 4 from the field. &QL;

   NEW YORK _ Injuries at amusement parks are rare, but when they
happen they can be serious, even fatal. The U.S. Consumer Product
Safety Commission reported in June 1998 that out of 36 deaths that
occurred on amusement rides from 1987 to 1998, 21 occurred at
amusement parks.
</P>
<P>
   Some recent amusement-ride accidents in the New York
metropolitan region:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; AUG. 28, 1999 &LR;  A 39-year-old woman and her 8-year-old daughter
are killed after being thrown from a roller coaster at an Ocean
City, N.J., amusement park. A 25-year-old woman and 7-year-old boy
suffer minor injuries.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; JUNE 11, 1999 &LR;  A 17-year-old girl is killed, and eight other
people are injured, after being thrown from a circular ride called
the Super Himalaya at Coney Island.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MAY 16, 1999 &LR;  At Six Flags Darien Lake, in Darien Center, a
37-year-old man is thrown from the Superman Ride of Steel roller
coaster, but suffers only minor injuries.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; JUNE 26, 1998 &LR;  Thirteen people are hurt, none seriously, when a
roller coaster malfunctions and stops abruptly at Mariner's Landing
in Wildwood, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; AUG. 14, 1995 &LR;  A maintenance worker is killed in North
Wildwood, N.J., after his head is struck by the foot of a passenger
on a roller coaster. The passengers were strapped into their seats,
but their legs were allowed to dangle. The worker had been clearing
trash.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; JULY 29, 1995 &LR;  Thirteen people are injured, two critically,
when they are thrown from the Hell Hole ride on Coney Island. The
ride's malfunction is attributed to metal fatigue.

   Charles Hall, an engineer who supervised some of the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration's early scientific
penetrations into deep space, died Thursday in a hospital in
Mountain View, Calif. He was 79 and lived in Los Altos, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, said John Dyer, a longtime colleague of
Hall's at NASA.
</P>
<P>
   Hall was widely known for having overseen the flawless flybys of
the planets Jupiter and Saturn by the unmanned spacecraft Pioneer
10 and Pioneer 11 in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Such exploration,'' Dyer said, ``quickly and at low cost, was
then essential to establish the feasibility of future in situ
exploration of the outer planets and deeper space.''
</P>
<P>
   The two spacecraft flew on for billions of miles, and
instruments on board gathered data until the early 1990s concerning
the influence of the sun on its part of the galaxy. The data proved
to be precious for scientific research.
</P>
<P>
   Hall was the man in charge of building and operating Pioneer 10,
a dish-shaped, 570-pound spacecraft, which was launched in 1972
from Cape Kennedy, Fla. It was the first spacecraft to travel
beyond Mars and the first to traverse the Asteroid Belt between the
orbits of Mars and Jupiter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pioneer 10's trip through the Asteroid Belt was the first
demonstration that that journey could be accomplished by a
spacecraft without destroying itself by colliding with particles of
asteroids,'' Dyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Pioneer 10's rendezvous with Jupiter in 1973 was the first close
examination of the solar system's largest planet. The data gathered
by Pioneer 10 have been used by scientists to design equipment like
the Galileo spacecraft, which is orbiting Jupiter and photographing
its moons.
</P>
<P>
   From Jupiter, Pioneer 10 traveled out of the solar system and
into interstellar space. Data it gathered have taught scientists
about the workings of the sun's magnetic field and the movement of
gases it emits.
</P>
<P>
   Pioneer 10 is now billions of miles from the sun, and it is
still sending back data to scientists at NASA.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview in 1973, Hall, an amiable, white-haired man with
dark eyebrows and a ruddy complexion, said: ``It's great fun, the
space business. If I had it to do over again, I'd do exactly the
same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   His relaxed, old-shoe manner, associates said then, belied an
inner toughness necessary to get a spacecraft built, launched and
tracked to its destination.
</P>
<P>
   Hall founded NASA's Pioneer Project Office at the agency's Ames
Research Center at Moffett Field, Calif., and managed it from 1963
until his retirement from NASA in 1980. The office directed the
development and the operations of Pioneer 10 and Pioneer 11, which
was the first spacecraft to reach Saturn, and other spacecraft.
</P>
<P>
   Commenting after Hall's death, NASA's administrator, Daniel
Goldin, lauded his intelligence and persistence. ``Charlie Hall's
Pioneer 10 craft may be over 6.8 billion miles from Earth,'' Goldin
said, ``but his spirit will always be with us at NASA.''
</P>
<P>
   The honors Hall received included two of NASA's Distinguished
Service Medals and the Achievement Award of the American
Astronautic Society Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Hall was born in San Francisco, grew up in the Bay Area and
received a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering in 1942 from
the University of California at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   From 1942 to 1960 he was with the National Advisory Committee
for Aeronautics, NASA'S predecessor, at Moffett Field, working as
an aeronautical research scientist and later on space projects.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Connie, whom he married in 1942;
three sons, Dr. Steven Hall of Sonora, Calif., Charles Hall III,
known as Frederick, of Pine Grove, Calif., and Frank Hall of
Portola, Calif., and 12 grandchildren.

JOHNSON AND GREENE RUN INTO HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
 (ms) 
 By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service     
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; SEVILLE, Spain _ It is too late for Michael Johnson or Maurice
Greene to run against Carl Lewis. Lewis, the American who cast the
longest shadow over the track and the field for more than a decade,
is retired and busy running a business instead of running in a
lane.
</P>
<P>
   But as first Greene and then Johnson grabbed the baton for the
anchor leg of the two men's relays Sunday night, they were still
competing in a symbolic sense with Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Greene would catch him; Johnson would pass him, and both their
predictably remarkable efforts would produce gold medals for the
United States on the final night of the track and field world
championships.
</P>
<P>
   When Greene received the baton from Brian Lewis, the American
400-meter relay team was in second place behind the British, but
the world's fastest man would prove much faster than Britain's
anchor, Dwain Chambers. As Greene roared past Chambers and across
the finish line, he was soon celebrating his third gold medal of
these championships. The only other man to win three in one year at
this event was Lewis, who did it in 1983 and 1987.
</P>
<P>
   ``That feels good,'' said Greene, who also won the 100 and 200
here. ``I've always said I wanted to take what Carl Lewis did a
step further.''
</P>
<P>
   When Johnson received the baton from Angelo Taylor in the
1,600-meter relay, there was nobody in front of him, and Taylor,
like everyone else in the stadium, was certain it would stay that
way. Taylor stuck an index finger in the air as Johnson, who broke
the world record in the 400 on Thursday night, sprinted toward the
first curve. Johnson won by nearly 2.5 seconds, and in the process
he won his ninth gold medal in the world championships: one more
than the record total Lewis managed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm honored,'' Johnson said. ``It's a testament to what I've
tried to do in my career: to be consistent, to go to every world
championship at the top of my game and go in to win.''
</P>
<P>
   The gold medal in the 1,600 was the third consecutive for the
Americans in this event, and Johnson has anchored each effort.
Sunday night's time of 2 minutes 56.45 seconds was the seventh
fastest of all time.
</P>
<P>
   But while Johnson and his fellow 400-meter runners have long
prospered together, the American sprinters have not. Dropped batons
kept them from advancing beyond the heats in the 400 at the last
two world championships, and at the 1996 Olympics they were beaten
by Donovan Bailey and the Canadians.
</P>
<P>
   This year the relay team trained together in Monaco before
coming to Seville, and if their passes tonight were not bold or
polished enough to allow them to beat the world record of 37.4
seconds, they were certainly good enough for the gold medal in
37.59, the fifth fastest ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our main concern was getting the stick in my hands, and we did
that,'' Greene said. ``We did safe handoffs, not as good as they
could have been. But the U.S. has had problems in the past, and we
wanted to wipe those problems away.''
</P>
<P>
   The American women were not able to build the same kind of
continuity and camaraderie. Marion Jones, who was supposed to
anchor the 400-meter relay, injured her back in the 200 on
Wednesday. The Americans replaced Jones with Nanceen Perry and
moved Gail Devers from the second leg to the anchor leg. But the
initial pass from Cheryl Taplin to Perry was bumbled, and by the
time Devers got the baton from Inger Miller, the Americans were in
third place. Christine Arron of France outraced Devers to the
finish line, and the American women were fourth. The team from the
Bahamas took the gold medal in 41.92 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't meant to be,'' said Devers, who received treatment
on her hip after her victory in the 100-meter hurdles on Saturday.
``I tried to do my best, but my best today wasn't good enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Jones's absence, Taplin said, ``I wish she could
have been here, and it probably would have been a different story
if she were, but things happen and we have to go on.''
</P>
<P>
   The American women's 1,600 team took the silver medal behind the
Russians and might have won if the German anchor, Grit Breuer, had
not slightly clipped the heels of Jearl Miles-Clark as Miles-Clark
was making a move to overtake Natalya Nazarova in the final
stretch. The German apologized, and there was no protest. The
Russians won in 3:21.98, with the Americans in 3:22.09.
</P>
<P>
   But that close race was not quite as close as the men's 800, won
by the reigning champion Wilson Kipketer of Denmark by the slimmest
of margins over Hezekiel Sepeng of South Africa. Sepeng led down
the stretch before Kipketer, who had started the race poorly,
desperately made up ground, lunging past him at the finish line to
win by two-hundredths of a second in 1:43.30.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the best kick I've seen in my life,'' Sepeng said.
</P>
<P>
   The Olympic champion Svetlana Masterkova of Russia demonstrated
a typically fine kick to win the women's 1,500 in 3:59.53. Regina
Jacobs of the United States ran a personal best of 4:00.35 to take
the silver.
</P>
<P>
   ``You watch the U.S. in the sprints and you can think it's easy
to get a gold here,'' Jacobs said, ``but I am the only American to
get a distance medal, so in the scope of the world, I think it's
tremendous.''  &QL;

AT 20, ESPN CELEBRATES SUCCESS IN A SMALL, GRATEFUL TOWN 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By MIKE ALLEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRISTOL, Conn._ Back in 1978, when television sets came with
rabbit ears, city leaders here were so proud of the fledgling
company they had just landed that they put up a big wooden sign
welcoming the ``ESP Network.''
</P>
<P>
   Even after locals learned that their new neighbor went by ESPN
and planned to offer sports, not psychics, the concept of cable and
satellites remained exotic. Farmers phoned City Hall to find out if
they could charge the new network for air rights over their land,
to allow passage of the scores and highlights that would soon be
spit heavenward by the big white satellite dishes.
</P>
<P>
   Some people worried that beams from the saucers might fry birds,
or even trees. On foggy nights, mischievous residents took visitors
down to the squat, brick birthplace of ESPN and tried to convince
them that the three lonely satellite dishes were ``alien
transports.''
</P>
<P>
   At 7 p.m. on Sept. 7, 1979, ``Sportscenter,'' television's first
daily sports news program, went on the air, followed by ESPN's
first live event: a slow-pitch softball doubleheader. The early
days also featured such treats as Australian-rules football,
tractor pulls, Thai kick boxing, model-plane racing and even a
darts match, complete with throw-by-throw commentary.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years have passed, along with more than 21,000 episodes
of ``Sportscenter.'' The three satellite dishes now have 22
friends, all lined up along Middle Street like intergalactic
catcher's mitts.
</P>
<P>
   And ESPN, which now rakes in well over $1 billion a year and
which analysts say is more profitable than the ABC television
network, is still here in the woods of central Connecticut, where
millionaire athletes arrive by limousine for interviews and then
must decide whether to dine at Friendly's or the Ground Round.
</P>
<P>
   Besides serving as the greatest aid to male bonding since the
invention of the beer, ESPN is credited with transforming the
relationship between America's teams and their fans. No longer
stuck with home-team highlights from a local station, the
``Sportscenter'' generation started following teams all over the
country, helping to drive up the value of franchises. Northerners
began watching stock car racing, and Southerners tuned in to
hockey.
</P>
<P>
   It was all driven from this town of 60,000, with a night life
centered on the Bristol Ten Pins, where on Fridays and Saturdays
the overhead lights go down and the area's working class bowls in
the spooky flashes of colored lane lamps reflecting off whirring
mirror balls.
</P>
<P>
   People in Bristol are not simply grateful that ESPN has stayed
put, gobbling up land and adding building after building to
accommodate ESPN 2 (``The Deuce,'' to fans), ESPN Classic, ESPNews,
ESPN Radio, ESPN.com, ESPN the Magazine, ESPN the Store, ESPN in
Spanish, ESPN in Portuguese and, beginning Sept. 7, a new ESPN
pay-per-view and ESPN the promo channel.
</P>
<P>
   They are stunned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm honored that they're here _ in fact, I'm humbled,'' Mayor
Frank N. Nicastro Sr. said.
</P>
<P>
   The network started with 70 employees and now has 2,100, 1,500
of whom work in Bristol, including the star anchors. ESPN officials
say most of their on-air personalities live within 20 minutes of
Bristol.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, the network began its anniversary celebration by holding
mock ``NFL 2Night'' auditions for guests, who were issued name tags
emblazoned ``Bristol University,'' after the network's cheeky
football promotions. At 7 p.m. on Sept. 7, the network will
broadcast a three-hour 20th anniversary special including bloopers,
a retrospective of ``Sportscenter'' fashions and a segment
comparing New York and Bristol.
</P>
<P>
   During its heyday in the Industrial Age, Bristol was America's
cradle of clock making. After those factories died, Bristol became
the bicycle bell manufacturing capital of the world, but eventually
those plants closed, too. Now Bristol exports springs _ and
``Sportscenter.''
</P>
<P>
   Jason Klemyk, 25, an insurance claims analyst who has lived in
Bristol all his life, plans to show his gratitude by rounding up
his buddies on the night of the anniversary special and heading for
the bar at the Radisson Inn, down the road from the Broadcast
Center, hoping to run into a Hall of Famer or maybe even a
``Sportscenter'' anchor.
</P>
<P>
   Who will pay for the drinks?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll hook them up,'' he said, ``just for being here.''
</P>
<P>
   ESPN landed here by a fluke. William Rasmussen, a former
spokesman for the New England Whalers, a hockey team then based in
Hartford, thought it would be neat to transmit Whalers and
University of Connecticut games throughout the state.
</P>
<P>
   To pursue his idea, he rented a room in the United Cable office
in Plainville, which is next to Bristol. Plainville had an
ordinance against satellite dishes, so when United decided to
switch to dish reception, it bought a patch of land in Bristol.
</P>
<P>
   Rasmussen figured that if it was a good spot for United, it
would be a good spot for him, and he inquired about the adjoining
parcel. The land was owned by the Bristol Redevelopment Agency,
which had promised it to a man who planned to build a mini-storage
warehouse. Rasmussen begged the agency to hold on to the land while
he tried to scrape together $18,000 to buy it.
</P>
<P>
   By a vote of 5-4, ESPN was allowed to set up shop in Bristol.
(The network now is, of course, by far the town's largest
taxpayer.)
</P>
<P>
   According to network lore, when Rasmussen plunked down his
Mastercard to reserve satellite time, RCA officials pointed out to
him that it would be almost as cheap to broadcast to the whole
country as to just Connecticut. That was the beginning of the
Entertainment and Sports Programming Network, which in 1985 became
simply ESPN Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Rasmussen raised the money by selling an 85 percent interest to
Getty Oil. Now ABC Inc., a subsidiary of the Walt Disney Co., owns
80 percent of ESPN, and the rest is held by the Hearst Corp.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ESPN was two months old when Sports Illustrated ran a withering
review titled ``The 24 Hours of Plainville.'' Since then,
``Sportscenter'' has become so well known for witty, allusion-laced
writing that in a column in 1996, George Will described it as ``the
thinking person's `World News Tonight.''' Catch phrases like ``put
the biscuit in the basket'' and ``Houston _ hello!'' ring out in
fraternity houses and gyms throughout the land.
</P>
<P>
   Cementing its iconic status, ``Sportscenter'' has been parodied
by ``Saturday Night Live,'' which replicated the set, graphics and
urgent ``Da! Da-da! Da! Da-da!'' theme music. ABC created a whole
sitcom, ``Sports Night,'' based on ESPN's signature show.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen years after the snippy review, Sports Illustrated ran a
``To Our Readers'' box announcing that it was essentially copying
ESPN and joining with Cable News Network to create CNN/SI, a ``new
24-hour cable sports network.'' A ``Sportscenter'' clone, ``Fox
Sports News,'' is broadcast on the regional sports stations that
Fox has built into _ go figure _ a 24-hour cable sports network.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Ley, who joined the network on its third day and remains one
of its best-known personalities, says the isolation of Bristol
helped produce the network's breezy style. ``If we had been in
L.A., they wouldn't have been hiring 24-year-old kids who could
pick up and move in two weeks,'' Ley, 44, said in his office, where
a silent television monitor was tuned to CNBC. ``We were all thrown
together here, with nothing else to do.''
</P>
<P>
   ESPN officials cite a variety of reasons for staying. Labor and
other costs are lower than they would be in a big city. Many
members of the young staff that founded the network have married
and had children, and now like raising a family in ``bucolic
Bristol,'' as it is sometimes called on-air. And the labyrinth of
studios, editing suites, radio booths and satellite dishes has
become so complex that moving it would be a mind-boggling
undertaking.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Bristol officials readily admit that they will do just
about anything for ESPN. In the early years, when the network
needed a building but had no money, the city bought the building,
then leased it to the network. ESPN needed a helicopter pad, so the
city built one. City, state and Federal funds are being poured into
an $8 million road improvement project around the 43 acres that now
make up ESPN Plaza.
</P>
<P>
   When ESPN officials were concerned that traffic noise would mess
up segments for the anniversary special that were being taped in
front of the Broadcast Center last week, officials closed the road
for six hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here, ESPN is the king,'' said John J. Leone Jr., executive
director of the Greater Bristol Chamber of Commerce. ``In New York,
ESPN would just be another network.''
</P>
<P>
   ESPN's president, George W. Bodenheimer, says he has no plans to
move. ``I'd be hesitant to disturb something that isn't broken,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The network is branching out. It has the ESPN Zone, a grill and
interactive entertainment center, in Baltimore and Chicago, and
plans to open one in Times Square on Sept. 14. ESPN also manages
some events, including the five-year-old X Games, which showcase
extreme sports like sky surfing and snow-motocross.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN stars have occasionally caused a local ruckus by referring
to Bristol as Godforsaken, or best viewed in a rear-view mirror.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Gentler Bristol humor is a network staple. In a promotion
spoofing a spate of team relocations, an ESPN official announces
that ``Sportscenter'' will be moving to ``the city of the future _
Bristol, Connecticut,'' praising its abundance of free parking and
``the availability of high-quality fruits and vegetables.'' A
ponytailed local skips up to the huge ESPN complex in knee-high
overalls, bearing a basket of produce.
