 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
FOR two decades, Richie Phillips led major-league umpires down a
path to power, privilege and riches. Through strikes and threatened
work stoppages, the umpires' union leader raised their salaries
tenfold, to $200,000 and more, while lengthening in-season vacation
time from zero to five weeks.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But this summer, the Philadelphia lawyer embarked on a course
that might cost the jobs of one-third of his union _ and his own as
well. Fearful the commissioner's office would change their working
conditions when a collective-bargaining agreement expires Dec. 31,
the umpires, whose labor contract has a no-strike clause, resigned
en masse, effective Sept. 2.
</P>
<P>
   When 12 union members in the American League refused to walk out
and 25 Class AAA minor-league umps were hired by the major leagues,
the union position crumbled. All resignations were rescinded within
two weeks of their issue, but Major League Baseball chose not to
rehire 22 umpires.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner Bud Selig got what he wanted _ the right to hire
and fire umpires. No more Eric Gregg. No more Ken Kaiser.
</P>
<P>
   But players dispute the popular notion that umps are
interchangeable and unimportant and that the departing ones are no
better than the newly hired minor-leaguers.
</P>
<P>
   ``These umpires are the best in the United States at what they
do,'' said the Astros' Jeff Bagwell. ``You take me out of a game
and put in a minor-leaguer, and it makes a difference. You take out
a major-league umpire and put in a minor-league umpire, and that
makes a difference, too. The calls on pitches, plays at certain
bases _ those determine the outcomes of ballgames. You want the
best possible umpires to make those decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   The umpires' union is in civil war, and that's not necessarily
good for baseball. As it stands, the national pastime will enter
its September stretch run with 25 minor-league umpires on full-time
duty.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the veteran umpires who were retained are suspect.
Privately, baseball officials admit politics got priority over
performance.
</P>
<P>
   Among the keepers: 14, led by Joe Brinkman and John Hirschbeck,
who issued a statement denouncing union leadership for ``a flawed
strategy that was doomed to fail from the beginning. The advice to
quit jobs in order to keep them made no sense at all.''
</P>
<P>
   AL president Gene Budig informed nine umpires their resignations
would stand: Kaiser, Drew Coble, Jim Evans, Dale Ford, Rich Garcia,
Ed Hickox, Mark Johnson, Greg Kosc and Larry McCoy.
</P>
<P>
   NL president Leonard Coleman notified 13 umpires that they won't
be needed after Sept. 2: Gregg, Joe West, Tom Hallion, Terry Tata,
Bob Davidson, Bill Hohn, Frank Pulli, Larry Poncino, Gary Darling,
Bruce Dreckman, Larry Vanover, Paul Nauert and Sam Holbrook.
</P>
<P>
   There were injustices. In an offseason poll by the players'
union, Garcia was ranked as the AL's third-best umpire and Coble
ranked sixth. In the National League, Pulli, 64, is one of the most
respected of arbiters. So is Darling, 41 and a 12-year veteran of
the major leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the league rehired Charlie Williams, rated by the
players as the NL's worst.
</P>
<P>
   &QC;
</P>
<P>
   So how did it all come to this?
</P>
<P>
   By threatening a walkout, Phillips hoped to draw Sandy Alderson,
Major League Baseball's vice president of operations, to the
negotiating table while the umpires had some leverage _ the
lucrative postseason looming. There were many issues to be
negotiated, but the key one is job security.
</P>
<P>
   ``The attitude in the past has been that even the umpires who
aren't that great are still better than anybody we could replace
them with,'' Phillips said. ``The attitude has never been to
improve umpiring by firing umpires. But that's the new mindset.''
</P>
<P>
   The union had reason to be confident in its negotiating
strategy. In two previous umpires strikes and a lockout, the
amateur replacements were so distractingly inept that the baseball
owners caved in to Phillips.
</P>
<P>
   But this time, Phillips, 58, failed for several reasons.
Foremost, he overestimated support from his union members.
</P>
<P>
   National League umpire Randy Marsh said the resignation plan
``didn't turn out to be the right move, because we had our
defectors. Our association fell apart when the American League guys
went the other way.''
</P>
<P>
   With his own union split, Phillips had no chance of organizing
the minor leagues. So Alderson could offer full-time jobs and snare
Class AAA umpires who had big-league experience as summer fill-ins
for vacationers.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Hooper, a Houston labor lawyer, said Phillips also was
hampered by the mixed reviews players gave his umpires. Ballplayers
are among the world's most ardent union supporters _ as long as
it's their own union.
</P>
<P>
   ``Immediately after the resignations,'' Hooper said, ``I heard
David Cone (All-Star pitcher for the Yankees) say, `Maybe we'll get
somebody up here who can actually call the strike zone.'
</P>
<P>
   ``The public statements of players have not been supportive of
the umpires, and that's surprising. They gave the impression
they're not going to bad-mouth the replacement umpires and thereby
jeopardize the validity of the games they'd be playing with
replacement umpires.''
</P>
<P>
   Most players are staying out of the umpires' squabble because
they don't want to expand the war. And some of the stars resent the
way umpires beseech them for autographed bats and balls, claiming
they are for charity causes. Even so, the players generally prefer
the devil they know to the newcomers they don't.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get used to each umpire; you get to know them and how they
call a game,'' the Astros' Billy Wagner said. ``With new guys, you
just don't know. I think after a couple of years it would be fine.
But I think it will take a couple of years. That's the way it goes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Say it's a tight situation and it's me facing Mark McGwire and
I throw him some good pitches. A new umpire, being in awe of
McGwire, may give him calls. Whereas if you have a veteran umpire
back there calling them straight up, you know you don't have to
groove the ball down the middle to get a strike.''
</P>
<P>
   &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Phillips isn't giving up the fight. But his former ally,
baseball labor icon Marvin Miller, doubts he can prevail in court.
Miller said the umpires ``put themselves in a very difficult
position because they gave the owners so many options and so many
weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts criticized Phillips for filing suit in
Philadelphia, in the court of U.S. District Judge Edmund Ludwig,
who last week refused to force Major League Baseball to hire back
all his umpires.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of going to Ludwig, Phillips could have sought
protection from the National Labor Relations Board.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally, in a case where a union alleges unfair labor
practices, the National Labor Relations Board has original
exclusive jurisdiction,'' Hooper said. ``So he wouldn't have been
able to prosecute that assertion in the courts prior to going
through the National Labor Relations Board.''
</P>
<P>
   But for all his tactical blunders, Phillips has failed because
he succeeded so well in the past. He negotiated the lengthy
vacations that allowed replacement umps to gain the big-league
experience that made Alderson's strategy feasible.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the job security Phillips acquired for his union
members, the minor-league umps saw little hope for advancement.
They jumped at the opportunity to join The Show, even if it meant
undermining Phillips and his union.
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen who represents the umpires in future labor
negotiations. Phillips' foes tried to replace him with Baltimore
player agent Ron Shapiro during a union meeting in Phoenix in
March. Phillips emerged with a five-year contract, but the 14 who
voted against him are haunting him.
</P>
<P>
   American League umpire Dave Phillips, one of the insurgents,
said: ``I want the image of umpires to change. We act like we are
gangsters all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro, who denies wanting to head the umpires' union, is much
less bellicose and abrasive than Phillips.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've learned that confrontational bargaining is the worst
thing you can do,'' Shapiro has said. ``My philosophy of
negotiation is that to get what you want, you have to strategize
about how to help the other side get some of what they want.''
</P>
<P>
   &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Along with behind-the-scenes maneuvering by the warring factions
of umpires comes iciness on the field. Hohn said he felt betrayed
by fellow umpires who rescinded their resignations ahead of the
Phillips supporters. Marcia Montague, wife of NL ump Ed Montague,
wrote a letter to Hirschbeck's wife, Denise, calling her husband
``Judas.''
</P>
<P>
   The league presidents, Coleman and Budig, then sent memos
threatening umpires with disciplinary action for ``illegal threats,
intimidation or harassment of other umpires.''
</P>
<P>
   The presidential directive, hardly conciliatory, referred to
``the illegal mass resignation plan'' of Phillips.
</P>
<P>
   Hooper said the mass resignations probably were legal, but they
``violated their no-strike agreement. So the individuals who
participate in that action are not protected by the National Labor
Relations Act, which generally protects people engaging in
concerted activity.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps belatedly, Phillips this week asked the NLRB to file
suit against Major League Baseball for unfair labor practices that
he said ``were designed to break the umpires.''
</P>
<P>
   He has charged that umpires were offered up to $2 million in
future gains if they joined the anti-Phillips faction. He also
claimed the umpires' labor contract was violated when they were not
offered assignments to games between the Baltimore Orioles and the
Cuban national team.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips has accused Major League Baseball of illegal
retaliatory action with its ``arbitrary and capricious'' dismissal
of umpires. The NLRB will review the complaint but is unlikely to
respond by Sept. 2.
</P>
<P>
   So the war goes on, and the players are caught in the crossfire.
Games will be decided by inexperienced umps and by veterans who are
bitter about losing their livelihoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all have too much pride to go out there and try to do a bad
job,'' Darling said. ``We're going to be second-guessed a bit more,
because people will wonder if our concentration might not be there.
But I know we'll all focus hard, as always.''
</P>
<P>
   The microscope will be on these lame ducks for three more weeks.
And then, unless the NLRB and federal courts rescue them or the
owners show mercy, they will vanish from the major-league stage.
</P>
<P>
   At the most critical juncture of the season, the game will be
jangled by shaky officiating. The umpires' union is in disarray,
but has the sport gained? That's not an easy call.

 By ALAN TRUEX  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
Gary Darling is not the stereotypical umpire who baseball wants to
excise. He's not fat. He's 6-3, 208 pounds and athletic. He's an
avid golfer and basketball player who played college baseball. He's
not confrontational, so you don't see him on highlight films.
<TEXT>
<P>
   He does his job quietly and competently, seldom drawing
criticism. When players list the best umpires in the National
League, Darling invariably is mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   He was one of the fastest risers in his profession _ in the big
leagues at 30. Now he's 41, married, a father of two _ and possibly
about to be unemployed.
</P>
<P>
   He's not a rabble-rousing union leader, just a loyal follower.
He's a model employee you would think the league would want to
keep. But he's one of 13 NL umpires to be discharged, effective
Sept. 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was never told why I was one of the 13,'' Darling said,
standing outside the umpires' dressing room in the Astrodome.
``There's a wide variety of guys _ middle-of-the-road guys, young
guys. One was hired this year, so he couldn't be doing that bad. I
don't know what the criteria was.''
</P>
<P>
   Major League Baseball is mum, other than to say it didn't want
to decrease the percentage of minority umpires.
</P>
<P>
   To deflect charges of illegal retaliation in a labor dispute,
the league retained union president Jerry Crawford, who was rated
the No. 1 NL ump in an offseason poll of the players' union. Also
rehired was union activist Bruce Froemming, who ranked near the
bottom in the poll.
</P>
<P>
   A major shock was the banishment of Frank Pulli, a 28-year
veteran and one of the most consistent of umpires. But this season
he incurred the wrath of the baseball lords when he violated rules
by viewing a television replay before making a call on whether a
ball was a home run or a double.
</P>
<P>
   Also dismissed was the much-respected Tom Hallion, but that was
attributed to one notorious misstep: He bumped Colorado catcher
Jerry Reed and was suspended for three games in July.
</P>
<P>
   That suspension, by league president Len Coleman, was one of a
series of incidents that incited umpires to vote July 14 to resign
en masse. When they withdrew their resignations, 22 major-league
umps were not hired back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it was fair the way they treated us the whole
time,'' Darling said, ``starting with last November when they tried
to force things down our throat with (standardizing) the strike
zone and centralizing us, without going through the proper
channels.''
</P>
<P>
   Major League Baseball wants umpires from both leagues to be
supervised by Sandy Alderson of the commissioner's office. With
interleague play, it makes sense to have centralized umpiring and a
standardized strike zone, and the umpires are not necessarily
opposed to those concepts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would be more than willing to listen,'' Darling said. ``But
they're unilaterally trying to take over, trying to break the
collective-bargaining agreement and trying to break our union.''
</P>
<P>
   Union chief Richie Phillips is making those claims in asking the
National Labor Relations Board to sue Major League Baseball for
unfair labor practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some guys don't agree with the things Richie is doing for
us,'' Darling said. ``But we've got 44 guys sticking together, and
we need the solidarity. I've talked with guys on the other side,
and hopefully we can all pull back together.''
</P>
<P>
   The union is trying to gain the support of the 25 minor-league
umpires hired by Alderson as full-time replacements for the
departing veterans. Darling said Hunter Wendelstedt, a replacement
umpire on his crew who is the son of longtime NL umpire Harry
Wendelstedt, has promised to honor a work stoppage if Phillips
calls for one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hunter and all the other new National League guys have said
they're not going to work if we go out,'' Darling said.
</P>
<P>
   But he's not sure about the American League, which has 11
veteran umpires seeking to remove Phillips.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American League guys (replacements) say they don't look at
it as being scabs if they do work,'' Darling said.
</P>
<P>
   He has no idea why National Leaguers are more union-loyal, but
it might be because the union is headquartered in Philadelphia, a
National League city. NL umps have more contact with Phillips.
</P>
<P>
   Darling admitted the replacements, from Class AAA, are more
capable than the amateurs hired in the past to break strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They do a fine job when they have the veteran umpires around
them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The implication is they won't do so well if 13 NL veterans
depart.
</P>
<P>
   If Darling loses his job, he's due more than $300,000 in
severance. But umpires with less than 10 years' tenure will draw no
golden parachutes. They face the prospect of earning $12,500, tops,
as minor-league umpires.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been an emotional roller coaster for me and my family,''
said Darling, who lives in Phoenix. ``My wife is supporting me, and
sometimes I'm having to support her, because we don't know what
will happen. Even if the legal system works in our favor like I
think it will, the way baseball is going, they might have different
umpires next year _ if they get what they want and can fire guys
easily.''

 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
Shane Reynolds played the guessing game with the Los Angeles
Dodgers.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Dodgers lost.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds pitched a five-hitter for his seventh career shutout
Thursday as the Astros completed a three-game homestand with a 7-0
victory over the Dodgers before a crowd of 38,018 at the Astrodome.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros won for the 10th time in 13 games and extended their
lead in the National League Central to 2{ games over Cincinnati,
which lost 2-1 to the Colorado Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds (14-7) struck out six and walked none in his third
complete game and second shutout of the season. Rarely behind in
the count, Reynolds retired 16 of the final 17 Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was keeping them off balance,'' catcher Paul Bako said. ``I
don't think they knew what he was going to start off with or finish
them with. He was throwing all four of his pitches for strikes.
When you get a guy taking a fastball for a third strike, that means
you've got them guessing.''
</P>
<P>
   Ismael Valdes matched Reynolds for six innings before the Astros
finally solved the Dodgers righthander.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Russ Johnson had three hits, including a home run that
snapped a scoreless tie and ignited a six-run seventh inning.
Johnson added a double and a single, getting within a triple of
becoming the first Astro to hit for the cycle since Andujar Cedeno
in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't score for a long while, but when Russ hit the home
run I figured the way Shane was pitching, that would have been
enough,'' said Bako, who had two singles.
</P>
<P>
   Since struggling in mid-June, Reynolds has won seven of his last
eight decisions, including three in a row. Reynolds has allowed no
more than five hits in any of his last three starts, giving up only
one earned run (0.38 ERA) in 24 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles had runners at second and third in the first inning,
but Reynolds worked out of the jam with a strikeout of Todd
Hollandsworth. The Dodgers' only other substantial scoring
opportunity was blocked in the fourth when center fielder Richard
Hidalgo gunned down Gary Sheffield at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a few mistakes early, but after that I got into a
rhythm,'' said Reynolds, who has not issued a walk in his last 16
innings. ``I was in the dugout thinking, `One run may win this game
on either side.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros didn't test the theory, opening the floodgates for
six runs off Valdes and relievers Alan Mills and Pedro Borbon in
the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   With one out, Johnson connected for his fourth home run of the
season _ a bases-empty shot to left field.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes (8-10) walked Jeff Bagwell, one of a season-high six free
passes he gave up, and Mills came in and walked Derek Bell. Lance
Berkman followed with an RBI double, and Hidalgo walked to load the
bases.
</P>
<P>
   Then Matt Mieske just missed his second grand slam of the season
with a deep foul fly to left. But he was effective nonetheless,
with a two-run pinch double off Borbon to put the Astros ahead 4-0.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Bogar got a run home with an RBI single, and Reynolds bunted
home the final run of the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Glen Barker drove in the seventh run with a single in the
eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell had a double and walked three times.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the late run support, the talk in the Astros'
clubhouse dealt with Reynolds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today wasn't so good,'' manager Larry Dierker joked. ``I can't
say enough about the starting pitching. You sometimes win fans with
home runs and big scores, but you win games with pitching and
defense. You win championships with pitching and defense.''
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, Dierker didn't think twice about letting
Reynolds go for the complete game. After the long seventh inning,
pitching coach Vern Ruhle noticed some stiffness in Reynolds'
warm-up pitches in the eighth. And Reynolds was approaching 100
pitches.
</P>
<P>
   But like he has done all season, Dierker left Reynolds in the
game, the pitch count stopping at 123.
</P>
<P>
   ``(I told Vern), `If we get to 100 pitches, we'll start counting
backward,''' Dierker said. ``So he ended up with 85 pitches, which
was well within his limit.''

 By TERRY BLOUNT  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Some boys dream about hitting a home run in the
World Series. Others imagine making a diving catch in the end zone
to win the Super Bowl, and some stand on their driveway and pretend
they just sank the winning 3-point shot in the NBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
   Like so many other boys across America, Tony Stewart also grew
up with a dream of becoming a sports hero. But Stewart's dream
wasn't about hitting a ball, making a catch or sinking a shot.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart's childhood fantasy was to someday win a race at the
historic speedway that is only 50 miles north of his boyhood home
in Columbus, Ind.
</P>
<P>
   He wanted to race in the Indianapolis 500, a goal he
accomplished in 1996 at age 25. Stewart has made four starts in the
Memorial Day weekend event, but his dream of taking the checkered
flag at Indy has eluded him.
</P>
<P>
   The 28-year-old driver will get another shot to win at Indy on
Saturday, and many racing fans believe it's his best chance. But
this time, Stewart will be competing at the Brickyard in a car with
fenders and bumpers.
</P>
<P>
   The guy who grew up watching the Indy 500 will be one of the top
contenders in the Brickyard 400, hoping to guide his Home Depot
Pontiac to a victory on his personal field of dreams.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I can win in front of the hometown crowd, it would be
great,'' said Stewart, who will start on the inside of row 6 after
qualifying Thursday at 178.348 mph. ``I could see them all cheering
for me today in the grandstands. You never know what can happen,
but really, I'd like to make any racetrack my first win.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody asks about Indy like I've got a choice in it.
Brother, if I can win a race, I'm going to win a race. I don't care
where it is. I'll sure take it this week if I can get it.''
</P>
<P>
   The thought of winning a race is something most Winston Cup
rookies can't imagine. It usually takes a few years before a driver
can learn all the things he needs to know to win at NASCAR's
highest level. But Stewart's rookie season has been one of the best
in Winston Cup history. Even Jeff Gordon and Dale Earnhardt as
rookies can't compare to what Stewart has done this year.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart has put the No. 20 Grand Prix in the top 10 at 11
events, including five times in the top five. He is fifth in the
points standings (one spot ahead of Gordon) and is likely to become
the first rookie to finish in the top 10 since Jody Ridley in 1980.
Stewart is on pace to become the first rookie in history to finish
in the top five in points.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tony Stewart is a great driver,'' said TV analyst Buddy Baker,
a former Winston Cup driver. ``He can drive anywhere, on any
surface. It doesn't matter if it's dirt, pavement, a road course,
whatever. He's also the bravest racer I've ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   The only thing Stewart hasn't done so far this season is win,
but it appears likely he will see Victory Lane soon. No rookie has
won a Winston Cup race since 1987, when Davey Allison did it twice.
Allison became a top driver, but he died in a helicopter crash in
1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``Davey had his time, and we all enjoyed it,'' said his father,
Bobby Allison. ``Now it's Tony Stewart's time, and the guy is
really good.''

   Stewart came painfully close to his first win last month at New
Hampshire. He had a 17-second lead with two laps to go when he ran
out of fuel. After the race, a bitterly disappointed Stewart
received some rare bad publicity when he refused to meet with
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get that close to a major goal and something happens
that's beyond your control, it's disappointing,'' he said. ``I was
so consumed with the emotion about what happened. Unless you're a
race-car driver, it's hard to understand how much emotion is
involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I hadn't run out of there. I just didn't do the right
thing. I've taken some grief over it, and I deserved it. I know I
have to deal with the good days and the bad, but I just hope people
will see the big picture. Sometimes you do or say things in the
heat of battle that you wish you could take back.''
</P>
<P>
   Racing fans have seen Stewart's emotional outbursts in the past,
especially at Indianapolis when a blown engine or another
mechanical problem kept him from having a chance to win the Indy
500.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart managed to win the Indy Racing League championship in
1997, but he already had decided to make his future in NASCAR. He
felt he wasn't getting the opportunity to make the most of his
talent, and his frustrations showed at times.
</P>
<P>
   ``After three years (in the IRL), I wasn't a very happy
person,'' Stewart said. ``And I didn't appear to be a very nice
person.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart opted to take the same route that Gordon took when he
left the short tracks of Indiana after racing against Stewart when
both drivers were teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people compare us (as Winston Cup rookies), I correct
them quickly,'' said Gordon, the top rookie of 1993 and a
three-time Winston Cup champion. ``I tore up a whole lot more race
cars than he has. I wasn't as smooth or as patient.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Gibbs hired Stewart to drive a Busch Grand National car in
1998 (while Stewart raced a full IRL schedule) before moving
Stewart up to Winston Cup this season. Gibbs admits he never
expected so much so fast from Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he would make a ton of mistakes,'' Gibbs said. ``We
thought we would have a lot of cars to fix because we thought he
would have some wrecks.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the most surprising thing about Stewart's season is that
he has managed to finish every race and stay away from accidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a meeting, and I told Joe that for every car I don't
crash, he can just pay me an extra bonus,'' Stewart said with a
grin. ``That's when the meeting ended.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart wants to keep his car in one piece Saturday and give
himself a chance to earn his first victory. But he said he won't be
overly aggressive to try to win at Indy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it doesn't happen, I don't think it will be a great
disappointment to us,'' Stewart said. ``Actually, I'm amazed at
where we are as a team. The main thing is we're in contention all
the time, so the wins will come. When the year began, I would have
considered 20th in the points to be a successful season. I still
would.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't bet on it, not for a guy as competitive as Stewart. Racing
is more than a career for Stewart; it's his life.
</P>
<P>
   He was the first driver to win the United States Auto Club
triple crown in the same year (1995) by winning titles in midgets,
sprints and Silver Crown cars. Earlier this year, he became only
the second driver in history _ joining John Andretti _ to compete
in the Indy 500 and the Coca-Cola 600 on the same day.
</P>
<P>
   After his disappointment at New Hampshire, Stewart healed his
sadness the next day by racing on a dirt track in Knoxville, Iowa.
After he finished sixth in the Pepsi 400 on July 3 at Daytona, he
came home to Indiana the next day and won a late-model stock-car
race in Terre Haute.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like I was a kid in a candy store,'' Stewart said. ``I
was so excited. I hadn't won a race since last year. Winning is
winning. It doesn't matter where it is or what kind of car it's in,
the feeling is the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart said by the time he was 12, when he won his first
national go-cart championship, he knew what he wanted to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I put all my eggs in one basket,'' he said. ``I didn't go to
college, because I wanted to pursue a racing career. Everything in
my life has been focused for this. I don't know what I would have
done if it hadn't worked out. I'd probably be picking up aluminum
cans.''
</P>
<P>
   With $1.2 million in earnings this year, Stewart won't be
looking for added income any time soon. It's likely the best is yet
to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are variables that are important in your career, like
being in the right place at the right time with the right people
and the right equipment,'' Stewart said. ``If you take one of those
variables out, you won't be as successful. Those variables are all
in place for me now. That's all you can ask for as a driver. If you
do your best each week, the victories will happen. Maybe even at
Indy.''

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
THE Astros won for the 66th time Thursday, which left them tied for
the major-league lead and happens to be more victories than they
ever have accumulated after 109 games.
</P>
<P>
   Were they the team they were supposed to be in spring training _
never mind the team they might have been had Randy Johnson stayed
on or Roger Clemens deigned to come home _ this information would
startle no one. But under the circumstances, it's borderline
miraculous. Even preposterous.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll just keep pinching ourselves,'' Craig Biggio said, ``and
hope we can keep it going. Eventually, we'll get everybody back.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Bidge, who needs everybody? Your Astros routed the fat-cat,
dog-like Dodgers 7-0 behind Shane Reynolds and the New Orleans
Zephyrs.
</P>
<P>
   Other than Reynolds, whose masterful five-hitter was at least
somewhat in line with the expectations for a staff ace on a
twice-defending division champion, Houston's heroes were the Killer
B-team _ Paul Bako, Lance Berkman, Tim Bogar and Glen Barker _ plus
fellow bit players Russ Johnson and Matt Mieske.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's scary,'' Biggio said, resisting the temptation to pinch
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Of that group, only Bogar, a career .230 hitter, surfaced in
Kissimmee last February with a better than 50-50 chance of breaking
camp on the Astros' roster.
</P>
<P>
   Here's some real irony for you. In the Astros' six-run seventh
heaven of a seventh inning, the superstar second baseman Biggio
grounded out and flied out in his two plate appearances. Johnson
homered to start the onslaught. Berkman, who is headed back to New
Orleans today to make room for Carl Everett, and Seattle discard
Mieske contributed run-scoring doubles.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds, with a squeeze bunt, and Bogar added the other RBIs.
Bogar at shortstop also thwarted a likely first-inning Dodgers run
by spearing Mark Grudzielanek's screaming liner.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting contributions from the entire roster,'' Biggio
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone we've called upon,'' manager Larry Dierker said,
``has found a way to do something to help us win.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros went a franchise-record 102-60 last season ``by
beating everyone's brains out,'' Biggio said. ``We were a lot
better team last year than we are this year. It became a very
special season. But this season is starting to get pretty special,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   Off-the-charts special, it would appear. Playing what Biggio
calls ``little ball'' _ ball that features superb pitching, tight
defense, sound fundamental strategy and timely contributions at the
plate _ the Astros keep coming up big. Win No. 66 might have been
the Astros' most typical to date.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's game was exactly, to a T, what the '99 Astros are all
about. Apparently, their opportunism knows no bounds.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Hidalgo, scuffling along at the plate with a .226
batting average, prevented two Dodgers runs with his sharp play in
center field, cheating Eric Karros out of a first-inning RBI with
extra-effort hustle on Karros' double, then cutting down Gary
Sheffield at the plate with a perfect strike following Raul
Mondesi's fly ball in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shane obviously pitched extremely well,'' Dierker said. ``He
made it look easy, and it's not easy to get a complete game, much
less a shutout, the way baseball is played today. But he needed a
lot of help to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Little of which was forthcoming from the usual suspects to
provide it. Biggio led off with a single but was nailed at second
trying to stretch it into his 47th double, then went hitless the
rest of the way. The Dodgers took the bat out of Jeff Bagwell's
hands by walking him thrice. Cleanup man Derek Bell was 0-for-4
with three K's.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Moises Alou and Ken Caminiti, those eternal
rehabbers, occupied their normal seats in the dugout, as did
Everett. At least Everett will be back for today's doubleheader in
Chicago, which is why Berkman's two-base hit would be his last
National League hurrah until an anticipated September call-up.
</P>
<P>
   Unless, of course, somebody else gets hurt before then. And the
way things have gone, somebody probably will, although the Astros
don't figure to miss a step or break a sweat. Where there's a will,
there will be a way. How do you explain Barker, a .245 hitter in
the minors with most of his experience at the Class AA level or
lower, batting .316 as a part-time NLer? You don't. You simply
applaud it and celebrate it.
</P>
<P>
   Biggio was asked which kind of winning was more satisfying _ the
conventional biff-bash style of a year ago or the
all-hands-on-deck, chewing-gum-and-spit approach of late. He
decided not to choose.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winning, is winning,'' he said. ``I'm always happy when we
win.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps. But surely this way provides an extra tingle.
</P>

NFS DECISION TO AFFECT TOURISTS AND CANYON WORK ERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK SHAFFER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLAGSTAFF _ The National Forest Service will announce a decision
today that could dramatically alter northern Arizona tourist
patterns as well as give Grand Canyon park workers a decent place
to live.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, officials have wrangled over the fate of Tusayan,
the Canyon's gateway community, which has been little more than a
pit stop for overpriced hamburgers.
</P>
<P>
   This morning, regional forester Eleanor Towns will either
approve Scottsdale developer Tom De Paolo's plan to build the large
scale Canyon Forest Village, or a smaller, Tusayan landowner-backed
project called FaeX.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the decision, it will be a day of anguish for the
hospitality industry in Flagstaff and Williams, which relies on
Grand Canyon tourism for its livelihood. Flagstaff is 75 miles and
Williams 50 miles from Tusayan, which is only a few miles away from
the Canyon's South Rim.
</P>
<P>
   If the Canyon Forest Village alternative is approved, an
additional 1,220 hotel rooms could be added just outside the
Canyon's gate.
</P>
<P>
   On the flip side, workers at Grand Canyon, most of whom have
been relegated to living in substandard shacks inside the park,
will have an alternative. Both plans call for construction of
residential housing.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the 1,220 hotel rooms, the Canyon Forest Village
proposal calls for the development of 270,000 square feet of retail
space and 1,100 housing units for local employees only.
</P>
<P>
   The CFV project also will include 20,000 square feet of retail
space for Native American merchants and 29 acres dedicated to
Flagstaff's Museum of Northern Arizona for a visitor-orientation
center about the history of the Colorado Plateau.
</P>
<P>
   De Paolo said he and his inves tors would exchange 2,200 acres
of land they own in the area for 282 acres of Forest Service land
between Tusayan and the park boundary, where the development would
be built.
</P>
<P>
   The FaeX plan calls for the construction of 400 new hotel rooms
and 250,000 square feet of retail space along with an undetermined
number of housing units.
</P>
<P>
   All of the state's major environmental groups have backed the
project, except the Sierra Club, which has concerns about
groundwater depletion in the Canyon area. The Havasupai and Hopi
tribes have also blessed the CVP project.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a nice coalition of diverse groups, which we hope will
shape the future up there,'' De Paolo said. ``We've waited eight
years for this, but this last day is the toughest.''
</P>
<P>
   De Paolo said that CFV has a contract with the Central Arizona
Project to bring in 61 million gallons of water a year from the
Colorado River at the community of Topock. The water would be moved
by rail from Topock to Williams and then sent by pipeline to
Tusayan.
</P>
<P>
   The Coconino County Planning and Zoning Commission and Board of
Supervisors are required to approve the development after the
Forest Service's decision before any building can begin.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Roush, a consultant for CFV, said it would take four years
to complete the project after the county's approval.
</P>
<P>
   But Tusayan and Williams business owners hope that never
happens. Tusayan hopes its plan will win out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not afraid of competition,'' said Chris Thurston, who owns
the Red Feather Lodge in Tusayan.
</P>
<P>
   But Thurston said that the Forest Service would ``give away
valuable land'' if it approves CFV and make it ``so we're no longer
on the same playing field.''
</P>
<P>
   The CFV effort is nothing but a land grab, Williams Mayor Jim
Hoffman said. Hoffman's wife owns a large portion of private land
in Tusayan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cow pasture they're getting for that is worth (much
less),'' Hoffman said, referring to the land proposed for exchange
by the CFV investors. And Williams could lose half a million
dollars a year in tourism if De Paolo gets his way, Hoffman added.
</P>
<P>
   If the Forest Service endorses Canyon Forest Village, Thurston
and Hoffman said they will fight it in court. &UR;  &QL;

DISMISSED NURSES EXPANDING X-RATED BUSINESS ON WEB

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A husband-wife nurse team fired Thursday by a Scottsdale
hospital for running an X-rated Web site aren't giving up their
business, they're expanding.
</P>
<P>
   George Miller says he's posted suggestive pictures of his wife,
Tracy, in her role as ``the very touchable Dakota Rae'' on 250 free
X-rated Web sites every day since the couple were suspended July 1
by Scottsdale Healthcare Osborn.
</P>
<P>
   The pictures contain a link to the Millers' Web site, where
surfers are invited to become members who may view explicit sex for
$14.95 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Hits on the site reached 48,000 on July 29, the day the Millers
appeared on the Howard Stern radio show in &UR; New York City, one of a
half-dozen media outlets that have aired the couple's story.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing I can say about this is that one door has opened
another door, and so on,'' George Miller said. ``I never thought
this would be this big.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller, 33, of northeast Phoenix, said hospital officials told
the couple they were being dismissed because they tried to recruit
fellow employees to appear on the Web site. The couple denied it.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital termination notices say the Millers, who worked as
on-call intensive care nurses, were being fired for violating
hospital policy by harassing other staff members and ``creating a
hostile or offensive working environment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm upset; this is all lies,'' said Tracy Miller, 32.
</P>
<P>
   Tracy, who had worked at the hospital for three &UR; years, and
George, who had worked there for two, say they earned $92,000 at
the hospital last year, and that the Web site is now their sole
source of income.
</P>
<P>
   Kay Sperduti, a hospital spokes woman, declined Thursday to talk
about the Millers' case because hospital policy forbids &UR; public dis
cussions of a specific personnel issue. She said the Millers' case
was the first of its kind in her 13 years at the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The Millers have three days to appeal the hospital's action and
said they plan to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have made a huge mis take,'' George said. ``This battle
has just started.''
</P>
<P>
   A Winter Park, Fla., lawyer whose firm specializes in defending
the owners of adult Internet sites said Thursday that he will be
representing the Millers without charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is this: It was an inappropriate, illegal
termina tion,'' attorney Lawrence Walters said. ``The hospital
fired them because they didn't like the Web site. It had nothing to
do with their work.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides the Stern show, the couple have appeared in the past
month on TV and radio shows, including CBS' Morning News, Court TV,
Extra and Inside Edition.
</P>
<P>
   The Millers will appear in an Aug. 24 Fox TV network show and
have been approached by the TV news show 48 Hours, they said.
</P>
<P>
   The couple tout their publicity on the Web site, telling surfers
that they have ``seen her on TV and read about her in the
newspaper.''
</P>
<P>
   The Millers have even used their dismissal from the hospital to
lure more members to their Web site. The opening page now says,
``X-rated porno nurse fired.''
</P>
<P>
   The site also has a special e-mail link for reporters to contact
the couple.
</P>
<P>
   George Miller said 150 hospital employees have become members of
the site in the past month.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to the Web site can see photos of ``Dakota Rae'' in
nurse's garb, sitting at a computer bare chested, and lounging by
the swim ming pool. More explicit pictures are shown only to
members. George Miller, known on the site as ``Da kota Rae's''
husband, ``Jack,'' ap pears in the members' section of the site
engaged in sexual activity with his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Miller said the number of paying members has hovered around
2,200 for the past three months.
</P>
<P>
   The Millers could make more than $100,000 a year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   They say they started the Web site three months ago to make
money for their children's college educations. They have an
11-year-old son and a 5-year-old daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Miller said he and his wife explained the Web site and their job
situation to their son, who took it in stride. &QL;

 (Subs 12th graf to update on McGuire home run total) 
McGWIRE SAYS HE ENDED USE OF ANDRO MONTHS AGO  
(rk) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mark McGwire disclosed Wednesday that he has stopped using the
androstenedione dietary supplement because he was worried about the
possible influence that his continued use could have on children.
But McGwire also added that he still does not believe there is
anything wrong with it and that adults should be permitted to use
the legal supplement.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire, who acknowledged that he took androstenedione while
establishing a major league record of 70 homers in one season with
the St. Louis Cardinals last year, said that he has not taken the
supplement for the last four months. Sales of androstenedione
increased dramatically after McGwire disclosed during his historic
season that he used the supplement to help intensify his workouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought long and hard about it, and I don't like the way it
was portrayed, like I was the endorser of the product, which I
wasn't,'' McGwire told reporters at Busch Stadium in St. Louis. ``I
don't like how it's portrayed that young kids take it because of
me. I always discouraged children from taking it.''
</P>
<P>
   Andro, as the supplement is commonly known, is sold legally over
the counter and on the Internet in the United States, even though
some medical experts believe it is essentially an anabolic steroid.
The supplement is banned by the NFL, the NCAA and the International
Olympic Committee because these organizations believe it enhances
performance and could be a potentially harmful drug. But baseball
has not banned it and has publicly refused to condone or condemn
it.
</P>
<P>
   While Commissioner Bud Selig praised McGwire's decision by
saying he has ``a lot of faith in Mark,'' he said that it would not
influence baseball's neutral stance on the supplement. Major League
Baseball and the Players Association are jointly funding a research
study by Harvard University on andro, and the findings are expected
later this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to go forward with the study,'' Selig said.
``There has been a lot of time put into the study.''
</P>
<P>
   The magnitude of McGwire's surprising decision reached the White
House, where Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey, director of national drug
control policy, lauded McGwire Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message Mark McGwire sends to our young people by walking
away from this substance is a powerful one,'' McCaffrey said in a
statement. ``We thank McGwire for his leadership and hope that
other athletes will follow his lead.'' McCaffrey has asked the Drug
Enforcement Administration to label andro a steroid so it can be
removed from stores.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone was so thrilled by McGwire's announcement. Dr.
Charles Yesalis, a Penn State professor and co-author of ``The
Steroids Game,'' said: ``It's too little, too late. I have nothing
against the guy. He seems like a good guy. I really believe that he
wants to do the best by kids. But the fact of the matter is he
dropped the ball on this one. When it was first made public a year
ago that he did this, he should have said, `Even though I'm not
breaking any of baseball's rules, I'm going to quit because this
sends a bad message to kids, and I'm sorry.'''
</P>
<P>
   Andro is a synthetic form of a male hormone that occurs
naturally in the body and is converted to testosterone. Those with
higher levels of testosterone usually have increased muscle mass.
</P>
<P>
   A recent Iowa State University study of 30 men found that andro
did not help build muscle, but instead raised the risk of heart
disease, pancreatic cancer and breast enlargement. Doctors have
maligned the study because the test subjects took dosages far
smaller than body builders routinely ingest.
</P>
<P>
   After McGwire said in spring training that andro was legal and
seemingly indicated he would keep using it, he said Wednesday that
he had stopped. The 35-year-old McGwire hit his 500th and 501st
career home runs on Thursday night and is on a pace to hit 65 home
runs this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``This showed that andro is irrelevant,'' McGwire explained.
``I've done this season what I've done my whole career. I've been
saying it all along that you don't hit homers because of andro.
It's my hands and my eyes and my brain. There have been studies
proving that it doesn't do anything to improve strength anyway,
which has always been my claim.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire's timing of the revelation was curious because he is one
homer away from his 500th career homer, the majority of which were
hit without using andro. While McGwire said that he did not
disclose that he had given up andro because no one had asked him
until Wednesday, a reporter from a New York newspaper tried to
interview him for an extensive article on andro last month and he
declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   If McGwire had made his disclosure before the season and then
did not produce homers as prodigiously as he has while averaging 60
over the last three years, there surely would have been more
speculation that andro had helped him in 1998 and that may have
influenced his timing. Without using andro, McGwire is on pace to
hit 63 this season.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews with more than 75 players, team trainers and club
officials earlier this season, it was estimated that 5 to 10
percent of the 750 major leaguers use andro. Medical experts
estimated that the number is higher, but baseball does not test for
any substances so it is impossible to know who is using andro.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still believe there's nothing wrong with it,'' McGwire said.
``But if I have a message for kids, it's that you don't necessarily
have to follow what somebody who's in the public eye does. If
you're an adult, you elect to choose your own destiny.''

WRIGHT MAN FOR LAKERS?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ From the long-anticipated to the unexpected,
the Lakers continued their roster building Thursday by re-signing
their own free agent, Rick Fox, while contemplating pursuit of
another L.A. free agent, the Clippers' Lorenzen Wright.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, as expected, signed a six-year deal worth about $24
million, leaving the Lakers with one open slot on the 12-man roster
and a gaping hole at power forward.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Oakley is the man most coveted for that role, but the
Lakers are less than confident he'll sign here, which brings them
to Plan B _ luring Wright away from their arena roommates, the
Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   Wright's agent, Robert Fayne, contacted Lakers executive vice
president Jerry West and told him Wright would play for the $2
million middle-class exception. That led to an erroneous ESPN
report that had Wright accepting an offer that technically has not
yet been tendered by the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   Fayne and West are scheduled to meet today.
</P>
<P>
   Wright, who can play forward and center, has turned down the
Clippers' six-year, $30 million offer and has tried to force a
sign-and-trade deal. Those efforts have failed so far, leaving
Wright with few options, and none as lucrative as the Clippers'.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers would prefer Oakley, but he is taking his time making
a decision and there are signs his flirtation with the Lakers might
simply be a ploy to get Toronto to increase its offer. The Raptors
have offered $5.5 million per year, far short of the $8 million
Oakley is seeking but far more than the Lakers can offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think realistically, the odds are stacked against us,''
Lakers general manager Mitch Kupchak admitted. ``We're just hopeful
that he would make a decision not solely based on economics.''
</P>
<P>
   If Oakley takes too long or turns down the Lakers, ``we have
options,'' Kupchak said. He wouldn't say that Wright was one of
those options.
</P>
<P>
   The re-signing of Fox comes two days after guard Derek Fisher
re-upped with the Lakers for seven years and gives the Lakers a
pair of complementary players known for self-sacrifice and
teamwork.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rick will do anything for the team,'' Kupchak said, ``and I
think now that he has some long-term security, it'll just magnify
(that attitude) of `whatever you guys want me to do, I'll do.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Fox, primarily a backup at small forward and shooting guard,
should flourish in new coach Phil Jackson's offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a good passer, a good shooter, he liked to rebound and is
fundamentally sound. Those things work well in the triangle,''
Kupchak said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rick is versatile,'' he added. ``I can envision him bringing
the ball up the floor, playing a ball-handling guard, playing small
forward, and as you recall during the San Antonio (playoff) series,
he even guarded Tim Duncan. It's unusual to have a player who can
play four positions. . . but he has done it.''

ON FIELD OR OFF, GWYNN MAKES CONTACT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tony Gwynn stroked his 2,999th hit on Thursday. That's a lot of
contact for a slender piece of wood but a pittance for its stout
owner.
</P>
<P>
   Is San Diego's Gwynn the best there ever was at making contact?
We should think so, considering all the lives he gets ahold of that
go unrecorded by the Elias Sports Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn, 39, connects with rawhide and regular people with
awe-inspiring consistency. It's what makes him a shoo-in for
Cooperstown and kingdom come.
</P>
<P>
   There are 106 major-league players who earn more money than
Gwynn but arguably no one who leads as rich a life.
</P>
<P>
   The ``selfish'' player journeyman catcher Jim Leyritz described
last weekend after being traded to New York (we trust the door
didn't hit him on his way out) is a family man who opens his home
to nieces and nephews and anyone who needs a stroke of luck or just
plain stroking.
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn and his wife Alicia are rearing three nieces and nephews
in addition to their own children, Anthony, 16, and Anisha, 13.
Three other children are living with them right now, kids they
rescued from the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, we see where Leyritz was coming from. Gwynn, he's a
regular Dennis Rodman.
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn doesn't go out of his way to publicize it, but he and his
wife have put more than a dozen students through college.
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn sprays money like he does hits: He goes to all fields.
</P>
<P>
   On the diamond, he is especially fond of the gap between second
and third. Off it, he is partial to kids who fall through society's
cracks: the abused, the abandoned and the emotionally troubled.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing purer than Gwynn's swing is his sense of purpose.
Michael Brunker, who has known the 18-year veteran since his
playing days at San Diego State, said, ``Tony's got his life in
order, which allows him to be committed to service over self.''
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn's life wasn't always so neatly prioritized. He struggled
in his early years in the big leagues to strike a balance between
family and baseball. He fixed it the same way he did his early
throwing and fielding deficiencies _ he made a conscious effort
every day to be better.
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn can remember as vividly as his 1,000th hit (a single off
Nolan Ryan on an 0-and-2 fastball) when he knew he had some
catching up to do as a father.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a green costume in my daughter's room and I had no
idea what it was for,'' Gwynn said.
</P>
<P>
   So when the Padres traveled up the I-5 to play the Dodgers in
June, Gwynn didn't take the team bus. He drove himself so he could
attend Anisha's eighth-grade graduation in the afternoon. Then he
lead-footed it back to Dodger Stadium to be on hand for a game he
wouldn't play in because of a calf injury.
</P>
<P>
   If that made him a prima donna in Leyritz's eyes, well, Gwynn
can live with that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five or six years ago, there's no way I would have driven home
for my daughter's graduation,'' Gwynn said. ``In the old days, if
there was a choice to be made between baseball and something else,
I always chose baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   His daughter's radiant expression when her name rang out and she
heard her dad holler for her in that distinctively squeaky voice of
his is a memory Gwynn wouldn't trade for his 4,000th hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you miss a moment like that,'' Gwynn said, ``you never get
it back.''
</P>
<P>
   You'd never know it from the way he holds court before or after
a game, but Gwynn is not naturally gregarious. Like hitting to
right field, talking to reporters is an acquired skill for the Long
Beach native.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figure you take an extra five minutes with people, it'll pay
off down the road,'' Gwynn said.
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn's good-gabber policy was tested in New York last year,
after Game 1 of the World Series. Gwynn went 3 for 4 with a home
run, but the Padres lost 9-6.
</P>
<P>
   In the visiting clubhouse, a reporter stuck a microphone in
Gwynn's face and said it had to be the greatest night of Gwynne's
life, hitting a home run in the house that Ruth built, yada, yada,
yada.
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn's cheeks reddened.
</P>
<P>
   Chicks, as Gwynn learned long ago, aren't the only ones who dig
the long ball. Seems he's always getting asked about losing weight
or hitting more for power.
</P>
<P>
   When he met Ted Williams for the first time, the superlative
contact hitter of yore managed to push both hot-button issues with
one comment. Williams took one look at Gwynns 5-foot-11, 225-pound
frame and said dryly, ``Big as you are, you should be hitting the
ball out.''
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, Gwynn takes great pride in swinging for the gaps
and not the fences. He decided the man behind the microphone should
have known that. A good reporter, Gwynn scolded him, does his
homework before the game, not after it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I showed him a side of Tony Gwynn nobody else has seen,'' the
outfielder said, shaking his head.
</P>
<P>
   Ten months later, that exchange continues to gnaw at Gwynn. He
can't believe that poor, misguided reporter and how he snapped at
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking afterward that I came on a little too strong,''
Gwynn said.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, we've heard that Albert Belle frets over that sort of
stuff, too.
</P>
<P>
   There's supposed to be no cheering in the press box. It's hard,
however, not to root for a player who showed up at the All-Star
Game this year even though he was injured, so he could pay homage
to Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   As always, Gwynn came prepared. He bought a book on the history
of the place. Whether he's hitting in a park or simply admiring it,
Gwynn always does his homework first.
</P>
<P>
   It's Gwynn's fastidiousness, on the diamond and in his
day-to-day dealings with people, that set him apart.
</P>
<P>
   On a warm, cloudless June afternoon at Dodger Stadium, Gwynn
mused about the machinations of celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless you do the off-the-wall things that draw people's
attention,'' he said, ``people just kind of forget about you.''
</P>
<P>
   Not always. Once in a long while someone comes along and quietly
connects with so many balls and so many people he has a whole
nation standing to give him his due. &QL;

A QUESTION OF GOVERNMENT VALUES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Someone in the federal bureaucracy charged with helping
America's small businesses apparently has a lot more dollars than
sense.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Sen. Kit Bond, chairman of the Senate's Small
Business Committee, is irked at the Small Business Administration
for what he sees as questionable use of its resources. He wants
some answers, pronto.
</P>
<P>
   The flap involves what the Missouri Republican says is a
violation of the congressional intent of 1997's SBA authorization
legislation, which mandated increased financing for the Service
Corps of Retired Executives. As it turns out, however, the SBA
apparently has cut administrative support for the organization
commonly known by its acronym, SCORE.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to SBA Administrator Aida Alvarez, Bond and ranking
Small Business Committee Democrat Sen. John Kerry expressed concern
about the matter and requested a ``prompt reply'' concerning what
can be done ``to rectify the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   The situation, according to Bond's letter, is a seeming decision
by somebody in the SBA to divert money intended to reimburse
expenses incurred by SCORE volunteers to pay instead for
administrative outlays such as office space and telephone and
postal services.
</P>
<P>
   If someone did make such a decision, it's foolishness, because
dollar for dollar, Uncle Sam probably gets more bang for his buck
from SCORE than any other activity you'd care to name.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who has spent any time whatsoever with SCORE volunteers
has no trouble understanding the significant contributions made by
this dedicated group.
</P>
<P>
   SCORE is exactly what its name says. Some 14,000 retired
executives and business managers throughout America spend a
considerable chunk of their spare time sharing their knowledge and
expertise with existing and aspiring small-business operators.
Kansas City is fortunate to have a particularly effective SCORE
organization, which during its years of working cooperatively with
local SBA officials has contributed substantially to the area's
economic vitality.
</P>
<P>
   The only recompense these volunteers receive is for expenses
incurred while helping others. It's one of the few areas in which
the federal government probably gets more value than its pays for.
As Bond puts it, these are really ``volunteers,'' in the truest
sense of the word, because they get no stipend whatsoever for their
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the compelling question is, why would anyone try to save
money by shortchanging those who do so much public service for so
little in return? Chalk it up to Oscar Wilde's line about a cynic
being somebody who knows the cost of everything and the value of
nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Bond's letter states the obvious when it points out that the SBA
should hardly be trying to reduce support for SCORE volunteers at
the very time Congress is considering even higher funding for the
program.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, anyone in Washington who thinks SCORE isn't pulling
its weight should spend some time observing how these retired
business types contribute to the good of their communities and U.S.
economic health.
</P>
<P>
   Shortchanging SCORE would be an example of ill-advised
government policy at its worst.

POWER &AMP; LIGHT DEVELOPERS ASK FOR BIGGER, MORE EXPENSIVE DISTRICT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK P. COUCH  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Plans for the Power &AMP; Light District are
getting bigger and more expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Developers of the entertainment district are asking for changes
in the voter-approved downtown revitalization plan that would boost
the total cost to $628 million from $454 million.
</P>
<P>
   Those changes would double the amount of office space, triple
the amount of apartment space, cut 10 movie screens from the
centerpiece megaplex and spare the President Hotel from the
wrecking ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very bold initiative,'' said Nick Bashkiroff,
managing director of Power &AMP; Light District LLC, an AMC
Entertainment Inc. subsidiary that is leading the project.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal also asks the city to accelerate, but not increase,
$176 million in taxpayer-assisted financing approved by voters in
February 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is more of what I call pot-stirring _ increasing
component size and adding more apartments,'' Bashkiroff said. ``We
feel very good that we are going to get this done and we are going
to get this done sooner rather than later.''
</P>
<P>
   The changes are included in a book of numbers the developers
expect to submit to the Kansas City Tax Increment Financing
Commission today. The developers have been sharing the numbers
privately with TIF staff and other city leaders in the past two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``These numbers are staggering in their complexity, profoundly
important and massive in their implications, but ultimately may be
in the best interests of the city,'' said Donald Zuchelli,
president and chief executive of ZHA Inc., the TIF Commission's
financial consultant.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Smith, lawyer for the TIF Commission, said the changes in
the development plan will be discussed at a public hearing on Sept.
15.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said the changes need the approval of the TIF Commission.
The Kansas City Council will review the changes, but Smith said the
changes aren't significant enough to require council approval.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Franco, lawyer for some landowners who don't want to move
for the project, said the changes might require council approval
because they substantially change the district.
</P>
<P>
   ``The courts will have to decide that,'' Franco said.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed changes do not alter the boundaries of the 12-block
district on the south end of downtown, roughly bounded by 13th
Street on the north, McGee Street on the east, Wyandotte Street on
the west and Truman Road on the south.
</P>
<P>
   And the proposal continues to call for movie and live theaters,
offices, apartments, hotels, restaurants, stores and parking
garages.
</P>
<P>
   Among the major changes:
</P>
<P>
   - Greatly increasing the amount of office and housing space in
an effort to attract people to live and work in the district,
increasing traffic for retail and entertainment components.
</P>
<P>
   - Restoring the Power &AMP; Light Building as a 198-unit apartment
structure that could be converted into condominiums. Apartments on
five of the floors would include terraced balconies.
</P>
<P>
   - Cutting 10 screens from the planned 30-screen AMC megaplex
movie theater.
</P>
<P>
   - Saving the President Hotel as a 185-suite hotel instead of
razing the vacant building.
</P>
<P>
   - Constructing more of the district in the initial phase.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the increased size of the project, the proposal only
adds 89 parking spaces. Backers said that would be sufficient.
</P>
<P>
   The approved plan calls for the construction of three blocks of
entertainment and retail in the first phase of the plan. In the
amended plan, developers plan to tackle nine blocks, including
offices and apartments, at the beginning of the project, completing
as much as 70 percent of the total project.
</P>
<P>
   By completing more of the project quickly, more city money would
be spent sooner. The existing plan calls for the city to spend $108
million in the first phase of construction. According to the
amended plan, the city would spend $161 million in the initial
construction period.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed changes are the result of advice from co-developers
on the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's foot traffic, critical mass, a 24-hour city,'' said S.
Reid Freeman, vice president of Regent Partners, one of two
Atlanta-based co-developers approved in April. ``You've got to have
people. We felt it was important to take and accelerate the plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Freeman declined to name prospective tenants, but said, ``We're
in deep negotiations with a number of potential anchor tenants.''
</P>
<P>
   To ensure that the project can proceed quickly, and that the
city is committed to the project, Power &AMP; Light District lawyer
Aaron March said the developers are asking the city to issue TIF
bonds and put as much as $50 million in escrow to help pay for land
acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   By having the $50 million in escrow, the developers can acquire
land and move quickly into construction. March said the bonds would
not be issued until the developers met conditions in the existing
plan.
</P>
<P>
   Those conditions require the developers to have financing
commitments from private lenders and leases on at least 40 percent
of the space in the entertainment district, excluding the AMC
theater.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Kay Barnes said the provision of money in escrow shouldn't
affect the plan.

<P>
   ``I don't anticipate that it will be a major issue as long as we
have the assurance that all the requirements will be met before any
of the city's money is in their hands,'' Barnes said. ``That hasn't
changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Bashkiroff, of Power &AMP; Light District LLC, said the developers
had let contracts to buy many of the properties in the district
lapse because the developers didn't have a certain starting date
for the project.
</P>
<P>
   Bashkiroff said the developers expect to start acquiring land in
December and hope to break ground before April 2000.
</P>
<P>
   But Franco, the lawyer for the landowners, said the request that
the city put money in escrow suggests the co-developers don't have
the financial strength to support the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``That just shows they signed up a group that doesn't have the
financial breadth for the project or the financial strength to sign
on the dotted line,'' Franco said. ``Obviously that's
disconcerting.''

CARNAHAN HAS LESS SENATE CAMPAIGN MONEY THAN ASHCROFT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN MURPHY  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Missouri Gov. Mel Carnahan's campaign fund for the
U.S. Senate is about $765,000 smaller than that of Sen. John
Ashcroft's, reports show.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, three weeks ago the governor was two months late
filing his personal financial disclosure form with the Senate,
although he avoided a $200 fine. Carnahan, a Democrat in his second
term as governor, had about $1.48 million in cash on hand for the
period that ended July 1, compared with about $2.24 million for the
Republican Ashcroft, according to reports filed with the secretary
of the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan spent $545,647 on fund-raising events, travel, staff
salaries and other expenses in the six months, compared with
$423,519 for Ashcroft.
</P>
<P>
   For the period, Ashcroft raised more money than Carnahan did:
$2.09 million for Ashcroft, $1.44 million for Carnahan. Both had
cash-on-hand carried over from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan campaign adviser Roy Temple said that fund raising had
gone well and that the $2.1 million the governor raised dating back
to last year was already approaching the $2.5 million that Missouri
Attorney General Jay Nixon raised in his losing bid for Senate last
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always understood that as a sitting U.S. senator, John
Ashcroft was going to have the capacity to raise more money,''
Temple said. ``The question is, did we raise enough to get the
governor's message out, and we think we have.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to campaign reports, U.S. senators and candidates
must file forms outlining their personal financial holdings and
sources of income. Carnahan filed a form when he declared for
Senate last fall, but he failed to file again by May 17, as
required.
</P>
<P>
   Temple said a staff person who misunderstood the filing schedule
made the mistake. Being more than 30 days late with a report
results in a $200 late filing penalty, unless waived by the Senate
ethics office.
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan filed the report July 13 after being notified by the
Senate secretary that it was due. Temple said the campaign
committee sent a letter with the form asking for a waiver of the
$200 penalty because the notice from the Senate secretary did not
come until after the 30 days had expired.
</P>
<P>
   On July 30, the ethics panel staff director wrote Carnahan a
letter agreeing to waive the fine, based on the circumstances and
precedents.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Hilton, spokesman for Ashcroft, said Carnahan's failure to
file on time ``has to be the result of carelessness, inattention or
a lack of respect for the rules.''
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft did not file his personal financial disclosure form May
15, but he requested and received an extension until Aug. 15.
Hilton said documents Ashcroft needed to accurately fill out the
form were unavailable in May.

GRANDVIEW POLICE SEE NO LINK BETWEEN LIBERTY CASE, UNSOLVED
SLAYING 
</HEADLINE>

 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star

<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Detectives returned from Texas on Thursday
with no evidence that William Brouse was linked to a killing in
Grandview, Mo., last year.
</P>
<P>
   Brouse, 25, died this week in a shootout with police in Plano,
Texas. Clay County, Mo., authorities had been seeking him in the
killing of Christy Schroeder near Liberty, Mo., in July.
</P>
<P>
   Grandview police were focusing on the killing Aug. 31 of Gary
Stein, who operated a sports memorabilia shop in Leawood, Kan., in
suburban Kansas City. They interviewed Cheryl Stein, his widow.
Stein now lives in Plano and had been in contact with Brouse in
recent weeks, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   But investigators were not able to connect Brouse with Stein's
death.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brouse was never a suspect,'' said Grandview Sgt. Kent Bruce.
``There's nothing to tie in to a homicide.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have an ongoing investigation with Gary Stein. It's
an open case. We haven't got a thing on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Clay County authorities, meanwhile, explored the links among
Brouse, Cheryl Stein and Schroeder, whose body was found in a pond
near Liberty in what police think was a random killing.
</P>
<P>
   Clay County authorities planned to interview Stein.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Steve Wright of the Sheriff's Department said interviews
with witnesses indicated that Brouse had been in contact with Stein
about the time Schroeder was killed. Authorities hope that Brouse's
phone records and the interview with Stein will confirm that.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities are not sure of the nature of their relationship but
suspect Brouse might have visited Stein in Texas. Clay County
authorities will continue their investigation to see whether anyone
might have aided Brouse while he eluded police.
</P>
<P>
   Just before Brouse was killed, Clay County prosecutors were
preparing to file an array of charges against him in Schroeder's
death, including murder, kidnapping, robbery and armed criminal
action.
</P>
<P>
   Surveillance videotapes and witness statements already placed
Brouse at the Schroeder crime scene, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities also hope to establish links between the weapons in
the Schroeder killing and the Plano shootout.
</P>
<P>
   Clay County investigators say a 9mm Beretta pistol was found at
the scene of the Plano shootout. Don Norris of the Clay County
prosecutor's office said authorities found a 9mm slug at the
Schroeder crime scene. And, Norris said, a 9mm weapon was stolen
from Gary Stein's home when he was killed.
</P>
<P>
   Plano police shot Brouse several times, but investigators also
discovered evidence of a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head,
said Lynn Salzberger, the acting county medical examiner.
</P>
<P>
   Salzberger said her final report would not be finished for
several weeks. But, she said, investigators might not be able to
make a ruling on whether Brouse died from police gunfire or by his
own hand.

TWO (MANY) RUELAS FIGHTS?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Ruelas brothers are giving themselves another
chance this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Gabriel and Rafael Ruelas, whose careers were thought by many to
be over last year, fight Saturday and Sunday against journeyman
opponents. Each brother has an eye on one more opportunity to fight
for a championship.
</P>
<P>
   Gabriel Ruelas, who faces Jose Rodriguez of Nicaragua in a
10-round lightweight bout Saturday in Miami on Telemundo, hasn't
fought since John Brown took him out in eight rounds in October of
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Rafael Ruelas, who takes on Hicklet Lau of Miami in a 10-round
junior welterweight bout Sunday on Fox Sports Net, last fought when
he was stopped by Kostya Tszyu in nine rounds last August.
</P>
<P>
   Both insist the one-sided losses were anomalies and both expect
to prove it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people tend to judge a fighter on his last fight,''
said Rafael Ruelas (52-4, with 42 knockouts). ``. . . I'm doing
this for myself. I enjoy proving myself right and in the process
proving others wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't necessarily believe in me, but I certainly
believe in myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Rafael Ruelas, who has relied more on tremendous heart than
natural ability, hasn't fought for a championship since he lost his
IBF lightweight title to Oscar De La Hoya in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Many believe his skills have eroded as he has taken more and
more punches. Some even fear for his safety.
</P>
<P>
   Ruelas' reaction? A look that says, ``Thanks for sharing.''
</P>
<P>
   He's only 28. As always, he's in tremendous physical condition.
He's trained for three solid months. And he has the wisdom gleaned
from 56 fights working in his favor.
</P>
<P>
   It also should be pointed out that money isn't his prime
motivation. He has invested his earnings well and is attending
school to become a financial adviser. With or without boxing, he
has a future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to give it one more shot,'' he said. ``. . . If
you look at the record, I've only had a few losses and I don't
believe I've taken devastating punishment in any fight. The only
one where people can make a case is the Tszyu fight. That just
wasn't my day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel good. I'm optimistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Many believe that Gabriel Ruelas (45-5, 24 KOs) has more left
than his brother because he hasn't taken as many punches.
</P>
<P>
   However, he hasn't been the same since delivering the blows that
killed Jimmy Garcia on the same card in which De La Hoya beat
Rafael Ruelas. With the exception of a thrilling knockout loss to
Arturo Gatti in 1997, he has lost the fire of his early career and
three of his past seven fights.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after nine-plus months off, he insists he has it back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I miss it,'' he said. ``. . . I thought maybe by just going to
the gym I'd fill that emptiness, but then I started thinking. I'm
only 28. I started thinking of all the fighters older than me who
are doing well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to give myself a chance. I haven't been hungry for
years. I feel that way now, though.''
</P>
<P>
   Conspicuous by his absence will be Joe Goossen, who trained both
fighters since they were children.
</P>
<P>
   Goossen has declined to comment in detail about the separation,
but it's obvious that he doesn't approve of the fighters' decision
to resume their careers.
</P>
<P>
   It's just as obvious that the fighters picked up on it, which is
one reason they moved on. Gabriel Ruelas works with Raymond Acquaye
of Ghana, Rafael Ruelas with Mexican Chato Robles.
</P>
<P>
   Both said it will be strange without Goossen in their corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely been different,'' said Rafael Ruelas, who
trains at the L.A. Boxing Gym downtown. ``It IS sad when you think
about it. He's the only trainer we've had.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to put that behind you, though. You have to focus on
the future, focus on progressing with a new trainer. That's what
I'm doing.''

MAYOR BLAMES EMPLOYERS FOR IMMIGRANT WOES  
</HEADLINE>
   (resending to correct slug, dateline) 
 (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By GRACIELA SEVILLA  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DOUGLAS, Ariz. The mayor of this border city is fed up.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Borane is sick of illegal immigrants dying in the desert as
they try to sneak past the Border Patrol.
</P>
<P>
   He's sick of his city's notoriety as the place where ranchers
with rifles stand ready to shoot migrants off their property.
</P>
<P>
   He's sick of the tension, the trash and the tragedy accompanying
the never-ending flow of people through his small city.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of blaming the undocumented, he's lashing out at
those who entice them to come: employers and pampered Americans who
he says are exploiting desperate Mexican job seekers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our community can no longer cope,'' he says in letters
recently fired off to newspapers around the country. ``You are
ultimately to blame.''
</P>
<P>
   In Douglas, a city of 15,000, the residents are outnumbered
every month by the illegal immigrants passing through city limits.
</P>
<P>
   Border Patrol agents at the Douglas station stopped 16,900
illegal entrants in July. And that wasn't even the peak month. The
numbers have been higher every month this year, except for May when
there was an unexplained drop to 15,477. March saw a record 27,225
apprehensions.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night alone, agents intercepted a group of 240
stealthy crossers hiding in the brush northwest of the city. It was
the third time in just one week that a group of more than 200 had
been caught after cutting past Douglas.
</P>
<P>
   On July 27, 240 illegal entrants, including three from
Guatemala, were apprehended by agents northwest of Double Adobe, a
small community about 15 miles northwest of Douglas.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Border Patrol agents detained 198 illegal entrants
east of Douglas. They were part of a group of about 600 people, the
largest mass crossing ever confronted by Arizona agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an invasion,'' says Borane, a retired state education
official. ``I blame the magnet of people pulling them here to
jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor was just as direct in the missive he sent to more than
a dozen papers in cities that attract large numbers of migrant
workers including the ``Las Vegas Sun,'' the ``Chicago Tribune,''
the ``Washington Post'' and ``The Arizona Republic''.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you hire illegal immigrants because you have forgotten,
or never knew how to make your own beds, mow your own lawns or cook
your own meals, as we do ours daily, it causes our fields to be
littered with thousands of plastic jugs and pieces of clothing,''
he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The terrain at the border between Douglas and Agua Prieta,
Sonora, is undeveloped desert where plastic water bottles and
grocery bags discarded by migrants who cross in the night clutter
the harsh landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Borane understands the frustration of the ranchers who complain
that their cattle die after eating the plastic trash or wander off
when their barbed wire fences are cut.
</P>
<P>
   But the mayor, whose maternal grandmother was from Sonora, also
feels sympathy for the migrants.
</P>
<P>
   Borane was born and reared in Douglas. He speaks Spanish
fluently and easily slips into friendly slang when he calls his
counterpart in Agua Prieta. He wants those who hire illegal
immigrants to consider the crossers' sacrifice and suffering.
</P>
<P>
   An editorial writer for the ``Aspen Daily News'' thought
Borane's tough talk was right on target.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a haven for wealth and privilege, this entire region must
accept responsibility for the social and cultural upheaval it
perpetuates,'' Paul Andersen wrote. ``Construction and maintenance
of luxury homes and resort amenities are made profitable for
developers, investors and owners because of cheap labor.''
</P>
<P>
   Others have chafed at the criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do not stand all high and mighty, saying, `See, all these rich
people are the problem,' '' angry Aspen area resident Leslie
Stevens wrote about Borane. ``They have to go through you first in
order to get here no matter what route they take. . . . Take care
of your own policies before you start trying to make ours. We are
not the problem, sir, our government policies are.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Henzo, an artist who has lived in Douglas 10 years, says
there is some truth to what Borane says, ``but in terms of hysteria
created by (the illegal immigration), it's more of a nuisance, if
anything, to the ranchers and farmers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't see a great horde invading the community, raping and
pillaging,'' he said while playing dominoes with a group of other
retired men at the Hotel Gadsen. ``They do leave behind trash,
plastic bottles and bags. . . . Most people in Douglas really
aren't affected by it.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the feedback, Borane is glad that his campaign is
drawing attention to his city's plight. But what he really wants is
a response from the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   A week ago, he went for broke, sending an angry letter to
President Clinton. In it, he accused Clinton of failing to address
the problem of uncontrolled illegal immigration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I write to tell you the border is bleeding,'' Borane's July 29
letter said. ``I simply cannot comprehend your inability to even
publicly recognize or acknowledge this invasion _ intrusion into
our lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of our isolation, we feel disgusted, frustrated and
abandoned, wandering in the darkness without any expectation of
assistance.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past two years, since Douglas became the focal point for
illegal crossings, the federal government has stepped up
enforcement. About 300 agents are now stationed in Douglas &UR; with an
additional 50 on temporary assignment.
</P>
<P>
   In May, ranch patrols were also organized by the Border Patrol
in response to complaints from ranchers and other rural residents.
</P>
<P>
   But Borane says enforcement alone will never stop the flow of
undocumented immigrants. The disparity between the poverty in
Mexico and the ``insatiable demand'' for cheap Mexican labor in the
United States, he says, fuel the flow.
</P>
<P>
   Borane's point is borne out across the line in Agua Prieta. It
is afternoon, and young men and women are milling about on the
sidewalks outside the dozens of cheap hostels that have popped up
to serve the growing numbers of border crossers.
</P>
<P>
   Storm clouds are churning overhead, but no one is deterred from
his or her plan to cross at nightfall.
</P>
<P>
   ````Hay mucho trabajo'' _ there's a lot of work waiting,'' said
Ramiro Reyes, a married father of two who's successfully crossed
illegally several times to work in California fields picking
grapes, melons, kiwis and watermelon.
</P>
<P>
   Borane's argument gets support from Reyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The employers have jobs, but they don't have people to fill
them, so they have to hire Mexicans,'' he said. ``If it wasn't for
the Mexicans, who would do this work?'' &QL;

   CHINA-SECT (Beijing) _ The crackdown on the Falun Gong sect is
turning out to be far less severe than it first looked, with more

here is that someone decided to shoot a movie. But that is not how

Hollywood built the set of ``Field of Dreams.'' The stirring,
fanciful story of a farmer who hears a voice telling him to build a
baseball diamond in his cornfield was an instant sensation.
Suddenly, some 50,000 people a year started coming to the baseball
diamond in the cornfield. People still come, but now the object of
their sentimental pilgrimage is ensnared in a bitter disagreement
between the farm couple who owns most of the outfield and the farm
couple who owns most of the infield. By Pam Belluck.

the sultriest Shakespeare comedy, ``A Midsummer Night's Dream.'' As
such, I joined the members of the city's acting fraternity who
spill out of theaters and into the great outdoors every summer,

matter how hot the weather. But summer also means art, and plenty
of it. Washington is a serious museum city. There's the National
Gallery of Art, of course. And the Smithsonian Institution covers a
wealth of cultural bases. The nation's collections of African,
African-American and Asian art are under its auspices, as is the
Hirshhorn Museum, a showcase for contemporary work. That's just a
partial list. Throw in privately financed outfits like the Corcoran

INTERNET COMPANY BECOMING INTERNATIONAL PLAYER WITH SOFTWARE DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID HAYES  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ A 4-year-old Kansas City-area Internet
company and the world's largest computer products wholesaler have
cut a deal that is likely to change the way millions of consumers
buy computer games and other software.
</P>
<P>
   As part of an agreement expected to be announced today, NetSales
of Overland Park, Kan., will distribute software over the Internet
for Ingram Micro Inc. Using NetSales, Ingram Micro will offer
thousands of retailers an opportunity to let consumers buy and
download software online.
</P>
<P>
   Ingram Micro is a $23.6 billion-a-year wholesaler that supplies
computer products to more than 140,000 retailers ranging from Best
Buy and CompUSA to small storefront computer shops.
</P>
<P>
   Its entrance into electronic software delivery is expected to
rev up an online market that is predicted to grow from $200 million
in 1997 to $5.9 billion in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   NetSales could get a big boost, in revenue and industry
visibility, as it collects a percentage of each Ingram Micro sale.
NetSales is one of the area's fastest-growing companies and could
go public soon in what would be the area's first big Internet stock
offering.
</P>
<P>
   NetSales will provide software electronically for Ingram Micro's
retailers to sell online. Consumers shopping on the Web from those
retailers will be connected invisibly to NetSales, where they'll be
able to download 75,000 or more software products from the Overland
Park company.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement with NetSales will allow California-based Ingram
Micro to expand into a new market, said Guy Abramo, senior vice
president of marketing worldwide. NetSales' extensive online
experience makes the company ``an ideal partner,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Fraser, NetSales founder and CEO, said the agreement was
a ``quantum leap'' for software retailing that would ``rock the
industry.''
</P>
<P>
   It also is big step for NetSales, a company that had 15
employees about 18 months ago, employs more than 120 now and has
set up a task force to handle the Ingram Micro project and hire 80
more workers by Jan. 1. The company is expected to grow to 400 or
more by the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll probably double again to 800,'' Fraser said.
</P>
<P>
   Even hitting the 400-job mark would make it larger than some
recent new employers that have moved into the area, including the
Harley-Davidson assembly plant in suburban Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   The partnership with Ingram Micro is the latest in a series of
high-profile deals for NetSales, which specializes in building
electronic commerce sites for small and medium-size companies.
</P>
<P>
   NetSales is operating more than 1,600 online storefronts and
adds about 40 client retailers or software companies a week. Among
those are deals to set up online stores for the Weather Channel,
Daytimers, Xerox, the Christian Broadcasting Network and the
American Jazz Museum in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   The company is expected to announce an initial public stock
offering later this month. Analysts predict the company will try to
raise $40 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``This outfit has objective business prospects at least as good
as some of the recent smash success IPOs,'' said William F.
Zachmann, an industry analyst and president of Canopus Research.
``That doesn't mean it will happen, but the prospect is there.''
</P>
<P>
   Company officials declined to comment specifically on the
possibility of a public offering.
</P>
<P>
   However, Fraser said NetSales had lost some contracts because it
wasn't a publicly traded company. ``A lot of the bigger clients
want to deal with a bigger company,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The company's start-up financing was raised privately, including
$1.6 million from Kansas City Equity Partners and $6.8 million from
Boston-based HarbourVest Partners.
</P>
<P>
   Zachmann, who met recently with Fraser to discuss NetSales, said
he was ``blown away'' by the company's ``brilliant business
model.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I heard about what they were doing, I thought to myself,
`How come somebody else hasn't been doing that?' '' Zachmann said.
</P>
<P>
   Companies generally have three options in the rush to enter the
Internet e-commerce consumer market, which is expected to reach $54
billion a year within three years.
</P>
<P>
   Large hardware companies like IBM have established big
e-commerce programs, offering retailers and manufacturers hardware,
software and setup. It comes with a price _ usually in the millions
_ and the process can take up to a year.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies have turned to outside consultants, who use
off-the-shelf software to set up sites in a process that also can
cost millions and take months.
</P>
<P>
   NetSales and a few other online commerce companies, most notably
Digital River Inc. of Minnesota, offer turnkey e-commerce
alternatives. Instead of charging the companies a large setup fee,
they charge as little as $250 for setup and take a 15 percent cut
of sales.
</P>
<P>
   Fraser thinks the partnership with Ingram Micro will give the
company a boost over the competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means our sales are going to go through the roof,'' Fraser
said. ``Tons of new customers are going to come to us. It's going
to get a lot of attention in the marketplace. It also is a huge win
for ESD,'' or electronic software delivery.
</P>
<P>
   Fraser said downloadable software is the next high-growth area
in Internet e-commerce. Although computer professionals have been
buying specialty software online for several years, consumers
haven't been as willing to follow that trend as they have been to
buy books, CDs and clothing.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts think downloadable software is hampered by slow
download speeds and consumers who want to see their software
delivered in a box.
</P>
<P>
   Fraser disagrees.
</P>
<P>
   He said the problem was that no company of any size was offering
enough software online to make the market viable.
</P>
<P>
   Fraser conceded that consumers ``generally feel more comfortable
having a CD-ROM with the software on it.'' In some cases, online
sellers follow up by sending out a hard copy of the software, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Being the ``plumbing,'' as Fraser calls it, of electronic
commerce wasn't always in the plans at www.netsales.net.
</P>
<P>
   Fraser started the company in 1995, working with three employees
out of cramped offices on 87th Street. The business plan then was
to sell advertising to software companies from a Web site at
www.benchin.com where consumers can write their own reviews of
software.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back in the Benchin days, e-commerce didn't seem like a big
deal,'' Fraser said. ``It looked like the Internet would bring
information to the desktop, but there was nothing about commerce.''
</P>
<P>
   Advertising exploded across the Internet, making Benchin a minor
player among thousands of sites offering advertising opportunities.
However, the company's business relationship with software
companies led to a new business plan _ selling downloadable
software online.
</P>
<P>
   Using database and security software developed by Fraser,
NetSales developed a secure online storefront. The company made its
first software sale on Oct. 31, 1996. ``It was $199. We made 20
bucks. I was like, `Yeah!' ''
</P>
<P>
   NetSales is expected to gross about $7 million this year and
jump to $14 million by the end of next year.

HUNDLEY HAS UN-FUNNY VALENTINE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Todd Hundley will stay at his Long Island home instead
of the Dodgers' team hotel, will chat with old friends and
reminisce about the good old New York days when the Dodgers begin a
four-game series with the Mets today.
</P>
<P>
   Pleasant memories, Hundley calls his days as a Met, although he
can't say the same about his dealings with Mets manager Bobby
Valentine. When it comes to Valentine, Hundley has no desire to
speak to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a no-brainer,'' Hundley said. ``It's really a given. I
don't have anything I need to talk to him about.''
</P>
<P>
   Time hasn't soothed the ill feelings between the two. Hundley
made history with the Mets when he hit a major-league-record 41
homers as a catcher in 1996, but his time in New York ended in
turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine made comments about Hundley's New York's night life
negatively impacting his play, then said he got along better with
Mike Piazza because they were both Italian and Hundley is not. An
unnamed Mets employee also accused Hundley of having a drinking
problem.
</P>
<P>
   In turn, Hundley responded by saying Valentine's problem with
him stemmed from the fact Hundley was the most popular of the Mets.
Hundley said that didn't sit well with his former manager.
</P>
<P>
   While the words were flying, Hundley was sitting because of
reconstructive elbow surgery. When he returned from his rehab,
Hundley flopped in an experiment in left field and then was traded
in the offseason with minor-leaguer Arnold Gooch for Roger Cedeno
and Charles Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like to go in there with a better record than we have,
but you have to put (the turmoil) to rest,'' said Hundley, who
spent parts of nine seasons with the Mets. ``It'd be easy to go
back if we were higher up in the standings, but that's not the
situation. That's where I grew up as a baseball player. I have a
lot of friends there so it's going to be fun. I'll see the guys,
the old teammates, or at least the ones that are left.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Mulling Mills: After pitching well for three months, Dodgers
set-up man Alan Mills has been awful the last month. He went 0-3
with a 4.20 ERA in July and is now having control problems.
</P>
<P>
   He entered Thursday's game in Houston with the Dodgers trailing
1-0, walked two batters and allowed an RBI double. All three
batters he faced scored.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alan, that's the worst I've seen of him,'' said Dodgers
manager Davey Johnson, who also had Mills in Baltimore. ``It's not
close. He's not just missing.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Arnold hearing delayed: Jamie Arnold's appeal hearing for his
five-game suspension was changed from today until Monday, which
means the right-hander will start Saturday's game against the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers are hoping to have Arnold's suspension reduced, and
team officials believe it can get chopped to three games despite
the video footage of Arnold repeatedly punching Seattle's Damaso
Marte during a July 11 brawl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be glad when it's over,'' Arnold said. ``I haven't
thought about (the significance of the start) one bit. Any
opportunity I get to go out and pitch, especially start, it's an
opportunity for the future.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Balks, walks and chalk: Eric Karros tied his career high with
his 30th double in the first inning. He also had 30 doubles in
1992. . . . Paul LoDuca, recalled from Triple-A before the road
trip, started behind the plate and went 0 for 3. He's now 2 for 39
(0.51) this season.

TWA CANNOT RECOVER FUNDS FROM INSURERS, JUDGE RULES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RANDOLPH HEASTER  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ A St. Louis judge has ruled that Trans World
Airlines cannot recover from its insurers more than $30 million in
environmental compliance costs at its Kansas City overhaul base.
</P>
<P>
   TWA sued Associated Aviation Underwriters and London Market
Insurers in 1994, seeking to have the insurers indemnify the
airline for polluting four sites at the maintenance base with
hazardous waste.
</P>
<P>
   The case referred to TWA's consent agreement with the
Environmental Protection Agency in the late 1980s. The EPA also
fined TWA $100,000, but the airline is expected to spend more than
$30 million to comply with the consent agreement, which involves
cleanup, monitoring of soil samples, studies and audits.
</P>
<P>
   But in Missouri Circuit Court in St. Louis, Judge Robert H.
Dierker Jr. ruled Monday that ``pollution exclusion'' provisions
contained in TWA's insurance policies since 1970 meant that its
insurers were not liable for the claims.
</P>
<P>
   Dierker said there was no evidence that contamination of
groundwater discovered in the late 1980s occurred before 1970, when
TWA's insurance policies did not have the pollution exclusion
provisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a total victory for us,'' said Joe B. Whisler, attorney
for Cooling &AMP; Herbers of Kansas City. Cooling &AMP; Herbers represented
London Market Insurers on the case, along with the lead law firm,
Lord Bissell &AMP; Bank of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   TWA declined to comment, saying its counsel was studying the
ruling. Whisler, however, said he fully expected TWA to appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The lag between the EPA's action 10 years ago and TWA's seeking
of insurance coverage was a factor in Dierker's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since TWA did not invoke coverage until 1994, long after the
1989 consent order, it is plain that AAU (Associated Aviation
Underwriters) had no duty to defend,'' Dierker wrote.
</P>
<P>
   TWA operates and leases the maintenance base, which is owned by
Kansas City.

FISET DEFEATS KINGS IN SALARY RULING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ One month before the start of training camp,
goalie Stephane Fiset recorded his first victory of the season on
Thursday, defeating the Los Angeles Kings in salary arbitration and
winning a one-year contract worth $2.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings did not immediately accept the ruling but were
expected to do so, and they must do so by Sunday or exercise their
``walk-away rights'' as spelled out in the NHL's
collective-bargaining agreement.
</P>
<P>
   If the Kings follow the unlikely path of using their ``walk-away
rights,'' Fiset, 29, would become an unrestricted free agent.
</P>
<P>
   If Fiset then signed with another team for less than 80 percent
of the $2.1 million ($1.68 million), the Kings would have the right
to match the offer and keep their No. 1 goalie. Fiset also would
have the right to accept the qualifying offer (just over $1.2
million) the Kings made to retain the goalie's rights before the
free-agent signing period began July 1.
</P>
<P>
   Most likely, however, the Kings will accept the arbitrator's
ruling. It is not known what offer the Kings made to Fiset before
the arbitrator, except that it was worth more than the qualifying
offer.
</P>
<P>
   Plagued last season by persistent groin injuries, Fiset appeared
in 42 games, posting an 18-21-1 record with three shutouts and a
career-best 2.60 goals-against average.

CEDENO HAUNTS DODGERS (CORRECTS BYLINE)
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ One lap around the New York Mets clubhouse and
it's eerie how often you run into the ghosts of Dodgers past.
</P>
<P>
   In one corner is Mike Piazza, the one-time cornerstone with big
numbers and the big contract. In another is Orel Hershiser, still
pitching more than a decade after winning a Cy Young Award and a
World Series ring. Across the way is Bobby Bonilla, a grim reminder
of last year's transition from Peter O'Malley to Rupert Murdoch.
</P>
<P>
   Throw in manager Bobby Valentine and pitching coach Dave Wallace
and it's the Dodgers the way they were supposed to be, in first
place with the best record in the National League.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the starkest connection to the past is quietly
sitting at his locker, lost in the sound of Latin music under a set
of head phones.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Cedeno gives a big smile and a wave, but it is still
scary. He is the ghost of Dodgers future.
</P>
<P>
   For years they pictured him doing what he's doing this year for
the Mets, batting .314, stealing 52 bases and securing a place as
one of the league's most exciting players.
</P>
<P>
   Cedeno clearly is not the player who made every fly ball an
adventure, every dash from first to third a dance through land
mines. He is the one who pulled hamstrings and misplayed fly balls,
suffered broken toes and broken dreams.
</P>
<P>
   This year he nearly made the All-Star team and leads the league
in stolen bases heading into tonight's series opener against the
Dodgers at Shea Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   What happened?
</P>
<P>
   ``I found a place that believed in me,'' Cedeno said. ``I'm on a
team where I'm not always looking over my shoulder.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be simple to check off Cedeno as another Dodgers
disaster, another Pedro Martinez who was buried under a language
barrier and crushing expectations. But Valentine, who came up in
the Dodgers organization in the late 1960s, says it's more
complicated than that. For the first time, Cedeno excelled because
no one was waiting for miracles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't happen very often that a player comes to New York
with less pressure on him than the place he came from,'' Valentine
said. ``But that definitely was the case with Roger. When we traded
for him last winter, we saw him as a fourth outfielder at best. We
didn't see him as a savior. He came into spring training knowing
that there was no pressure. He just took off from there.''
</P>
<P>
   Cedeno, who turns 25 later this month, was acquired in a
three-team trade with the Dodgers and Baltimore on Dec. 1. When
veteran free-agent Rickey Henderson started slowly, Cedeno became
the offensive catalyst.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing I never saw in Los Angeles was his speed,'' said
Bonilla, who played just over a half-season with the Dodgers after
coming over from Florida in the Piazza trade. ``He just has a
confidence here that wasn't there before. But I don't blame the
Dodgers. Where was he going to play with (Raul Mondesi) in right,
(Devon White) in center and (Gary Sheffield) left? Sometimes you
have to let a guy move on and hope it doesn't come back to haunt
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Cedeno played parts of four seasons with the Dodgers. In 1996,
he took over in center when Brett Butler underwent surgery and
treatment for throat cancer. He played 86 games, batting an
unspectacular .246 and stealing just five bases.
</P>
<P>
   He also was tentative defensively and injury prone. He missed
the final 30 games of the 1997 season with a fractured left big toe
and was sidelined all of spring training and the first 20 games of
1998 with a strained right hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you think back to him in those days, that is what you
remember,'' Piazza said. ``He was getting an opportunity, but
things always got in the way.''
</P>
<P>
   In spite of it all, Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone says he
was reluctant to trade a switch hitter with speed regardless of his
shortcomings.
</P>
<P>
   ``My scouts said he couldn't play center field,'' Malone said.
``There was no other place to put him in our outfield.''
</P>
<P>
   But the problem goes back even farther than that.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers have an unofficial rule that any player signed out
of Latin America must spend at least two years playing for the
club's rookie-league team in the Dominican Republic. The move is
designed to give the players a chance to mature and develop before
arriving in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Cedeno, a Venezuelan, played only 58 games for Santo Domingo
before heading to Great Falls, Mont., and the Dodgers minor-league
system.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is anything I would do over, it would be keeping him
in the Dominican the full two years,'' said Dodgers chief Latin
scout Ralph Avila. ``He was just such a complete player, we forgot
how much he still had to learn.''
</P>
<P>
   Cedeno and Valentine credit former Mets center fielder Mookie
Wilson, now a coach with the team, with the turnaround. Wilson took
over the project with only one goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was there to restore his confidence,'' Wilson said. ``We
talked a lot about what happened with the Dodgers, but we didn't
dwell on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Cedeno's rebirth with the Mets, Valentine says Malone's
scouting report was accurate. Although Cedeno often is dazzling
defensively in right, he is shaky in center. Valentine hopes to put
Cedeno there some day, but when he traded starter Brian McRae at
the July 31 deadline, he got center fielder Darryl Hamilton in
return.
</P>
<P>
   Cedeno got three hits Wednesday in Milwaukee after going through
his first extended slump with the Mets. Since July 17, he had gone
11 for 56 (.196) with 17 strikeouts, dropping his average from
.336.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine stayed with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't criticize the Dodgers and we certainly didn't have all
the answers,'' he said. ``We had some coaches who would have rolled
their eyes when Roger would make a mistake. But one thing we did
during the instruction was get him to answer us when we asked him a
question. A lot of times, a Latin player will just nod because he
doesn't understand the questions. We tried to communicate more and
I guess it got through.''

FIREFIGHTERS RESCUE 800-POUND MAN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY LISA VAN PROYEN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
LOS ANGELES _ Firefighters used crowbars and saws to tear down
apartment walls and free an 800-pound man Thursday after he
complained of breathing problems, officials said.
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Swaney, 57, an attorney and former announcer for KFWB
(980-AM), was in stable condition at Los Angeles County/USC Medical
Center.
</P>
<P>
   Residents at the apartment complex watched in amazement as some
30 firefighters smashed through three walls about 8:45 a.m. to
retrieve Swaney from his apartment in the 11200 block of Morrison
Street in North Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters from the Urban Search &AMP; Rescue team in Sherman Oaks
fashioned a gurney from plywood and steel pipes and used a forklift
to move him into the ambulance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We kind of had to wing it. Like the Egyptians building the
Pyramids,'' Los Angeles Fire Capt. Mark Saxelby said of the
improvised gurney.
</P>
<P>
   Swaney was first taken to Providence Saint Joseph Medical Center
in Burbank, but medical equipment was not suitable for the
patient's weight, hospital officials said. So he was transferred to
County/USC Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters had been called out to treat Swaney at least twice
before in the past month, and they grew worried about his health
and ability to get out of his apartment, said Los Angeles Fire
Capt. Stephen Ruda.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally, fire crews were scheduled to visit Swaney on
Thursday to develop a plan in case he had to be removed in an
emergency, Saxelby said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, we have our plan now, and it worked,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For at least the past month, Swaney has been confined to his
bed, which is supported by bricks, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He basically ran his business from his bed,'' Ruda said.
</P>
<P>
   Swaney was one of the first anchormen for KFWB when it converted
to an all-news format in 1968, said Crys Quimby, station news
director. Ten years later, he began a full-time law practice after
graduating from Loyola Law School.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, he joined another radio station, KGIL (1260-AM), where
he hosted a morning-drive talk show, ``Breakfast Edition,'' Quimby
said.
</P>
<P>
   A friend regularly brought Swaney food, neighbors said. One
neighbor, Susanna Foster, said she was sorry to see Swaney in such
condition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know a gentleman and a cultured man when I see one and he is
one of them _ gracious and kind and wanting to help,'' Foster said.
</P>
<P>
   Swaney has struggled with his weight problem for many years,
said Charlie Brailer, who worked with Swaney at KFWB-News radio in
Hollywood for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``In recent years, he has been almost housebound,'' Brailer
said. ``But he operates a law referral business out of his home
that's very successful.'' &UR; !dlim!!end! &QL;

YANKEES DEFEAT MARINERS, 7-4 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ There will be the peripheral issues for Manager Joe
Torre in these last two months of the Yankees' regular season, the
Darryl Strawberry sideshow and Andy Pettitte's crisis of confidence
and the overpowering intensity of Tino Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   The project that will consume the Yankees, however, is the
mystery of Roger Clemens, a puzzle that must be solved before the
post-season. Clemens floundered early again on Thursday night but
survived, lasting seven innings in a 7-4 victory against Seattle in
the Yankees' first game in the newly opened Safeco Field.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez slammed his 200th and 201st career home runs, ending a
string of 79 at-bats without a homer. Torre had called Martinez
into his office before the game for one of those chats Torre likes
to have with slumping players. Martinez batted seventh in the
lineup for the Yankees, the lowest position in the batting order he
has occupied in his four seasons since being acquired from Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees had five extra-base hits against Jamie Moyer (10-6),
Bernie Williams' first-inning two-run triple among them, and if
Clemens were pitching as the Yankees expected him to when they
traded three players for him in February, they would have glided to
their 65th victory. But again Clemens was wildly inconsistent at
the outset, inning to inning, batter to batter, pitch to pitch.
</P>
<P>
   He missed his aim with a fastball to Alex Rodriguez in the first
inning _ catcher Jorge Posada set up inside and Clemens's fastball
went outside _ and Rodriguez crushed a two-run homer. The Yankees
(65-42) assumed a 3-2 advantage in the second, on the first of
Martinez's home runs, before Clemens struggled badly in the third,
repeatedly failing to finish off hitters once he reached a
favorable ball-strike count.
</P>
<P>
   This is how Clemens threw to the three batters who preceded Ken
Griffey Jr. and Rodriguez in the third inning:
</P>
<P>
   _ Russ Davis, the No. 9 batter, fell behind by no balls and two
strikes and stroked a single.
</P>
<P>
   _ Brian Hunter walked on four pitches.
</P>
<P>
   _ David Bell fell behind, no balls and two strikes, and drew a
walk.
</P>
<P>
   Bases loaded, nobody out, Griffey and Rodriguez due to bat.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens fired a fastball through Griffey's swing for strike one,
tossed another for strike two _ no balls and two strikes again _
before Griffey laced an outside fastball to left field, driving
home a run. Griffey hit the ball so hard that Hunter had to stop at
third, even with his sprinter's speed. Clemens got ahead of
Rodriguez no balls and two strikes, the same pattern, and Rodriguez
managed to loft a fly ball to right field, deep enough for Hunter
to score. The Yankees trailed, 4-3.
</P>
<P>
   Pitching coaches who have worked with Clemens in the past say he
adjusts adeptly. If there is a mechanical flaw, he will fix it. If
he falls into a pitch pattern that needs correcting, he will
change. Clemens could not have compiled 243 victories without
adapting.
</P>
<P>
   So the solution for Clemens does not appear to be simple,
reflected in the possible theories considered by the Yankees. Once
he recovers from a strained hamstring and regains his leg strength,
they thought, then the Rocket would take off; he has not. Once
Clemens went back to relying on his fastball, they thought, then
Clemens would rebound; he has not.
</P>
<P>
   A hitter for another team that faced Clemens recently said the
talk among his teammates is how much less Clemens commands the
outside part of the plate. ``He doesn't seem as intent on
intimidating you as he used to be,'' the player said.
</P>
<P>
   But that's another theory, too. Clemens is not Clemens yet, but
on Thursday night, he was good enough to win. Imperfect though he
was, _ he required 95 pitches to get through the first five innings
_ he battled and competed enough and had enough run support to pick
up his 10th victory.
</P>
<P>
   With the Yankees down a run in the sixth, Martinez lofted his
second home run of the game, a two-run shot that propelled his team
into the lead. Clemens shut out the Mariners (53-55) in the fourth,
fifth and sixth innings, and the Yankees added a run in the top of
the seventh, moving ahead, 6-4. They closed out their scoring with
a run in the top of the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   David Bell was the last hitter Clemens faced, with two outs in
the bottom of the seventh, and after Williams ran down Bell's long
drive at the base of the wall in right-center field, Clemens waited
for Williams in front of the dugout and patted him on the head,
affectionately pushing his hat from side to side. His teammates
helped Clemens get through Thursday night, and they are hoping for
_ expecting _ the greater side of Clemens to appear before
October's trials. &QL;

BOEING, WHITE HOUSE SCRAMBLING TO SAVE HUGE PLANE DEAL WITH CHINA
AIR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAUL NYHAN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Clinton administration and Washington politicians are
scrambling to salvage The Boeing Co.'s plan to sell $1.5 billion
worth of airplanes to China Airlines after the carrier indicated it
was walking away from the purchase.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from Taiwan and its largest carrier, China Airlines,
have told Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., they won't proceed with plans
to buy as many as 12 Boeing 777 airplanes. Instead, they are opting
to order A340 airplanes from Boeing's rival, Airbus Industrie.
</P>
<P>
   The indication has set off a flurry of activity in Washington,
D.C., with senators pressing Taiwan to reconsider and senior
Clinton administration officials contacting their Taiwanese
counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear whether the press will succeed.
</P>
<P>
   China Airlines could complete its agreement with Airbus within
days, according to congressional aides. Still, Boeing has a chance
to land the order _ or a portion of it _ thanks to the last-minute
flurry of visits, according to an aide familiar with the
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, we can work something out here,'' said Washington
Democratic Rep. Norm Dicks. ``I am very encouraged'' by the Clinton
administration's response, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The potential order appears to be a victim of the Taiwan
government's anger over President Clinton's China policy and its
claims that Boeing has treated it poorly, according to lawmakers
and congressional aides.
</P>
<P>
   Gorton will make a final effort to appease those concerns by
flying Friday to Taiwan. He plans to meet with senior officials
from both the government and China Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   While China Airlines appears ready to craft a deal with Airbus,
the carrier could also decide to grant Boeing a portion of the
original 777 order, according to a congressional aide familiar with
the talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boeing should hope, at least, to save half of it,'' the aide
said.
</P>
<P>
   If that effort fails, China Airlines would strip Boeing of a
lucrative contract and reward its competitor, Airbus, in the
critical Asian market. China Airlines never officially agreed to
buy the 777s. Rather, in 1995 it signed a letter of intent, which
isn't a binding contract.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the airline denied that politics would influence
the company's decision. The contract will be announced next week,
they said.
</P>
<P>
   While China Airlines may place its $1.5 billion 777 order in
Airbus' hands, Boeing is still expected to land a separate order
with the carrier for up to 13 Boeing 747-400s, worth an estimated
$2.5 billion, next week.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan pushed the carrier toward Airbus on the 777 contract,
initially because officials were angered by Clinton's refusal to
alter the U.S. position on China, according to Dicks.
</P>
<P>
   President Lee Teng-hui recently said Taiwan and China should
conduct talks as two equal states.
</P>
<P>
   The move angered China, and in the wake of the comments, Clinton
reaffirmed U.S. support for the ``one China'' policy that has been
a backbone of U.S. policy toward China and Taiwan. However, Clinton
added that he ``would take very seriously'' any attempt by Beijing
to resolve its differences with Taiwan by force.
</P>
<P>
   Dicks said Taiwan should consider how much it relies on U.S.
support as it looks to the European-based Airbus for the new order.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Taiwanese should recognize if there ever is a
crucial moment in the future it is going to be the United States of
America upon which their security rests,'' Dicks said. ``I would
not think I would want to go out and offend that person.''
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan, however, has also laid the blame at the feet of Boeing,
saying the aerospace giant has failed to treat it like a top-flight
customer that has purchased billions of dollars worth of airplanes
in the last four years, according to Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash.
</P>
<P>
   Murray met Thursday with Stephen Chen, a Taiwan representative
in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Murray said before the meeting that it was unlikely the Boeing
order could be saved. But ``they did not say ... the door is
shut,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan and the United States don't have formal ties.
</P>
<P>
   Both U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky and Commerce
Secretary Bill Daley have also joined the fray and have written
letters to Taiwan officials.
</P>
<P>
   We ``have relayed to them that any purchase should be made on
commercial and technical merit,'' said Helaine Klasky, a
spokeswoman for Barshefsky.
</P>
<P>
   The Boeing Co., which is the largest U.S. exporter, and Taiwan
also play large roles in Washington's economy, spurring Gov. Gary
Locke to offer his assistance Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have not been enlisted, but have thought on my own that I
would be more than willing to help in any way I can, to talk with
Taiwanese officials, to the government of Taiwan, to help Boeing,''
Locke said.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Boeing nor its rival Airbus would say much about the
$1.5 billion potential order as it entered a critical stage of
international diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly the marketplace has spoken,'' said Marta Newhart, a
spokeswoman for Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only flag carrier in Asia that hasn't chosen it (the 777)
is China Airlines.''
</P>
<P>
   Airbus officials declined to discuss the situation, except to
say the consortium of European companies would welcome an order as
the market for wide-body airplanes softens.
</P>
<P>
   ``A wide-body order would be particularly nice to have at this
point in time,'' said David Venz, an Airbus spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The aerospace rivals should know the winner in a matter of days,
according to Murray.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and Boeing officials have their work cut out for them as
they make their last-minute pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things have progressed (to the point) that they are close to
signing a deal with Airbus,'' said Cynthia Bergman, a spokeswoman
for Gorton.
</P>
<P>

BRIGGS CAN'T AFFORD TO WASTE TIME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT MORALES  
 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BIG BEAR LAKE, Calif. _ Growing up in the rough Brownsville
section of Brooklyn, N.Y., Shannon Briggs spent four of his
formative years on the streets.
</P>
<P>
   His mother was a heroin addict, whose habit caused her to lose
everything, including a place to live. But Briggs survived.
</P>
<P>
   As a heavyweight boxer, Briggs has battled asthma, a supposed
lack of heart and the stigma that he is not as serious as he should
be about his profession. But today, Briggs labels himself a
determined, more mature fighter.
</P>
<P>
   He gets a chance to prove that against Francois Botha (39-2, 24
KOs), who will fight the new Shannon Briggs on a pay-per-view card
Saturday in Atlantic City.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am 27 years old now,'' said Briggs, ranked No.7 by the WBC.
``I have matured, physically and mentally, and I am enjoying boxing
a lot more now.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a good thing, or the career of one of the more talented
heavyweights to come along recently could have been a waste.
</P>
<P>
   The first sign of change for Briggs came when he hired trainer
Emanuel Steward, who trained Lennox Lewis when Lewis knocked out
Briggs in the fifth round March 28, 1998. It was his second loss,
the other was to Darroll Wilson, who knocked Briggs out in the
third round on March 15, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But Briggs, now 31-2, is a survivor.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother was a heroin addict for 15 years, so we eventually
fell,'' said Briggs, whose mother died Dec. 4, 1997, on his 25th
birthday. ``And I lived on the streets. But it was a learning
experience for me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't look back and regret any of it. I feel like that is
how I got into boxing. I know I wouldn't have been able to go
through the toughness of boxing unless I went through that
hardship.
</P>
<P>
   ``We suffered a lot. But before my mom died, she got to see her
son become successful as a boxer. That was very important. She
didn't feel like her life was wasted.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, her son is working to avoid wasting what could become a
fine boxing career.

FORUM AT TRADE SUMMIT FOR PUBLIC INTEREST GROUPS PROPOSED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration wants to set aside the
day before this fall's World Trade Organization meeting in Seattle
to allow consumer, environmental and labor groups to air their
concerns directly to the world's trade ministers.
</P>
<P>
   The move to provide a formal opportunity for public interest
groups to address members of the often closed and secretive
international organization comes as companies, countries, and a
variety of organizations are stepping up their efforts to influence
the Seattle gathering, which will be the largest trade meeting ever
held in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Industries from chocolate manufacturers to liquor distillers
want Congress to put their needs on the U.S. agenda, while members
of Congress want to use the WTO to do everything from stemming the
flow of filmmaking jobs to Canada to protecting U.S. steel and
sugar industries.
</P>
<P>
   And an army of public interest groups, concerned that trade
liberalization is coming at the expense of the environment, food
safety, consumers and workers, is planning a mix of protest and
participation in their efforts to call attention to their critique
of global trade liberalization.
</P>
<P>
   Although many countries do not share the United States' concern
about labor and environmental issues, Deputy United States Trade
Representative Susan Esserman testified at a congressional hearing
Thursday that her agency hopes to offer consumer groups, business
associations, environmental groups and labor organizations a chance
to publicly voice their views.
</P>
<P>
   Her boss, Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky, will be
chairwoman of the Seattle meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do think it's very important for members of civil society
to have direct access to the ministers,'' Esserman said. Then,
citing a ``very successful and very positive'' gathering in Geneva
in March in which environmental groups were allowed to speak to WTO
trade ministers, Esserman said, ``we are also contemplating doing
the very same thing on a range of issues the day before the
ministerial (meeting) begins in Seattle.''
</P>
<P>
   Esserman said the gathering for business, consumer,
environmental and labor groups might be a tough sell to some
countries. ``Many governments around the world do not share our
interest in labor, so there is a great deal of work that needs to
be done ... to talk to other governments about the importance of
including the labor perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   Pressed by Rep. Richard Neal, D-Mass., on whether the interest
groups would really have an opportunity to speak directly to
foreign trade ministers, Esserman said ``we are seeking to include
mechanisms for direct participation, by labor, by environmental
groups, so that they have a chance to directly provide their views
to the ministers in the WTO. This is something that we have been
urging on the other countries in the WTO who don't necessarily
share our interest in doing this. But we have very, very strongly
advocated doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the fast pace at which the WTO is affecting world
trade greeted Esserman's proposal with skepticism. Although
President Clinton hopes the Seattle session will launch a new round
of global trade negotiations, the critics say the WTO would be
better off pausing to reflect on the successes and failures of past
trade liberalization efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we have this kind of forum the day before the ministers
meet, not only is it going to be too little, but it will be too
late,'' said David Downes, a senior attorney at the Center for
International Environmental Law, who said the United States
government has not been aggressive enough in pushing environmental
concerns. ``By the time the ministers sit down in Seattle, the deal
will have been done, so this will have as much show value as
anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists are concerned that in the rush to remove trade
barriers between nations, it is becoming too easy to override
environmental standards of various countries. That complaint is
echoed by advocates of strict food safety and labor standards, who
argue that the most progressive countries are being forced to give
up some of their consumer and worker protections in the interests
of uniform global regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our ultimate objective is that there should no longer be a
downward harmonization of health and food and environmental
standards,'' said Mike Dolan, the deputy director of the Global
Trade Watch program of Public Citizen, a consumer group founded by
Ralph Nader. ``There has been a trumping of laws by faceless trade
bureaucrats in Geneva, and it's not acceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   Dolan is helping a wide array of public interest groups prepare
for the Seattle meeting, and he promises a mix of tactics to try to
influence it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a very intricate choreography of inside and outside
activities by a number of civil society groups,'' he said. ``On the
inside, accredited non-governmental organizations will take
whatever the World Trade Organization is willing to offer in the
way of seats near the table. On the outside, there will be a series
of organized symposia, press conferences and strategy sessions, as
well as demonstrations and protests...''
</P>
<P>
   As for the proposed one-day event, Dolan said, ``I can't wait to
receive my invitation to that. I'll believe it when I see it. Our
challenge is to have a seat at the table, and not merely near the
table.''

LEGISLATURE ENDS SESSION IN SPIRIT OF COMPROMISE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for updating, rewriting throughout) (sw)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Finally calming the partisan tensions that have
buffeted it all year, the state Legislature ended its annual
session early on Friday morning by forging a last-minute deal with
Gov. George Pataki on a handful of outstanding issues.
</P>
<P>
   The governor and the legislative leaders agreed on measures that
would stiffen penalties for stalking and for blocking abortion
clinics, expand the state's database of DNA specimens from
criminals, and allow the construction of new power plants. They
focused on those bills after jettisoning others that proved too
nettlesome, including one that would have permitted New York to
join the multistate Powerball lottery.
</P>
<P>
   While officials here hailed the late-night compromise, it was
reached nearly two months after the Legislature had planned to
adjourn, and the topsy-turvy negotiations that dragged on
throughout the day and into the evening on Thursday could serve as
a primer on the difficulties of getting things done in Albany.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the deal came together after the Senate majority
leader, Joseph Bruno, threw up his hands on Thursday afternoon,
broke off discussions with the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver,
and ordered the Senate closed for the session. But in a highly
unusual spectacle, Silver kept the Assembly working into the night
and continued negotiating with Pataki, even though it was not clear
how the bills could become law with the Senate having decamped.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after 10 on Thursday night, Pataki, Silver and Bruno
announced a deal under which the Assembly would approve the bills
immediately and the Senate would do so the next time it is in
session _ perhaps as soon as next month, but more likely in late
November, when the Legislature plans to return for a short special
session.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The governor and the Legislature had earlier agreed to extend a
law that allows thousands of people to live in otherwise illegal
loft apartments, mostly in lower Manhattan. The Republicans had
been withholding their approval in an effort to wring concessions
from the Democrats on other bills. The law had expired on June 30,
leaving tenants fearful of eviction.
</P>
<P>
   Until late Thursday night, the talks had yielded mostly grief,
and the disarray on the lawmakers' last day of work had seemed an
apt finale to one of their least productive sessions in recent
memory.
</P>
<P>
   As with the state budget, which the Legislature approved this
week after missing the deadline by more than four months, all sides
at times seemed more willing to dig in their heels than to hand a
victory to the opposition. The session, which began in early
January, had been scheduled to conclude on June 16, but it was
repeatedly extended because of the haggling over the budget.
</P>
<P>
   While the governor and lawmakers had attained some
accomplishments by Friday morning, they had long ago abandoned
bargaining over dozens of other measures, including one that would
loosen the Rockefeller-era penalties for drug crimes and another
that would change the rules regarding polluted industrial sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a frustrating and exasperating session,'' Bruno
said before the compromise was announced. ``Not just today and
yesterday, but practically since we started the session.''
</P>
<P>
   After negotiating well into Wednesday night, Bruno, who is known
for his impatience with Albany's penchant for delay and
gamesmanship, gave up. He had the Senate pass the latest drafts of
the important remaining bills and send them to the Assembly,
adopting a take-it-or-leave-it approach with the Assembly Speaker.
The Senate then recessed.
</P>
<P>
   Silver, a Manhattan Democrat, rejected those versions of the
bills, but then spent Thursday evening cobbling together new
compromises with Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   Silver's spokeswoman, Patricia Lynch, acknowledged that the
negotiations were unconventional. ``I have never seen it quite done
this way,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The collapse in talks before the late-night deal was caused
largely by the longstanding Albany strategy of linking unrelated
measures to exert leverage. In other words, one side refuses to
approve a bill until another agrees to endorse a separate measure.
The connections can often become so convoluted that in the end,
either all the measures are approved or none of them are.
</P>
<P>
   Those tactics infuriated some supporters of the bills, who
assumed that with the governor and the Legislature in general
agreement and seeking only to resolve minor disputes, the bills
would easily become law.
</P>
<P>
   Abortion rights groups had lobbied the Senate Republicans for
months to support the clinic access bill and were jubilant after
they dropped their opposition in June. But by Thursday afternoon,
the groups were despondent, only to rally again after learning of
the compromise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never seen an issue that was this up, this down, this
unsettled and then finally came out all right,'' said JoAnn Smith
of Family Planning Advocates.
</P>
<P>
   Blocking access to an abortion clinic is already prohibited
under federal law, but the federal statute is not often used. A
state law can be enforced by the local police. The Assembly has
passed the bill several times, and the calls for a state law gained
urgency with the killing last year of Dr. Barnett Slepian, a
Buffalo-area doctor who performed abortions.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki has pressed for mandatory collection of DNA
``fingerprints'' from all felons, a measure that had also been
advocated in New York City by Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. Just as
fingerprints collected from criminals can be put into a computer
and matched to those found at crime scenes, a DNA database would
allow law enforcement officials to match hair, skin or blood
samples left at a crime scene to the files of known criminals.
</P>
<P>
   The state already collects DNA information, usually from a
saliva sample, from people convicted of certain violent crimes,
including sex crimes, or about 8 percent of all felony convicts.
Silver had wanted to limit the new categories of criminals who
would be subject to collection. Under the bill, which was opposed
by some civil liberties groups, the state would gather specimens
from all violent felons and those convicted of several other kinds
of offenses.

FINLEY IS FINE IN ANGELS WIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ The season has been as baffling to Chuck
Finley as it has been disappointing, but for one night the Anaheim
Angels pitcher showed why he was a sought-after commodity before
the trading deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Throwing one of his best games of the season, Finley shut out
the Boston Red Sox on four hits in seven innings as the Angels won
8-0 Thursday night before 26,175 at Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   Finley won his first game in five starts; his last win was on
July 9 vs. Colorado. He struck out seven, giving him 2,075 in his
career and moving him into 46th place on the all-time list.
</P>
<P>
   Finley has endured what he called the worst slump of his career.
And coincidentally or not, it started after he suggested he might
accept a trade to a contender if the Angels fell out of the race.
</P>
<P>
   In his eight previous starts going into Thursday's game, Finley
won one game and had an ERA of 9.29.
</P>
<P>
   The victory was the Angels' second in a row, the first time
they've won back-to-back games since beating the Rockies July 9 and
10.
</P>
<P>
   Troy Glaus hit a three-run homer, Jim Edmonds had four hits,
Garret Anderson had three and Orlando Palmeiro and Ben Molina added
two apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Glaus broke a scoreless tie in the fourth inning after singles
by Edmonds and Darin Erstad put runners on first and third with
none out.
</P>
<P>
   Glaus hit a towering fly ball down the left-field line on a 1-0
pitch, but it hooked foul. On the very next pitch, Glaus hit
another towering fly ball, but that one stayed fair and gave the
Angels a 3-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   It was Glaus' 18th home run of the season, tying him with Mo
Vaughn for the team lead. Glaus' 50 RBI rank second on the team
behind Vaughn's 64.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox threatened to rally in the sixth, putting runners on
first and second with one out. Finley fell behind in the count to
Butch Huskey, 3-1, but got him to hit into a force play for the
second out.
</P>
<P>
   Finley then fell behind to Troy O'Leary, 3-0, but threw three
consecutive strikes to get out of the inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels added to their lead in the bottom of the sixth after
Glaus opened the inning with a walk. Jeff Huson's hit-and-run
single drove Glaus to third, and Ben Molina scored Glaus with a
single to right.
</P>
<P>
   After ex-Dodger pitcher Mark Guthrie replaced Bryce Florie,
Orlando Palmeiro's sacrifice fly to the short fence in right field
scored Huson. One out later, Garret Anderson drove in Molina from
second with a bloop single to center for a 6-0 Angels lead.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the game, it looked as though the game would be just
another with missed opportunities. The Angels loaded the bases on
three walks with none out in the second inning, but Huson grounded
into a 1-2-3 double play and Molina lined out to center.

DOCTORS WORRY THAT STUDY ON SUNBURN, SKIN CANCER WILL BE
MISINTERPRETED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TOM PAULSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scientists in Texas have found that sunburn may actually stop
the beginnings of skin cancer by ridding the skin of genetically
damaged cells.
</P>
<P>
   But the researchers at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in
Houston cautioned sun lovers that the finding is not at all an
endorsement of serious tanning.
</P>
<P>
   ``This doesn't mean a sunburn is a good thing,'' said Dr.
Honnavara Ananthaswamy, chairman of immunology at the University of
Texas' M.D. Anderson center and a co-author of the study, published
Friday in the journal, Science.
</P>
<P>
   Reacting to the study's findings, Dr. Daniel Berg, director of
dermatologic surgery at the University of Washington in Seattle,
said it's the sunburn that causes the damage in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believing sunburns will protect you against skin cancer is
like arguing that slashing somebody with a knife stimulates their
body's wound healing system.''
</P>
<P>
   The Texas team's research, based on mice, showed that skin
burned by excessive exposure to the ultraviolet portion of sunlight
triggers a genetically programmed ``cell suicide'' mechanism that
kills off heavily irradiated skin cells.
</P>
<P>
   But Ananthaswamy emphasized that the same sunburn also causes
moderate damage in cells that don't get eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   ``You might kill off those cells with excessive damage, but
cells with less damage will persist, and may later develop into
cancer,'' he said. ``This (study) isn't a license to go out and get
a sunburn.''
</P>
<P>
   Skin cancer is the most common form of cancer. In the United
States, about 1 million cases are diagnosed annually.
</P>
<P>
   The most serious form, melanoma, accounts for about 44,200 cases
each year. Although skin cancer can be treated if detected early,
it kills about 9,200 Americans each year.
</P>
<P>
   The Houston cancer center team, led by Drs. Laurie Hill and
Laurie Owen-Schaub, identified the role of a particular gene
product, a protein known as FasL, that plays a key role in
responding to sunburn and leading to the ``cell suicide.''
</P>
<P>
   The mouse is considered a good model for human skin cancer
studies.
</P>
<P>
   One potential implication of the study could be that humans
defective in the FasL protein may be at greater risk for developing
skin cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Owen-Schaub said it appears FasL helps protect the body from
over-exposure to the sun.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get DNA damage almost every time you go out,'' she said.
``If you can get rid of the cells containing the DNA damage, you
get rid of the cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the most important known players in ridding the body of
mutated cells is a gene known as p53, which so far appears to be
implicated in half of all cancers.
</P>
<P>
   When p53 fails to do its job, cancer can occur.
</P>
<P>
   ``People need to know about p53 and how to protect their p53s,''
said Christopher Kemp, a cancer biologist at the Fred Hutchinson
Cancer Research Center in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Avoiding sun exposure, tobacco and charred meat are ways people
can protect their p53 genes, Kemp said.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Texas study is interesting, he said, because
the research team found that FasL appears to work together with p53
in ridding the skin of pre-cancerous cells.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sheds light, no pun intended, on the mechanism of how cells
get damaged by a toxic substance such as sunlight and respond to
that damage,'' said the UW's Berg.
</P>
<P>
   This could lead to tests that might help identify those people
at higher risk for skin cancer, Berg said. It could also lead to
better treatment and prevention.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, doctors said they were concerned the study would be
misinterpreted. That fear, they said, stems from the public's
misunderstanding of the value of sunscreen lotions.
</P>
<P>
   Although Owen-Schaub and Berg agreed that the proper use of
sunscreens likely protects against skin cancer, they said no one
knows for sure.
</P>
<P>
   That unanswered question, Berg said, is complicated by a number
of studies that found people who frequently use sunscreen have a
higher rate of skin cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Some have interpreted this to mean that sunscreens somehow cause
the cancer, he said, when it may mean that people who use lotions
spend more time in the sun.
</P>
<P>
   ``They get a false sense of security ... and they over-expose
themselves,'' said Ananthaswamy.
</P>
<P>
   He and the other cancer experts said the use of sunscreen
together with limited exposure to sunlight is still the most
prudent method for preventing the risk of skin cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Texas study was based on a comparison of mice
which had normal protein FasL activity against mice that were bred
to be deficient in this protein.
</P>
<P>
   Both groups of mice were then exposed to UV radiation.
</P>
<P>
   Among the normal mice, 5 percent had genetically damaged, or
mutated, skin cells.
</P>
<P>
   Among the FasL-deficient mice, 70 percent had mutated cells.
</P>
<P>
   That indicates that the lack of FasL allowed more DNA damaged
cells to persist.

SEATTLE'S RAINIER VALLEY GETS FED HELP FOR REDEVELOPMENT PROJECT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ALAN SNEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Southeast Seattle's Rainier Valley scored a major
redevelopment windfall Thursday when the city received $17.2
million in federal support for a $45 million commercial and housing
project.
</P>
<P>
   The Rainier Court Shopping Center would bring retail shops, an
8- to 10-screen movie theater and apartments to a run-down,
eight-acre tract at 3700 Rainier Ave. S.
</P>
<P>
   The project, with 156,000 square feet of commercial space, will
create 250 jobs and add up to 180 affordable housing units,
developers say.
</P>
<P>
   ``This part of Seattle has been ignored for too long,'' U.S.
Rep. Jim McDermott said at a news conference. ``While other areas
of the city were benefiting from redevelopment in a thriving local
economy, parts of Rainier Valley have been left out.''
</P>
<P>
   It is hoped that a project of this magnitude, offering both
commercial and housing, will serve as an economic jumpstart for one
of the city's poorest areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're creating a civic center that makes you want to get out
of your car and do things,'' said Earl Richardson, executive
director of SouthEast Effective Development (SEED), a non-profit
community development corporation, which will be the developing
agency.
</P>
<P>
   SEED plans to build 201 apartments and 43 townhouses, with 140
to 180 of the units pegged for low-income tenants.
</P>
<P>
   Apartment rents would go for about $500 to $700 a month, and
residents would range from working-class people to those earning
about $60,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said his group has talked with Magic Johnson Theaters
about building the multiscreen movie complex.
</P>
<P>
   Basketball legend Johnson is known to build multiscreen theaters
in inner-city locations in cities such as Los Angeles and Miami,
filling a void.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone was praising what was being billed as one of
Seattle's biggest such redevelopments.
</P>
<P>
   Some residents worried that the gentrification of the area _
which is near the upscale Mount Baker neighborhood _ and escalating
property taxes will drive minorities, working-class people and
longtime residents out of Rainier Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're making it too expensive for us to live here,'' said
hair designer Andrena Harris, shampooing a client's hair Thursday
at Unique Hair Design, a block from the development.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at the site last night, 20-year resident Penny Graham
hoped developers will keep in mind the needs of local residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need to broaden the survey of what people here really
need,'' Graham said. Keep it affordable, she said, so people who
have lived here a long time won't be driven out.
</P>
<P>
   But at Continental Sales and Music Center, owner Marshall Jones
welcomed the development as a step toward getting rid of blight and
crime, instilling community pride and bringing jobs to the
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love it,'' he said. ``We need something out here that we can
call our own rather than going out to Southcenter Mall.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson and Starbucks boss Howard Schultz opened a joint-venture
Starbucks Coffee shop in Columbia City this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel the community here deserves this,'' Johnson said at
the time.
</P>
<P>
   But critics cautioned those who celebrated the HUD financial
backing, saying the development is another step toward yuppifying
Seattle and displacing poor, minority residents to the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   They pointed to the Columbia City Starbucks as an example of
unwanted gentrification.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a project that's friendly to this area. SEED has
turned its back on the community,'' said George Curtis, a Rainier
Valley resident and member of Save Our Valley. The group this week
requested a federal investigation of what it sees as racially
driven inequities in Sound Transit's proposed light rail line
through Rainier Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Councilman Peter Steinbrueck welcomed the news of the federal
money, but cautioned that redevelopment should not mean pushing out
poor, working-class people.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should preserve communities and not cause displacement,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rainier Valley ranks high on Mayor Paul Schell's list of
neighborhoods that should receive public resources.
</P>
<P>
   But even as politicians promise to not force anyone out of
subsidized housing, fears persist among some wary South End
residents that when there's talk about redevelopment, it means
being pushed aside by a new upscaled community.
</P>
<P>
   Such was the case when the city this year requested a hefty
federal grant to double Rainier Vista's 481 housing units and build
new homes to replace the World War II-era housing project.
</P>
<P>
   Schell and others point to positive changes at the east Beacon
Hill housing project of Holly Park, undergoing a transformation
from low-income to mixed-income.
</P>
<P>
   And the manager of a Safeway store across the street from the
proposed Rainier Court Shopping Center said the neighborhood needs
the commercial growth and jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're pouring dollars into the community. It can't help but
help,'' said the manager who declined to give his name.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's $17.2 million in HUD backing consists of $15.5
million in loan guarantees, which the city will pass on to SEED.
</P>
<P>
   The city also drew a $1.7 million Brownsfield Economic
Development Initiative grant.
</P>
<P>
   SEED will borrow $27.8 million more from private sources. The
developer hopes to break ground in 2000 and finish construction in
July 2002.
</P>
<P>
   SEED hopes the anchor stores, offices and retail shops will
capture a portion of the estimated $250 million in local consumer
money currently spent outside the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   It plans to partner with the private firm of Gramor Development
Washington to build Rainier Court.
</P>
<P>
   The first job is to spend $7 million to buy parts of the site
SEED does not already own, then $800,000 to $1 million for
environmental cleanup of petroleum products and chemicals left from
past businesses. The site was once home to a welding shop, auto
distributor, tool company and dump truck service.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said residents around the site are concerned about
traffic and parking.
</P>
<P>
   The project will include parking for 1,009 cars, including 289
underground spaces.
</P>
<P>
   ``But on balance, they want to see something happen,'' he said.
``It's a pretty much rundown site and that doesn't help property
values.''

MEDIA PACK HEAVY FOR GWYNN, MCCGWIRE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ It is a fact of life in sports that once an athlete
rises above the pack, he comes to dislike another pack altogether.
</P>
<P>
   That would be the media pack, a species with hundreds of legs,
thousands of dollars of electronic equipment, interchangeable faces
and questions that range from the obtuse to the ordinary.
</P>
<P>
   It's nothing personal. Tony Gwynn and Mark McGwire actually like
many of the media people who intersect their lives, and they and
other superstars certainly understand it's a part of the process.
Gwynn is glib, and McGwire is guarded in dealing with reporters,
but they essentially handle it well.
</P>
<P>
   But times like now are very wearing. The media attention at
milestone moments like this McGwire hit his 500th and 501st career
home runs and Gwynn collected his 2,999th career hit Thursday can
be suffocating, frustrating and even damaging.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers double their usual number of reporters. National
magazines dispatch reporters and photographers. The number of radio
microphones, usually seeking nothing more than a crisp 15-second
quote, can triple. Each TV crew can include as many as four people
sportscaster, producer, cameraman and sound man and every one wants
the ultimate one-on-one interview.
</P>
<P>
   And each and every interview session has the same dynamic,
because the questions all focus on ``The Moment.'' How will you
feel? Are you pressing? Nervous? What have your teammates said? Is
this the greatest moment in your life?
</P>
<P>
   ``These numbers are bigger than both of us,'' said Gwynn. ``We
try to handle it like professionals. The thing is, we know what
people are going to ask, and sometimes, there's no answer. Or the
answer is predictable.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I don't get a hit, people will want to know why. And
sometimes the answer is that I happened to suck that night.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire went through this past year during his chase and
escalation of the home run record. He came to deplore the `how will
you feel' question, because there's no way to predict exactly what
someone will feel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just one more (home run),'' McGwire said Wednesday, ``and then
I can answer all the questions you've wanted to ask.''
</P>
<P>
   The better reporters often look for deeper, more meaningful
questions. But those require much more time than either the
reporter or athlete have available. That can then lead to obtuse
questions, like the one thrown out Wednesday at McGwire: ``When's
the last time you were asked a good question?''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire pursed his lips and shrugged. ``Last spring?'' he said.
``It's the same stuff all the time. I go to the archives. I give
the same answers to the same questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn and McGwire talked about the crush during Wednesday's
game, after a Gwynn single led to a pitching change.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him he doesn't have to explain why he didn't get a hit
every time,'' said McGwire. ``Tony's been through things like the
World Series, but this is the first time he's had to deal with
everything personally.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tougher for me,'' Gwynn said. ``I've never had to deal
with it like this. Basically, I'm talked out. There's no way I can
preview this any more.''
</P>
<P>
   The media crush has other angles beyond what someone says and
the size of the pack. On Wednesday, a reporter asked McGwire if he
is still taking andro, the hormone supplement which caused a bit of
a firestorm last summer.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire said no, that he had stopped taking andro before the
season because he was concerned his use was an influence on kids.
He was uncomfortable that teens might think he's endorsing the
product. Since the andro story broke a year ago, the product has
enjoyed a sales boom, and a significant percentage of new users are
teenage boys.
</P>
<P>
   When asked why he waited until August and the eve of his 500th
home run to announce this, he said ``no one asked.'' The St. Louis
Post-Dispatch takes issue with that. Its reporters say they asked
him about it during spring training. They believe he waited until
the timing was right 42 homers in early August and andro-free for
four months to guard against critics saying his 70-homer season was
a hormonal fluke.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, it is easy for the media pack to feel a bit used
and abused. Is it any wonder why so many of us are cynical.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the teammate issue, which becomes a question of
media spillover. The impression last year during McGwire's run was
that he was well-liked by his teammates and they were tolerant of
the situation. But soon after being traded, Brian Jordan said last
year ``was all about one guy'' and that many teammates resented the
attention McGwire received.
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn felt this brush last weekend, when Jim Leyritz, after
being traded, said Gwynn wasn't a leader and inferred he was
selfish. Two other Padres, quoted anonymously, said Leyritz was out
of line, but they also said there was a little truth to what
Leyritz said.
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn was angry for a few days, then let it go. He's the first
to admit the crush of coverage of his milestone takes away from his
teammates and can warp the usual list of priorities. The Padres
have won one game in their last 12, so it isn't a happy, fun-loving
clubhouse right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to get it done just so things can get back to
normal,'' he said. ``This takes away from the 24 other guys. The
focus shifts from the games to what you do, and that I really don't
like.
</P>
<P>
   ``The name of the game is winning and losing. When you have
success and the team doesn't win, it's difficult to sit there and
talk about yourself with a smile. Your teammates have every right
to (feel a bit strange). Right now, I want to get these two hits
and get back to being just one of 25 guys.''
</P>
<P>
   If it's possible.

By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   This fall on ABC's ``Show Me The Money'' Monday prime-time:
</P>
<P>
   Join the hijinks on the links with Tiger Woods and one of his
PGA pals in the new drama/comedy/tragedy series ``Two Guys, A
Gallery and a Fairway with Floodlights and a Big Rock in the
Middle,'' coming up right after ``Monday Night Football'' on most
of these network stations.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, probably not.
</P>
<P>
   The next made-for-Tiger ``Showdown at (Fill In the Name of the
Elite Country Club)'' match-play event will likely happen, but
exhibitions like last Monday night's crowd-pleaser at Thousand
Oaks' Sherwood Country Club will depend on much more than Nielsen's
backing, according to those involved in such programming decisions.
</P>
<P>
   The PGA Tour gods must allow it. There have to be sponsors. It
has to show a profit. And the headline players have to be
available. If there's a charity available to kick back some of the
dough to, so as not look too obscene, all the better.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, TV might not even require two golfers to be present.
</P>
<P>
   ``The matchup has to make sense on a number of different
levels,'' said John Filippelli, ABC's new senior vice president of
programming. ``If Tiger Woods takes on Justin Leonard, would that
capture the same interest? This was a unique situation with the
Nos. 1 and 2 golfers available and a prime-time slot available.
</P>
<P>
   ``Say we had the top two NASCAR or Grand Prix drivers available
_ could you do a show around two cars going around a track for an
hour and a half? I don't know. But we'd consider it.''
</P>
<P>
   A regularly televised golf-tour event might appear to have
minuscule ratings/ share numbers, such as the 3.0/7 for the PGA's
Greater Hartford Open on CBS last weekend. But that's deceiving
because it's like comparing a pound of angel food cake to a sliver
of cheesecake _ the smaller piece is much richer. The male
demographics bear that out.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night's respectable 7.4/12 ratings/share for the
overnights in major markets, adjusted to a 6.9/12 once everyone
else was accounted for, definitely showed that even casual fans
took notice. On Monday nights in July and August, ABC typically
airs a stale movie that even Blockbuster has taken off the rental
shelves, which usually delivers a 6.3 rating.
</P>
<P>
   By ABC research, more than 20 million viewers watched some or
all of Monday's Tiger 'n Dave show. Even though overall it was only
the fourth-most-watched show that night behind CBS' ``48 Hours,''
``Becker,'' and ``Everybody Loves Raymond,'' one of the most
important numbers to the sponsors was that ABC grabbed the
highest-rated share of men ages 18-49 and men ages 25-54 for the
night.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, to counter the $1.5 million that the network paid the PGA
for the rights to the event, it reportedly sold more than $2
million in advertising spots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever criteria you use to measure success, we met and
exceeded it,'' said Filippelli.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Gerber, the executive vice president of ESPN Regional
Television, might be the single busiest golf producer on TV today.
He oversees 48 televised events each year, and for the last 10
years has been involved in the Skins Games, which many golf
elitists consider to be the beginning of the made-for-TV events
that have cheapened the game.
</P>
<P>
   On July 26-27 of last week, he conducted a similar event _ the
DLJ direct Par 3 Shootout with Jack Nicklaus, Ray Floyd, Phil
Mickelsen and Lee Janzen that was shown tape-delayed in prime time
over two nights on ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   Gerber, like Filippelli, doubts there'll be a sudden surge of
these events, especially on a weekly basis, but ``you'll probably
see another excursion or two in prime time as long as it has a
unique format and the cooperation of the PGA Tour.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerber notes that since the PGA won't sign off on members to
play on TV elsewhere when there's a tour event going on, the only
TV windows generally open during the season are Mondays and/or
Tuesdays. After the tour season ends, the so-called ``Silly
Season'' that includes the Shark Shootout are played during the
fall and winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The value of Woods and Duval was exposing the game to the
non-golf viewer,'' Gerber said. ``I'd think the tour would welcome
anything that increases popularity of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Events like this or the Skins Games bring out the
personalities, so to be successful, you need someone with a strong
public following. But there's only a handful of guys who have the
ability to bring a ratings spike.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Woods has done for TV is impressive. Prior to him, the
regular tour was a ratings doldrum. Tiger can probably generate a
ratings point or two all by himself if he's on the leaderboard.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerber agrees that these ratings will spark future events.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, anytime you can go to a course and watch Tiger and David
play and bump into Wayne Gretzky, it can't be all that bad,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But critics who call these events an insult to the game don't
agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's absurd,'' said Filippelli. ``. . . This was a chance to
do something for the game of golf, something that could be hugely
important to its future by exposing it on larger stage. On its own
terms, it had merit. Anyone who says it was a sham, I'd suggest
they get more of a life.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
WHAT SMOKES &QL; 
__ NFL. On TV. It's (brace yourself) back. The warmup is the
2{-hour Hall of Fame induction ceremonies from Canton, Ohio, shown
Saturday on ESPN2 at 10 a.m. that'll include Eric Dickerson's time
to shine. Later that day at 6 p.m., Fox delivers the American Bowl
between the Ryan Leaf-less San Diego Chargers and John Elway-less
Denver Broncos from Rupert Murdoch's backyard in Sydney, Australia.
Pat Summerall does the call with Matt Millen because no one could
figure how to get the Maddencruiser to drive on water. Monday, it's
the unofficial opener to the 30th season of ``Monday Night
Football'' with the Hall of Fame Game in Canton between Cleveland
and Dallas at 5 p.m. (don't worry, regular ``MNF'' goes back to 6
p.m. when the season starts). This could be the first time many
people actually turn on the audio portion of the telecast, since
the team of Al Michaels and Boomer ``Mr. America'' Esiason will be
free from the syntax shackles of Dan Dierdorf. &QL; 
__ Veteran sports radio guys Fred Wallin and Peter Vent have worked
a deal to take their show to KRLA-AM (1110) for a Saturday 7-10
p.m. slot. &QL; 
WHAT CHOKES &QL; 
__ This messy ending to the relationship of former USC broadcasters
Larry Kahn and Mike Lamb with the university. Suits and
countersuits in L.A. Superior Court, claims of defamation and
breach of contracts forcing the two to come up with nearly three
quarters of a million dollars. Kahn and Lamb, who might have got in
over their heads financially but were always professional as
broadcasters, busted their tails for the school and are left busted
by broken promises. &QL; 
__ Jimmy Roberts' health plan. Next time you're on the golf course
trying to do an interview, try a little power-walking with a
protein-boost shake at Ballys before going step-for-step with Tiger
Woods, as was attempted during his match play against David Duval.
Roberts, who must now cover golf as he would a triathlon, might try
to use the Casey Martin exemption and ride a cart alongside next
time. &QL;

GWYNN WITHIN ONE HIT OF 3,000
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; ST. LOUIS  &UR; _  &LR; The final tally after Thursday's baseball game at
Busch Stadium was 501 home runs for Mark McGwire, 2,999 hits for
Tony Gwynn, a 10-3 Padre win, and ten standing ovations from a
crowd of 45,106.
</P>
<P>
   For Gwynn. Not for Mark, the big redhead in the Cardinal jersey
who crushed two more baseballs and made some more baseball history,
but for the right fielder in the visiting gray uniform.
</P>
<P>
   There were standing ovations before the game, for each of
Gwynn's five at-bats, an enormous cheer after his two-run double in
the ninth inning, a cheer as he ran out to right field for the
bottom of the ninth, another rousing ovation when the scoreboard
flashed a thanks-and-good-luck message, and one last cheer as he
walked into the dugout after the game.
</P>
<P>
   Throw in the loud boos when Gwynn was walked in the second
inning and the assorted individual hosannas, and you have about two
dozen physical displays of affection.
</P>
<P>
   One can't imagine what the reaction would have been if he had
actually gotten his 3,000th hit.
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, Gwynn was virtually speechless.
</P>
<P>
   ``What can you say? It is absolutely amazing for a visiting
player to be treated the way I've been treated the last four
nighst,'' he said. ``The fans here treated me and my family like
royalty. I can't thank the people here enough.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire did what people in St. Louis have come to expect. He
crushed two belt-high pitches from Andy Ashby, a 451-footer to
center field in the third inning for the 500th of his career, and
No. 501 in the seventh off the left field scoreboard. He now holds
the record for being the fastest man to 500 home runs. It took Babe
Ruth 5,801 at-bats to get to 500, and McGwire just 5,487.
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn's hit came off of Manny Aybar, a two-run line drive double
to right field in the ninth inning. He hit the ball well all night,
in fact, but two well-hit drives were caught by Cardinals
center-fielder J.D. Drew. He grounded out and walked in his other
two plate-appearances.
</P>
<P>
   The fans booed pitcher Larry Leubbers after each ball of the
walk, which came in a two-on, two-out, first-base-open situation in
the second. During his other at-bats, you could hear fans chanting
his name and rhythmically clapping for a hit.
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn certainly would have liked to get his 3,000th hit in front
of so many true baseball fans, not to mention three other players
with 3,000 hits, Stan Musial, Lou Brock and Paul Molitor. But there
was also a sense that McGwire deserved the night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's his stadium, his ballpark,'' said Gwynn. ``How many times
does this guy deliver? I had a feeling he would do it tonight, and
I'm glad the Cardinal fans got a chance to see it.''
</P>
<P>
   For Gwynn, it's now (ital) c'est la vie (end ital) and on to
Montreal. He admittedly was restless after Wednesday's game, where
he got three hits. He didn't get to sleep until about 5:30 Thursday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   Between the clash of history, royal treatment and number of
family members on the trip, Gwynn was pretty exhausted. Montreal
won't provide much in the way of ambiance, but that may be what
Gwynn needs most.
</P>
<P>
   The Expos have drawn fewer fans in 1999 than any other team in
major league baseball -- 507,681 in 55 home games, a robust average
of 9,230 per game. They trail the team ranked 29th in attendance,
Minnesota, by a mere 303,000.
</P>
<P>
   Sagging attendance, ownership arguments and the lack of public
financing and interest in a new stadium has the franchise poised to
move, perhaps to suburban Virginia as soon as next season. The
Expos' M.O. in the '90s has been to discover and develop quality
talent and then watch it leave via free agency or
financially-motivated trades.
</P>
<P>
   But there is some richness to Montreal's past. It is where
Jackie Robinson broke into professional baseball with the
International League's Royals in 1946. Rusty Staub, Le Grande
Orange, became sort of a folk hero in Montreal, Gary Carter had his
most productive years as an Expo, and Rick Monday broke Montreal's
heart in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should be easier now,'' he said. ``One is a lot easier than
two. I think I can get one hit, so I don't think I'll be as hyped.
At this point, whether I play before 5,000 or 50,00, I just want a
hit. Bloop, chinker, bunt, line drive, I don't care what it is.''

WORKING WITHOUT R. JAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAUL OBERJUERGE  
 c.1999 San Bernardino County Sun  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ R. &UR;  &LR; Jay Soward was in full uniform, from his
gleaming cardinal helmet to his gold No. 18 jersey to his white
leather gloves.
</P>
<P>
   He had just come in from a lengthy photo session with ESPN The
Magazine, which might put the game-breaking receiver on its cover
in the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   There was irony in Soward's full-pads appearance at USC last
week because his teammates were running laps in the mid-afternoon
heat while the senior out of Fontana High School was on campus just
to pose for a magazine shoot.
</P>
<P>
   But then, the Trojans have been working without R. &UR;  &LR; Jay all
summer. By his count, he's made only three of the non-mandatory
workouts in three months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed,'' coach Paul Hackett said of Soward's summer
attendance. ``I'm very disappointed. You'd think his attitude would
be, `Let's prepare to have a great senior year.'''
</P>
<P>
   Said USC tailback Chad Morton: ``At first, everybody was kind of
mad at him. But eventually the team said, `That's R.Jay.' He's kind
of like Dennis Rodman; you gotta let him do what he does.''
</P>
<P>
   Soward, a free spirit by all accounts, knows he might not be the
most popular member of the USC football team just now. But it's
hard to stay angry at such a bright, likable guy _ and such a
talented one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach Hackett is very demanding,'' Soward said. ``He wants to
see me a lot and be around the team. Honestly, I haven't been
around the team all summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that he's apologizing. Soward came close to making himself
available for the NFL draft last April, and he sees his senior
season at USC as his last chance to kick back and relax before he
gets a high-paying job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a hard time getting out of bed,'' he said. ``I'm lazy.
I'd like to sleep all day if I could.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I get to the NFL, that's a real job. I can't be late to
meetings because I'll get fined. Here, I'm being asked to sacrifice
my body for $700 (in stipends) a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to be at school right now. It may (tick) Coach
Hackett off. He may show some animosity. So be it.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Morton: ``As long as he's not getting into trouble, that's
his choice. What he's doing now, you don't want to do in the pros _
just not show up. He can be a kid for another year, just be wild.''
</P>
<P>
   Soward concedes his attitude might be influenced by the
$7.6-million contract former teammate Chris Claiborne got. And by
the fact that former USC teammates Billy Miller and Mike
Bastianelli are now playing for pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could have gotten, like, $3 million,'' he said. ``Then I
wouldn't be eating fast food every day and trying to live on the
$60 a month my dad sends me.''
</P>
<P>
   Soward was so close to declaring for the draft that he told some
friends he would. ``I think the coaches thought I was gone,'' he
said. ``I told some of my friends I was gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he had a conversation with Marvin Demoff, a well-known
agent, who advised Soward that he would go no higher than No.10 in
the draft _ and perhaps as late as the second round.
</P>
<P>
   Soward changed his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not me,'' he said, shaking his head. ``Not even. That's not
me. I'm always top-10. If I'm not No.1, I want to be close to it.''
</P>
<P>
   He returned to Heritage Hall. ``I apologized in front of the
team,'' he said. ``I didn't think it was necessary, but Coach
Hackett felt I should do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, his erratic attendance at team functions has cost
him any organized publicity campaign on his behalf by the
university. Morton, a competent but undersized tailback, is on the
cover of the media guide.
</P>
<P>
   Soward, a player with 21 40-yards-or-more gains to his credit, a
guy who scores a touchdown every 6.9 times he touches the ball, a
preseason all-American in several publications, is relegated to the
inside of the foldout cover, sharing a page with workaday fullback
David Gibson.
</P>
<P>
   Soward said being a Heisman Trophy candidate would be nice, but
his real goal is to be No.1 in the NFL draft next year. He figures
he can do that by gaining 3,000 all-purpose yards this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's ever been done,'' he said. ``If I can do
that, I can see myself being the No.1 pick.''
</P>
<P>
   He might have a chance at 3,000. Hackett plans to have Soward
return all kickoffs and punts, and he remains the home-run threat
at receiver.
</P>
<P>
   Soward, however, wants the ball more often than he's been
getting it. He had 44 catches last year, but is thinking in terms
of 100 this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``All they have to do is throw me the ball three times a
quarter,'' he said. ``Till now, my career has been, `R.Jay, go
long, and the quarterback's gonna throw it as far as he can and you
see if you can catch it.' I mean, that's the lowest-percentage pass
there is. Then I come back to the huddle and they give the ball to
Chad or throw to Billy Miller on the `out.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, throw me a hitch, coach! Let me take a step, look at the
quarterback and turn and run!''
</P>
<P>
   He said he doesn't feel comfortable with Hackett, who last
season replaced John Robinson, a man Soward felt comfortable with.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach Hackett is so hard to talk to,'' Soward said. ``I don't
feel I can be open with him. When I'm in his office it's really
tense.''
</P>
<P>
   Soward has spent much of his summer working on his music, he
said. He has a pre-production studio in his Los Angeles apartment,
and he has recorded some rap songs, including one cut entitled
``It's a Struggle,'' and also managed his cousin, a San
Bernardino-based rythym and blues artist named Lawrence Dotson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had a lot of fun, getting out to the clubs, meeting some
people,'' Soward said. ``I've always loved music, and if I had to
walk away from football I'd make a demo tape.''
</P>
<P>
   Soward, Hackett and Morton agree on one thing: They expect No.18
to be ready to play when camp opens later this month at UC Irvine.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's gotta perform,'' Hackett said. ``He's gotta return punts,
he's gotta return kicks, he's gotta catch passes.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Morton: ``When he gets in the pads, he'll be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Soward: ``I know I have to come into camp and be in shape
and blah, blah, blah.''

TEKELEC SHARES CLIMB 23 PERCENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Wall Street gave a strong endorsement Thursday to
recent changes at telecommunications equipment specialist Tekelec,
driving up shares by 23 percent in the wake of better-than-expected
financial performance.
</P>
<P>
   The stock jumped $2.125 to $11.625 with 4.06 million shares
changing hands, four times the 30-day average. Analyst Nikos
Theodosopoulos at Warburg Dillon Read Inc. began coverage with a
``buy'' rating and a 12-month target of $17; Timothy Savageaux at
Volpe Brown Whelan &AMP; Co. lifted his rating to ``buy'' from
``neutral.''
</P>
<P>
   Savageaux also said he believes Tekelec, which sells switching
equipment and diagnostic tools for improving network performance,
is turning around its performance.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which saw shares bottom out at $6.75 four months
ago, surprised Wall Street late Wednesday with second-quarter
profits of $4.7 million, or 8 cents a share, excluding one-time
acquisition charges. Not only did that beat forecasts by a penny,
but the report also showed a 57 percent gain in back orders to a
record $66.3 million. Sales rose 20 percent to $51.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   During a conference call with analysts, Cruttenden Roth's Glenn
Powers declared, ``It looks like things are turning around.''
</P>
<P>
   Tekelec, which has about 450 employees, also acknowledged
Wednesday its profitability had been impacted by its commitment to
maintain spending on research and development and infrastructure
despite a lower-than-expected revenue base. ``Tekelec views this
investment in its future as critical toward maximizing its
long-term potential,'' it noted.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street also shrugged off the announcement that Chief
Financial Officer Gilles Godin will leave in October to spend more
time with his family and pursue personal interests. Tekelec said it
has started to search for a successor. Doug Moxley, who has been
controller since 1993, will assume Godin's duties while the search
is going on.
</P>
<P>
   Tekelec shares had hit $25 last year on optimism stemming from
sales of switching equipment to major telecom entities such as
Sprint. But the stock was hammered in February and March after a
disappointing earnings report that included failure to close sales
on time and a bleak outlook.

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Despite having premier backers, HomeStore.com
made a modest Wall Street debut on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   HomeStore.com shares rose by $2.75 to close at $22.75, up by 14
percent on volume of 10.2 million shares. The double-digit gain by
the Thousand Oaks-based parent of real estate Web sites may sound
impressive, but not in relation to investor expectations of
previous Internet highfliers with blue-blood backers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is not very receptive right now to IPOs. It's very
selective,'' said Tom Taulli, an IPO analyst and author of
Investing in IPOs. ``It's not necessarily a bad company. It's bad
timing.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Internet Capital Group went public Thursday as
well, and it rose by 103 percent to $24.4375. It is a venture
capitalist firm that invests in Internet companies. Part of the
appeal may be its business model. Indeed, Taulli said the company
is nicknamed ``CMGI Jr.,'' after the popular Internet venture
capitalist firm.
</P>
<P>
   Some other IPOs on Thursday came from Mission Critical Software,
which saw a 59 percent increase to $25.4375 a share; Interactive
Pictures Corp., whose stock rose by 6 percent to $19 a share; and
Pivotal Corp., which rose 2.6 percent a share to $12.3125.
</P>
<P>
   But the market didn't treat the initial public offering this
week from 1-800-Flowers.com too well. The stock was priced at $21
and closed at $16 on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   HomeStore.com sold 7 million shares for its IPO. Initially
priced from $8 to $10 a share, the company debuted at $20 and
garnered about $121.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   After the offering, total outstanding shares stood at 67
million. The lead underwriter is Morgan Stanley. The company's
backers include the National Association of Realtors, GE Capital
and Kleiner Perkins, a well-known venture capitalist firm that has
backed Netscape, Excite and Sun Microsystems.
</P>
<P>
   HomeStore.com operates these Web sites: Realtor.com, which lists
1.4 million homes out of 1.5 million available nationally;
HomeBuilder.com, which lists more than 100,000 new homes;
SpringStreet.com, which lists 45,000 rental properties in more than
6,000 cities; and CommercialSource.com, which provides links to
commercial property listings.
</P>
<P>
   HomeStore.com traces its roots to July 1993. Back then, the
company was known as InfoTouch and developed kiosks with computer
screens for home-listings searches, according to Securities and
Exchange Commission filings.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, RealSelect was formed to operate the
Realtor.com real estate Web site. RealSelect initially was owned by
the National Association of Realtors and NetSelect LLC. In turn,
NetSelect LLC was owned by InfoTouch and a holding company called
NetSelect Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Last February, NetSelect Inc., NetSelect LLC and InfoTouch
merged into the entity now called HomeStore.com.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the company reported revenues of $19 million but lost
$69 million. For the first six months of 1999, HomeStore.com lost
$50 million on revenues of $21.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   HomeStore.com also is being sued by Cendant Corp., which alleges
that it reneged on a deal that gives it access to real estate
listings in exchange for part ownership in the Internet company.
</P>
<P>
   HomeStore officials declined to comment on the pending
litigation.

RED SOX GO NOWHERE IN TRIP OPENER 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-ANGELS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ With Mo Vaughn in no position to help or
hinder his former team Thursday &UR;  &LR; night, the Red Sox opened a
seven-game trip here against an Angels team that has been dangerous
only to itself for much of this season.
</P>
<P>
   But even with Vaughn absent because of a staph infection that
likely will cause him to miss the entire weekend, the Angels were
anything but an E ticket ride at Disneyland for the Sox, whose
wild-card aspirations are sandwiched between the Blue Jays and A's
at the moment.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox managed just four singles, advancing just one runner
to third base in falling, 8-0, to the Angels before 26,175 in
Edison International Field. The Blue Jays, who were idle, now lead
the Sox by a game, while the A's moved within a game of Boston by
beating the White Sox in extra innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox, who have lost three of their last four games, are 13-18
since July 1. Of those 18 losses, this was the seventh time they
have lost by five runs or more. Nomar Garciaparra's 13-game hitting
streak also came to an end, as he went 0 for 4, with left fielder
Orlando Palmeiro robbing him of a hit with a diving catch in the
eighth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Brian Rose was unable to pitch past the fifth inning for
the seventh time in his last eight starts, leaving with a 3-0
deficit in the fourth, when Troy Glaus followed singles by Jim
Edmonds and Darin Erstad with a three-run home run. Rose gave up
six hits and walked three before he departed.
</P>
<P>
   Rose, now 6-4, has walked three or more batters only three times
in 15 starts this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I had an answer for that,'' Rose said when asked about
Thursday &UR;  &LR; night's control problems, ``because then I would have
fixed it out there. I used to be able to find out what was wrong
and correct it.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I don't throw strikes, this is what usually happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Glaus's home run was the first three-run homer struck by an
Angels player since Vaughn went deep June 24 against the Mariners,
37 games ago. Any questions why the Angels are in last place in the
American League West, 19 games behind division-leading Texas?
</P>
<P>
   Rose retired the next two batters after the home run, but Jimy
Williams retrieved him following Palmeiro's two-out single. By
then, Rose already had thrown 78 pitches, and Williams had surmised
that Rose's capacity for escaping trouble of his own making had
expired. The rookie righthander had base runners in every inning,
including the second, when he walked the first three batters but
survived when Jeff Huson tapped into a pitcher-to-home-to-first
double play and rookie Ben Molina lined to center.
</P>
<P>
   Newcomer Bryce Florie spelled Rose after Palmeiro's hit, retired
Gary DiSarcina to end the fourth, and worked a scoreless fifth
before the Angels pounced on him in the sixth, when Glaus walked
and Huson and Molina followed with singles to make it 4-0.
</P>
<P>
   Williams went to lefty Mark Guthrie, last seen making out his
last will and testament after giving up a game-winning home run to
David Justice Monday night. There's no telling what Guthrie would
have done Thursday &UR;  &LR; night if Palmeiro, who flied out to the track
in right to bring home a fifth run, had lofted his ball a couple of
feet farther.
</P>
<P>
   As it was, Guthrie let both of his inherited runners score, as
Garret Anderson blooped a two-out single to center to make it 6-0.
Guthrie gave up the last two Angels runs as well.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox, meanwhile, were being mesmerized by Chuck Finley,
the lefthander who has spun some beauties against them in the past
but has been mostly awful this season, entering the game with a
Woolworth's record (five and dime) and a 5.76 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox actually looked like they might get to Finley early,
until Mike Stanley ran them out of a potential rally in the first.
Jose Offerman walked and two outs later Stanley drew another pass.
Butch Huskey then shot a single through the left side, but the
combination of a newly conservative Wendell Kim, the third base
coach, and the overzealous Stanley, sabotaged the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Kim threw up the brakes to the speedy Offerman, holding him at
third as Stanley chugged around second, head down, unaware that
Palmeiro's throw was cut off by third baseman Glaus. The Angels
trapped him in a rundown, before second baseman Huson whirled and
threw to the plate to retire Offerman, bolting for home on a
suicide mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two-out situation, we had a chance maybe to do some things
early,'' Williams said. ``Leadoff hitter on second base, two outs,
two strikes on the hitter, but the ball was hit really hard, right
at him (Palmeiro), he came at the ball hard and came up with it
clean. It would have been a really close play.''
</P>
<P>
   A play you force the Angels to make?
</P>
<P>
   ``As I've said before, you normally send him,'' Williams said.
``But not being in the (coaching) box, that's a different position.
You see where the runner is, the ball is, you've got to make a
decision quick.
</P>
<P>
   ``You go with the decision. That's what I believe. The decision
was made.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox didn't stir again until the sixth, when singles by John
Valentin and Stanley put runners on the corners with one out. But
Finley retired Huskey on a tapper to third and Troy O'Leary
whiffed, Finley's seventh strikeout of the night.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a quality pitcher,'' Valentin said. ``They've been saying
he's not pitching as well. You hope that he'd fall behind us and
we'd hit him, but today he pitched well.''

TINO MARTINEZ HOMERS TWICE TO BEAT MARINERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ During batting practice, especially before the first
game of a series, Mariners manager Lou Piniella often floats around
the batting cage, like the host at a party, greeting guests with a
smile and small talk.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, as he prepared to take his turn in the cage, New
York Yankees first baseman Tino Martinez came by and hugged
Piniella, his former boss with the Mariners. Then he showed
complete disregard for etiquette by spoiling the party.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez hit two home runs, including the 200th of his career,
as the Yankees beat the Mariners, 7-4, before a sold-out Safeco
Field. Teammate Bernie Williams added four hits and three runs
batted in as the Mariners fell to a season-high 12{ games behind
the Texas Rangers in the American League West.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, part of the 1995 team that generated the momentum to
build Safeco, worked with coaches before the game on shortening his
stride. The adjustments helped snap a 4-for-35 skid for Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Derek) Jeter said to Tino, `You waited until you got home,'''
said Yankees manager Joe Torre. ``He likes it here in the new
ballpark. He broke it in right.''
</P>
<P>
   If 45,190 fans were expecting a pitchers' duel, they didn't get
it. The Yankees' Roger Clemens threw 126 pitches over seven
innings, the Mariners' Jamie Moyer 117 over six.
</P>
<P>
   Selectivity at the plate was a hallmark of the Yankees' 1998
championship season. Moyer was facing New York for the first time
in more than a year, and noticed a significant difference between
the Yankees and the Baltimore Orioles, whom he beat in his last
start while throwing only 29 fewer pitches in two more innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're very disciplined hitters,'' Moyer said of the Yankees.
``You look at that club and put Baltimore on the same field, and
Baltimore swung at a lot of my first pitches. (The Yankees) were
more selective. It would be interesting to see how many first-pitch
strikes I threw; probably not a whole lot. That made a big
difference tonight. But it wasn't just their patience. It was a
combination of their patience and my inconsistency.''
</P>
<P>
   The difference in the game was Martinez, who had not homered in
more than three weeks. He broke a 2-2 tie with a solo shot in the
second, then hit a two-run blast to overcome a 4-3 deficit in the
sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Moyer allowed five earned runs on seven hits and two walks over
six innings. He was touched in the first inning by a familiar foe _
Williams, who now has 23 hits in 46 career at-bats off the
left-hander. With two on and one out in the first, Williams drilled
a triple to right-center, giving New York an early lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners erased the Yankees' lead in their half against
Clemens, whose 18 wins against the M's are the most of any active
pitcher. Only Dave Stewart, with 20, has beaten Seattle more times.
</P>
<P>
   But the Clemens of '99 has been different from the pitcher who
has dominated the American League since the mid-'80s. He missed
three weeks with tightness in his left hamstring early in the year,
then won six of his next eight starts.
</P>
<P>
   But over six July starts, he was 1-2 with a 5.30 earned-run
average, and has had trouble this year starting games strong. His
ERA has consistently been twice as high the first two innings as it
has the rest of the game.
</P>
<P>
   That pattern continued last night. Brian Hunter was nearly
buzzed by Clemens' second pitch of the game; he then sliced a
single to right. With two outs and a runner on first, Clemens tried
to bust Alex Rodriguez inside. But he missed over the plate, and
Rodriguez crunched a two-run homer over the wall in right-center,
tying the score 2-2.
</P>
<P>
   It was Rodriguez's 26th home run of the year, and sixth at
Safeco Field. The left-field power alley is 388 feet from the
plate, but Rodriguez has improvised: four of those six homers have
gone the opposite way.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens encountered trouble again in the third. Russ Davis led
off with a single, then Hunter and David Bell fought Clemens off to
draw walks. Ken Griffey Jr. drove in Davis on a single to left, and
Rodriguez brought home Hunter on a sacrifice fly to right. That
gave the M's a 4-3 lead, and by the time Edgar Martinez grounded
into an inning-ending double play, Clemens had induced only four
swings that missed over three innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first,'' Torre said, ``it looked like he was trying to
throw the ball to Mount Rainier.''
</P>
<P>
   But the rest of the game was a vintage effort. Jay Buhner swung
and missed at all three strikes for Clemens' first whiff in the
fourth. Clemens hustled to the bag for the throw on John Mabry's
grounder to the second base hole, then fanned Davis to end the
inning.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens went 1-2-3 through the fifth, put two runners on but
struck out Mabry to end the sixth and finished with a 1-2-3 seventh
highlighted by Williams' racing catch of a long fly by Bell to end
the inning.

ALLEN WATSON HAPPY BACK IN NEW YORK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Allen Watson never asked the Mariners for his release
_ verbally, at least.
</P>
<P>
   In every other way, he let them know he wasn't happy. Watson's
body was in a Mariners uniform for nine days in June, but his mind
was far away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to be here,'' said Watson, in town with the New
York Yankees. ``I had some pretty good reasons why I didn't want to
be here. I guess they kind of figured it out.''
</P>
<P>
   After spending three years with West Coast teams, Watson signed
with his hometown New York Mets last winter. Other teams showed
interest, he said, and he could have signed for more money. But he
wanted to play in New York, because his only sibling, a sister,
needed help raising her son.
</P>
<P>
   Used infrequently by the Mets, Watson came to Seattle in
mid-June for pitcher Mac Suzuki. It was a disaster from the first
hitter Watson faced, in Cleveland on June 19 in a game he now calls
the worst of his career.
</P>
<P>
   That day, Watson allowed a leadoff homer, and two more homers to
the next eight batters. He pitched three games for the M's,
allowing first-batter home runs each time. In all, he got nine outs
and allowed five long balls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love baseball, it's what I live for, play hard for and
dedicate myself to,'' Watson said. ``But just at that point, I
wasn't there. It wasn't fair to Seattle. No excuses _ I just
pitched bad.''
</P>
<P>
   With his mind elsewhere, Watson wasn't himself with the
Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys were great, Lou (Piniella) was great,'' Watson said.
``I just didn't pitch well and I wasn't mentally here. That's a bad
combination.''
</P>
<P>
   Watson was released on June 28, and signed with the Yankees. In
five games before Thursday night, he had allowed one earned run in
72/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Being close to his family, he said, has made all the difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baseball players go through the same things in life as anybody
else does,'' Watson said. ``Everybody thinks we're different
because we play baseball. But whatever happens in their lives
happens to us.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; el.5l &LR;
</P>
<P>
   SEE BALL, HIT BALL: John Mabry grinned as he hustled down the
ramp from the Mariners clubhouse to the batting tunnel Thursday
night. He'd already taken batting practice, but Mabry was going for
another round of a new technique that's gaining popularity with M's
hitters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything to get an edge,'' Mabry said.
</P>
<P>
   The first baseman is one of eight Mariners participating in a
new kind of eye-hand coordination drill. Conditioned Ocular
Enhancement, a Chicago-based company that works extensively with
the Milwaukee Brewers, has been training Mariners hitters using
tennis balls traveling as fast as 160 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Davidson, a ``visual trainer'' for the company, inks a
number on each of the four sides of the ball. Hitters try to read
the number as the ball flashes by, with Mabry's 1-in-4 success rate
among the best.
</P>
<P>
   Using a patented machine, Davidson gradually increases the speed
of the tennis balls from 70 to 160 mph. The goal is to make better
contact hitters and reduce strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the guys are seeing the ball hit the bat now,''
Davidson said. ``Did you ever ask players if they see the ball hit
the bat? Nine out of 10 say no. And here, we're training guys to
see the ball hit the bat, and at that split second, they actually
see the ball stop. Once they see it, they're all over it.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; el.5l &LR;
</P>
<P>
   BABY TALK: It's been an uneventful season on the field for
Carlos Guillen, who has been down since early April with a torn
anterior cruciate ligament. He's been working out 4-5 hours a day,
and said he might start hitting next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a couple of months, I have to get ready for winter ball,''
Guillen said. ``I think I might be ready in November.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, he's enjoying fatherhood. Guillen's wife gave
birth to their first child, Alfonso Jose, on July 11.
</P>
<P>
   Another Mariner is preparing for the role _ outfielder Shane
Monahan has ``MM'' written on the back of his cap for daughter
Madison Monahan, who is due in three months.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; el.5l &LR;
</P>
<P>
   AROUND THE HORN: Yankees pitcher David Cone was honored before
the game as the 1999 Hutch Award winner. Cone received the award,
which honors competitive spirit, at the Post-Intelligencer's Sports
Star of the Year banquet in February. ... Even with his error
Wednesday, Russ Davis entered Thursday night's game third among
American League third basemen in fielding percentage, at .956. ...
The Mariners tied their three-year-old club record of 25 pitchers
in a season when Tom Davey made his first appearance Wednesday. The
M's are four shy of the all-time mark, set by the 1996 Angels.

YANKEES CHRISTEN SAFECO FIELD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ At last, the real opening of Safeco Field.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees came to town Thursday night. Tino Martinez, the
matinee idol. Pesky little Chuck Kno-blauch. Smooth Derek Jeter,
and the glowering Paulie O'Neill.
</P>
<P>
   You better watch out for flying Gatorade dispensers. O'Neill can
go off, which is why Mariner fans booed O'Neill with delight
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   This is the fun of it all.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks to the night that Seattle dawned (or is that
dusked?) a new era of outdoor baseball, the Mariners got the one
opponent worthy of stepping first onto the green grass of their new
ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   Forget that the Padres, Diamondbacks, Twins, Royals, A's,
Orioles and Devil Rays all dipped their toes in Safeco's grass
already.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees finally made it here for Opening Night, Part II.
</P>
<P>
   The defending World Series champion Yankees helped make us feel
the kind of heady rush that the presence of a true baseball rival
can induce in a baseball town, which Seattle still is, right?
</P>
<P>
   If you were watching Thursday night, did you catch the blinding
glare of all those camera flashbulbs when in the first inning, Ken
Griffey Jr. stood in against Roger Clemens?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it was an All-Star matchup; a Hall of Fame moment. But it
was enhanced by the fact that Clemens is a Yankee now and Griffey,
a lifelong Mariner (so far) and the little kid former Yankees
manager Billy Martin chased from the Yankees clubhouse, was at the
plate to defend his new, natural home turf.
</P>
<P>
   The night had some pop.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, that was Alex Rodriguez and not Griffey who took Rocket
Roger deep in the first inning to waken the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   And yes, that was Tino Martinez who did A-Rod one better.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez was once the ultimate Mariner but when his free-agent
price tag grew too big because of all he accomplished with the M's
through the magical season of '95, Mariner manager Lou Piniella
took Martinez aside and asked the fellow Tampa native where he
wanted to be traded.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Yankees are the Yankees, Martinez told his skipper
to ship him to the Bronx _ a place with so many World Series
banners and so much history, they play amongst stone monuments
erected for baseball ghosts who never quite die.
</P>
<P>
   Since Martinez has been a Yankee, he has indeed won two World
Series, making it easier to forget all the emotional moments in
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   But word out of New York earlier this week is that Martinez was
asking about the new park. How does it play? Is it true what they
say about the fences being too far back? Is Safeco as grand as
everyone has reported?
</P>
<P>
   He must have taken notes. Martinez came to town and etched his
mark on Safeco.
</P>
<P>
   During his first at-bat at the park he helped build, the other
half of the Two-Martinez Launch cranked a homer to right field _
the 200th of his career. And in the sixth, Martinez belted his
second of the night, one that pushed the Yankees to a 5-4 lead that
would grow to a 7-4 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Still, you gotta love that guy.
</P>
<P>
   And say what you want about the Yankees, you gotta love them,
too _ or at least acknowledge their place in Seattle baseball lore,
if not Seattle's baseball history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the Yankees had some problems here in the past,''
Yankees manager Joe Torre said Thursday night, although it was not
Torre's ship that sunk those three electric October nights when the
Mariners committed the most improbable, franchise-saving comeback
in the history of baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe this is the start of a new era,'' Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   What Torre meant was, maybe this first Safeco Field series
between the Mariners and Yankees is the start of the new era in
which the Yankees will no longer be made to look like chumps, as
they were in the Kingdome.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is better. That dome _ there is something about a dome.
When you play, you want to have a little touch of the outside about
the ballpark,'' Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the misery the Mariners dished to the Yankees back
in '95, the Yankees remain every bit as much the reason Safeco
Field exists. As much as the M's and their September to remember.
As much as the swooning Angels.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, without question, the Yankees should have been the
Mariners' first visitor at Safeco Field.
</P>
<P>
   The schedule-makers had it completely wrong, bringing us the
Padres to kick off this rekindling love affair with the game. The
curse of inter-league baseball struck us at completely the worst
time, diminishing Safeco's original grand opening with a
novelty-type matchup.
</P>
<P>
   Don't get the wrong idea. There have been a healthy smattering
of Safeco Moments so far in the ballpark's infant existence.
</P>
<P>
   There was the return of Randy Johnson. There is the shrinking
Mariner pitching staff ERA. There was the first homer (Russ Davis)
and the first steal of home plate (Dan Wilson) and the first fan to
get hit by a foul ball (the writer of this column).
</P>
<P>
   But three weeks to the night of Safeco's first opening night,
the M's got their true rival to stop by the new yard for the start
of what we hope is a sizzling weekend series.
</P>
<P>
   For these Yankees, they should have brought back the Seattle
Symphony. They should have hung the bunting back up.
</P>
<P>
   More than simply the grand ceremonial feel of Safeco's inaugural
game, the arrival of the Yankees has marked Safeco's real opening
night.

<TEXT>
<P>
   What a wonderful time it is to be a boss of a big company. Money
pours into your lap. How easy it must be to believe, with John D.
Rockefeller, that ``the power to make money is a gift of God'' _
and that your accumulating fortune is the direct and justifiable
result of superhuman managerial talent.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is usually more mundane.
</P>
<P>
   The largest and speediest creation of fortunes that the world
has ever seen is taking place mainly because of lucky timing, as
executives (particularly Americans) happen to have been around when
a greater slice of their remuneration has arrived in the form of
share options _ the right to buy some of a company's equity at an
agreed price, after an agreed length of time.
</P>
<P>
   And the buoyant stock market has hugely and unexpectedly
inflated the value of these options.
</P>
<P>
   If the effect of options _ known as share options in Britain,
stock options in America _ has been to make a few thousand bosses
staggeringly rich, should that be a cause for concern?
</P>
<P>
   Some people find extreme wealth intrinsically repellent. Wide
divergence of rewards within companies may make it harder to reap
the rewards of team-building and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   To this, however, a shareholder might retort that a first-class
boss can make so large a difference to a company's performance that
almost any price is worth paying for his services. And in the old,
pre-1990s days when pay was just pay, managers often just did what
they liked.
</P>
<P>
   Yet investors may be paying a higher price than they realize.
The spread of share options may be distorting the economy,
contributing to a temporary overvaluation of equities, encouraging
shortsighted managerial decisions and storing up problems for
companies in the future.
</P>
<P>
   The theory behind options is that they turn paid managers into
part-owners, thus aligning bosses' interests with those of
shareholders. Their huge popularity represents a rare triumph of an
economic idea.
</P>
<P>
   An influential article in the Harvard Business Review in 1990
argued that, if top executives were rewarded like bureaucrats, they
would behave like them, too.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the top employees of big American firms have a claim on
more than 13 percent of the equity of their firms. Elsewhere, the
proportion is also rising, although from a lower base.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the evidence for a link between options and
performance is thin. Even so, options may have brought benefits.
</P>
<P>
   They have focused management attention, to an unprecedented
extent, on shareholder value. They have encouraged firms to drive
down costs, even in the middle of a boom. They have discouraged
some of the empire-building mergers that were a feature of the
1960s and 1970s. They may have persuaded many bright youngsters to
choose a business career.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, they have reduced the cash costs of starting a
company: employees can be brought on board with the mere promise of
future growth that a share option represents.
</P>
<P>
   A firm with almost no assets can compete for staff head-to-head
with an IBM, simply because it can lure clever people by offering
options.
</P>
<P>
   Silicon Valley, cradle of the information-technology revolution,
is built on options _ not just for the bosses, but for most staff.
</P>
<P>
   Some would even argue that America's uniquely generous use of
options may explain America's uniquely successful economy. The
trouble is that the causality could easily be the other way around:
a booming economy and stock market may have themselves encouraged
the use of options instead of cash pay.
</P>
<P>
   Accounting rules mean that companies do not normally have to
treat options as an expense, charged against reported profits, as
they do any other form of compensation. So options have become a
cheap way to pay top staff.
</P>
<P>
   But what is cheap in the short term may turn out to be expensive
in the long, for three reasons. First, when share values retreat,
boards face a dilemma: do they assume that the boss who was worth a
fortune when equity prices were high is still worth a fortune when
they are low, and replace devalued shares with expensive cash?
</P>
<P>
   That, broadly speaking, is what happened during the most recent
prolonged fall in share prices, in the early 1970s, although
options then were both less common and less valuable.
</P>
<P>
   Or the board could reprice the options, as some did when equity
prices dipped last year. But the Financial Accounting Standards
Board has decreed that in such cases firms should take a hit
against profits.
</P>
<P>
   Repricing makes a nonsense of any claim that managers now face
incentives and risks similar to those of owners.
</P>
<P>
   Secondly, even if accounts do not show it, options may in
practice impose a cost on shareholders by diluting a firm's
existing equity. Options that are not set off against corporate
income inflate reported profits, perhaps by as much as 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   If they were treated as an expense, recorded profit growth would
be lower. Would share prices be lower too? Only if investors do not
already understand the numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Those who are prepared to hunt through the footnotes to the
accounts and do some strenuous work on their calculators may indeed
understand what has happened to their investments _ although in
many countries outside the United States, even that much is
impossible.
</P>
<P>
   But it would still be better if the accounts were made more
transparent so that all investors could easily assess the extent of
a company's true liabilities.
</P>
<P>
   A third difficulty is more fundamental: in attempting to align
the interests of the managers and the owners of a company, the
owners have introduced a bias that may come back to bite them.
</P>
<P>
   Managers motivated by options have been jacking up their firm's
share prices, often by issuing debt and using the proceeds to buy
back equity.
</P>
<P>
   Another influential economic idea, the Modigliani-Miller
theorem, named after its two Nobel-prize-winning originators,
suggests that this is fine: how a firm is financed makes no
difference to its value, other things equal.
</P>
<P>
   But running up debts does make a difference to the value of
those options. And other things are not equal: very high levels of
corporate debt make a firm more vulnerable to bankruptcy in the
event of a downturn.
</P>
<P>
   Shareholders have shown an astonishing willingness to share
their equity with executives, and with remarkably few strings
attached.
</P>
<P>
   The link between options and performance has usually been taken
on trust. But in the United States, options with a performance
target have to be counted as a cost against profits.
</P>
<P>
   If the rules were changed to treat all new options as expenses,
two benefits would result. Boards would no longer be discouraged
from linking options to performance. That would ensure that
executives did not make their fortunes merely because the overall
stock market rose.
</P>
<P>
   And investors would have a clearer view of what their company
was really worth. If they already invest rationally, share prices
should not even twitch. &QL;

   HALIFAX, NOVA SCOTIA _ First passive smoking, now passive
smelling.
</P>
<P>
   It cannot be tolerated, the people of Halifax, the capital of
Nova Scotia, are being told. Though the air in this Canadian port
may sometimes carry the fragrance of fish, the citizens themselves
should not indulge in the immoderate use of scent, after-shave,
hair spray or strong-smelling deodorant.
</P>
<P>
   No edict yet has the force of law, but many businesses and
public offices now tell staff, and ask visitors, not to use balms
that could offend their colleagues. Those who transgress in
scent-free zones may be asked to wash.
</P>
<P>
   And about time, too, it should be said. To stand downwind of
another's perfume may send more than the nostrils aquiver, while
the mix of dozens of cheap scents can be overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   Rightly, the public-spirited employers of Halifax have taken
responsibility for their staff. It is about time someone put a foot
down. But why stop with smells? Among offenses against the senses,
scents are not the only ones to incense.
</P>
<P>
   Noise is especially irksome. Overlook, for present purposes, the
ubiquitous ghetto-blaster, the supposedly silent but
impossible-to-ignore Walkman, the chirping mobile phone and the
inane conversation of those who take such delight in using it.
</P>
<P>
   Concentrate instead on chatter, and in particular the
chatterer's charter, the so-called right to free speech.
</P>
<P>
   Those who are impudent enough to talk in public at all _ in the
street, on buses and in trains _ only do it to annoy. And in Nova
Scotia they even do it in a funny old Scottish accent.
</P>
<P>
   A total ban is long overdue. Then there is the matter of
appearance. Applaud the good burghers of Halifax for forbidding the
use of hair spray. Improvements to the air quality aside, that will
do much to rid television screens of images of bouffon-haired
politicians.
</P>
<P>
   But whose retina has not also been scorched by a particularly
vile checked shirt, shoulder pads so huge that they would become an
American football-player, or a pair of trousers that would have
looked out of place even on the backside of a Soviet booldozeristka
_ female tractor-driver _ of yore?
</P>
<P>
   Let's confine these clothes to private clubs.
</P>
<P>
   It may seem indelicate to mention more personal shortcomings,
but medical science now has solutions to many of the sights that so
often cause public dismay _ bad teeth, for example, and big noses.
Some people really are too plump; that can be fixed.
</P>
<P>
   Others need to remember that hair is frequently a needless cause
of unsightliness. Those who have too little will find that
transplants, never mind toupees, are nowadays quite inexpensive.
Those who have too much should just cut it. This applies
particularly to the facial fuzz beloved by all those awful bearded
journalists.
</P>
<P>
   Redheads, incidentally, need not be embarrassed to dye their
hair some less offensive color.
</P>
<P>
   In Halifax, it is the task of the personnel manager and the
buildings superintendent to enforce the no-fragrance rules. That is
sensible too _ though really these people should be given their
proper titles, the human-resources director and the facilities
manager.
</P>
<P>
   Every company needs them, just as it needs appropriate rules to
govern the thoughtlessness and intolerance of those who insist upon
being fragrant.
</P>
<P>
   Let the wives of litigious husbands take note. And, by the by,
let's have no flowers in public gardens: a rose is a rose is a
rose, not a machine for making sweet smells. &QL;

   A total ban is long overdue. Then there is the matter of
appearance. Applaud the good burghers of Halifax for forbidding the
use of hair spray. Improvements to the air quality aside, that will
do much to rid television screens of images of bouffon-haired
politicians.
</P>
<P>
   But whose retina has not also been scorched by a particularly
vile checked shirt, shoulder pads so huge that they would become an
American football-player, or a pair of trousers that would have
looked out of place even on the backside of a Soviet booldozeristka
_ female tractor-driver _ of yore?
</P>
<P>
   Let's confine these clothes to private clubs.
</P>
<P>
   It may seem indelicate to mention more personal shortcomings,
but medical science now has solutions to many of the sights that so
often cause public dismay _ bad teeth, for example, and big noses.
Some people really are too plump; that can be fixed.
</P>
<P>
   Others need to remember that hair is frequently a needless cause
of unsightliness. Those who have too little will find that
transplants, never mind toupees, are nowadays quite inexpensive.
Those who have too much should just cut it. This applies
particularly to the facial fuzz beloved by all those awful bearded
journalists.
</P>
<P>
   Redheads, incidentally, need not be embarrassed to dye their
hair some less offensive color.
</P>
<P>
   In Halifax, it is the task of the personnel manager and the
buildings superintendent to enforce the no-fragrance rules. That is
sensible too _ though really these people should be given their
proper titles, the human-resources director and the facilities
manager.
</P>
<P>
   Every company needs them, just as it needs appropriate rules to
govern the thoughtlessness and intolerance of those who insist upon
being fragrant.
</P>
<P>
   Let the wives of litigious husbands take note. And, by the by,
let's have no flowers in public gardens: a rose is a rose is a
rose, not a machine for making sweet smells. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   The Wisconsin governor's office is closed for renovations, which
means that Governor Tommy Thompson has to meet your Economist
correspondent, Lexington, in a small conference room, the sort of
place any minor businessman might use.
</P>
<P>
   The governor does not have the usual politician's polish. He
looks more like a small-town bank president who enjoys hunting
ducks with his customers at the weekend but is perfectly capable on
Monday morning of bullying those who have fallen behind on their
payments.
</P>
<P>
   He brims with confidence, and yet pauses periodically to ask his
visitor personal questions that would seem odd anywhere outside the
Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson has dominated Wisconsin's politics for 13 years. He has
led the Republican Party along the road to its present position on
subjects like welfare reform and school choice.
</P>
<P>
   He is far more sure-footed than the acerbic fellows who make up
most of the Republican ranks in Congress in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   If presidential nominations were based on accomplishment alone,
it is Tommy G., not George W., who would now have the Republican
presidential nomination all but locked up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I initiated welfare reform in this country,'' Thompson says
with no hint of modesty; and he is right.
</P>
<P>
   The W-2 program (Wisconsin Works) was the first to insist that
able-bodied welfare recipients either find work or lose the dole.
It combined the stick of time-limits with large dollops of money
for training, transport, health care and child care.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson has raised state subsidies for child care from $12
million to over $150 million. As a result, the number of Wisconsin
families on welfare has fallen spectacularly, from 100,000 to a
mere 8,000.
</P>
<P>
   He also created one of the country's first school-choice
programs for poor students. Pupils can select the school they want
to go to from a range of options that includes state schools,
private religious schools, vocational schools, and charter schools
operated by bodies such as the University of Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   And Thompson should get at least some of the credit for bringing
Wisconsin's flabby economy back into shape.
</P>
<P>
   When he was first elected governor, in 1986, he cut or
eliminated a number of taxes, made the training of workers
tax-deductible, and vigorously lured businesses into the state.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment has fallen from 7 percent when he took office to
under 3 percent now. True, times have been good from coast to
coast, but Wisconsin's unemployment has now been lower than the
national rate for 144 consecutive months.
</P>
<P>
   It is one of the few states where manufacturing jobs are sharply
on the rise, and the combination of a healthy economy and dwindling
welfare rolls has put a record 69 percent of the state's
working-age population into wage or salary jobs, up from 54 percent
when Thompson became governor.
</P>
<P>
   How has he got these things done in a state that voted for Bill
Clinton in both 1992 and 1996, and whose legislature has been
controlled by Democrats for half of the governor's time in office?
</P>
<P>
   Thompson is, says Bill Kristol, the editor of the conservative
Weekly Standard, ``a strong and bullheaded guy who is also a very
good politician.''
</P>
<P>
   He is personable, but he is also just rough enough around the
edges to make opponents cock a wary eye at him. Above all, he is a
serious realist.
</P>
<P>
   The essence of his governorship, says Donald Kettl, a professor
of political science at the University of Wisconsin, has been his
ability to work out and then to sell common-sense solutions to
familiar problems.
</P>
<P>
   He manages to present these solutions, even pretty conservative
ones, in a non-ideological way.
</P>
<P>
   Welfare reform means finding poor people jobs, says the
governor. If he had just gone out there ``and said I'm going to
kick everybody off welfare, I would have never got anything done.''
</P>
<P>
   At key moments, he invites his Democratic opponents to the
discussion table rather than leaving them to throw stones from a
distance.
</P>
<P>
   In his first term, he put a senior Democrat in charge of the
state's health and family services, and then gave him
responsibility for getting the first of his welfare reforms through
the legislature. The committee that hammered out the details of the
final bill had more Democrats than Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Should Washington's Republicans, who have a knack of snatching
defeat from the jaws of victory, pay more attention to Thompson? He
reckons they have something to learn.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with the Republicans in Congress is that ``they make
these outlandish statements. That scares people.'' The Republicans'
rhetoric can be so shrill, he says, that even their talk of vast
tax cuts makes people wary.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, there are Republicans in Washington who give
Thompson his due for fighting lonely battles and winning most of
them. But, they add, it is easier to do these things from the
executive branch of government.
</P>
<P>
   While governors fix the bridges on roads already built, the
Republican majority in Congress has the harder task of drawing the
map for the roads of the future.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there may be lessons for the map-drawers in Thompson's
success. The Republican right may sneer at ``compassionate
conservatism,'' but the voters seem to find it an attractive pair
of words.
</P>
<P>
   It is not yet time for Thompson to declare victory and go home.
He has recently unveiled a new program which will expand Medicaid
coverage to children and adults in working families earning less
than 185 percent of the federal poverty level.
</P>
<P>
   He will almost certainly have to modify his welfare-reform
program when the economy starts to slow down.
</P>
<P>
   And, as if that were not enough, Congress has made Thompson the
chairman of Amtrak, with the task of making America's
passenger-train system self-sufficient within four years.
</P>
<P>
   This year Amtrak high-speed trains will link up Washington, New
York and Boston. There are plans for a profitable high-speed rail
corridor in California, and a nine-state network in the Midwest
with Chicago at its hub.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson has endorsed George W. Bush for the Republican
nomination. Down the road, there may be a vice-presidential
candidacy, or a job in a Bush cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   But why, Lexington asks, is Thompson, who has much the more
impressive record, not himself the nominee?
</P>
<P>
   ``Four reasons,'' he answers without pause. ``One, my name's not
Bush. Two, I don't come from Texas. Three, I don't have $40
million. Four, he's better-looking.''
</P>
<P>
   There's a realist. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   HAPPY, TEXAS _ Back in Europe, funny-sounding place-names such
as Ramsbottom emerged slowly out of the feudal mulch. Not so in
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Here, names came as suddenly as the settlements. Admire the wry
humor of the pioneer who called his new home Grit. And pity the
macho cowboy who, thanks to an effete ancestor's whim, has to admit
he hails from Twitty.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, place-names come in all styles. Marfa, a west Texas
town bothered recently by lights said to come from alien
spacecraft, was named after a character in one of Dostoevsky's
novels.
</P>
<P>
   Eden and Utopia also fall into the ethereal category. Fate and
Uncertain are darkly ambiguous, no doubt an attempt by the towns'
founders to dampen the spirits of their more happy-go-lucky
descendants.
</P>
<P>
   Flat, Flatonia and Levelland come straight to the point, as do
Cactus and Notrees, a town so bald and remote that it resorts to
decorating itself with tumbleweeds instead of trees at Christmas
time.
</P>
<P>
   Most towns in southern and western Texas have Spanish names,
such as San Antonio and El Paso. But central Texas is dominated by
Germans.
</P>
<P>
   There are New Baden, New Braunfels (named after its founder,
Prince Carl von Solms-Braunfels), New Salem and New Ulm, not to
mention Schertz, Schuler, Schroeder, Schulenberg and Schwertner.
</P>
<P>
   Scotland, naturally, did not take this lying down. It has
provided, to name a few, Dundee, Edinburg (Texans have dropped the
confusing ``h''), McAllen, McGregor, McKinney, McLeod and,
sandwiched between McLean and McClellan Lake, the town of Alanreed.
</P>
<P>
   Even Dallas shares its name with a village in the Scottish
Highlands.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Texas's heroes are well remembered. Turn to the map for
Crockett, Travis, Austin and, of course, Houston (from Sam,
governor and commander of the Texan army in the Mexican war).
</P>
<P>
   Alamo, Lonestar and Jacinto City (after the battle which won
Texan independence from Mexico) have the same ring of patriotism.
Only a few places _ such as Washington, Taft and Roosevelt _
grudgingly admit to a larger American patriotism.
</P>
<P>
   East of Dallas lies the town of Quitman, named after John
Anthony Quitman, governor of Mexico after the Mexican-American war,
and the only American ever to preside over Montezuma's palace.
</P>
<P>
   Some names are pretty un-Texan. Humble, a suburb of Houston,
would sit better in quietly spoken South Dakota than in the brazen
Lone Star state. Impact, Cut-and-Shoot, Dimmit and Gun Barrel City
are more like it.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Moody and Petty aside, Texan place-names tend to have an
upbeat flavor, as befits a state whose name is derived from an
Indian word meaning ``friendly.''
</P>
<P>
   There are Energy, Smiley, Jolly and Joy. Best of all is Happy, a
threadbare town of 588 souls set in the breezy, big-sky cattle
country south of Amarillo.
</P>
<P>
   The name certainly cheered up your correspondent on a recent
visit, but it is not easy to live up to. Despite the Happy Center
(where old folks hang out) and Happy High (not a marijuana farm but
the town's school), Happyites seemed, that day at any rate, just a
touch melancholy. &QL;

   HAPPY, TEXAS _ Back in Europe, funny-sounding place-names such
as Ramsbottom emerged slowly out of the feudal mulch. Not so in
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Here, names came as suddenly as the settlements. Admire the wry
humor of the pioneer who called his new home Grit. And pity the
macho cowboy who, thanks to an effete ancestor's whim, has to admit
he hails from Twitty.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, place-names come in all styles. Marfa, a west Texas
town bothered recently by lights said to come from alien
spacecraft, was named after a character in one of Dostoevsky's
novels.
</P>
<P>
   Eden and Utopia also fall into the ethereal category. Fate and
Uncertain are darkly ambiguous, no doubt an attempt by the towns'
founders to dampen the spirits of their more happy-go-lucky
descendants.
</P>
<P>
   Flat, Flatonia and Levelland come straight to the point, as do
Cactus and Notrees, a town so bald and remote that it resorts to
decorating itself with tumbleweeds instead of trees at Christmas
time.
</P>
<P>
   Most towns in southern and western Texas have Spanish names,
such as San Antonio and El Paso. But central Texas is dominated by
Germans.
</P>
<P>
   There are New Baden, New Braunfels (named after its founder,
Prince Carl von Solms-Braunfels), New Salem and New Ulm, not to
mention Schertz, Schuler, Schroeder, Schulenberg and Schwertner.
</P>
<P>
   Scotland, naturally, did not take this lying down. It has
provided, to name a few, Dundee, Edinburg (Texans have dropped the
confusing ``h''), McAllen, McGregor, McKinney, McLeod and,
sandwiched between McLean and McClellan Lake, the town of Alanreed.
</P>
<P>
   Even Dallas shares its name with a village in the Scottish
Highlands.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Texas's heroes are well remembered. Turn to the map for
Crockett, Travis, Austin and, of course, Houston (from Sam,
governor and commander of the Texan army in the Mexican war).
</P>
<P>
   Alamo, Lonestar and Jacinto City (after the battle which won
Texan independence from Mexico) have the same ring of patriotism.
Only a few places _ such as Washington, Taft and Roosevelt _
grudgingly admit to a larger American patriotism.
</P>
<P>
   East of Dallas lies the town of Quitman, named after John
Anthony Quitman, governor of Mexico after the Mexican-American war,
and the only American ever to preside over Montezuma's palace.
</P>
<P>
   Some names are pretty un-Texan. Humble, a suburb of Houston,
would sit better in quietly spoken South Dakota than in the brazen
Lone Star state. Impact, Cut-and-Shoot, Dimmit and Gun Barrel City
are more like it.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Moody and Petty aside, Texan place-names tend to have an
upbeat flavor, as befits a state whose name is derived from an
Indian word meaning ``friendly.''
</P>
<P>
   There are Energy, Smiley, Jolly and Joy. Best of all is Happy, a
threadbare town of 588 souls set in the breezy, big-sky cattle
country south of Amarillo.
</P>
<P>
   The name certainly cheered up your correspondent on a recent
visit, but it is not easy to live up to. Despite the Happy Center
(where old folks hang out) and Happy High (not a marijuana farm but
the town's school), Happyites seemed, that day at any rate, just a
touch melancholy. &QL;

   COLUMBIA, S.C. _ In a rough inner-city neighborhood plagued with
prostitution, drug-dealing and other messy things, a grey two-story
house with new red-brick stairs stands out like a beacon.
</P>
<P>
   This ``rehabbed'' building on Lady Street, always graceful in
its lines and now tastefully renovated, makes a sharp contrast with
the crumbling motel across the street.
</P>
<P>
   It is also notable for its inhabitants: two policemen who use
identical one-bedroom apartments in mainland America's first
live-in ``koban,'' the Japanese for mini-station.
</P>
<P>
   Opened earlier this summer, and modelled on Japan's little local
police stations, Columbia's koban is an attempt to prevent crime by
tackling some of the things that cause it: broken families,
children who stop going to school, the failure of communities to
help people at the end of their tether.
</P>
<P>
   By coming to the consumer, as it were, these two Columbia
policemen _ recent college graduates who volunteered for their
rent-free rooms _ have ``a vested stake in the community,'' says
Columbia's police chief, Charles Austin.
</P>
<P>
   It was Austin, a veteran of 26 years of policing, who decided
that South Carolina needed kobans. He had seen them when he was in
Tokyo studying Japan's community-policing system in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Rico, an island that is part of the United States, is
also trying them out.
</P>
<P>
   The koban is not the first creative idea to come from Austin,
who is studying to become a clergyman. In 1991, he arranged for
police officers to be offered a loan at a modest 4 percent interest
rate, and with no down-payment, when they move into a home within
the city. They also get a bonus of $500 a year.
</P>
<P>
   More than a dozen policemen have accepted the offer, and
officials say this move towards the front-line has helped to cut
crime.
</P>
<P>
   On Lady Street, local people are encouraged to visit the
carpeted first floor of the koban to report crimes. The building is
used for neighborhood meetings.
</P>
<P>
   It is intended to be a safe haven for youngsters and the
elderly. It is also a workstation for social and educational
services, with programs designed to teach literacy to both children
and adults.
</P>
<P>
   The koban's officers, Taurus Sanders and Melron Kelly, walk
their beat and visit the neighbors, offering tips on crime
prevention and trying to calm troubled young people before they do
anything foolish.
</P>
<P>
   The experiment is based on the ideas of the Milton S. Eisenhower
Foundation, of Washington, D.C. During the past few years,
non-residential kobans have been opened in a dozen cities,
including Washington, Boston, Baltimore, Los Angeles, Memphis,
Minneapolis and Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Their aim is to reduce crime and violence, and the use of drugs;
to improve school and job attendance; and to make it clear to the
locals that they have policemen among them.
</P>
<P>
   In Columbia, it is also hoped that Lady Street's live-in koban
will help the area's economy: the less crime there is, the more
businesses may move in.
</P>
<P>
   If it works, Austin thinks Columbia will soon have another one. &QL;

<P>
   HARGEISA _ This is a country of about 3 million people, five
telephone companies, seven airlines and, according to the
government's improbable statistics, 10,442,443 goats.
</P>
<P>
   These facts about Somaliland are not unrelated. Over half its
population are nomads, walking every year with their herds of
goats, sheep (5,571,565) and camels (5,454,590), from the grazing
lands of northeast Ethiopia to the ports from which their livestock
are exported to Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   This nomadic life, carried on through many generations, has
formed them into family clans that stick together with fierce
loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   It has also made them natural travellers, so that, when Somalia
fell apart as a state in 1991, they scattered all over the world
but kept in close touch with relations still at home. Hence the
telephone companies and airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Remittances from the exiles (not in the statistics, but
estimated at up to $500 million a year) and revenue from livestock
are the country's only sources of revenue.
</P>
<P>
   But is it a country? Somaliland has a flag, a president, a
parliament, a currency, a central bank, a university, an army and a
planning department that produces these oddly precise statistics.
But nobody recognizes it.
</P>
<P>
   A former British colony that willingly merged with the former
Italian Somalia at independence in 1960, Somaliland was badly
neglected under the dictatorship of Siad Barre.
</P>
<P>
   A rebellion in 1988 resulted in a three-year battle for the
capital, Hargeisa, in which the town was destroyed and the
population fled to Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
   The rebellion spread and Barre was overthrown, but the rest of
Somalia descended into fearsome clan warfare.
</P>
<P>
   With at least the semblance of a government, Somaliland declared
independence in May 1991. Two years later it had its own clan war.
</P>
<P>
   But the clan system that had divided the country so bitterly
also provided the mechanism for putting it together again. At a
series of conferences, some of them lasting for months, groups of
elders worked out peace treaties.
</P>
<P>
   In the old days, the clans would have sought women and camels as
compensation for killing and as tokens of peace. Now they agreed to
share power.
</P>
<P>
   War, many of them had come to realize, was impoverishing
everyone. Some of the more intransigent clans were simply bought
off.
</P>
<P>
   Poets, highly influential in Somali society and traditionally
glorifiers of war, began to sing of the stupidity of so much
fighting and killing.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1995, Somaliland has enjoyed remarkable stability and
security. In one street in Hargeisa, women sit in a row trading in
gold. There is not a gun in sight. Almost half of the capital's
buildings now have roofs, and some parts of the city have
electricity. With the help of aid agencies, the water supply has
been restored.
</P>
<P>
   The country has an administration that is certainly no worse
than that of many African countries.
</P>
<P>
   So is it time for the world to accept Somaliland as an
independent state?
</P>
<P>
   Lack of recognition has meant that the country, if such it is,
is being rebuilt without much help from western donors. It cannot
issue passports, so its ministers and businessmen cannot travel
easily.
</P>
<P>
   A 16-month ban on the import of its livestock by Saudi Arabia,
its chief market, resulted in a collapse in government revenues
from $45 million to $27 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   The ban, now lifted, was ostensibly imposed because Somaliland's
veterinary certificates, giving the animals a clean bill of health,
were not internationally recognized.
</P>
<P>
   The main reason why the world will not accept Somaliland's
independence is that the rest of Somalia does not want it, and its
other neighbors are wary.
</P>
<P>
   President Mohammed Haji Ibrahim Egal is now suggesting some sort
of halfway house that would give Somaliland international status
but leave the door open to reunification with Somalia at some
point.
</P>
<P>
   That should at least give Somaliland access to money to rebuild
its infrastructure. But recognition would not solve its deeper
problems.
</P>
<P>
   The elders may have been able to bring the clan wars to an end,
but they cannot run a state. They chose the president and members
of parliament, but Egal was, at least until recently, able to
manipulate the lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Parliament has now begun to exert more independence and to curb
the president's autocratic tendencies. A parliamentary commission
has drafted a constitution that proposes a mix of multi-party
democracy and traditional representation. Egal, who depends upon
the traditionalists, does not like it.
</P>
<P>
   The second problem is that livestock farming, the backbone of
the economy, is in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The nomads, who look after the animals, are the poorest people
in the country and there is no government assistance for them or
their flocks. Their lands are overgrazed, and trees, essential for
regular rainfall, are being cut down.
</P>
<P>
   Free enterprise, the government's philosophy, is encouraging
people to enclose huge areas of common grazing land. Somaliland's
tough nomads, survivors of drought, pestilence and wars, have never
faced more difficult times. &QL;

 TECH FIRMS' PLEA FOR WORK VISAS DRAWS CRITICISM  &HT;     By CAROLYN LOCHHEAD 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A key immigration critic in the House charged
Thursday that the INS cannot keep track of how many foreign work
visas have been issued and said the program should not be expanded
until the agency sorts out the numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The comments from Rep. Lamar Smith, the Texas Republican who
chairs the House Judiciary Committee's immigration panel, came as
lawmakers from both parties responded to the clamor from high-tech
companies to let them hire more temporary workers from abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, after a prolonged battle, Congress raised the ceiling
for the so-called H-1B visas from 65,000 to 115,000. But the INS
reported on June 15 that the increased supply of visas had already
been exhausted for the fiscal year that ends in September.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., introduced a bill this week to lift
all limits on foreign workers who hold a bachelor's degree or
higher in science, mathematics or engineering from a U.S.
university and have an offer for a job paying at least $60,000 a
year. Lofgren's bill would allow workers to stay in the country for
five years, rather than the three allowed under the H-1B program,
and it would not affect the overall ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever you touch immigration issues you make somebody mad,''
Lofgren said. ``But if we could at least agree on where we agree,
that it is not in America's best interest to force away the top 20
percent of real smart scientists and engineers who can pull down
big salaries ... that would be a useful thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Smith's opposition, the push for visa expansion has
strong GOP backing. Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott has teamed
with Texas Sen. Phil Gramm to expand the number of visas to 200,000
and exempt all foreigners with a master's degree or higher who were
paid at least $60,000 a year. Rep. David Dreier, R-Calif., Thursday
introduced a companion measure in the House.
</P>
<P>
   Smith called Thursday's hearing to try to slam on the brakes. He
suggested that visa fraud at a consulate in India, along with a
huge backlog of applications from previous years may explain why a
new visa shortage has cropped up so soon after the program was
expanded.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said the INS approved a backlog of almost 20,000 H-1B visa
petitions before the new ceiling went into effect last October.
``So an argument can be made that even before fiscal year 1999 even
started, the 115,000 quota approved by Congress for this year had
in effect already been reduced to 95,569.''
</P>
<P>
   Austin Fragomen, chairman of the American Council on
International Personnel, whose members include large multinational
corporations, agreed that INS record keeping was atrocious. But he
also argued that the shortage of high-tech workers is real. He and
Crystal Neiswonger, an immigration specialist at TRW Inc.,
estimated that the demand for workers will exceed the new cap by at
least 40,000 workers this year.
</P>
<P>
   And the American Electronics Association released a study that
found wages _ a market indicator of demand and supply of workers _
in the high-tech industry have risen nearly 20 percent since 1990.
At the same time, unemployment for engineers, computer scientists
and programmers and mathematicians ranged from 1.2 percent to 1.6
percent.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the number of U.S. graduates in science, math
and engineering is falling, AEA found, with the number of
bachelor's degrees in electrical engineering alone falling 33
percent between 1990 and 1996. Foreign nationals, by contrast, are
now receiving from one third to nearly two thirds of doctoral and
masters degrees in those fields. Foreigners received 64 percent of
the U.S. doctoral degrees granted in engineering technology in
1996, according to the study.
</P>
<P>
   The study said visas provide at best a temporary remedy. It
argued that poor U.S. science and math education in grades K-12,
which leaves U.S. students ill-prepared to go on to advanced
degrees, is at the root of the problem. Lofgren said her proposal,
which does not lift overall H-1B visa caps but removes the
restrictions for extremely skilled workers, offers a way to ``chase
the best'' without arguing about whether or not shortages exist.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want the best and the brightest,'' Lofgren said. ``In my
judgment, you can never have too many geniuses.''
</P>
<P>
   The current system, she said, ``is not very good at assessing
shortages, but I think the marketplace does help establish'' what
is actually happening in the real world. ``If you're paying people
a whole bunch of money the day they walk out of college, that says
something about whether they're a hotshot or not _ probably more
than Congress knows about how to evaluate'' skills.
</P>
<P>
   She said her bill limits the number of new visas ``by the very
terms of who's eligible. It would only be people who have graduated
from American universities, with a degree in the hard sciences,
math or engineering, who are offered at least $60,000. That's a
limited pool.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is opposed to expanding the visa
program, saying last year's increase was adequate and companies
should focus on retraining U.S. workers. A spokesman for Smith said
the prospects for a visa increase remain uncertain, but a measure
could pass given the broad and enthusiastic support in Congress for
the high-tech industry.

<TEXT>
<P>
   HARGEISA _ This is a country of about 3 million people, five
telephone companies, seven airlines and, according to the
government's improbable statistics, 10,442,443 goats.
</P>
<P>
   These facts about Somaliland are not unrelated. Over half its
population are nomads, walking every year with their herds of
goats, sheep (5,571,565) and camels (5,454,590), from the grazing
lands of northeast Ethiopia to the ports from which their livestock
are exported to Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   This nomadic life, carried on through many generations, has
formed them into family clans that stick together with fierce
loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   It has also made them natural travellers, so that, when Somalia
fell apart as a state in 1991, they scattered all over the world
but kept in close touch with relations still at home. Hence the
telephone companies and airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Remittances from the exiles (not in the statistics, but
estimated at up to $500 million a year) and revenue from livestock
are the country's only sources of revenue.
</P>
<P>
   But is it a country? Somaliland has a flag, a president, a
parliament, a currency, a central bank, a university, an army and a
planning department that produces these oddly precise statistics.
But nobody recognizes it.
</P>
<P>
   A former British colony that willingly merged with the former
Italian Somalia at independence in 1960, Somaliland was badly
neglected under the dictatorship of Siad Barre.
</P>
<P>
   A rebellion in 1988 resulted in a three-year battle for the
capital, Hargeisa, in which the town was destroyed and the
population fled to Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
   The rebellion spread and Barre was overthrown, but the rest of
Somalia descended into fearsome clan warfare.
</P>
<P>
   With at least the semblance of a government, Somaliland declared
independence in May 1991. Two years later it had its own clan war.
</P>
<P>
   But the clan system that had divided the country so bitterly
also provided the mechanism for putting it together again. At a
series of conferences, some of them lasting for months, groups of
elders worked out peace treaties.
</P>
<P>
   In the old days, the clans would have sought women and camels as
compensation for killing and as tokens of peace. Now they agreed to
share power.
</P>
<P>
   War, many of them had come to realize, was impoverishing
everyone. Some of the more intransigent clans were simply bought

<P>
   Henry Louis Gates is a phenomenon in America, but virtually
unknown in Britain. That may be about to change, thanks to a
six-part television series, ``Into Africa,'' broadcast over the
past month on BBC2 and, from October, on PBS in America.
</P>
<P>
   Part travelogue and part ancient history, it is the story of a
singular African-American confronting his roots from Zanzibar to
Timbuktu.
</P>
<P>
   The W.E.B. Dubois Professor of the Humanities and chairman of
the African-American studies department at Harvard University is
known as ``Skip,'' but under his fuller name Gates has become the
chief interpreter of the black experience for the white
establishment.
</P>
<P>
   He has built up his department into the country's most important
black-studies faculty; has been the co-author of 15 books and has
written five of his own as well as numerous magazine articles; is a
consultant to the Dreamworks film studio, and the creator, with
Microsoft, of the first pan-African CD-ROM encyclopedia, which will
make him a very rich man.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and he is only 48.
</P>
<P>
   A natural ``academostar,'' Gates is a silver-tongued
intellectual imp. Nearly everyone (Louis Farrakhan, head of the
radical Nation of Islam is a rare exception) who meets him loves
him, including the camera.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in his gold wire-rimmed glasses and Harvard T-shirt,
Gates is as much a character in the television films as the
characters he discusses: King Solomon or Don Francisco de Souza,
Ivory Coast's most notorious slave trader.
</P>
<P>
   As such, he is both commentator and comic relief. But his
willingness to play the buffoon has led critics to accuse Gates of
creating an ``easy listening'' version of the black experience.
</P>
<P>
   It might be more accurate to say that his is the Mary Poppins
philosophy of social and cultural instruction: a spoonful of sugar
helps the agenda go down.
</P>
<P>
   In the television series, Gates wants to rebut the deeply-rooted
conviction of whites from Hume to Hegel that black Africans had no
culture, that they couldn't read or write and thus couldn't have
created the astonishing civilization unearthed on their continent.
</P>
<P>
   He is trying to pin down ``the part of black history that was
lost or stolen,'' both metaphorically and, on occasion, literally.
(He has set up a base at Harvard to catalogue and translate 4,500
medieval books that were written by Africans and are housed in the
library at Timbuktu.)
</P>
<P>
   Whether the program draws as big an audience in Britain as it
will in America is not yet clear. Gates is, he says, a ``citizen of
the black Atlantic.''
</P>
<P>
   While he admits you cannot extrapolate from America to Britain _
``in America the primary signifier is race,'' he says; ``in
Britain, it's class'' _ he believes that the personal struggle to
reconcile the past and the present is universal. &QL;

(He has set up a base at Harvard to catalogue and translate 4,500
medieval books that were written by Africans and are housed in the
library at Timbuktu.)
</P>
<P>
   Whether the program draws as big an audience in Britain as it
will in America is not yet clear. Gates is, he says, a ``citizen of
the black Atlantic.''
</P>
<P>
   While he admits you cannot extrapolate from America to Britain _
``in America the primary signifier is race,'' he says; ``in
Britain, it's class'' _ he believes that the personal struggle to
reconcile the past and the present is universal. &QL;

 A DIRTY RING AROUND CITY HALL  &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ It seems like everything is falling down and
wearing out, as I was saying just this morning to my fanny-tuck
surgeon.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for instance, the woman in the bathtub who fell off her
roof and suffered career-ending injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1969, a mannequin woman has been taking a luxurious bath
in an antique claw-foot tub on the roof of Caldwell's Factory
Outlet on Bayshore Blvd.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how dismal the weather, the world political situation,
the national economy or the performance of Muni, that woman bathed
away. Her tranquility was unshakable. She was a spiritual
touchstone and a symbol of life's fine small moments.
</P>
<P>
   But the wood supporting the tub rotted away, and two weeks ago,
crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``One day, we just found her on the ground,'' says Oscar
Salinas, a Caldwell's employee. ``The tub wasn't damaged at all,
but the woman, she got  &UR; all &LR;   &LR; broken up. Everyone's been calling,
`What happened to good old Betty?'''
</P>
<P>
   Several people have inquired about buying the tub. It would be
worth about $250, but this is San Fransentimental, so offers have
topped $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Caldwell says he won't sell it,'' says Salinas.
</P>
<P>
   Bless Mr. Caldwell's heart. I don't want to turn this into a
popularity contest, but if I had to save either Caldwell's bather
or the Doggie Diner's doggie, I'd vote bath woman.
</P>
<P>
   The tub probably will go back up on the roof soon, with a new
bather.
</P>
<P>
   Then maybe Mr. Caldwell, who seems to have a feel for tradition
and timely repair, can fix up the rest of the city.
</P>
<P>
   Like ... oh ... City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   The building itself is fine, but the infrastructure seems to
need attention.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI is shutting down and rummaging through the files of at
least two city agencies. The feds have been swarming for weeks, and
the mayor says, ``I don't know who they are investigating. I have
no concern and no comment.''
</P>
<P>
   I'm no expert on mayoral duties and on where the buck stops, but
in this case, shouldn't Willie Brown have both concern  &UR; and &LR; 
comment?
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it's only the Housing Authority and the Human Rights
Commission. Wake Willie when the G-men start snooping around
something important.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI seems to suspect that there has been a significant
victimization of poor people and minorities by people in city
agencies. Why should that be a mayor's concern?
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Walker is at least part of the focus of the FBI probe.
Walker throws a huge party for Willie every year, a fund-raiser for
Walker's ``nonprofit'' agency.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Brown says Walker is not a Brown associate. Yet there is
the annual party, and Walker was a key figure in the campaign for
passage of the 49ers' stadium/mall, a campaign upon which Mayor
Brown lavished more time, energy and passion than on any other
single project during his term in office.
</P>
<P>
   In the current FBI investigation, Walker has not been charged.
But his nonprofit agency, which has had some big-money dealings
with City Hall, has never been registered as a nonprofit agency.
</P>
<P>
   That is a detail that someone in the mayor's administration
should have noticed, especially since Walker served three years in
prison for abusing minority contracting programs in this very San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   You would think the mayor would at least like to explain how
Charlie Walker got past the B.S. detector without setting off
buzzers, bells and foghorns.
</P>
<P>
   However, with a mayoral race under way, it's important that we
all realize, as Brown's re-election campaign press secretary said,
``This is not a campaign issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though this is a town where the major issue of the last
mayoral campaign was a candidate's shower with two radio DJs.
</P>
<P>
   I'm eagerly awaiting the official list of suitable, Brown-OK'd
campaign issues. I hope there are some spicy items on the list.
Otherwise, it could be a dreary race.
</P>
<P>
   Party pooper Angela Alioto dropped out of the mayor derby
because she's busy with her law practice. She probably wouldn't
have showered with DJs, but she would have been a spirited sparring
partner for Willie.
</P>
<P>
   Clint Reilly can't seem to pick up steam in the polls, despite
the fact he offers specific, written solutions to major problems
and has enough of his own money that he doesn't have to sell his
soul to campaign backers.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, Reilly, coming off a long career as a political
consultant, is considered by some to be too political.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Jordan needs to show a little more flair and visibility.
He could volunteer to replace the woman in the tub on Caldwell's
roof.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, barring any messy discoveries by the FBI, it's
looking like another four years of Mayor Brown.
</P>
<P>
   I'd like to ask Willie about the campaign, but first I'll have
to see if the campaign is a campaign issue.
</P>

GM, WARNER BROS. TEAMING UP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ Can the Batmobile be far behind?
</P>
<P>
   Warner Bros. and General Motors Corp., a pair of venerable
American business icons, staged a corporate love-in Thursday to
launch a four-year marketing alliance. The first product of their
union: a minivan bearing Bugs Bunny and WB logos.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this says is that GM and Warner Bros. have an assured
date for the prom,'' said Michael Schau, editor of the
Entertainment Marketing Newsletter. ``You want that ready-made
friendship because it's really about GM being able to use
whatever's going on at Warner.''
</P>
<P>
   The van, with a $29,575 price tag, is by far the most expensive
studio tie-in product ever let loose on the mass market, Schau
noted.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference on the Warner lot attended by Time Warner
chief Gerald Levin and new studio chief Barry Meyer, GM announced
it will build 20,000 Chevy Venture Warner Bros. vans _ 20percent of
the van's production run _ during the next year as a first element
of the partnership, which gives it ``first look'' at promotions for
all studio operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This takes creative marketing to another level,'' said Dan
Romanelli, the studio's consumer products chief. ``The
possibilities are limitless.''
</P>
<P>
   GM, which has previously worked with Warner on product placement
in movies, would not give specifics on the 15 other partnerships it
has formed with the studio. But Phil Guarascio, vice president for
advertising and corporate marketing, hinted the automaker is
working on more Warner-themed vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not borrowing assets,'' Guarascio said. ``We're trying
to integrate customers where we have the same customer, so it feels
natural, not forced. We're putting money on the table because we
want Warner to know we're serious.''
</P>
<P>
   Executives would not comment on how much money GM has committed,
although reports have emerged of a $30million ``floor'' for royalty
payments.
</P>
<P>
   The minivan, produced at GM's Doraville, Ga., plant, will hit
showrooms next month. The vehicle is aimed at mid-upscale parents

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Prospects for the NFL returning to the Coliseum
took a pair of damaging blows Thursday when Gov. Gray Davis
withdrew the state as a dealmaker, and the NFL responded by saying
it would now focus on other stadium sites in the Los Angeles area.
</P>
<P>
   The shift in position by the NFL over the Coliseum impasse could
either open the expansion door back to the city of Carson or to
Hollywood Park, or signal the league is now prepared to give its
32nd franchise to Houston.
</P>
<P>
   One source close to the negotiations quoted an NFL source as
saying, ``This is their way out. They are ready to go to Houston.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest flurry of developments in the saga over who would get
the league's 32nd franchise opened up several possible scenarios.
</P>
<P>
   Entertainment giant Michael Ovitz originally proposed a new $370
million NFL stadium and shopping mall in Carson, before the league
selected the Coliseum as its area site and he designed plans for
Exposition Park with competing billionaire Eli Broad. He now could
revive his Carson plan, although local officials said the politics
of the deal had shifted.
</P>
<P>
   Oil billionaire Marvin Davis has an option on the Hollywood Park
property Raiders owner Al Davis planned to relocate his team to
five years ago before moving his franchise back to Oakland. Davis
now could step in with an offer, much as race track officials
anticipated when the Coliseum deal began the prime focus last year.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL has given Los Angeles a Sept. 15 deadline to complete an
acceptable expansion package, or the league said the next franchise
will be awarded to Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The Coliseum deal started falling apart last week in Chicago
when the agreement Gov. Gray Davis' designated representative, Bill
Chadwick, thought he had brokered with the NFL was rejected by
owners. Instead of signing the nonbinding agreement, league
commissioner Paul Tagliabue demanded more public funding for the
project.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles officials were united in rejecting the demand for
public funding, and Davis refused additional support Thursday,
asking the league to work out the deal with the potential owners.
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue said the league would now focus on other possible
sites in the area.
</P>
<P>
   A source close to the negotiations said Chadwick failed to
consult either prospective ownership group, Eli Broad-Ed Roski Jr.
or Ovitz-Ron Burkle, over his plans to partially repay the
$150million in bonds for new parking garages through a
$5million-per-year lease.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chadwick's plan effectively pulled the leg out from under the
deal, taking $40million away from the team's owners,'' the source
said, noting previous discussions had focused on $1million-a-year
Coliseum rent.
</P>
<P>
   Roski, who has been championing the Coliseum for the past three
years, said despite the NFL's new stance, he did not believe the
Coliseum deal was dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not over yet,'' Roski said. ``We just need to continue
our dialogue with them. We're definitely not going to cease our
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if they decide to go to Houston we would continue on,
because I really think it's important to the city and the fans of
Los Angeles to have an NFL team. We will continue to pursue it, and
continue to pursue it at the Coliseum.''
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Davis, Tagliabue said the league chose the
Coliseum as the site advocated by Los Angeles leaders, but more
public funding was needed. &QL; 
``We have concluded that our effort to reach agreements for the
operation of an NFL team in Los Angeles can no longer be limited to
the Coliseum and Exposition Park and will in the weeks remaining
before September 15 focus on other potential stadium sites in the
Los Angeles area.''
</P>
<P>
   Several leaders scoffed at the suggestion that another site
could suddenly satisfy the NFL's demands within the next 40 days.
</P>
<P>
   Coliseum Commission President Sheldon Sloan said he believes it
will be almost impossible for any other group to come up with
detailed plans and still meet the deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the site is in the city of Los Angeles, it will not get any
local political support, and if they expect anything from the
state, they can forget it,'' Sloan said.
</P>
<P>
   Councilman Mike Hernandez, who represents the area around Dodger
Stadium, had threatened action to block plans by then-owner Peter
O'Malley to build a football stadium in Chavez Ravine.
</P>
<P>
   Sloan said the cost elsewhere of a new stadium and
infrastructure will be far more than rebuilding the Coliseum, where
all existing facilities are in place.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfortunate the NFL is rejecting the proposal developed
by Bill Chadwick and that it was not considered substantial enough
for them,'' he said. ``I think they're also overlooking the fact
that building at the Coliseum requires only the approval of the
state architect. Anywhere else they go will require numerous
permits and potentially delay things for years.''
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz was far along in his plans for Carson but abandoned the
city when the NFL tabbed the Coliseum without naming Broad-Ovitz as
the ownership group or approving their stadium and site plans. The
league gave approval to the site plans essentially designed for the
Coliseum by Ovitz at its meetings last week.
</P>
<P>
   Carson Mayor Peter Fajardo said he was eager to get his city
back in the NFL expansion picture, but warned many at City Hall
were left with ill feelings over Ovitz's departure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we are interested and would like to have a new team
and stadium,'' Fajardo said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they do come back, it will be a whole different ballgame
after these people walked out and left us cold.''
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND TAKE FOLLOWS) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Carson originally committed $180million to the stadium and mall
plans. Fajardo said although the city could still generate the
funds, there might not be as much open-ended support for the
financing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There would be tremendous economic benefits, jobs and so on,''
he said. ``But the political complexion may have changed here.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Ovitz comes back to us, he will be very surprised by our
attitude and what we will want from him.''
</P>
<P>
   The NFL's new position leaves Ovitz in an awkward position. If
he quickly returns to Carson, he would likely be viewed as
flip-flopping. His representative, Mark Fabiani, said Ovitz had yet
to read Tagliabue's letter to Davis and would not comment until he
had.
</P>
<P>
   A quick deal might be more easily put together at Hollywood
Park. R.D. Hubbard's company is in escrow with Churchill Downs over
the race track, but will still own the casino and land _ including
the 100-acre site across from the Forum where the football stadium
had been proposed. Hubbard could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Any stadium effort other than the Coliseum, however, could be at
risk of running up against political opposition from Los Angeles.
When Al Davis wanted to build a new stadium in Irwindale,
opposition and legal action tied up and eventually killed the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Like Roski, Broad said in a statement he would continue to
support the Coliseum as the NFL site and had sent a letter to
Tagliabue on Tuesday outlining a new financing scheme for
Exposition Park, ``Which can be accomplished at no net cost to
taxpayers.''
</P>
<P>
   In the letter he made another bid to be selected the franchise
owner, offering $2 million for a nonrefundable 60-day option to
complete a deal that included a $150 million public investment to
be repaid from sales, property and income tax; public
responsibility for costs outside the Coliseum, including demolition
and site work, and maintaining the stadium; rent of $1 million per
year for 55 years; the franchise receiving all revenues from
parking, stadium rentals and concessions; and guaranteed sellouts.
</P>
<P>
   Broad's plan calls for a franchise fee of $550 million, a
stadium renovation of $400 million, and includes a $150 million
loan from the NFL. Broad offered to put up $275 million in cash
without expectation of a return on his investment for several
years.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan praised the
plan and threw his full weight behind the Broad plan, saying it was
the only one that could bring the city's business community fully
behind the team and ensure the sale of costly luxury boxes needed
to make the finances work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe Eli Broad's proposal is sound and responsible,''
Riordan said.

 &HT;    CONGRESS EASES INTO COMPLIANCE WITH FEDERAL REGULATIONS
 &HT;    For release Sunday, Aug. 8.
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a hugely popular move, Republicans in 1995
required Congress to abide by the laws it enacts for the rest of
the country. It was the first plank of the GOP ``Contract With
America.''
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, the lawmakers have begun to live under many of
the provisions of 11 health, safety, labor and anti-discrimination
laws. But Capitol Hill has not quite put itself quite into a
straitjacket of regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were significant exceptions that Congress gave itself,''
said Ricky Silberman, executive director of the little-known
congressional Office of Compliance, set up to administer the laws.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, her small office, not a huge federal bureaucracy,
is the overseer. And there are other differences:
</P>
<P>
   _ Trade groups can now unionize and bargain for pay and
conditions. But unlike private-sector workers, they are forbidden
to strike. Staff workers for Congress members and committees are
forbidden to unionize.
</P>
<P>
   _ Congressional employees can now seek compensation for job
discrimination or sexual harassment under a mediation system that
is often completed within a mere 60 days, much faster than under
civil rights actions in the private world.
</P>
<P>
   _ Most worker complaint cases are kept strictly confidential,
protecting lawmakers from embarrassing publicity that might hurt
re-election campaigns. In 27 cases since 1996, congressional
employees have been awarded a total of $204,959, the compliance
office reported this week. No details of the cases are given out
unless the plaintiff decides to take the case to court.
</P>
<P>
   When an award is paid to an employee, it does not come from the
pocket of the supervisor or member involved or even from a member's
office, but from a separate taxpayer fund.
</P>
<P>
   _ Fire and safety hazards have abounded at the Capitol's power
plant, paint shop and other work areas controlled by the architect
of the Capitol, whose employees have the highest rate of accidents
and injury of any federal agency. Yet an Office of Compliance
citation issued last month was only a symbolic action in response
to infractions discovered after a fire in a Library of Congress
building.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the private sector, the secretary of labor sets the fine,''
said Gary Green, general counsel for the compliance office. ``It
would have been a big bill, in the high five figures.''
</P>
<P>
   Green said that he is conducting a complete review of Capitol
Hill buildings. He said he was ``satisfied'' that the hazards
listed in the citation have been removed.
</P>
<P>
   Green said Congress has ``done a pretty good job'' with
installing wheelchair ramps and other changes required in the
Americans With Disability Act.
</P>
<P>
   But don't look for many no-smoking signs in the areas where
lawmakers work. Unlike many other workers today who must leave the
building for a cigarette, members of Congress can light up in their
work areas.
</P>

 &HT;    TALL TALES &AMP; SHORT STORIES: Cool and breezy is forecast for
Prague
 &HT;    (Eds: Fifth in a series. Cox Newspapers senior writer Joe Murray
reported from Eastern Europe during a visit 10 years ago, just
before the fall of the Berlin Wall. This summer he returned to
write about the changes that have led three former Eastern Bloc
countries _ Hungary, the Czech Republic and Poland _ to become the
newest members of NATO. At the end of the series, CoxNet will
compile these columns into our weekly Focus page, good for running

 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRAGUE _ Prague is a city intoxicated on freedom, and that's not
all.
</P>
<P>
   It's not unusual to meet someone along the street smoking a
joint.
</P>
<P>
   One of the finest restaurants in Prague is just a block from an
open drug market.
</P>
<P>
   You may be sitting in a restaurant and, instead of a waiter,
it's a drug dealer who comes to your table to ask what he can bring
you.
</P>
<P>
   It takes some getting used to.
</P>
<P>
   But then, so does the weather girl on TV, who appears totally
nude and then begins to dress herself accordingly for the next
day's weather. On occasion, it's an equally naked weather boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This country has so much history, and now so much freedom,'' a
Prague friend explained. ``The people are almost like spoiled
children. Everything's allowed.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's a selection of snapshot impressions made during a
three-day visit:
</P>
<P>
   _ You see police everywhere, but they're there primarily to make
sure things don't get out of hand. Otherwise, they leave you alone.
As for possession of narcotics, police are allowed a wide degree of
discretion in enforcing the law.
</P>
<P>
   _ Prostitution is prevalent.
</P>
<P>
   _ Walk into a store and the employees are sitting around and
talking among themselves. You may have to interrupt them in order
to be waited on, and then you're likely to be treated as if you're
an intruder. Such is the legacy of communism.
</P>
<P>
   _ Eating out is cheap, if you go outside the tourist center of
the city. Two can dine for as little as $20, including drinks.
</P>
<P>
   _ Prague has ``non-stop bars,'' open 24 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   _ You don't dare criticize Czech beer. As the ancestral home of
Budweiser, beer is one of the few things sacred in this ancient
city _ that and the ice hockey team.
</P>
<P>
   _ Most Americans didn't take much notice, but the Czech Republic
won the European championship in ice hockey this past year, and the
ensuing celebration in Prague was like unto New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   _ There's no sense of the American health craze here. You'll see
children as young as 12 smoking in public. Men drink lots of beer
and it shows. Women, however, are expected to keep their figure and
dress provocatively _ and drink only dark beer, which, it is
believed, increases their bust size.
</P>
<P>
   _ Mini-skirts and low-cut blouses are much in fashion. Sexist
remarks are considered compliments, especially from a boss. Women,
even if they have jobs outside the home, are expected to do all the
household chores and have a hot meal on the table for their
husbands at dinnertime.
</P>
<P>
   _ Visitors are warned to watch out for pickpockets. Worst places
in the city are the two train stations.
</P>
<P>
   _ Czechs hate everything Russian. An upscale Russian restaurant
finally gave up trying to maintain its storefront, such was the
graffiti. Under communism, Russian was a required language course.
Now, Czechs refuse to speak it, and won't even acknowledge they can
speak it.
</P>
<P>
   _ Czechs love everything American, especially our music and
fashion, but they consider us arrogant and, worse, ignorant of
Czech culture. Don't ever say, ``In America, that's not the way
things are done.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Example of Czech culture that Americans are ignorant of: At
Christmas, fish peddlers sell live carp on the street. The large
fish is brought home and kept in the bathtub for several days. On
Christmas Eve, as the women prepare the holiday feast, the
tradition is for the man of the house to whack off its head with a
butcher knife. It's a Czech thing _ you wouldn't understand.

BUYING PC ONLINE BRINGS IT FULL CIRCLE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's fitting that one of the most popular items people use their
computers to buy over the Internet is ... other computers. There's
something wonderfully circular about updating your wheezing
compu-clunker with a few clicks of its mouse, and having a shiny
new replacement show up on your doorstep a few days later.
</P>
<P>
   Web sales of PCs are accounting for more and more machine sales.
And why not? Besides the convenience, there's the ability to
customize a machine to fit your needs.
</P>
<P>
   Here are examples of three PCs you can buy online. One's a
low-budget system, the other high-end, and the last is just plain
cool.
</P>
<P>
   _ Dimension L500c, $1,361, Dell Computer Corp.: This is at the
high end of the low-price category for PCs, but it's worth it. This
machine has only one flaw _ its graphics system _ and it's a
significant one. But overall, it's one of the best low-cost
desktops I've seen this year.
</P>
<P>
   The L500c comes with Intel's new 500-megahertz Celeron chip, 64
megabytes of fast memory, a 6.4-gigabyte hard drive, a 40X CD-ROM
drive, a 56K fax modem, Harman Kardon speakers and a 17-inch
monitor. I added an Intel 10/100 Ethernet card to this base
configuration.
</P>
<P>
   As you'd expect, there are no performance complaints with this
system _ it took everything I threw at it. Although it's not quite
as fast as a 500-MHz Pentium III system, it's more than
respectable.
</P>
<P>
   The system is well designed. The case opens simply by pushing
back on a tab, and the side falls away. There are no old-style ISA
slots, just three open PCI slots.
</P>
<P>
   The computer comes with its Intel-based AGP graphics adapter
built into the motherboard, and there's no separate AGP slot if you
want to upgrade to a faster video card. The adapter also uses the
system's RAM for its own memory, but in a unique way. Rather than
having a fixed amount _ say, 2 MB _ it will take what it needs. One
minute you may have 63 MB of system memory available for programs,
and the next minute only 60 MB.
</P>
<P>
   The graphics also are limited to 24-bit color displays. It won't
do 32-bit displays, which means you shouldn't plan on using this
machine if you do high-end graphics work, or if you want 32-bit
color for state-of-the-art games that support it.
</P>
<P>
   _ Aspire 6160, $1,719, Acer America: Acer has made an aggressive
push to sell its home PCs online. There are a variety of models at
different prices, but unfortunately, you can't customize them. Take
'em or leave 'em _ though Acer says the ability to configure your
own is on its way.
</P>
<P>
   The model I tried was the 6150, which has since been replaced by
the 6160. My system had a 500-MHz Pentium III chip, 128 MB of
memory, an eight-GB hard drive, a 4X DVD-ROM drive, a 56K modem and
a 4-MB ATI Rage Pro graphics adapter.
</P>
<P>
   The 6160 improves on this with a 550-MHz Pentium III chip and a
13-GB hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   (The price listed above does not include a monitor. I used a
Dell 1500FP flat panel display, at $949, which has a 15-inch
active-matrix screen. It has an excellent look _ sharp and bright _
and several people here in the office mistook it for a traditional
CRT monitor until they realized how thin it was.)
</P>
<P>
   The Aspire line is aimed at home users, and is one of the few
systems that still has a simplified shell that sits on top of
Windows, allowing fast access to the programs on the computer. The
ACE Desktop is indeed handy, and those who are confused by the
Windows Start button and Explorer may benefit from this.
</P>
<P>
   This computer also makes extensive use of the Universal Serial
Bus. Both the mouse and the keyboard connect via USB ports, and
there are two more open USB ports for other devices.
</P>
<P>
   It's a very fast machine, though the ATI graphics card is a bit
underpowered. Since it sits in an AGP slot, rather than being
soldered to the motherboard, it's easy to upgrade to something more
muscular.
</P>
<P>
   _ Profile, $2,299, Gateway: This is one of several new designs
that are both eye-catching and space-saving, and rely largely on
notebook-PC technology. Indeed, the Profile looks like a notebook
computer perched on a display stand _ and performs like it, too.
</P>
<P>
   It comes with a 400-MHz Advanced Micro Devices K6-2 chip, 64 MB
of memory, a 6.4-GB hard drive, a 2X DVD-ROM drive, a four-MB ATI
Rage LT Pro graphics adapter, a 56K modem, a built-in 10/100
Ethernet adapter and a 15-inch active-matrix flat-panel screen.
Simple speakers are built into the PC's base.
</P>
<P>
   This is an incredibly easy PC to set up. Pull it out of the box,
set it on your desk, plug in the mouse and keyboard and you're good
to go. A snap-off panel in the back masks ports for the modem and
Ethernet connections.
</P>
<P>
   The Profile has a nice, bright display that benefits from the
fact that it doesn't run on batteries. The screen also has a decent
field of view _ you can still see the display even if you are
standing off to the side.
</P>
<P>
   But considering that similarly configured desktop systems sell
for less than half the cost of this, you're paying a premium for
space savings and the coolness factor. You're certainly not paying
for friskiness, because this is no speed demon.
</P>
<P>
   Most notebook computers are not as fast as desktops, even if
their specifications are comparable. There are numerous bottlenecks
in a notebook, ranging from the system bus to the hard drive, that
can cause this. It's the price you pay for portability.
</P>
<P>
   And you also pay the price here, for the sake of a neat design.

RECOMMENDED SPECS FOR PORTABLE PCS: SOME USERS' REQUIREMENTS MAY
VARY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I very much appreciate your semiannual minimum PC specs
column. I've used it in making hardware purchases and to keep up
with hardware advances. Your column is so helpful that I'm
wondering if you would write a similar column regarding minimum
laptop specs. I am a writer who spends many hours at the keyboard
and would like to practice my craft outside of the office
environment. What minimum specs should I look for in a laptop?
</P>
<P>
   A: The way people use portable computers varies as much as the
way folks use desktops _ maybe more. That makes offering a single
set of recommended specifications for Windows-based portables more
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   For example, people who need a portable primarily to check
e-mail and communicate with the office don't need the same kind of
system as those who do sales presentations. And usually those who
already have a desktop system don't need the same kind of machine
as those whose portable is the only machine they use.
</P>
<P>
   _ Processor: If you need a fairly powerful system for
presentations or high-end applications (or even if you just like to
play games in your hotel room at night!), shoot for a 366-megahertz
or faster AMD K-6, Intel Pentium II or Celeron processor. Note that
the Pentium II chips have a significantly greater drain on battery
life than do the older Pentium MMX chips, or some of the K-6 chips.
</P>
<P>
   If you're primarily interested in a computer for communications,
such as e-mail or connecting to a network, you can drop down to the
older Pentium MMX chips that run at 266 and 300 megahertz. These
provide excellent battery life, so they are also a good choice if
you spend a lot of time on airplanes and don't want to keep
swapping batteries.
</P>
<P>
   _ Display: In general, I almost always recommend active-matrix,
or TFT (Thin Film Transistor), color displays. They are much better
than passive-matrix displays, which wash out easily in bright light
and are very slow _ you'll frequently see ``smears'' as things move
on the screen. Although passive-matrix screens are less expensive,
it's worth paying the extra money for an active-matrix display.
</P>
<P>
   The display should also be at least 11 inches, measured
diagonally, with at least two megabytes of video memory.
</P>
<P>
   _ Memory: Notebook memory is usually more expensive than desktop
memory, so upgrading is sometimes a painful proposition. It's
important, then, to get as much memory as you can afford in the
portable you buy _ it'll be cheaper this way than if you add it
later. I would recommend a minimum of 48 megabytes of random access
memory in a portable _ 64 or more if you can afford it.
</P>
<P>
   _ Hard drive: Most people don't store as much on a notebook
computer as they do on a desktop, but even so, today's productivity
application suites take up serious space. To accommodate bloatware,
get at least a four-gigabyte hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   _ CD or DVD: I actually think a DVD drive makes more sense on a
portable machine than it does on some desktops. This allows you to
watch DVD movies, either on a plane or in a hotel room, which is an
excellent diversion. If you're a frequent traveler, I'd recommend
the DVD drive. If not, a CD-ROM drive is fine.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ports, etc.: The more ports present on the portable, the
better. On some of the ultraportable, thin-and-light machines,
manufacturers have scrimped by putting ports on an external part
called a replicator. This is just one more part to tote _ or lose.
</P>
<P>
   Make sure the portable has at least one, if not two, PC-card
slots. That's particularly important if it does not have a built-in
modem. If you have only one PC-card slot on an ultraportable, and
it's taken up with a PC-card modem, you're hosed if you want to add
a second PC-card-based device.

BANK LENDS A HAND WITH CHILD CARE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By L.M.SIXEL 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ It typically happens when the baby sitter calls in
sick or the kids wake up sick.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, there's a big scramble to find someone or someplace to
take care of the kids and still get to work on time.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, that'll be one problem Chase Bank of Texas employees won't
have to worry about.
</P>
<P>
   The bank plans to open a backup, on-site child care center to
serve its 3,500 employees in downtown Houston and another backup
center in west Houston for the 2,000 employees who work in nearby
call centers.
</P>
<P>
   The bank is also building a child care center in Arlington,
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Employees can use the centers free 20 days a year for each
child. Chase is also giving its parents of newborns eight weeks of
free care to help them adjust to the expense and hassles of child
care.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to keep the employees we have and keep them happy,''
said Dee Dee Guzman, vice president of human resources product
development. ``Time and time again, employees say they feel more
committed and more loyal'' when the bank helps with something that
can be so stressful, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Chase is spending more than $4 million to build the three
centers in Texas and expects to spend each year between $600,000
and $700,000 to operate the downtown site and $400,000 to $500,000
to run the west Houston site.
</P>
<P>
   Chase surveyed its employees last year and found that while they
liked their regular child care arrangements, they're in a quandary
when their day care center closes for a religious holiday, or there
are floods and schools are closed.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a completely new endeavor for New York-based Chase
Manhattan Corp. It built its first backup child care center in 1992
to help employees who had been transferred to the bank's offices in
Brooklyn. It was so popular that the bank is expanding the concept,
and by 2001, there will be 11 backup child care centers around the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
LESS PRESSURE ON EMPLOYEE &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Valle Wilson, a senior credit lender at Chase's consumer loan
center in west Houston, said she is thrilled with the plans for the
new child center that is scheduled to open next year.
</P>
<P>
   The church-affiliated day care center that her son, 14-month-old
Zachary, attends is closed on some religious holidays that the bank
doesn't observe. On those days, Wilson's husband has taken the day
off, but that will be more difficult to do now because he has been
traveling quite a bit lately. Other times, Wilson has asked
relatives to step in, but that's hard because they work too.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will take a lot of pressure off me,'' said Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   The new program will also take pressure off managers who have
production quotas to meet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have lots of parents who wake up in the morning and Johnny
has spots,'' said Kevin O'Brien, executive vice president of cash
management, an intensive 24-hour, seven-day-a-week operation.
Employees then scramble to find alternative care and come in late,
or take leave to stay at home, all of which slows down the
processing.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, parents have brought their children to work with
them, but that causes great disruption, O'Brien said, because
everyone wants to stop for a 10-minute conversation about the
child's school progress and plans for summer vacation.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
SERVICE FILLS A NEED &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Houston has a handful of corporate on-site day care centers as
well as places to take sick children. But child care advocacy
experts say they don't know of any local corporate-sponsored child
care that is strictly designed for backup care.
</P>
<P>
   It's a real need, said Suzanne Hinds, director of Initiatives
for Children. The child care referral service gets about 5 percent
of its calls each month from parents looking for backup care.
Another 5 percent comes from parents looking for care for their
sick child.
</P>
<P>
   Bright Horizons Family Solutions, which manages child care
centers and will manage Chase's new centers in Texas, has a couple
of other employers who have set up backup care. But they don't
offer it free of charge, said Missy Martines, communication project
manager for Cambridge, Mass.-based Bright Horizons.
</P>
<P>
   More clients are interested in providing the service because it
greatly reduces employee absenteeism and it's a great recruiting
incentive, Martines said.

HOUSTON IN TOP 10 AS TEEN HAVEN 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JEANNIE KEVER 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's official. Houston is the place to be if you're a
mall-hangin', shopaholic teen.
</P>
<P>
   Or a Comet-gazing teen.
</P>
<P>
   Or a thrill-seeking teen.
</P>
<P>
   Houston is one of 10 cities named as teen havens in the
September issue of Seventeen magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The others are Ann Arbor, Mich.; Billings, Mont.; Boston;
Boulder, Colo.; Honolulu; Montclair, N.J.; New York; San Francisco
and Seattle. San Francisco was singled out as the top town for
teens, but the other nine weren't ranked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shopping, anyone? If you love to indulge in retail madness,
Houston is the place for you,'' according to the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   You'll get no quibble on that from Lauren Young, a 14-year-old
freshman at Cypress Falls Senior High School. She's lived in
Houston all her life, and she says it's a good place for teens.
``It's big, and there are lots of places to go shopping,'' she said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Her favorite? The Galleria.
</P>
<P>
   For its first-ever survey of teen livability, Seventeen looked
at 120 cities across the country, checking out five major
categories: fun stuff to do, shopping, crime rate, schools and
quality of life. The magazine defined ``quality of life'' as
involving climate, mass transit, free festivals, curfew laws, how
cool downtown is for kids, access to reproductive health care,
divorce rates, quality of the library system, and suicide and
depression rates.
</P>
<P>
   It crunched the numbers and came up with the winners. The losers
in the magazine's rankings weren't identified.
</P>
<P>
   The results are good news for Houston, said Jim Kollaer,
president of the Greater Houston Partnership and father of a
15-year-old son. That's because it points up the city's appeal to
younger workers. ``We're getting a lot more growth in this area,''
Kollaer said. ``It means we'll have a more educated, younger work
force.''
</P>
<P>
   No other Texas cities made the Top 10, although San Antonio and
Dallas were both cited for their shopping opportunities, and San
Antonio made the list of best places for a cheap date _ just $19.93
for a pizza and two movie tickets.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to its wealth of shopping destinations _
Westheimer's eclectic mix of shops and coffeehouses were mentioned,
along with the Galleria _ the magazine listed the WNBA championship
team, the Comets, and the city's amusement parks as being of
special appeal.
</P>
<P>
   And for kids who don't already live here, Seventeen thoughtfully
provided a list of the city's universities.

TAKING ROOT IN DALLAS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  A childlike love of games is turning a handful of companies in
North Texas into heavyweights as they churn out blockbuster titles
in an atmosphere of healthy competition and communal pride 
 
By TRICIA SERJU-HARRIS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Two major deadlines are pressing down on game developer
Terminal Reality.
</P>
<P>
   The company's next game, a flight simulator called Fly!, must be
ready to ship to stores in a few weeks. A second game, Nocturne,
needs a playable demo finished soon so it can be included in a game
magazine's October issue.
</P>
<P>
   President and Lead Programmer Mark Randel is feeling the heat.
He and his team of programmers have been punching in programming
code for hours, day and night.
</P>
<P>
   The art teams continue to smooth out the look of each game, and
level designers work frantically to make everything fit together.
</P>
<P>
   You can see the strain in Randel's face. He's losing sleep and
it shows in his eyes. Every day, there's another fire for him or
Brett Combs, Terminal's vice president, to douse.
</P>
<P>
   This is life in the computer and video game industry. But this
isn't San Francisco, Los Angeles, Seattle or Austin.
</P>
<P>
   It's Dallas. And in the past few years, this city of 1.1 million
people has been a contender for the title of America's game
developing capital.
</P>
<P>
   In the thick of things are about 10 &UR;  &LR; independent Dallas
development houses. No less than half have each had a blockbuster
hit of 500,000 or more units sold in the last few years.
</P>
<P>
   The city's game companies form a web of friends, semi-rivals and
pseudo-families. And their lifestyles are driven by an ardor that
is rarely seen in other businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Working in this industry is addictive,'' said Robert Atkins,
art director for Ritual Entertainment. ``It will take over your
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Being a game developer means living a life of high stress,
grueling ly long hours and a ``complete lack of a personal life,''
Atkins said.
</P>
<P>
   But the fear of caffeine headaches and a sensitivity to sunlight
hasn't stopped what he and other game makers have accomplished so
far.
</P>
<P>
   Hit games have been developed by Terminal Reality (Monster Truck
Madness I and II), id Software (Doom and Quake series), Apogee
Software Ltd./3D Realms Entertainment (Duke Nukem series) and
Ensemble Studios (Age of Empires series).
</P>
<P>
   Several more developers have ``sure things'' due for release
later this year, or early next. Among them, Ritual Entertainment
(Heavy Metal: FAKK2), Third Law Interactive (KISS Psycho Circus _
The Nightmare Child), Edge of Reality (Monster Truck Madness N64)
and Ion Storm (Anachronox).
</P>
<P>
   Propelling these young companies is a video gaming industry that
is in its third consecutive year of double-digit growth, according
to the Interactive Digital Software Association.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of PC games rose between 10 and 15 percent last year, and
console games for machines like Sony PlayStation and Nintendo 64
grew between 15 and 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   At about $6.3 billion, the game industry took in more money in
1998 than the movie industry did at the box office in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have a kind of child-like fascination with
(games), or it would be just another job for you,'' said Sverre
Kvernmo, Third Law's lead designer. ``It was what I always did in
my free time anyway, and now it's how I make my living. That's true
of a lot of the other guys here.''
</P>
<P>
   A recent report by the Milken Institute, a California think tank
that studies world economic growth, placed the city second only to
the Silicon Valley based on the concentration and economic output
it in high-technology industries.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Institute, Dallas has a diversified high-tech
base _ seven technology industries out of a possible 14 were more
concentrated in the area than elsewhere in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas is also home to six of the nation's 20 largest
telecommunication service companies, the report found.
</P>
<P>
   That may explain, in part, why Dallas has attracted so many game
developers.
</P>
<P>
   But many claim the success of id's Wolfenstein 3-D, a project
proposed, funded and originally published as shareware by Apogee in
1992, played the greatest role.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfenstein and then the phenomenal success of id's follow-up,
first-person shooter Doom helped attract some of computer gaming's
most visionary and renowned artists, designers and programmers to
Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of us have released at least one big hit, and, having
tasted that success, it's high motivation to taste it again,'' said
Scott Miller, founder of Apogee and a partner in 3D Realms.
</P>
<P>
   Other factors, too, made it easy for Detroit native Randel to
move his company to nearby Lewisville.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a more relaxed and laid-back attitude here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It also doesn't hurt to know a strong-selling game can yield a
developer $1.5 million to $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   Companies in the ``Dallas gaming mafia,'' as the group's been
dubbed, have ``always been independently owned and therefore we've
always been able to play by our own rules,'' Scott Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Mike Wilson and Harry Miller took that burgeoning
attitude and persuaded four local companies and two outside of
Texas to form Gathering of Developers, a computer and video game
publisher.
</P>
<P>
   The Gathering wants to change the publishing side of the
industry, and it's done so by breaking a few steadfast rules. Its
developers receive higher royalties and creative space to create
games and get the majority of the recognition for their work.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the founding companies has a seat on the board and a say
in all business decisions. The partners include Ritual
Entertainment, Terminal Reality, Epic Megagames, Edge of Reality,
Apogee/3D Realms and Poptop Software.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Miller, Gathering's president, said the game publisher has
made some inroads already.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(MORE) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We were misunderstood for a long time, but that's changed,''
he said. ``Other publishers are looking to work with us, whereas
before they were not. They understand why we are here.''
</P>
<P>
   The developers had no doubts about the Gathering's purpose.
After working with Microsoft to publish Terminal Velocity: Fury 3
and other games, the team at Terminal Reality joined the Gathering.
</P>
<P>
   Fly! _ a general aviation flight simulator that uses real
satellite terrain imagery and has realistic cockpit controls _ is
Terminal's first title published by the Gathering.
</P>
<P>
   But it's Terminal's second title, Nocturne, that will mark its
entry into the non-simulation market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Traditional publishers like to typecast. They expect a
developer to do one type of genre game for their entire
existence,'' Combs said. ``What's been cool about the Gathering is
they've allowed us to go outside our typecast of being a simulation
company in creating Nocturne.''
</P>
<P>
   Nocturne, a horror/action adventure, debuts on Halloween.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been working on Nocturne, my baby, for three years
now,'' Randel said.
</P>
<P>
   Randel wanted to create a new interactive experience with
Nocturne, which required the development team to go beyond what
other character games had done before.
</P>
<P>
   The early results: realistic proportions, realistic physics and
early praise in the gaming press.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can do it in real life, then you can do it in the
game,'' Randel said. ``You can run, jump and climb, but you can't
scale walls and do a standing back-flip from a standstill.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can't do it, why make a character jump, turn twists and
stand like a superhuman? Now the monsters, on the other hand ...,''
he laughs.
</P>
<P>
   The obvious force driving these twenty- and thirty-somethings
has less to do with becoming rich overnight and more with gaining
respect for their creations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest misconception about the game industry is people
don't realize how big and serious of an industry it is,'' said Rob
Cohen, president of Edge of Reality. ``The premier games are
technological and artistic masterpieces. Eventually (they're) going
to be recognized as an art form.''
</P>
<P>
   What's also evident is, unlike their California peers,
Dallas-based developers aren't afraid to express their excitement
over another developer's work, nor do the companies discourage
employees from mixing with those of a rival firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gaming community here is younger. There's no paranoia
about having employees mixing,'' said Tony Goodman, president and
CEO of Ensemble Studios.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Ensemble Studios threw a grand opening bash to show
off its new headquarters and upcoming game, Age of Empires II. The
guest list was a gumbo of the Dallas gaming elite.
</P>
<P>
   Pam Wolford, managing partner at Third Law Interactive, said the
companies actually ``root for each other.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Development teams have a family element to them, and people
move around so much that most of us have been friends or worked
together at some point in time,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The success and experience found in Dallas have inspired two of
the city's newest game makers _ Third Law and Edge of Reality.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen, along with Vice President Mike Panoff, started Edge of
Reality last year. The company's seven employees work out of an
apartment in a Dallas suburb.
</P>
<P>
   Their first game, Monster Truck Madness 64, is now in stores.
</P>
<P>
   Wolford and the entire Third Law team jumped ship last year from
Ion Storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reasons for our leaving varied from person to person,''
said Kvernmo, a native of Tromsdalen, Norway, near the Arctic
Circle. ``What we did have in common was the notion we had
potential as a team, and that wasn't being realized (at Ion).''
</P>
<P>
   The Gathering will publish Third Law's first game, The Nightmare
Child. It should hit stores next spring.
</P>
<P>
   Both Edge of Reality and Third Law said there's tremendous
pressure to be part of the successful history of developers in the
city.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's there. This is the title that will break or make us,''
Kvernmo said.
</P>
<P>
   Handling Third Law's daily operations keeps Wolford busy enough.
But as the only woman in a company of 11 young men, she's also
taken on the unofficial position of ``Mom.''
</P>
<P>
   Her office would make her popular among teenagers. Comic books
and action figures from Kiss Psycho Circus line her bookshelves and
any free space on her floor. The Psycho Circus was created by Todd
McFarlane, the mastermind behind the best-selling Spawn comic books
and merchandise line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, I'd rather the team think they've got a brilliant,
attractive woman running the ship rather than a motherly figure,''
Wolford, a tall, 37-year-old blond, said, laughing. ``But the `mom'
persona works much better for all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   At id Software, Katherine Anna Kang and administrative assistant
Donna Jackson consider themselves and their 13 male colleagues one
big family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Miss Donna thinks of the guys as her kids, and I think of them
as my bratty brothers,'' said Kang, id's director of business
development.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys are not embarrassed to run around with Nerf toys,
shooting each other. You can be a kid and that's still OK. It's a
relaxed, youthful environment.''
</P>
<P>
   It's clear the overall atmosphere is a balance of competition,
respect and success.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing laid-back about Dallas business, and you are
only as good as your last work,'' said Wilson, chief executive of
the Gathering. ``It's a great environment for keeping one focused
on work and productivity, and having others around you driven to
excel is great.''
</P>
<P>
   And as in any relationship, there are feuds. But they come and
go as the developers seek success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you hear of spats and stuff, but then it dies,''
said Ritual's Richard ``Levelord'' Gray. ``We're all so busy.
There's no time to fight.''

BACK-TO-SCHOOL ADVENTURE REQUIRES CAREFUL PLANNING 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JEANNIE KEVER 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Think you'll just dash out and grab some
back-to-school stuff for the kids this weekend?
</P>
<P>
   Think again. The experts say you need a plan.
</P>
<P>
   High on the list is deciding when and where to shop.
</P>
<P>
   First thing in the morning and late afternoon-to-early evening
are generally quiet times, although many retailers expect bedlam
this weekend as people take advantage of the three-day sales tax
holiday, which began at 12:01 a.m. Friday. It continues until
midnight Sunday, giving Texas families a break on shoes, clothing
and a variety of other items.
</P>
<P>
   The sales tax exemption amounts to 8.25 percent at stores inside
the Houston city limits, and many stores are offering further
discounts.
</P>
<P>
   So prepare for crowds.
</P>
<P>
   ``You almost have to go with the same attitude you would have at
Christmas,'' said David Gusewelle, special events manager for J.C.
Penney Co. ``Parking will probably be something. You'll have to
wait for everything. If you have to go to the bathroom, you'll
probably have to wait.''
</P>
<P>
   Deciding what you want before leaving home could speed things
up.
</P>
<P>
   Priscilla Thorne, a spokeswoman for Foley's retail store,
suggests going through your kids' closets and determining what they
need to complement what they already have. She recommends sticking
with the basics _ jeans, khakis, polo shirts _ and allowing for one
or two special items.
</P>
<P>
   School uniforms simplify the choices, but kids will need a few
other things, depending upon their ages and interests. A
skateboarding 11-year-old has different wardrobe requirements than
a 16-year-old with a part-time job and a busy social life.
</P>
<P>
   Talking to older kids about what they need and want _ not always
the same thing, of course _ can help determine your destination. If
only one brand name will do, figure out ahead of time which stores
carry it.
</P>
<P>
   Another part of the shopping plan is figuring out how much you
can spend.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of families are on budgets, so come prepared with the
amount of money you're able to spend,'' advised Christina Kerford,
a Macy's spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   There's also the matter of how much money is at hand. You can
usually find the available limit on your credit cards with a quick
telephone call, avoiding embarrassing and time-consuming delays in
the checkout line.
</P>
<P>
   Thorne suggests giving older kids a budget and some guidelines _
including a firm thumbs down on anything you'll definitely hate _
and letting them make their own choices. Teens may be happy with
fewer things in exchange for one thing they really want, whether
it's an outrageous pair of sneakers or an expensive pair of
designer jeans. If they love it, they'll wear it constantly.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, if kids of any age tell you they don't like something,
believe them. They won't wear it.
</P>
<P>
   Some die-hard shoppers swear by the piecemeal approach: blue
jeans in the morning, followed by a break for lunch. Shoes in the
late afternoon, then call it a day. Make a couple of equally
well-defined forays the following day, and repeat until the job is
done or you're broke, whichever comes first.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't work for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte Gallegos ought to have back-to-school shopping down to
a science _ she has 10-year-old triplets.
</P>
<P>
   Rayanne, Taylor and Tyler will start fifth grade at Memorial
Parkway Elementary School in nearby Katy next week, so Gallegos is
girding for a one-day shopping spree this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all go as a family,'' she said. ``It's quite an event.''
</P>
<P>
   With no older siblings to pass along hand-me-downs, the family
starts new every year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need everything,'' Gallegos said. ``Socks, underwear,
shirts, shorts, jeans ... We like to buy it all at once. I know
that sounds crazy, but we do. We don't like to keep going back and
forth (to the mall), so we try to make a big haul.''
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, Thorne said, people with several kids should shop for
one child at a time, ``especially if they're younger.''
</P>
<P>
   But if you'll be shopping en masse this weekend or later in the
month, make it as easy as you can:
</P>
<P>
   _ Scour the ads for sales before leaving home.
</P>
<P>
   _ Trying on new clothes will be less of a hassle if the kids
wear easy-on, easy-off shoes and clothing.
</P>
<P>
   _ You should wear comfortable clothes, too, and, most important,
comfortable shoes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Make sure the kids have had a good night's sleep and a good
breakfast. ``Bathe them, feed them, give them lots to drink and
take them to the bathroom,'' advises one store employee bracing for
the busy weekend.
</P>
<P>
   _ To sustain yourselves, drink plenty of water before and
throughout the shopping trip. Take a water bottle for convenience.
If you've got small kids, a tote bag of toys, snacks and drinks is
handy.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't forget to take an occasional break.
</P>
<P>
   _ And remember that kids grow. Buy some things in larger sizes
or wait until the after-Christmas sales to buy things for the
second half of the school year.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Take into consideration your children's taste,'' Kerford
said. ``Compromise. Let kids pick out a few things they like.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Ask if you're getting the absolute best price _ some stores
have coupons or other special deals you may not know about. Ask
about the return policy, just in case. Some clothing can't be
returned if the tags have been removed.
</P>
<P>
   And try to have a good time. The Gallegos family will.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're good little shoppers,'' Gallegos said. ``We love the
mall, and our kids actually like going. My daughter is like, `Oh,
Mom, let's shop 'til we drop.' And the boys are like, `We'll go if
we get something.'''

SALES-TAX HOLIDAY COULD BE BONANZA _ OR BUST _ FOR TEXAS RETAILERS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG HASSELL 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ As Texas retailers gear up for the state's first sales
tax holiday, which started Friday morning and continues through
midnight Sunday, one big question remains to be answered.
</P>
<P>
   Will shoppers embrace the event and stampede the stores like
they do on the days after Thanksgiving and Christmas? Or will they
dismiss it as a political gimmick that offers little relief for
their pocketbook?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not sure what the impact will be, because we've never
had anything like this before,'' said John Pew, general manager of
Baybrook Mall in Houston. ``To be on the safe side, we are going to
assume that it will be very, very busy.''
</P>
<P>
   But don't panic. It's unlikely the crowds will rival those that
jam stores during the peak days of the Christmas shopping season.
</P>
<P>
   ``This holiday only affects some of the stores _ those that sell
clothing. We have a lot of stores that don't sell apparel, and they
will not feel much of an impact,'' Pew said.
</P>
<P>
   The sales-tax holiday of 1999 will give Texans 72 hours of
tax-free shopping, as long as they are buying clothing and shoes
costing less than $100 per item.
</P>
<P>
   Clothing and equipment used exclusively for athletic purposes _
things such as golf shoes or football pants _ will not be
tax-exempt. Likewise, the law does not exempt accessories such as
jewelry, handbags and wallets.
</P>
<P>
   The holiday is timed to coincide with back-to-school shopping,
and the list of tax-exempt merchandise is tailored to try to give
the biggest break to families needing to outfit their children for
the coming school year. State officials estimate Texas shoppers
will save about $69 million during the three-day weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``We pay so much tax. So even though this isn't a huge tax
break, it feels really good not to pay tax on something,'' said
Shannon Mathias, who planned to do some shopping for her two
children Friday morning at The Woodlands Mall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to beat the rush and get back home,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Erin McLeod plans to cash in on the tax savings, but she has a
slightly different strategy for avoiding the crowds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my daughter's birthday this weekend, and we are going to
go shopping late Friday night,'' said McLeod, who has her sights
set on hitting First Colony Mall, which planned to stay open until
midnight Friday and Saturday. ``I think the crowds will be ungodly,
so we are going to shop late.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond setting their shopping hours, the mother acknowledges
she'll be able to control little about their upcoming shopping
trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``Haley is turning 11, so she has to pick out everything she
wears herself. I'll tell her what she can't have _ that's why I am
going along,'' McLeod said.
</P>
<P>
   Tiffany Ball likes the idea of a tax holiday, but she isn't
putting shopping on her to-do list this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great idea, but I won't be there,'' she said. ``I've
got family in from out of town, and they aren't coming here to
shop.''
</P>
<P>
   Trying to gauge public interest in the sales-tax holiday is a
key business decision for merchants. Most are spending big bucks to
pay for extra staffing and extra merchandise. Many are cutting
prices to motivate customers with more than simply the tax break of
8.25 percent, which includes regional and local sales taxes.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Foley's retail store is offering its big ``Red
Apple'' sale this weekend. Other merchants, such as Macy's and
Palais Royal, are offering steep discounts on selected items.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are ready to rip and roar,'' said Oshman's Sporting Goods
President Alvin Lubetkin.
</P>
<P>
   But Lubetkin is concerned the public may be too uninformed or
apathetic to make this a big sales bonanza. As he sat in a barber's
chair Thursday, Lubetkin was keenly interested when the
conversation swirling around him turned to the upcoming sales tax
holiday.
</P>
<P>
   ``A woman in the barber's shop spoke up and said she had just
heard about this thing called the sales-tax holiday. She acted like
she had never heard of it before,'' he lamented. ``I don't get the
sense that a lot of people are real excited about this. I hope I am
wrong. We are hoping for the best.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the best-case scenario for merchants, could this weekend
conceivably rival the weekend after Thanksgiving?
</P>
<P>
   ``No way,'' Lubetkin said. ``I just don't see it.''
</P>
<P>
   While it may not be a runaway train, the weekend will give a
sales boost to some retailers, including some who aren't normally
thought of as mainstream clothing merchants.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Raisbeck, co-owner of Charlotte's Saddlery, didn't think
his merchandise would be covered by the tax holiday until he read a
newspaper article that specifically listed ``riding pants'' as
being tax-exempt.
</P>
<P>
   ``God, that surprises me,'' Raisbeck said. ``I didn't expect it,
but I'll take it.''
</P>
<P>
   Shirts, pants and some boots sold at Charlotte's will be
tax-free, he said. Kroger supermarkets will get a piece of the
action because it sells diapers, pantyhose and socks, all of which
are tax-exempt items.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have stocked up on diapers and will run a special on large
packs of Huggies,'' said Kroger spokesman Gary Huddleston. ``Kroger
is excited to participate in the sales-tax holiday. ... It's real
tax relief for real people.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is so enthused about the tax holiday, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of like the lottery. There is an illusion present
that could end up costing some people a lot of money,'' said Reggie
James, director of the Consumers Union Southwest Regional Office.
``Low-income (people) don't have a lot of disposable income.
Because of easy credit, there will be a temptation to spend a lot
of money they don't have.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not an appreciable savings,'' James added. ``On $100, you
save about $8.''
</P>
<P>
   But if shoppers hunt for the best discounts being offered and
don't blow their budgets sky-high, the holiday will be a benefit,
James conceded.
</P>
<P>
   A more typical line of complaint concerns the list of items that
are tax-exempt. For instance, lingerie is not your normal
back-to-school staple, but it's tax-exempt. But pencils and a paper
tablets are not.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they are so concerned with school kids, why aren't school
supplies exempt?'' McLeod asked. ``I'll spend $100 easy on school
supplies.''
</P>
<P>
   Another head-scratcher is that fur coats are exempt, but
backpacks are not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why didn't they include backpacks? Every kid who goes to
school wears a backpack of some kind,'' Lubetkin said.
</P>

   FILM-REVIEW-CROWN (Undated) _ Whenever she can, insurance
investigator Catherine Banning (Rene Russo) refers to Thomas Crown
(Pierce Brosnan), her billionaire playboy prey, as ``Tommy.'' The
boyish nickname is part tool of reductive seduction, part nominal
territory-marking, part Banning's way of informing Crown that she

   TV-FRASIER (Pasadena, Calif.) _ It has been one of television's
better teases, the pining of the lovelorn Dr. Niles Crane for the
oblivious Daphne Moon. But it's been six years now. Something has
to give with those kids from ``Frasier.'' Otherwise, David Hyde
Pierce (who plays Niles) says, ``It starts being unbelievable.'' By
MARK McGUIRE.

<P>
   FILM-REVIEW-SENSE (Undated) _ ``The Sixth Sense'' sneaks up on
you _ slowly, on tip-toe, slinking up the cellar stairs until it's
hovering right behind you, hissing down your neck. The film is a
cunning paranormal thriller about a boy who sees dead people and
the child psychiatrist who tries to help him. By AMY BIANCOLLI.
</P>
<P>
   FILM-REVIEW-LIFE (Undated) _ Sometimes an out-of-touch
kids-find-sex movie can be quaint in its need to pretend that
yesterday is better than now _ or that yesterday is a lot like now.
But ``My Life So Far'' is neither a reminiscent throwback nor mild
allegory, it's a willfully turgid demonstration that if a filmmaker
puts his mind to it he can tell a tale about a boy sexually coming
of age as if the birds, bees and educated fleas were the only one's
doing it. By WESLEY MORRIS.
</P>
<P>
   FILM-REVIEW-LUMINATA (Undated) _ Imagined as a love song to his
wife about the strength of their marriage, John Turturro's ``Il

Shakespeare version of ``The Ballad of John and Yoko.'' But for
better or worse, the wife, Kathryn Borowitz, is no Ono. By WESLEY

   FILM-REVIEW-MYSTERY (Undated) _ Champion City could be one
post-millennial metropolis over from Tim Burton's Gotham City and
two towns away from any Terry Gilliam municipal zoo. Basically,
it's a circus of emancipated superhero carnival freaks who want to
time warp again, and ``Mystery Men'' is their bacchanal. By WESLEY

   WORKING-COLUMN (Undated) _ Most cities have a disaster
contigency plan if a hurricane hits or if key employees go on

<P>
   COMPUTER-COLUMN (Undated) _ It's fitting that one of the most
popular items people use their computers to buy over the Internet

about updating your compu-clunker with a few clicks of its mouse,
and having a shiny new replacement show up on your doorstep a few
days later. An example of three PCs you can buy online. By DWIGHT
SILVERMAN.
</P>
<P>
   COMPUTER-HELPLINE (Undated) _ A reader asks, ``Your column is so
helpful that I'm wondering if you would write a similar column
regarding minimum laptop specs. I am a writer who spends many hours

tax-exempt. Likewise, the law does not exempt accessories such as
jewelry, handbags and wallets.
</P>
<P>
   The holiday is timed to coincide with back-to-school shopping,
and the list of tax-exempt merchandise is tailored to try to give
the biggest break to families needing to outfit their children for
the coming school year. State officials estimate Texas shoppers
will save about $69 million during the three-day weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``We pay so much tax. So even though this isn't a huge tax
break, it feels really good not to pay tax on something,'' said
Shannon Mathias, who planned to do some shopping for her two
children Friday morning at The Woodlands Mall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to beat the rush and get back home,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Erin McLeod plans to cash in on the tax savings, but she has a
slightly different strategy for avoiding the crowds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my daughter's birthday this weekend, and we are going to
go shopping late Friday night,'' said McLeod, who has her sights
set on hitting First Colony Mall, which planned to stay open until
midnight Friday and Saturday. ``I think the crowds will be ungodly,
so we are going to shop late.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond setting their shopping hours, the mother acknowledges
she'll be able to control little about their upcoming shopping
trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``Haley is turning 11, so she has to pick out everything she
wears herself. I'll tell her what she can't have _ that's why I am
going along,'' McLeod said.
</P>
<P>
   Tiffany Ball likes the idea of a tax holiday, but she isn't
putting shopping on her to-do list this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great idea, but I won't be there,'' she said. ``I've
got family in from out of town, and they aren't coming here to
shop.''
</P>
<P>
   Trying to gauge public interest in the sales-tax holiday is a
key business decision for merchants. Most are spending big bucks to
pay for extra staffing and extra merchandise. Many are cutting
prices to motivate customers with more than simply the tax break of
8.25 percent, which includes regional and local sales taxes.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Foley's retail store is offering its big ``Red
Apple'' sale this weekend. Other merchants, such as Macy's and
Palais Royal, are offering steep discounts on selected items.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are ready to rip and roar,'' said Oshman's Sporting Goods
President Alvin Lubetkin.
</P>
<P>
   But Lubetkin is concerned the public may be too uninformed or
apathetic to make this a big sales bonanza. As he sat in a barber's
chair Thursday, Lubetkin was keenly interested when the
conversation swirling around him turned to the upcoming sales tax
holiday.
</P>
<P>
   ``A woman in the barber's shop spoke up and said she had just
heard about this thing called the sales-tax holiday. She acted like
she had never heard of it before,'' he lamented. ``I don't get the
sense that a lot of people are real excited about this. I hope I am
wrong. We are hoping for the best.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the best-case scenario for merchants, could this weekend
conceivably rival the weekend after Thanksgiving?
</P>
<P>
   ``No way,'' Lubetkin said. ``I just don't see it.''
</P>
<P>
   While it may not be a runaway train, the weekend will give a
sales boost to some retailers, including some who aren't normally
thought of as mainstream clothing merchants.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Raisbeck, co-owner of Charlotte's Saddlery, didn't think
his merchandise would be covered by the tax holiday until he read a
newspaper article that specifically listed ``riding pants'' as
being tax-exempt.
</P>
<P>
   ``God, that surprises me,'' Raisbeck said. ``I didn't expect it,
but I'll take it.''
</P>
<P>
   Shirts, pants and some boots sold at Charlotte's will be
tax-free, he said. Kroger supermarkets will get a piece of the
action because it sells diapers, pantyhose and socks, all of which
are tax-exempt items.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have stocked up on diapers and will run a special on large
packs of Huggies,'' said Kroger spokesman Gary Huddleston. ``Kroger
is excited to participate in the sales-tax holiday. ... It's real
tax relief for real people.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is so enthused about the tax holiday, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of like the lottery. There is an illusion present
that could end up costing some people a lot of money,'' said Reggie
James, director of the Consumers Union Southwest Regional Office.
``Low-income (people) don't have a lot of disposable income.
Because of easy credit, there will be a temptation to spend a lot
of money they don't have.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not an appreciable savings,'' James added. ``On $100, you
save about $8.''
</P>
<P>
   But if shoppers hunt for the best discounts being offered and
don't blow their budgets sky-high, the holiday will be a benefit,
James conceded.
</P>
<P>
   A more typical line of complaint concerns the list of items that
are tax-exempt. For instance, lingerie is not your normal
back-to-school staple, but it's tax-exempt. But pencils and a paper
tablets are not.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they are so concerned with school kids, why aren't school
supplies exempt?'' McLeod asked. ``I'll spend $100 easy on school
supplies.''
</P>
<P>
   Another head-scratcher is that fur coats are exempt, but
backpacks are not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why didn't they include backpacks? Every kid who goes to
school wears a backpack of some kind,'' Lubetkin said.
</P>

BACK-TO-SCHOOL ADVENTURE REQUIRES CAREFUL PLANNING 

</HEADLINE>

By JEANNIE KEVER 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Think you'll just dash out and grab some
back-to-school stuff for the kids this weekend?
</P>
<P>
   Think again. The experts say you need a plan.
</P>
<P>
   High on the list is deciding when and where to shop.
</P>
<P>
   First thing in the morning and late afternoon-to-early evening
are generally quiet times, although many retailers expect bedlam
this weekend as people take advantage of the three-day sales tax
holiday, which began at 12:01 a.m. Friday. It continues until
midnight Sunday, giving Texas families a break on shoes, clothing
and a variety of other items.
</P>
<P>
   The sales tax exemption amounts to 8.25 percent at stores inside
the Houston city limits, and many stores are offering further
discounts.
</P>
<P>
   So prepare for crowds.
</P>
<P>
   ``You almost have to go with the same attitude you would have at
Christmas,'' said David Gusewelle, special events manager for J.C.
Penney Co. ``Parking will probably be something. You'll have to
wait for everything. If you have to go to the bathroom, you'll
probably have to wait.''
</P>
<P>
   Deciding what you want before leaving home could speed things
up.
</P>
<P>
   Priscilla Thorne, a spokeswoman for Foley's retail store,
suggests going through your kids' closets and determining what they
need to complement what they already have. She recommends sticking
with the basics _ jeans, khakis, polo shirts _ and allowing for one
or two special items.
</P>
<P>
   School uniforms simplify the choices, but kids will need a few
other things, depending upon their ages and interests. A
skateboarding 11-year-old has different wardrobe requirements than
a 16-year-old with a part-time job and a busy social life.
</P>
<P>
   Talking to older kids about what they need and want _ not always
the same thing, of course _ can help determine your destination. If
only one brand name will do, figure out ahead of time which stores
carry it.
</P>
<P>
   Another part of the shopping plan is figuring out how much you
can spend.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of families are on budgets, so come prepared with the
amount of money you're able to spend,'' advised Christina Kerford,
a Macy's spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   There's also the matter of how much money is at hand. You can
usually find the available limit on your credit cards with a quick
telephone call, avoiding embarrassing and time-consuming delays in
the checkout line.
</P>
<P>
   Thorne suggests giving older kids a budget and some guidelines _
including a firm thumbs down on anything you'll definitely hate _
and letting them make their own choices. Teens may be happy with
fewer things in exchange for one thing they really want, whether
it's an outrageous pair of sneakers or an expensive pair of
designer jeans. If they love it, they'll wear it constantly.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, if kids of any age tell you they don't like something,
believe them. They won't wear it.
</P>
<P>
   Some die-hard shoppers swear by the piecemeal approach: blue
jeans in the morning, followed by a break for lunch. Shoes in the
late afternoon, then call it a day. Make a couple of equally
well-defined forays the following day, and repeat until the job is
done or you're broke, whichever comes first.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't work for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte Gallegos ought to have back-to-school shopping down to
a science _ she has 10-year-old triplets.
</P>
<P>
   Rayanne, Taylor and Tyler will start fifth grade at Memorial
Parkway Elementary School in nearby Katy next week, so Gallegos is
girding for a one-day shopping spree this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all go as a family,'' she said. ``It's quite an event.''
</P>
<P>
   With no older siblings to pass along hand-me-downs, the family
starts new every year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need everything,'' Gallegos said. ``Socks, underwear,
shirts, shorts, jeans ... We like to buy it all at once. I know
that sounds crazy, but we do. We don't like to keep going back and
forth (to the mall), so we try to make a big haul.''
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, Thorne said, people with several kids should shop for
one child at a time, ``especially if they're younger.''
</P>
<P>
   But if you'll be shopping en masse this weekend or later in the
month, make it as easy as you can:
</P>
<P>
   _ Scour the ads for sales before leaving home.
</P>
<P>
   _ Trying on new clothes will be less of a hassle if the kids
wear easy-on, easy-off shoes and clothing.
</P>
<P>
   _ You should wear comfortable clothes, too, and, most important,
comfortable shoes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Make sure the kids have had a good night's sleep and a good
breakfast. ``Bathe them, feed them, give them lots to drink and
take them to the bathroom,'' advises one store employee bracing for
the busy weekend.
</P>
<P>
   _ To sustain yourselves, drink plenty of water before and
throughout the shopping trip. Take a water bottle for convenience.
If you've got small kids, a tote bag of toys, snacks and drinks is
handy.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't forget to take an occasional break.
</P>
<P>
   _ And remember that kids grow. Buy some things in larger sizes
or wait until the after-Christmas sales to buy things for the
second half of the school year.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Take into consideration your children's taste,'' Kerford
said. ``Compromise. Let kids pick out a few things they like.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Ask if you're getting the absolute best price _ some stores
have coupons or other special deals you may not know about. Ask
about the return policy, just in case. Some clothing can't be
returned if the tags have been removed.
</P>
<P>
   And try to have a good time. The Gallegos family will.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're good little shoppers,'' Gallegos said. ``We love the
mall, and our kids actually like going. My daughter is like, `Oh,
Mom, let's shop 'til we drop.' And the boys are like, `We'll go if
we get something.'''

 &HT;    Arguments: Husbands know when it's time to quit talking and find
a cot
 &HT;    By Jim Minter
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FAYETTE COUNTY, Ga. _ Discovering you're no longer welcome in
your own home is a sad experience. The best I can say for my wife
is that she tried to break the news diplomatically.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad you finally decided to clean out your shop,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' I replied. ``I need a place to paint the tractor. After
30 years I thought it needed a face lift, and now that I'm getting
a little long in the tooth myself, maybe a tractor that looks new
will help my image.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I had another use in mind for the shop,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like what?'' I asked. I thought she might be planning to clean
out her closets and start a nearly-new boutique.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking of putting in a bathroom,'' she said. ``And a
washer and dryer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We already have more bathrooms than we had in the south half
of Fayette County when I was growing up,'' I said. ``Why in the
world do we need another one in my shop?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you ever totaled up the real cost of your garden?'' she
asked. ``Now that we don't have children in college your garden is
our biggest expense.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's preposterous,'' I replied. ``With this heat wave, our
electric bill is more than house payments used to be.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And why do you think that is?'' she asked. ``What do you think
runs the pump that runs all night so you can water your garden? If
you didn't insist on having a garden, we could cut our electric
bill in half.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What's this got to do with a bathroom in the shop?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can shower out there after working in your garden instead
of messing up the house,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know we can't afford to build a bathroom in the shop just
so I can shower before coming in from the garden,'' I argued.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only can we afford a bathroom,'' she said. ``We can afford
a sink and a washer and dryer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a washer and dryer in the basement,'' I pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   ``And they're both about worn out,'' she said, ``from washing
your garden clothes twice a day.''
</P>
<P>
   I had to concede I do have a lot of garden clothes to be washed
and dried. The older you get, the more you sweat, a phenomenon
complicated by repressive house rules. I'm not allowed to sit on a
sofa or in a dining room chair when my clothes are wet with sweat.
Because of those restrictions, and especially in this hot weather,
I have to change clothes twice a day, at noon, and again at
suppertime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still don't think a little extra washing justifies
installing a bathroom and a laundry operation in the shop,'' I
argued.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does when you consider the cost of carpet,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do carpets have to do with it?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you didn't track mud from the garden in the house, we
wouldn't have to replace the carpet,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you're saying,'' I concluded, ``is that you really don't
want me in the house anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not all the time,'' she answered.
</P>
<P>
   I have to admit I brought part of this on myself. When my garden
was thriving last month I did some bragging, even going so far as
inviting Dr. George Patton, the north Fayette master gardener, down
to view the fruits of my labors.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere in the Bible it says that the Lord will smite a
braggart and bring the boastful low. If the Bible doesn't say that,
it must have been an oversight, because it surely is the truth.
</P>
<P>
   The very day I bragged about my superior corn patch, the Lord
sent a driving rainstorm and high winds. Half my corn patch was
flattened. With ears on the ground and subject to raiding raccoons,
the Silver Queen had to be harvested immediately. Then it rained
for eight days and eight nights, causing the tomatoes to wilt. They
had to be picked before they rotted on the dying vines. The wet
weather prompted squash and cucumbers to record production.
</P>
<P>
   All of this merged with a bumper crop of figs made more
unmanageable than usual when two extra bushes I'd put out for
insurance kicked in. I'll admit the kitchen and the washing machine
got vigorous workouts, and maybe some mud was inadvertently tracked
on the carpet during the eight days and nights of monsoons. But
with people starving all over the world, it would have been sinful
to let anything go to waste.
</P>
<P>
   I guess all of that put together pushed my wife over the edge.
Nevertheless, it isn't a good feeling to realize you're about to be
kicked out of the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I'll get a little cot and sleep in the shop, too,'' I
suggested.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a good idea for the rainy season,'' she responded, with
more enthusiasm than I thought appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   If anyone knows where I can find an old Army cot and mattress,
please let me know. I could also use a small stove to heat soup and
keep me warm on cold winter nights.

 &HT;    Psuedoscientific hooey the scare tactic of choice nowadays
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ People know that politics, philosophy and theology
are based on personal beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   Science, however, is considered based on knowledge obtained from
comprehensive testing and objective research.
</P>
<P>
   That perception opens the door for deception.
</P>
<P>
   America apparently is chockablock with anti-business,
anti-industry Luddites willing to support any flimsy excuse to
malign politically incorrect technological advances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scientific studies show such and such'' is more persuasive
than ``I believe such and such.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers, whose careers depend on persuasion, know this. Any
trial where enough money is involved likely will have dueling
scientific experts.
</P>
<P>
   After the contradicting experts are finished, the jurors, who
have been carefully screened for their lack of knowledge on the
points in dispute, are often left to mold a decison out of
conflicting emotional arguments and contridictory
scientific-sounding testimony.
</P>
<P>
   O.J. Simpson would be on death row had his fate rested in the
hands of a panel of genuine scientists.
</P>
<P>
   Junk science caused Dow Chemical Company to file for bankruptcy
and put thousands of workers out of jobs due to claims that the
company's silicone breast implants caused cancer, lupus and other
chronic disorders.
</P>
<P>
   When all the payments are completed, it is estimated that Dow
Corning will have paid out $3.2 billion to lawyers representing
176,000 women for diseases caused by silicone breast implants.
</P>
<P>
   The billions of dollars, the anxiety of a national scare and the
loss of jobs were all based on anecdotal claims of scientific
knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   The science was junk and the claims were bogus, according to an
actual long-term scientific study of the evidence by respected
scientists who made up a committee named by the Institute of
Medicine, the medical division of the nonprofit National Academy of
Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   After a thorough examination of all available evidence, the
committee found that women with silicone breast implants are no
more likely to develop chronic disease than women without the
implants.
</P>
<P>
   There are risks inherent in any invasive surgery, especially
when a foreign object is placed in the body, but the scientists
said there is ``no evidence to suggest that the silicones used in
the transplants are toxic to humans.''
</P>
<P>
   There has been no accounting to show how many millions or
billions of dollars have been wasted to accommodate faulty science
that supposedly showed that electromagnetic fields, or EMF, from
high-tension lines caused cancer or childhood leukemia.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, it turns out that a scientist at the Lawrence
Berkeley Laboratory faked the evidence to help him win $3.3 million
in federal grants.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-industry scares based on junk science often can be spotted
simply because they appear out of nowhere and quickly sweep across
the nation. Real science is slow and time-consuming. It is based on
tests on top of tests that are open to peer review.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Alar on apples and global warming, other popular scares
have been the report that houses and buildings with high radon
counts cause cancer and that the tiny amounts of electromagnetic
energy (more good ol' EMF) from cell phones cause cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The alar scare was eventually found to be spurious.
</P>
<P>
   One of the lead scientists promoting global warming for the
Clinton administration previously promoted a global ice-age scare.
</P>
<P>
   The only long-term measurements of the planet's temperature come
from NASA satellite data that consistently show a slight global
temperature drop, not an increase.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly it's better to be safe than sorry, right up to the
point that we are repetitively foolish.

although she knows they are bound to do things she won't agree

ways to use the unique capabilities of such creatures as
cockroaches, honeybees, moths, lobsters and lizards to perform
military tasks. (Nesmith, Cox Washington Bureau) Art includes

   WITH: DEPRESSION WALK -- Almost every day for the past three
months, someone has stopped Stuart Perry on the road, wanting to
talk about depression. Since May, Perry has walked on back roads
from Georgia to Chicago talking about depression to anyone who
would listen. He began his trek to educate people about the
devastating illness and to give hope about treatment. (Miller,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

<P>
   WITH: ANTIOXIDENTS GAIN RESPECT -- An increasing number of

plant-based chemicals _ are the key to maintaining health if you
live in a city with high levels of air pollution and other toxic
chemicals. (Kennedy, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   MANATEE _ BOCA RATON, Fla. _ Manatees aren't too slow or stupid
to get out of the way of boats; they just can't hear them, says a
Florida Atlantic University scientist whose research into sea cow
acoustics is getting international attention. Edmund Gerstein's
research shows that manatees evolved to hear only high-pitched
sounds, not the low rumble of boat propellers. His solution: he's
developed an ultra-high pitched warning beacon that boaters could
stick to their hulls. He recently published his research in an
international acoustics journal. The British magazine New Scientist
just ran a blurb on it, causing his phone to ring off the hook.

   THEATRE-CENTURY _ A CENTURY IN THE ARTS: THEATER: The changing
nature and mission of American theater in the 20th century is tied
to the places that it serves. To put it bluntly, the what and why
of theater is intimately connected to the where. Up until the
1950s, the where was New York and the why was for-profit. Beginning
with ``Oklahoma!'' in 1943, and extending through ``A Streetcar
Named Desire'' and ``Death of a Salesman'' at the end of the
decade, theatrical talent converged and peaked in the Broadway
district. By the ``60s, the regional theater movement had started.
It continues to flourish today. (Hulbert, Atlanta

 &HT;    New woodworking book is basic, but not best
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Taunton Press is once again demonstrating one of
its most remarkable aptitudes, that of creative literary recycling.
</P>
<P>
   The publishers of Fine Woodworking magazine let very few
articles go unreprinted; they have put out several series of
softcover books, gathering under specific headings a number of
compatible and complementary articles published over a period of
years.
</P>
<P>
   I've just received the first two in what I assume will be
another lengthy series with the overall designation of Essentials
of Woodworking.
</P>
<P>
   These are ``The Basics of Craftsmanship'' and ``Ingenious Jigs
and Shop Accessories.'' Taunton is reinventing the wheel, so to
speak, with both of these; it already has at least one book on shop
jigs and several on basic woodworking. Nonetheless, at least the
first of these books will be of interest to many less experienced
woodworkers and they are reasonably priced at $17.95 each.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basics of Craftsmanship'' is broken into six parts _ setting
up a shop, materials, tools, techniques, projects and finishing.
</P>
<P>
   The section on setting up a shop will be of particular interest
to the beginner, although the ``How to Buy Used Hand Tools''
article is somewhat questionable. Used hand tools, in my
experience, are either woefully abused or antiques or both.
</P>
<P>
   An article on buying hardwood lumber will answer a lot of the
newcomers' questions, and so will one on sandpaper. The tools
section is useful, although it does not cover the entire range of
tools; the techniques section is good as far as it goes but it
doesn't cover that most basic of all woodworking joints, the
mortise and tenon.
</P>
<P>
   What the beginner really wants to buy first is another Taunton
Press book, the one that established it as a pioneer in the field _
the first volume of Tage Frid's trilogy. It's called ``Tage Frid
Teaches Woodworking: Joinery _ Tools and Techniques.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the best book on woodworking ever published. It is
eminently readable; I really have never been sure whether Tage Frid
made the book or the book made Tage Frid. I got to know this truly
great man after the book was published, and I can assure you that
reading the book is exactly like listening to him talk.
</P>
<P>
   I wouldn't go so far as to say it's the only book on woodworking
you'll ever want or need, but I will assure you that if you read it
carefully and keep it by your bench, you will be able to build just
about any piece of furniture you desire.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Basics of Craftsmanship'' can serve as a useful
augmentation to Frid's work, but it won't replace it. I doubt
anything ever will.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Ingenious Jigs'' book is not another one of those tiresome
books for people who would rather spend their shoptime making shop
knicknacks than furniture. It deals primarily with major jigs such
as sliding crosscut sleds for the table saw, router tables and the
like. It's certainly worth the price.

 &HT;    Jenkins inspires with stories of `the Rapture'
 &HT;    By Gayle White
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ As a counselor at a Christian camp, Jerry Jenkins
relished opportunities to entertain and inspire his young minions
with stories of ``the Rapture,'' the time, many Christians believe,
when the faithful will be called into heaven leaving those on Earth
to deal with the end-times.
</P>
<P>
   Now Jenkins, 49, is co-author of a series of novels that has
enthralled the reading public with that same story, embellished and
updated.
</P>
<P>
   The series started in 1995 with ``Left Behind,'' which opened
with Capt. Rayford Steele flying a 747 across the Atlantic when
more than 100 of his passengers disappeared _ as, he learned later,
did his wife and son. In fact, millions of people all over the
globe vanished. Steele, his daughter and Buck Williams, a senior
writer for a newsmagazine, are Left Behind.
</P>
<P>
   This week, book six in the series, ``Assassins,'' hit bookstores
with an advance printing of 850,000 copies. ``Left Behind'' sales
are nearing 2 million, and ``Tribulation Force'' (1996) and
``Nicolae'' (1997) have each topped 1 million in sales. ``Soul
Harvest'' (1998) is a few sales shy of a million; ``Apollyon''
(1999) has sold more than 850,000. There are also ``Left Behind''
books for children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apollyon'' hit both The New York Times and the Publishers
Weekly list of best sellers for the general market. ``That's
unprecedented for a Christian novel,'' said Lynn Garrett, religion
editor of Publishers Weekly, a book industry trade magazine.
Garrett attributes the accomplishment to the success of the
previous books and to savvy marketing by publisher Tyndale House.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously the books have had appeal beyond the usual
audience,'' said Garrett. ``They're being read by people who aren't
evangelical Christians.''
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins will be in metro Atlanta today and Saturday for signings
at two bookstores, one Christian, one secular.
</P>
<P>
   Judy Brown, a community relations manager for Barnes &AMP; Noble in
Morrow, said the store invited the author because ``these are
enormously popular books. We're excited about his coming.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown read ``Left Behind'' in preparation for Jenkins' visit and
said she will probably read more. ``You get hooked on the series,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Store manager Emily Gulledge, 46, got hooked and read them all.
``Even if they didn't have the religious content, they would be
interesting books,'' said Gulledge, who says she was raised
Southern Baptist and has attended several different kinds of
churches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Me and my wife fight over who's going to read them first,''
said aircraft mechanic Bob Brown, 41, who lives in Milner and
attends Fairview Baptist Church in Brooks.
</P>
<P>
   For Jenkins, successful books are nothing new. He's written more
than 130 volumes, including co-authoring memoirs for Billy Graham,
Nolan Ryan and Orel Hershiser. His ``'Twas the Night Before,'' a
secular Christmas novel from Viking, has been sold to CBS for a
movie next year and he has a new Christian novel, ``Though None Go
With Me,'' due out from Zondervan in January. For readers who want
to keep up with it all, he also has a website:
www.jerryjenkins.com.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Left Behind'' books are the result of a match made by a
literary agent, Rick Christian of Alive Communications. Co-author
Tim LaHaye, a Bible prophecy expert, author of several non-fiction
Christian books, and part of a power evangelical partnership with
wife Beverly, founder of Concerned Women For America, had an idea:
a modern-day account of the events of the book of Revelation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that appealed to me about the project is that Tim
didn't want to ... help write it,'' said Jenkins. ``He provides the
prophetic chart and sequence of events. He serves as the expert on
prophecy. And he's proven to be a great cheerleader.''
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins, who was born and raised in a Christian home in
Kalamazoo, Mich., and spent his teenage years in Chicago, said he
``had always believed the way LaHaye did, although I wouldn't have
been able to justify it.''
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins said he felt good about the first ``Left Behind'' book
and thought it might sell as many as 200,000 copies. ``I didn't
tell too many people that,'' he said. ``It doesn't sound good to
predict.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the phenomenal sales of ``Left Behind'' and its sequels,
Jenkins says, ``It's just crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to what he attributes the success, Jenkins answers, ``The
great writing,'' but quickly adds, ``no, I'm just kidding.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Dr. LaHaye has it right,'' Jenkins said. ``Revelation
is so difficult to understand that by fictionalizing it, people are
fascinated. I think that's part of it. I think there's also a
general hunger for spiritual things in the market place. Look at
'Celestine Prophecy' and other New Age-type things. People seem to
be drawn to those. We feel like we get a chance to throw our answer
into the mix.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he and LaHaye are splitting millions in royalities,
``my life really hasn't changed much materially,'' said Jenkins,
who lives in Colorado Springs. ``I was raised in a tradition where
you're not comfortable with great amounts of income. We look for
places to use it for good because the Bible sort of teaches that
wealth can be a dangerous thing.''
</P>
<P>
   If he is a bit uncomfortable with the financial riches the books
have brought, he thoroughly enjoys the visibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd never seen people read my books on airplanes before,'' he
said. And as for book signings and public appearances, ``I really
love that part of it,'' he said. ``Writing is such a solitary
profession, I think it's good to get out and meet people. I've had
my share of those autograph parties where three people show up and
two of them are relatives. I kind of enjoy the crowds.''

<P>
   ``It used to be that trends lasted a decade, or at least five
years. Now they come and go every three months,'' said Calin
Riffle, a jewelry designer who also owns Anata, a New York apparel
and jewelry showroom.
</P>
<P>
   It is clear that trends have a shorter life span than they once
did. The reasons vary, but generally revolve around a culture
bombarded by media _ including the Internet _ by celebrity
influence and by the growth of television shows _ on networks and
on cable _ about fashion.
</P>
<P>
   While many teen-agers might love to see trendy new items in the
stores on a weekly basis, this can pose a huge problem for
retailers and manufacturers when the trend dies.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers often resort to markdowns or moving the merchandise to
their outlet stores, while manufacturers offer the goods to
retailers at reduced prices, or to outlet stores or off-pricers.
</P>
<P>
   Most people look to the media to tell them what trends to
follow, and teens are quick to try to emulate what young
celebrities are wearing.
</P>
<P>
   Dee Dee Gordon, editor of the L Report, published by Lambesis,
cites Cameron Diaz, Lauryn Hill and Jennifer Lopez as some of the
hour's more influential trendsetters.
</P>
<P>
   And in Japan, said Gordon, there is a Japanese pop star and
model who goes by the name of Angie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything she wears in a photograph or on television sells out
the next day (in Japan), both the exact item and any knockoffs,''
Gordon said.
</P>
<P>
   Tammy Greenman, women's buyer for The Junkman's Daughter, a
specialty store in Atlanta, reports the same phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a popular performing artist on MTV wears something,
everybody wants it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, she said, when the female lead singer of
Genitorturers appeared on the MTV Music Awards wearing Lip Service,
there were numerous requests for her outfit.
</P>
<P>
   But sometimes a trend dies on the selling floor. Greenman said
the Marc Jacobs-inspired pleated skirt was over before she got her
shipment in. They sold after being marked down.
</P>
<P>
   Even though celebrities may be setting the trends, there are
still many people who insist on individuality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fashion is broader now because people want some
individuality,'' said Larry Hansel, chief executive officer of
Rampage, a Los Angeles-based junior line.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers want to create their own looks by having more trends
to mix and match, so it's not all about just the India or the
hippie trend, he said. In fact, L Report's Gordon calls the look of
the moment ``anything goes.''
</P>
<P>
   But more than any other factor, advanced communication
technologies speed up trends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the '90s, people didn't have the same awareness. Now
there are 8 million magazines and the Internet. There's just more
stimulation,'' said Wendy Red, owner of Up Against the Wall, a
15-unit specialty store chain based in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   According to Red, today's teens are used to the fast pace; most
of her customers are looking for items to wear that same night.
</P>
<P>
   Red said she doesn't typically get stuck with dead stock, but
one trend she did bomb with was bleached stretch jeans. She said
she monitors inventory and marks down items immediately if they're
not moving fast enough. Things that just aren't selling are moved
to Up Against the Wall's discount warehouse, where some items sell
for as little as $1.99.
</P>
<P>
   Holly Fiene, design director for Los Angeles-based junior line
XOXO, said her customer shops every week. Some trends that bombed
for XOXO were skants and the whole Prada-influenced utility look.
</P>
<P>
   Fiene said they were just too early for her customer and that
both looks are starting to get publicity now.
</P>
<P>
   XOXO sends its dead stock to its three outlet stores: Two are in
Southern California and one is in New Jersey. They also sell to
Marshalls, Ross and TJ Maxx.
</P>
<P>
   Rampage sells its dead stock to Marshalls, or holds internal
sample sales in its parking lot, or donates them to charity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes a trend doesn't even last a season. By the time I
get it in, it's over,'' said Greenman, who finds long-lived trends
just as unnerving at her store. She cites, for example, chinos,
which have saturated the market and now bore her.
</P>
<P>
   ``When something is the key word at a show, when I hear it
everywhere, I get sick of it,'' Greenman said.
</P>
<P>
   She prefers a steadier pace, rather than some trends lasting two
years while others last two months.
</P>
<P>
   To cut down on dead stock, most retailers test merchandise. Up
Against the Wall's Red tried out skants in the spring, but either
too many manufacturers made them, or her customers hadn't seen them
enough in the media. She'll try them again in the fall, but doesn't
think they'll be especially meaningful.
</P>
<P>
   Other than testing, Red relies on gut instinct, and on being
totally aware of her market and the media through traveling, and
scouting clubs and trendy restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Greenman has her own kind of market research going. She'll carry
something if she can think of three people she knows who would wear
it.
</P>
<P>
   Online catalogs limit dead stock by functioning as test and
reorder businesses. Rather than forecasting, Karen Ngo, creative
and fashion director for Alloy, a junior Web site and online
catalog, is responding to what's selling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wait and see. We go out on the streets and see what kids
are wearing. The minute a trend stops selling, we drop it,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ngo also reports trends change faster than necessary. How long
the market says a trend should last may not coincide consumer
demand, as is the case with butterfly and dragonfly motifs. For
that reason, Alloy plans on doing more of its own product
development.
</P>
<P>
   For manufacturers, more trends mean more profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fashion is all about change, which works to our advantage.
Trends are essential to our success,'' said Jerry Friedman,
national sales manager for Dollhouse, a junior contemporary company
based in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Friedman says if a style or group isn't well received, it's
dropped immediately. He adds that the advantage of sourcing
domestically is that he doesn't have to take as many risks, such as
committing to large orders from overseas. He can also react quickly
once he finds out something is a hot seller.
</P>
<P>
   When Dollhouse has dead stock, it offers it to regular accounts
at closeout prices so retailers have a chance for margin-building
profits. They also sell to TJ Maxx and Loehmann's.
</P>
<P>
   XOXO's Fiene notes that if you want to keep selling, you must
keep up, or the consumer will think you're stale. Her goal is to be
the first to adapt a trend well once it hits the runway.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cover every trend, but in our way. For example, we revamped
the cargo to fit our sexy, feminine image. It's not about knocking
it off exactly,'' Fiene said.
</P>
<P>
   Dollhouse's Friedman calls his interpretations an ``edgy basic
with attitude.'' Rather than compete with the Gaps of the world,
Dollhouse tweaks basics with the latest styles and fabrics.
</P>
<P>
   Rampage's Hansel aspires to create the same combination, what he
calls ``the perfect marrying of the basic with the trend,'' the key
to his business. He adds that the more body types a trend suits,
the broader its customer base, which equals higher sales.
</P>
<P>
   To stay on top of trends, manufacturers rely on different
resources. Dollhouse employs students from the Fashion Institute of
Technology as scouts, while XOXO's design team travels to Europe
more than five times a year, looks through every magazine and
runway photo, and scours the streets of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't end with discovering a trend, though; manufacturers
must then guess its progression. Good examples are capri pants,
which evolved from 1998s slim version that fell right below the
knee, to this year's wide-leg, seven-eighths cut, and the shrug,
which evolved from the attached version to separates.
</P>
<P>
   According to XOXO's Fiene, newness is what sells. ``We may
approach a trend from a different angle. Like we'll change the
color on a Gucci-inspired Hawaiian print, but our goal is to move
on,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Some trends that manufacturers and retailers have moved on from
are baggy, urban styles inspired by hip-hop; wide-leg raver pants
with 30-40 inch cuffs; butterfly or fairy motifs; woven knits;
shrugs; futuristic/high tech looks; layers, and boot cuts.
</P>
<P>
   A few trends continue to do exceptionally well. Both Rampage and
Dollhouse report stretch is still No. 1, with at least 80 percent
to 90 percent of the lines incorporating spandex.
</P>
<P>
   Dollhouse's biggest sellers are dark denim, seven-eighths
trousers and tube tops and dresses.
</P>
<P>
   Hansel reports denim, Hawaiian prints, and anything with shine,
iridescence, metallic embellishment or glitter are Rampage's
strongest sellers this season.
</P>
<P>
   Moving away from solids, XOXO's biggest trends are Hawaiian
prints in stretch twill, embellished denim, paisley cotton prints
and lots of color. For styles, camisoles, halters and seven-eighths
pants sell well.
</P>
<P>
   Another big summer item is the backless apron top. Red reports
selling 100 to 200 tops a week from Maryland-based Gear Co. She
also does well with stretch denim; seven-eighths pants; stretch
wire chokers, and hair clips and barettes with rhinestones.
</P>
<P>
   Upcoming trends range from peasant to hippie to circus-inspired,
each fantasy-related and in vibrant colors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key word for fall and spring is `skin.' Once the baggy
look is over, you're going to see a lot more peekaboo tops, bare
shoulders, and open fronts and backs,'' Hansel said. Dresses will
make a big comeback, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the best item to show off all the prints for next
spring,'' Greenman said.
</P>
<P>
   For spring, Fiene plans to show lots of Pucci, paisley and
floral prints, plus Mexican and peasant ruffled looks and Indian
influence.
</P>
<P>
   Accessories will feature colored jewels and rhinestones,
feathers, mirrors, beading and crystals. Whether to run with
upcoming trends should depend on one's niche, says L Report's
Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids can smell out a phony from a mile away,'' she said.
``They know when someone is jumping on the bandwagon.''

   Fiene said they were just too early for her customer and that
both looks are starting to get publicity now.
</P>
<P>
   XOXO sends its dead stock to its three outlet stores: Two are in
Southern California and one is in New Jersey. They also sell to
Marshalls, Ross and TJ Maxx.
</P>
<P>
   Rampage sells its dead stock to Marshalls, or holds internal
sample sales in its parking lot, or donates them to charity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes a trend doesn't even last a season. By the time I
get it in, it's over,'' said Greenman, who finds long-lived trends
just as unnerving at her store. She cites, for example, chinos,
which have saturated the market and now bore her.
</P>
<P>
   ``When something is the key word at a show, when I hear it
everywhere, I get sick of it,'' Greenman said.
</P>
<P>
   She prefers a steadier pace, rather than some trends lasting two
years while others last two months.
</P>
<P>
   To cut down on dead stock, most retailers test merchandise. Up
Against the Wall's Red tried out skants in the spring, but either
too many manufacturers made them, or her customers hadn't seen them
enough in the media. She'll try them again in the fall, but doesn't
think they'll be especially meaningful.
</P>
<P>
   Other than testing, Red relies on gut instinct, and on being
totally aware of her market and the media through traveling, and
scouting clubs and trendy restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Greenman has her own kind of market research going. She'll carry
something if she can think of three people she knows who would wear
it.
</P>
<P>
   Online catalogs limit dead stock by functioning as test and
reorder businesses. Rather than forecasting, Karen Ngo, creative
and fashion director for Alloy, a junior Web site and online
catalog, is responding to what's selling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wait and see. We go out on the streets and see what kids
are wearing. The minute a trend stops selling, we drop it,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ngo also reports trends change faster than necessary. How long
the market says a trend should last may not coincide consumer
demand, as is the case with butterfly and dragonfly motifs. For
that reason, Alloy plans on doing more of its own product
development.
</P>
<P>
   For manufacturers, more trends mean more profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fashion is all about change, which works to our advantage.
Trends are essential to our success,'' said Jerry Friedman,
national sales manager for Dollhouse, a junior contemporary company
based in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Friedman says if a style or group isn't well received, it's
dropped immediately. He adds that the advantage of sourcing
domestically is that he doesn't have to take as many risks, such as
committing to large orders from overseas. He can also react quickly
once he finds out something is a hot seller.
</P>
<P>
   When Dollhouse has dead stock, it offers it to regular accounts
at closeout prices so retailers have a chance for margin-building
profits. They also sell to TJ Maxx and Loehmann's.
</P>
<P>
   XOXO's Fiene notes that if you want to keep selling, you must
keep up, or the consumer will think you're stale. Her goal is to be
the first to adapt a trend well once it hits the runway.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cover every trend, but in our way. For example, we revamped
the cargo to fit our sexy, feminine image. It's not about knocking
it off exactly,'' Fiene said.
</P>
<P>
   Dollhouse's Friedman calls his interpretations an ``edgy basic
with attitude.'' Rather than compete with the Gaps of the world,
Dollhouse tweaks basics with the latest styles and fabrics.
</P>
<P>
   Rampage's Hansel aspires to create the same combination, what he
calls ``the perfect marrying of the basic with the trend,'' the key
to his business. He adds that the more body types a trend suits,
the broader its customer base, which equals higher sales.
</P>
<P>
   To stay on top of trends, manufacturers rely on different
resources. Dollhouse employs students from the Fashion Institute of
Technology as scouts, while XOXO's design team travels to Europe
more than five times a year, looks through every magazine and
runway photo, and scours the streets of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't end with discovering a trend, though; manufacturers
must then guess its progression. Good examples are capri pants,
which evolved from 1998s slim version that fell right below the
knee, to this year's wide-leg, seven-eighths cut, and the shrug,
which evolved from the attached version to separates.
</P>
<P>
   According to XOXO's Fiene, newness is what sells. ``We may
approach a trend from a different angle. Like we'll change the
color on a Gucci-inspired Hawaiian print, but our goal is to move
on,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Some trends that manufacturers and retailers have moved on from
are baggy, urban styles inspired by hip-hop; wide-leg raver pants
with 30-40 inch cuffs; butterfly or fairy motifs; woven knits;
shrugs; futuristic/high tech looks; layers, and boot cuts.
</P>
<P>
   A few trends continue to do exceptionally well. Both Rampage and
Dollhouse report stretch is still No. 1, with at least 80 percent
to 90 percent of the lines incorporating spandex.
</P>
<P>
   Dollhouse's biggest sellers are dark denim, seven-eighths
trousers and tube tops and dresses.
</P>
<P>
   Hansel reports denim, Hawaiian prints, and anything with shine,
iridescence, metallic embellishment or glitter are Rampage's
strongest sellers this season.
</P>
<P>
   Moving away from solids, XOXO's biggest trends are Hawaiian
prints in stretch twill, embellished denim, paisley cotton prints
and lots of color. For styles, camisoles, halters and seven-eighths
pants sell well.
</P>
<P>
   Another big summer item is the backless apron top. Red reports
selling 100 to 200 tops a week from Maryland-based Gear Co. She
also does well with stretch denim; seven-eighths pants; stretch
wire chokers, and hair clips and barettes with rhinestones.
</P>
<P>
   Upcoming trends range from peasant to hippie to circus-inspired,
each fantasy-related and in vibrant colors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key word for fall and spring is `skin.' Once the baggy
look is over, you're going to see a lot more peekaboo tops, bare
shoulders, and open fronts and backs,'' Hansel said. Dresses will
make a big comeback, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the best item to show off all the prints for next
spring,'' Greenman said.
</P>
<P>
   For spring, Fiene plans to show lots of Pucci, paisley and
floral prints, plus Mexican and peasant ruffled looks and Indian
influence.
</P>
<P>
   Accessories will feature colored jewels and rhinestones,
feathers, mirrors, beading and crystals. Whether to run with
upcoming trends should depend on one's niche, says L Report's
Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids can smell out a phony from a mile away,'' she said.
``They know when someone is jumping on the bandwagon.''

   ``It used to be that trends lasted a decade, or at least five
years. Now they come and go every three months,'' said Calin
Riffle, a jewelry designer who also owns Anata, a New York apparel
and jewelry showroom.
</P>
<P>
   It is clear that trends have a shorter life span than they once
did. The reasons vary, but generally revolve around a culture
bombarded by media _ including the Internet _ by celebrity
influence and by the growth of television shows _ on networks and
on cable _ about fashion.
</P>
<P>
   While many teen-agers might love to see trendy new items in the
stores on a weekly basis, this can pose a huge problem for
retailers and manufacturers when the trend dies.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers often resort to markdowns or moving the merchandise to
their outlet stores, while manufacturers offer the goods to
retailers at reduced prices, or to outlet stores or off-pricers.
</P>
<P>
   Most people look to the media to tell them what trends to
follow, and teens are quick to try to emulate what young
celebrities are wearing.
</P>
<P>
   Dee Dee Gordon, editor of the L Report, published by Lambesis,
cites Cameron Diaz, Lauryn Hill and Jennifer Lopez as some of the
hour's more influential trendsetters.
</P>
<P>
   And in Japan, said Gordon, there is a Japanese pop star and
model who goes by the name of Angie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything she wears in a photograph or on television sells out
the next day (in Japan), both the exact item and any knockoffs,''
Gordon said.
</P>
<P>
   Tammy Greenman, women's buyer for The Junkman's Daughter, a
specialty store in Atlanta, reports the same phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a popular performing artist on MTV wears something,
everybody wants it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, she said, when the female lead singer of
Genitorturers appeared on the MTV Music Awards wearing Lip Service,
there were numerous requests for her outfit.
</P>
<P>
   But sometimes a trend dies on the selling floor. Greenman said
the Marc Jacobs-inspired pleated skirt was over before she got her
shipment in. They sold after being marked down.
</P>
<P>
   Even though celebrities may be setting the trends, there are
still many people who insist on individuality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fashion is broader now because people want some
individuality,'' said Larry Hansel, chief executive officer of
Rampage, a Los Angeles-based junior line.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers want to create their own looks by having more trends
to mix and match, so it's not all about just the India or the
hippie trend, he said. In fact, L Report's Gordon calls the look of
the moment ``anything goes.''
</P>
<P>
   But more than any other factor, advanced communication
technologies speed up trends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the '90s, people didn't have the same awareness. Now
there are 8 million magazines and the Internet. There's just more
stimulation,'' said Wendy Red, owner of Up Against the Wall, a
15-unit specialty store chain based in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   According to Red, today's teens are used to the fast pace; most
of her customers are looking for items to wear that same night.
</P>
<P>
   Red said she doesn't typically get stuck with dead stock, but
one trend she did bomb with was bleached stretch jeans. She said
she monitors inventory and marks down items immediately if they're
not moving fast enough. Things that just aren't selling are moved
to Up Against the Wall's discount warehouse, where some items sell
for as little as $1.99.
</P>
<P>
   Holly Fiene, design director for Los Angeles-based junior line
XOXO, said her customer shops every week. Some trends that bombed
for XOXO were skants and the whole Prada-influenced utility look.
</P>
<P>
   Fiene said they were just too early for her customer and that
both looks are starting to get publicity now.
</P>
<P>
   XOXO sends its dead stock to its three outlet stores: Two are in
Southern California and one is in New Jersey. They also sell to
Marshalls, Ross and TJ Maxx.
</P>
<P>
   Rampage sells its dead stock to Marshalls, or holds internal
sample sales in its parking lot, or donates them to charity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes a trend doesn't even last a season. By the time I
get it in, it's over,'' said Greenman, who finds long-lived trends
just as unnerving at her store. She cites, for example, chinos,
which have saturated the market and now bore her.
</P>

   She prefers a steadier pace, rather than some trends lasting two
years while others last two months.

too many manufacturers made them, or her customers hadn't seen them

scouting clubs and trendy restaurants.

 By STEPHEN L. COHEN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    As the gun battles continue to rage in the schools, on the
streets and in the fractious House of Representatives, something is
missing. Amid all the emotional rancor, something has gotten lost
in the controversy.
 &HT;    In a bygone era, they used to call it horse-sense. Today, in the
absence of any sense whatsoever, all that's left is the artful
dodge.
 &HT;    Throughout the debate so far, reason has been trumped by
strident hyperbole. But it need not be this way. It would be
helpful to approach the issue of gun mortality from a more clinical
perspective, taking a cue from the medical community, which deals
with death and morbidity all the time.
 &HT;    Perhaps if we saw the issue for what it really is -- a public
health calamity -- we could bring all the power and insight of
modern medicine to bear on the problem.
 &HT;    The first step in the search for a ``cure'' to the gun malady is
to identify potential causes of the problem. Then, as with any
medical condition, public health authorities could begin to test
their theories. But we can't test any theories -- or even gather
useful information Q- when special interest groups obstruct the
search for solutions.
 &HT;    At a time when additional research is urgently needed, the gun
lobby has called for the elimination of the National Center for
Injury Prevention and Control (NCIPC), a division of the Centers
for Disease Control. The NCIPC has spearheaded much of the nation's
research on gun mortality, but the National Rifle Association
claims that the center has shown an ``almost vicious sentiment
against personal firearms ownership.''
 &HT;    Though scientists have been known to disagree with CDC findings,
in recent memory, no other organization has ever accused the CDC of
being ``vicious'' in its approach. It's a curious charge, given the
CDC's mission to save lives, but it's entirely consistent with the
NRA's desire to protect the status quo regarding gun ownership in
America.
 &HT;    While the CDC may have focused unwanted attention on gun
violence, it has also stressed a vital message: that further
research is needed to shed light on the causes of firearms
mortality.
 &HT;    In contrast, bitter rivals on both sides of the debate have
insisted that either the media or the gun lobby is to blame for the
epidemic of violence sweeping the nation.
 &HT;    Not surprisingly, gun-control advocates target the firearms
industry while the NRA draws a huge bulls-eye on the foreheads of
media moguls. Apparently, neither side has considered another
option: Why not fire a few shots in both directions?
 &HT;    Of course, hitting something useful is precisely the goal of
scientific research, but it's hard to hit anything useful when your
eyes are closed. It seems safe to assume that the NRA would agree
with this notion. The Motion Picture Association of America, which
is fighting legislation to create a commission on youth violence,
needs its eyes pried open as well.
 &HT;    A good scientist would want to start his inquiry by examining
the existing body of data on gun mortality. Although we still have
much to learn about the causes of gun violence, certain trends are
already emerging from existing research. Substantial data, for
example, indicates that gun-related deaths are a major pediatric
health problem in the U.S. In fact, firearm-related injuries are
the second leading cause of death in children.
 &HT;    Every year, more than 5,000 children die as a result of gun
homicides, suicides and unintentional shootings, and 20,000 more
are wounded. Accidental gun injuries account for almost 1,500
pediatric emergency room visits annually, and in 1994, nearly 200
children were killed in this manner.
 &HT;    Because of such staggering statistics, the American Academy of
Pediatrics has called for aggressive action to reduce the danger of
firearms to young people, including the removal of handguns from
households with children. The AAP has even called for a ban on the
manufacture, sale and private possession of handguns.
 &HT;    The nation's baby doctors aren't alone. In 1998, the Annals of
Internal Medicine reported that 94 percent of internists and 87
percent of surgeons believe that firearm violence is a major public
health issue. The journal also reported that a majority of doctors
surveyed support efforts to enact legislation to restrict the
possession or sale of handguns.
 &HT;    NRA president Charlton Heston probably doesn't agree. But the
NRA leader would be well advised to approach the problem as a
serious public health issue. If he really cares about the nation's
pediatric population, he'll try to think like a healthcare
provider: he'll analyze the available data and make an informed
decision that puts the interest of the patient before all other
concerns (like, for instance, the right to shoot animals).
 &HT;    If Heston could think like a doctor, he'd make the right
decision. Doctors must constantly make choices based on limited
data, since there's so little certainty in the practice of
medicine.
 &HT;    The trick is to make intelligent decisions that reduce
significant risks to the patient. And in the case of handguns, the
most conservative approach (clinically, if not politically) is to
err on the side of caution.
 &HT;    This means more than just putting safety locks on guns, but it
is telling that the NRA has resisted even this minimal treatment
for the gun malady. In 1997, when handgun manufacturers announced a
voluntary program to include trigger locks with new guns to help
reduce firearms injuries, the NRA immediately denounced the
measure. This was not exactly what one would call a ``clinical''
approach to the issue.
 &HT;    The basic problem is that the gun lobby, unlike the medical
establishment, has other priorities: reducing gun fatalities is
ultimately less important than protecting the right of gun owners
to have unfettered access to their weapons. This explains why the
NRA has fought virtually every effort to strengthen the barriers
between weapons and kids.
 &HT;    In its defense, the gun lobby consistently repeats the same
argument like a mantra: improve enforcement of existing laws and
the problem will go away. While better law enforcement is certainly
a worthwhile goal, major public health issues are rarely resolved
by narrowly focused efforts. Systemic, comprehensive solutions are
often required, especially when complex social factors are
involved.
 &HT;    Clearly, any solution that improves the odds for America's youth
-- from child safety locks to restricted access to handguns Q-will
entail some sacrifice on the part of gun owners. But it doesn't
take a brain surgeon to see that it's impossible to reduce the
risks to children without somehow reducing access to guns.
 &HT;    The question is, are gun owners up to the challenge? Are they
willing to do more than simply rely on existing laws? If they're
sincere in their desire to save lives, why not take a more
ambitious approach? Why not use all the tools at our disposal to
protect the nation's children?
 &HT;    That's how a doctor would approach the problem -- he'd do
everything possible to stack the odds in favor of the patient. One
can only hope that the gun lobby will take a similar approach.

 By STEPHEN L. COHEN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    As the gun battles continue to rage in the schools, on the
streets and in the fractious House of Representatives, something is
missing. Amid all the emotional rancor, something has gotten lost
in the controversy.
 &HT;    In a bygone era, they used to call it horse-sense. Today, in the
absence of any sense whatsoever, all that's left is the artful
dodge.
 &HT;    Throughout the debate so far, reason has been trumped by
strident hyperbole. But it need not be this way. It would be
helpful to approach the issue of gun mortality from a more clinical
perspective, taking a cue from the medical community, which deals
with death and morbidity all the time.
 &HT;    Perhaps if we saw the issue for what it really is -- a public
health calamity -- we could bring all the power and insight of
modern medicine to bear on the problem.
 &HT;    The first step in the search for a ``cure'' to the gun malady is
to identify potential causes of the problem. Then, as with any
medical condition, public health authorities could begin to test
their theories. But we can't test any theories -- or even gather
useful information Q- when special interest groups obstruct the
search for solutions.
 &HT;    At a time when additional research is urgently needed, the gun
lobby has called for the elimination of the National Center for
Injury Prevention and Control (NCIPC), a division of the Centers
for Disease Control. The NCIPC has spearheaded much of the nation's
research on gun mortality, but the National Rifle Association
claims that the center has shown an ``almost vicious sentiment
against personal firearms ownership.''
 &HT;    Though scientists have been known to disagree with CDC findings,
in recent memory, no other organization has ever accused the CDC of
being ``vicious'' in its approach. It's a curious charge, given the
CDC's mission to save lives, but it's entirely consistent with the
NRA's desire to protect the status quo regarding gun ownership in
America.
 &HT;    While the CDC may have focused unwanted attention on gun
violence, it has also stressed a vital message: that further
research is needed to shed light on the causes of firearms
mortality.
 &HT;    In contrast, bitter rivals on both sides of the debate have
insisted that either the media or the gun lobby is to blame for the
epidemic of violence sweeping the nation.
 &HT;    Not surprisingly, gun-control advocates target the firearms
industry while the NRA draws a huge bulls-eye on the foreheads of
media moguls. Apparently, neither side has considered another
option: Why not fire a few shots in both directions?
 &HT;    Of course, hitting something useful is precisely the goal of
scientific research, but it's hard to hit anything useful when your
eyes are closed. It seems safe to assume that the NRA would agree
with this notion. The Motion Picture Association of America, which
is fighting legislation to create a commission on youth violence,
needs its eyes pried open as well.
 &HT;    A good scientist would want to start his inquiry by examining
the existing body of data on gun mortality. Although we still have
much to learn about the causes of gun violence, certain trends are
already emerging from existing research. Substantial data, for
example, indicates that gun-related deaths are a major pediatric
health problem in the U.S. In fact, firearm-related injuries are
the second leading cause of death in children.
 &HT;    Every year, more than 5,000 children die as a result of gun
homicides, suicides and unintentional shootings, and 20,000 more
are wounded. Accidental gun injuries account for almost 1,500
pediatric emergency room visits annually, and in 1994, nearly 200
children were killed in this manner.
 &HT;    Because of such staggering statistics, the American Academy of
Pediatrics has called for aggressive action to reduce the danger of
firearms to young people, including the removal of handguns from
households with children. The AAP has even called for a ban on the
manufacture, sale and private possession of handguns.
 &HT;    The nation's baby doctors aren't alone. In 1998, the Annals of
Internal Medicine reported that 94 percent of internists and 87
percent of surgeons believe that firearm violence is a major public
health issue. The journal also reported that a majority of doctors
surveyed support efforts to enact legislation to restrict the
possession or sale of handguns.
 &HT;    NRA president Charlton Heston probably doesn't agree. But the
NRA leader would be well advised to approach the problem as a
serious public health issue. If he really cares about the nation's
pediatric population, he'll try to think like a healthcare
provider: he'll analyze the available data and make an informed
decision that puts the interest of the patient before all other
concerns (like, for instance, the right to shoot animals).
 &HT;    If Heston could think like a doctor, he'd make the right
decision. Doctors must constantly make choices based on limited
data, since there's so little certainty in the practice of
medicine.
 &HT;    The trick is to make intelligent decisions that reduce
significant risks to the patient. And in the case of handguns, the
most conservative approach (clinically, if not politically) is to
err on the side of caution.
 &HT;    This means more than just putting safety locks on guns, but it
is telling that the NRA has resisted even this minimal treatment
for the gun malady. In 1997, when handgun manufacturers announced a
voluntary program to include trigger locks with new guns to help
reduce firearms injuries, the NRA immediately denounced the
measure. This was not exactly what one would call a ``clinical''
approach to the issue.
 &HT;    The basic problem is that the gun lobby, unlike the medical
establishment, has other priorities: reducing gun fatalities is
ultimately less important than protecting the right of gun owners
to have unfettered access to their weapons. This explains why the
NRA has fought virtually every effort to strengthen the barriers
between weapons and kids.
 &HT;    In its defense, the gun lobby consistently repeats the same
argument like a mantra: improve enforcement of existing laws and
the problem will go away. While better law enforcement is certainly
a worthwhile goal, major public health issues are rarely resolved
by narrowly focused efforts. Systemic, comprehensive solutions are
often required, especially when complex social factors are
involved.
 &HT;    Clearly, any solution that improves the odds for America's youth
-- from child safety locks to restricted access to handguns Q-will
entail some sacrifice on the part of gun owners. But it doesn't
take a brain surgeon to see that it's impossible to reduce the
risks to children without somehow reducing access to guns.
 &HT;    The question is, are gun owners up to the challenge? Are they
willing to do more than simply rely on existing laws? If they're
sincere in their desire to save lives, why not take a more
ambitious approach? Why not use all the tools at our disposal to
protect the nation's children?
 &HT;    That's how a doctor would approach the problem -- he'd do
everything possible to stack the odds in favor of the patient. One
can only hope that the gun lobby will take a similar approach.

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   What does it take to win an election? First you must establish
name identification, viability, and a ``vision.'' Then you must
lower the media's expectations, rebut charges of pandering and
profligacy, and fend off attacks on your character.
</P>
<P>
   What does it take to launch a magazine successfully? As Talk
Editor Tina Brown demonstrated this week, the answer is: pretty
much the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   --NAME IDENTIFICATION. Having served in two high-profile offices
over the past 15 years (Vanity Fair and The New Yorker), Brown was
well positioned for a run at Talk. She scored an early publicity
coup by getting Hillary Clinton to appear in the magazine at its
debut. But Brown also benefited from a gaffe by her opponent, New
York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who responded to Clinton's appearance by
banishing Talk's launch party from a city-owned site. His attack on
Brown made the front pages of the New York tabloids, giving Talk a
free media hit.
</P>
<P>
   --PANDERING. Many editors, like politicians, broaden their
audience by appealing to the public's lowest instincts--and, like
politicians, are accused of pandering. The rap on Brown is that
she's ``vapid'' and ``shallow,'' and her magazine is ``fluff'' and
``froth.'' A parody Web site calls Talk ``Chatter! Banter! Emotion!
Solipsism! Pretense!'' As often happens in campaigns, Brown
suffered an embarrassing defection last month, when writer Walter
Kirn quit and told the press he had been saddled with ``celebrity
profile assignments.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown's surrogates have replied that a good editor, like a good
politician, must toss a bit of red meat to the crowd now and then
to sustain her popularity and her movement.
</P>
<P>
   But Brown, like Dan Quayle, has lent credence to her caricature.
She has told the press that her editorial knack lies in being
``easily bored'' and that the problem with celebrity hype is that
it's ``dull.'' Faced with the charge that she's ``lowbrow,'' Brown
has espoused a ``high-low'' formula under which Talk will endeavor,
according to one staffer, ``to balance the higher-brow stuff and
the trashier stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown's critics have also circulated her quote that magazines
should ``be places where people can picnic intellectually.'' These
comments create an impression of flippancy and flip-flopping, which
bolsters the argument that Brown lacks conviction.
</P>
<P>
   --VISION. The best way to deflect charges of pandering and
flip-flopping is to articulate an essential message or ``vision.''
Brown constantly boasts that Talk has a ``point of view.'' But when
called upon to define it, she speaks of a ``look,'' a ``tone,'' and
an ``atmosphere.''
</P>
<P>
   Talk, she told th Wall Street Journal, is ``about
expressing--without encumbrance of any kind--a vision, in a sense,
of the times that we are in.'' She comes off sounding like
President Bush, whose ruminations on ``the vision thing'' convinced
everyone that he recognized the importance of having a vision but
didn't quite know what the word meant.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Brown speaks often of her ``passion'' and ``desire''
for good writing. Message: I care.
</P>
<P>
   --CHARACTER. Some of Brown's opponents have gone negative,
calling her ``ruthless'' and tyrannical. She seems unsure whether
to stay on message--``The dogs bark and the caravan moves on,'' she
told London's Sunday Telegraph--or to make negative campaigning an
issue. While her surrogates decry the ``long knives'' arrayed
against her, Brown accuses her rivals of ``blood sport.''
</P>
<P>
   At times, she plays to the center, projecting kindness and
tolerance: ``I don't understand this fear thing. I'm not
vindictive.'' At other times, she plays to her base, wearing her
enemies' scorn as a badge of honor: ``I've fired a lot of people
and killed a lot (of copy). I don't make friends that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Like any smart politician, Brown spins the attacks on her as
evidence of her formidability. As New York Post columnist Liz Smith
puts it, ``What is it about her that scares the rest of the
press?''
</P>
<P>
   Brown also has a Clintonian streak that threatens to escalate
pandering into a character issue. Bill Clinton pitches himself as
the man who feels your pain. Brown pitches Talk as the magazine of
``intimacy,'' starting with its cover story, ``The Intimate
Hillary,'' in which the first lady divulges her ``feelings'' about
her husband's infidelities.
</P>
<P>
   The consensus among political pundits is that whether Brown used
Mrs. Clinton, vice versa, or both, the whole thing was
``calculated'' rather than intimate. Brown's assertions that the
piece plumbs the ``depth'' of the Clintons' ``shared passions'' and
``spiritual intensity'' add to the impression that she's more
interested in advertising intimacy than in achieving it.
</P>
<P>
   --FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY. The old rap on Brown was that she spent
wastefully and ran up big deficits at The New Yorker. Brown's spin
is that she cut the deficit: ``When I arrived, it was losing money,
and when I left, it was losing less money.'' But the old rap has
been overtaken by a new rap--that Brown is fielding a ``B team'' of
writers because she's no longer paying top rates. Meanwhile, the
hard-times ethic of fiscal austerity has given way to a good-times
ethic of ``invest and grow,'' which frowns on frugality.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's successor at The New Yorker, David Remnick, is
criticized for being ``weak on the buzz factor,''` ``sheepish''
about courting fashion designers, and addicted to ``earnest
seriousness.'' A colleague likens Remnick's avoidance of limousine
service to President Carter's despised modesty.
</P>
<P>
   --EXPECTATIONS. An editor, like a candidate, must limit
expectations so that she can impress everyone by exceeding them.
Brown has done so. A week ago, the hype about Talk had spent
itself. ``Expectation is so high that her enemies are already
predicting the biggest let-down since Eyes Wide Shut,'' crowed the
Telegraph. New York's Daily News said critics were predicting a
``gigantic fizzle.''
</P>
<P>
   But by the time the magazine came out, the backlash, too, had
spent itself. According to Time, ``the correct attitude'' prior to
Talk's debut ``was to be sick of it already without having seen it.
But Brown has created something that shouts READ ME.''
</P>
<P>
   And being read, ultimately, is the name of the game.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine market is less like a general election, in which
the candidate with the higher negative rating always loses, than
like a crowded primary, in which the fight for attention is
crucial, and it's worth alienating some people in order to attract
others. The more Brown is attacked, the better she does.
</P>
<P>
   When Giuliani vetoed Talk's party site and told the press it was
``unimportant'' and ``irrelevant,'' all he did was make the
magazine important and relevant.
</P>
<P>
   The Journal put the point succinctly to Brown: ``Is any
publicity good publicity?'' She answered: ``People are rarely
indifferent to the magazines I've put out. Sometimes they hate it,
but they are engaged.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, yes.

<P>
   In bad times, ``outsider'' candidates run against the economic
status quo. In good times, it seems they strain to do exactly the
same thing. Probably the most distinct theme to emerge thus far
among the leading challengers to quasi-incumbent Al Gore in the
2000 presidential race is that the material wealth of America in
the 1990s has brought with it a sense of spiritual discontent.
</P>
<P>
   The official slogan of the George W. Bush campaign is
``Prosperity With a Purpose,'' which W. explains by pointing out
that ``prosperity alone is simple materialism.''
</P>
<P>
   In his ``armies of compassion'' address in Indianapolis, he
elaborated a bit more. ``The invisible hand works many miracles,''
Bush said. ``But it cannot touch the human heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley has been saying essentially the same thing. On
``Meet the Press'' Sunday, Tim Russert asked Bradley to identify
the biggest problem confronting American society in the next
century. Bradley cited two issues: race and the lack of meaning.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is something that's going on in the country that is
widely felt, and that is people searching for some meaning in their
life that is deeper than the material,'' he said. ``I think that
that is a profound reaction to the materialism of our time and to
the hollowness of life if you're only interested in material
things.''
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to disagree with such sentiments, but it's even harder
to understand why Bush and Bradley are turning them into focuses of
their campaigns. Don't they remember Jimmy Carter's malaise speech?
Don't they remember Hillary Clinton's ``politics of meaning''
fiasco? Americans tend to be allergic to politicians' dabbling in
vague spiritual criticism, and for good reason. We're electing
someone to run the government, not minister to the condition of our
souls.
</P>
<P>
   You also have to wonder just whose feelings these guys are
trying to voice. Even in flush times like these, it's hard to
imagine that a large segment of the electorate feels burdened by
the spiritual side effects of excessive wealth. While presidential
candidates spend a good deal of time among people with too much
money on their hands (they're called thousand dollar contributors),
this is surely not a significant voting block.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps such comments are intended less for those who feel
afflicted by this particular form of ennui than for the larger
group capable of resenting the rich. On this reading, denouncing
the spiritual fallout of excess wealth is a sophisticated variety
of economic populism tailored to an audience of people who fully
hope to get rich themselves. Like greed, materialism is a vice that
tends to afflict those with more money than oneself.
</P>
<P>
   The problem isn't money. It's the values of people who have
money. Here the multimillionaires Bradley and Bush may have
stumbled upon something rather clever: a kind of rich candidate's
class warfare. Shunning shallow materialism is a way to express
contempt for the upper class while being a member of the upper
class.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the candidates are going to have trouble pulling this
off. The last rich president to benefit from class warfare was
Franklin Roosevelt. FDR could do this not just because of his sense
of noblesse oblige but because he had policies to propose that
would rein in the rich. Bush and Bradley don't have any practical
suggestions. Instead of taxing and regulating the ``malefactors of
great wealth'' into submission, they merely suggest we feel sorry
for them.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore hasn't said anything about empty materialism yet, so he
still may have a chance to differentiate himself. If I were he, I
think I'd respond by saying that excessive prosperity is now a
problem for just a few--and that the next president should see to
it that it afflicts as many of us as possible.

<P>
   LONDON _ The sun will vanish. Air will chill. The birds will
fall silent. The grid will lock.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday morning at 11:11 (6:11 a.m. Eastern Time), the sky
over the fingerlike jut of southwestern Britain known as Cornwall
will darken as the moon briefly blots the sun.
</P>
<P>
   The last solar eclipse of the millennium will last only about
two minutes, but it's arrival has been keenly awaited _ or dreaded
_ by the inhabitants of the rugged, remote region for more than a
year.
</P>
<P>
   And as it is with Big Events these days, the eclipse brings with
it the increasingly familiar mix of commerce and consternation.
</P>
<P>
   While it will be visible elsewhere in England _ and indeed as
far away as Pakistan but not North America _ nowhere will the
eclipse produce a more striking affect, weather permitting, than
Cornwall. The Path of Totality _ not the title of a self-help book
but instead the narrow band of the moon's most intense shadow _
will cut directly across the region producing within 15 minutes the
experience of sunset and sunrise.
</P>
<P>
   And nowhere will it touch a place so rich in history, myths and
magic. Cornwall is full of religious monuments and other little
understood curiosities that predate the Romans. This is the
supposed land both of King Arthur and the Druids. Merlin the wizard
is said to have been born under such a darkened sky here near the
end of the First Century.
</P>
<P>
   If predictions hold true, a little magic may be needed to cope
with the throngs of eclipse chasers expected descend on the quaint
green and largely undeveloped region.
</P>
<P>
   More than six times the normal summer holiday traffic is
expected to jam the region's already overtaxed highways. Police are
warning that gridlock is nearly inevitable and advise travelers to
stay away from the roads during peak times and to carry bicycles to
get around. The last total eclipse in Britain, in 1927, attracted
more than 3 million people to Yorkshire in Northern England. At
least 1 million are expected in Cornwall.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the hassle of so many people, some local
officials are fearful about the historic sites. Mike Rosendale, an
official with the Penwith district council, is worried about the
influx of alternative groups
</P>
<P>
   that place special significance to the eclipse and its passage
through what is seen as a mystically rich land.
</P>
<P>
   ``This area has the highest concentration of prehistoric
monuments in Western Europe and the eclipse and the Millennium are
disaster for them,'' Rosendale said. ``They have never been under
so much pressure, never faced this level of threat for 4,000
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, about 30,000 acres near Penzance have been sealed
off to protect monuments. Additional police and military forces
will be on alert during the week.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Norfolk, a member of an organization called the Pagan
Federation, believes these concerns are exaggerated. Norfolk has
been on the speaking circuit for months warning fellow pagans to
behave themselves. ``It is the most important event for pagans this
decade,'' he said. ``The Millennium has no significance for us, but
an eclipse sees the major symbols of paganism coming together,
where masculine and feminine forces are balanced and it is a time
for great chance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We want people to avoid lighting fires, burying things or
doing things with candles,'' Norfolk said.
</P>
<P>
   Bed-and-breakfasts, hotels and even spare rooms are largely
booked up. Many are demanding minimum stays of five days. As many
as 100,000 sea vessels are expected to gather near the coast,
causing concerns about conflicts with commercial shipping lanes.
</P>
<P>
   Another major fear here is that people will stare at the moon
and sun causing severe eye damage. The World Health Organization
last week warned about the dangers. After a 1970 solar eclipse, 145
people reported serious cases of sight loss. After the 1980
eclipse, there were 112 such cases.
</P>
<P>
   While a source of consternation for many, such an event is
mother's milk to entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Barlow, a local former waiter turned businessman, is
banking on getting his share of the mystical margin.
</P>
<P>
   With his brother Ian, Barlow over the past 18 months has snapped
up rooms, cottages and condos, organized train expeditions and even
chartered a supersonic Concorde for high-rolling eclipse hounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even my initial reaction to the eclipse was 'so what?' until I
found out more,'' Barlow said. ``It's been the equivalent of
Cornwall trying to organize the Olympic Games.''
</P>
<P>
   For others, the significance is even more universal. Robin Cole
of the Gloucestershire UFO enthusiasts group Circular Forum thinks
the eclipse could catch the attention of observers from other
galaxies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 1991 eclipse visible from Mexico City marked the dawn of a
new era in UFO sightings in the area,'' Cole told the
Gloucestershire Echo. ``Thousands of people standing to watch the
eclipse saw and photographed a UFO hovering over the city. Who
knows if the same thing could happen here?''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Story can end here. Optional add follows &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The aliens would be treated to a rare treat. A total eclipse
occurs when the moon's orbit places it precisely between the Earth
and the sun. The sun travels faster across the sky than the moon
and as it passes behind the moon the sun is blotted out, casting a
shadow over the Earth. The temperature drops, the wind kicks up and
birds sensing nightfall cease their songs.
</P>
<P>
   A journalist for the Daily Express described the 1929 eclipse _
which last 15 seconds compared to the more than two minutes
predicted Wednesday _ this way: ``I caught my breath as I looked
up. The gray shadows near men were really men and women but they
looked like ghosts. Their faces were dry and dead. This, I thought,
is what it must be like to be dead _ gray colorless and quiet, all
standing together in an unearthly light, waiting, rather
frightened.''
</P>
<P>
   But missing this eclipse needn't be the end of the world. North
America will be visited by a total eclipse on Aug. 21, 2017, and
the phenomenon will come again to Britain in 2090. Book early.

DAY TRADING IS FOR SUCKERS
</HEADLINE>
  (Slate commentary)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JAMES SUROWIECKI &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of last week's shootings at two day-trading firms in
Atlanta, a spokesman for one of the companies said that these firms
did a good job of warning prospective clients of the risks day
trading entails and added that if clients followed the rules the
company laid out, day trading was both easy and profitable.
</P>
<P>
   Now, easy it may be, although spending six and a half hours
staring at a computer screen isn't my idea of fun. (Which makes you
wonder why I'm a writer.) But profitable day trading certainly
isn't, and the current mania for it is less a reflection of the
moneymaking opportunities it offers than of the allure of easy
credit and the seemingly unstoppable conviction of all gamblers
that the house can be beaten.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers are by this point well known, but they're no less
staggering for all that. Most estimates suggest that 80 to 90
percent of all day traders lose money. And that's in absolute
terms: These people leave their day trading careers with less money
than they had when they started.
</P>
<P>
   Those statistics say nothing about how many day traders lose
money in relative terms, which is to say underperform the S&AMP;P 500.
(If you do worse than an index fund, you're effectively losing
money, because you can invest in an index fund with no labor or
opportunity cost at all.)
</P>
<P>
   It's probably safe to say that less than 5 percent of day
traders are successful, even without considering the opportunity
cost of all the time and energy they have to put into their
trading.
</P>
<P>
   This is not, needless to say, surprising. Day trading is
predicated on a fundamental misconception about the nature of stock
prices, namely that they are somehow persistent and predictable.
</P>
<P>
   Now, some interesting academic studies in recent years have
called into question the idea that stock prices move only in a pure
random walk (i.e., they're as likely to go up as go down at any one
moment).
</P>
<P>
   But the walk is effectively random, in the sense that patterns
are incredibly hard to discern and basically impossible to take
advantage of with any regularity. In order to succeed as a day
trader over time, you have to be one thing: incredibly lucky.
</P>
<P>
   The media sort of gets this. But the attacks on day trading have
gotten too mixed up with concerns about the impact of online
brokerages, the rise of individual investing, and the mania for Net
stocks. These are distinct phenomena, and have nothing to do with
what's wrong with day trading.
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, the impact of day trading on stock prices is
negligible, and although the rise of the 'Net has facilitated day
trading, in fact day trading as it's done at firms such as All-Tech
and Momentum looks more like old investing than new investing.
</P>
<P>
   The people who profit from day trading are not the day traders,
but the firms that reap huge commissions from all the trading, just
as old-line brokers tended to encourage people to trade to increase
churn in their accounts and boost commissions.
</P>
<P>
   The thing that is most remarkable about day trading, though, is
the almost complete absence of a coherent investment theory that
could justify the practice.
</P>
<P>
   If you read Warren Buffett or Peter Lynch or John Burr Williams,
you get a clear sense of the principles that guide their investing.
But if you talk to day traders and try to figure out why they
believe they can beat the market, you don't get any real ideas. You
just get a host of anecdotes about great trades. The press has
exacerbated this problem by including in every article about day
trading at least one character who says he's made hundreds of
thousands of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   How he did it and why he doesn't get up from the table and walk
away always remain unexplained.
</P>
<P>
   Let's face it. If you go into any casino, there's going to be
someone there who's up many thousands of dollars. That may help us
understand why people keep gambling. It doesn't help explain what
gambling really means economically.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, it's crucial to remember that day traders have the
dubious advantage of playing with the house's money, since most
firms will lend them up to 50 percent of their existing capital to
buy more stocks with. That has two consequences: It increases risk,
and it makes day traders' performance even less impressive. If
you're wagering 150 percent as much money as you have, the profits
when you succeed will be greater than otherwise. But so will be
your losses.
</P>
<P>
   What day traders need to ask themselves is: If I had put 150
percent of my money in an index fund, what would my returns have
been?
</P>
<P>
   But if they could ask themselves that question, they wouldn't be
day traders.

   CONGRESS-RECESS (Washington) _ With its tax cut behind it,
Congress left for its August recess today setting the stage for a
high stakes autumn confrontation with President Clinton over what
should be the nation's fiscal policies in an era of budget
surpluses. That battle is the most far-reaching of many
ideologically charged policy disputes to come in the fall, also
setting the stage for a high stakes election battle. Other issues
on the agenda for the fall are health care, gun control, campaign
finance reform and the question now is whether there will be a
season of compromise or continued partisan strife. By Alison
Mitchell.

 &HT;    STATES FEAR FLOOD OF NEW YORK GARBAGE
 &HT;    1150&AMP;add. With GARBAGE-OHIO. For release Sunday, Aug. 8.
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The effect of New York City's decision to close its
Fresh Kills landfill, a 50-year-old, 3,000-acre mound of garbage on
Staten Island, is spreading through neighboring states like a bad
smell.
</P>
<P>
   Without Fresh Kills, which is scheduled to close Dec. 31, 2001,
the only way the city can get rid of the 13,000 tons of residential
garbage it generates every day is by shipping it elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   As Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Gov. George Pataki search for
fresh fields for garbage now going to Fresh Kills _ the largest
active landfill on Earth _ state officials as far south as North
Carolina and as far west as Ohio and Indiana wait nervously.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing convoys of big trucks loaded with what rots and stinks
from New York, state legislatures are passing laws to ban or
restrict out-of-state garbage _ and bills have been introduced in
Congress to overturn a Supreme Court decision declaring such state
laws unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   A Senate bill, introduced by a first-term Republican, George
Voinovich of Ohio, has been assigned to the Environment and Natural
Resources Committee, whose chairman has expressed strong
reservations about the bill. Voinovich says he still hopes the
panel will approve the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the pending collision between a garbage stream that
cannot be turned off and an adamant ``not here'' reaction to it is
forcing new dialogues about the way America looks at waste, and may
be providing a preview of future garbage wars.
</P>
<P>
   Various interests swirl around garbage like the seagulls, crows,
starlings and pigeons that hang out at Fresh Kills. They include:
</P>
<P>
   _ Private garbage haulers and landfill operators, including two
of the largest companies in the country.
</P>
<P>
   _ Environmentalists, who think they perceive in the crisis
circumstances that could decisively favor one of their movement's
fondest dreams, recycling.
</P>
<P>
   _ New York officials like Giuliani, who inherited the problem in
a city that has a history of responding to garbage problems with ad
hoc solutions.
</P>
<P>
   _ Neighborhood officials, such as Staten Island Borough
President Guy Molinari, who is adamant that Fresh Kills, which
opened in 1948 as a ``temporary'' solution to an earlier solid
waste crisis, be closed.
</P>
<P>
   _ Federal environmental officials, equally determined that the
city keep its 2001 commitment to close the landfill, which lacks a
lining to contain liquid runoff.
</P>
<P>
   _ State officials, such as the Republican governors of New
Jersey, Pennsylvania and Virginia, all of whom have engaged in
angry exchanges with New York's Republican mayor over the issue.
</P>
<P>
   _ Local officials, such as those in Charles City County, Va.,
which has enjoyed an infusion of revenue in the form of ``host
fees'' from a 934-acre landfill owned by America's largest trash
hauler, Waste Management Inc. of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Chandler, county administrator of Charles City County, said
the modern, federally approved, lined landfill is a welcome
addition to his county, primarily because of the revenue it
produces.
</P>
<P>
   The landfill is the largest business in the county of 7,000
people, Chandler said. Since it opened in 1990, it has provided a
stream of revenue that allowed the predominantly black county to
build a state-of-the-art school complex, with elementary, middle
and high schools, while cutting property taxes 44 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole concept of where we are today was seen as a very
good thing in the '80s,'' Chandler said. ``Regulated landfills were
actually promoted by the state back then.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the garbage that has subsequently come to Charles City
County originated in New York, where Waste Management and other
haulers collect a daily load of commercial waste roughly equal to
the 13,000 daily tons of residential garbage that goes to Fresh
Kills. The commercial garbage is already trucked out of the city.
</P>
<P>
   The Charles City County landfill is one of seven ``megafills''
in Virginia, all of them owned either by Waste Management or the
country's second largest garbage company, the yet unnamed entity
that would result from the pending merger of Browning Ferris
Industries of Houston and Allied Waste Industries of Scottsdale,
Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   Anticipating new business from the Fresh Kills closing, Waste
Management has received county permission to build special garbage
barge docks at Port Tobacco on the James River.
</P>
<P>
   However, Gov. James Gilmore, who like other state officials
supported the waste industry in the early 1990s when the seven
large landfills were built and who has received significant
campaign support from the industry, ordered the state attorney
general to oppose construction of the port in federal court.
</P>
<P>
   So far, courts have ruled that the state's opposition to the
port is an effort to ban or restrict the flow of out-of-state
garbage. In a 1993 ruling, the Supreme Court declared that garbage
shipments were protected from state interference by the
Constitution's interstate commerce clause, which reserves to
Congress the authority to regulate commerce between states.
</P>
<P>
   Bills introduced in the House and Senate would delegate this
authority to states, as far as garbage is concerned.
</P>
<P>
   The measures resemble bills that have been introduced in each of
the past several years. Ironically, the chief obstacle to passage
has been Rep. Thomas Bliley, R-Va., chairman of the House Commerce
Committee and a close friend and ally of Gilmore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have a pretty good chance of it this time,''
Voinovich said. ``The environment has changed significantly.''
</P>
<P>
   Voinovich said that when he became governor of Ohio eight years
ago, that state was importing around 3.7 million tons of garbage a
year, most of it from New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the largest garbage importer is Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   For collecting and hauling off commercial refuse, New York
already pays about $57 a ton, and although contracts for handling
the residential waste haven't been signed, most expectations are
that the cost will easily exceed $60 a ton.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, environmentalists say the net cost of recycling
materials like metal, glass and plastic _ a process that brings in
less revenue than it costs _ is going down in New York. The city
already sells more than 130,000 tons of waste paper a year to a
newly opened paper recycling mill on Staten Island, and another
paper plant is planned in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within the next five years or so, it's likely that despite the
inevitable start-up costs, recycling and landfilling will be on a
cost par with one another, and that's not environmental
poppycock,'' said Eric Goldstein, an attorney in the New York
office of the National Resources Defense Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real challenge for the 21st century will not be whose
landfills get filled up first, but how to accelerate the shift to
recycling, reusing and recovering that will benefit the nation as a
whole,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein and others think the dilemma closing in on Guiliani
may force New York to lead the way in making that shift.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the method, Staten Island wants Fresh Kills closed.
</P>
<P>
   Opened in 1948 as a temporary way to deal with garbage that was
spilling out of small, waterfront dumps, the landfill became so
large that the Statue of Liberty could be buried upright in it with
25 feet of garbage on top of her upreaching arm.
</P>
<P>
   According to Nicholas Dmytryszyn(cq), environmental engineer and
consultant to borough president Molinari, by the seventh day of
every calendar year the landfill generates enough air pollution to
be in violation of the federal Clean Air Act for the rest of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   An enormous flow of methane gas is collected and flared, and
eventually it will be added to natural gas used by New York's gas
utility, Brooklyn Union Gas, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dmytryszyn said he was skeptical about the prospects for
recycling to significantly reduce the New York waste stream.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are great differences between our understanding of
reality and that of the environmental groups,'' he said. ``They
tend to take the position that if you recycle, businesses will come
in and set up technologies to use the materials.''
</P>
<P>
   However, it is done, he said, Staten Island wants Fresh Kills
closed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This landfill has been operating too long illegally and we
want it shut down,'' he said. ``It is a quality-of-life debacle on
this island.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Young, an assistant New York santitation commissioner, said
the city will close Fresh Kills on time, and that will mean
exporting thousands of tons of garbage a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The New York City Department of Sanitation, before entering
into a contract to export garbage, checks that our garbage is
delivered to a licensed and permitted facility that also has a host
community agreement,'' she said. ``That's wherever our garbage
goes. And anyone who is exporting our garbage knows that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Recycling? I wish we could recycle everything we throw away,''
she said. ``However, I can drink a soda in a plastic bottle and
throw it in the recycling bin, but if there's not a company that is
willing to to pick it up, there's not going to be any recycling.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the ultimate solution, she said, one principle will
endure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Garbage will always win,'' she said.

 &HT;    VOINOVICH SEES 'PRETTY GOOD CHANCE' OF LIMITING GARBAGE
SHIPMENTS
 &HT;    With GARBAGE. For release Sunday, Aug. 8.
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. George Voinovich, R-Ohio, spoke with Jeff
Nesmith of the Cox Newspapers Washington Bureau about the politics
of garbage.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When you became governor, the state (of Ohio) was already
receiving a lot of waste.
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, it was as high as 3.7 million tons. (It was coming from)
New Jersey and New York, but primarily New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why did it decrease while you were governor?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think one of the reasons is that some of the waste outfits
tried to be responsive to our requests and we kind of encouraged
them to not take out-of-state waste. Maybe it became easier to send
it someplace else.
</P>
<P>
   Q: At the June hearing of the Senate Environment and Natural
Resources Committee on your bill, Sen. John Chafee, (R-R.I.,
chairman of the committee) expressed pretty strong reservations
about any bill that would impose these kind of restrictions on
interstate commerce. What are the chances you'll even get it out of
his committee?
</P>
<P>
   A: Well, I think we have a pretty good chance, actually. Now
that John Warner (R-Va.) is interested in it, that enhances our
opportunity. He's putting a whole lot of pressure on John Chafee to
get a bill out.
</P>
<P>
   My staff is working with Warner's to come up with kind of a
compromise piece of legislation that we can agree on and use that
as the basis for a bill.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What are some of the areas you expect to be compromising on?
</P>
<P>
   A: The staff has been working on it, and I don't know. Our bill
goes farther than Warner's.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In the House, Rep. Thomas Bliley (R-Va., chairman of the
House Commerce Committee) has traditionally opposed this kind of
legislation. Is there any reason to think that will change?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think the environment has changed significantly. For
example, we had a real difficult time convincing Tom Bliley when I
was governor. I don't think he was interested in at that stage
because they weren't getting so much in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   I think that he's a lot more interested in it now, because there
are a lot of people raising hell about this thing in his state. I
think he realizes that something's got to be done. He understands
as well as we do that when Fresh Kills closes, there's going to be
something like 13,200 tons of garbage each day that are going to be
diverted to other facilities. I think he realizes his state of
Virginia is going to be on the list of places to take it.
</P>
<P>
   You are talking about an additional 4 million tons a year going
someplace, and that has gotten the attention of a lot of people
around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How much are you concerned about the solid waste industry
lobby?
</P>
<P>
   A: I hope that they realize that there's a problem out there and
what we're suggesting is reasonable. It gives a lot of options to
states. It doesn't close the door unless a state wants to. They
have good relations with state legislatures. States can't ban new
facilities (under the bill), but they can require than no more than
20 percent comes in from out of state.
</P>
<P>
   This is not some kind of draconian piece of legislation that
will shut them out. What it will do is bring some reason to this
and, frankly, it may force New York state to come to grips with the
fact that they haven't done a very good job of dealing with their
own problem.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In terms of providing more landfills?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. In Ohio, we realized that we had a problem and we
started to close down the ones that weren't environmentally sound
and they started to build other ones that really are about the best
you can get. For some reason, the political leadership in New York
just hasn't had the fortitude to understand that they have a
responsibility to take care of the good part of their own waste.

 &HT;    HIGH-TECH TRADITIONALISTS STAMPEDE INTO HUNT COUNTRY
 &HT;    1130&AMP;add. Moving in (a) national and (l) lifestyle categories
for release Sunday, Aug. 15.
 &HT;    By BOB DART

<P>
   MIDDLEBURG, Va. _ The license plate on the Lexus said it all:
``POLO MOM.''
</P>
<P>
   The scents of money and manure have long mingled in Hunt
Country, the historic name of this piedmont in the shadow of the
Blue Ridge Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Stables are as common as garages, and blacksmiths are as vital
as baby-sitters for young families. Polo is actually a
johnny-come-lately pastime in a rolling green region where, for
several centuries, the major sporting seasons have been fox hunting
in the fall and steeplechases in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``A horse is absolutely a necessity'' for Hunt Country living,
said Kim Mendes, whose family has two and is shopping for a third.
</P>
<P>
   With a new house and a newer barn on five acres of former
farmland along a gravel road, the Mendes family is part of a
population boom that is changing the region's culture and
demographics while clinging to its horsey heritage. With two
children, they added the barn shortly after moving down from New
York and discovering that they had the room and the hankering for
horses.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Mendes, a telecommunications company executive, is typical
of Hunt Country newcomers. He commutes 35 minutes to work in the
high-tech corridor near Dulles International Airport where America
Online, Orbital Sciences, Comsat, Star Technologies and dozens of
other digital industries are headquartered in a suburb of
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Loudoun County, home to both the stables of Middleburg and the
servers of AOL, is one of the fastest growing areas in America. In
what was mostly a rural economy two decades ago, 75 percent of
county's new employers are in high-tech fields. Unemployment is
practically nonexistent.
</P>
<P>
   Land values are soaring in the rural areas an hour's drive from
the nation's capital. Sandy Lerner, co-founder of Cisco Systems
Software, paid about $7 million for the 800-acre Ayrshire estate in
Loudoun County. Robert Johnson, chairman of Black Entertainment
Television, bought a sprawling Hunt Country farm for about $4.3
million. ``Farmettes'' with a house and a stable on five- to
10-acre lots start at around $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   The high-tech influx is fueling a boom in low-tech trades that
have survived in Hunt Country since colonial times.
</P>
<P>
   ``This tech money is keeping us all very busy,'' said Malcolm
Matheson, a stone mason who said he can't keep up with the demand
for pillars, chimneys, archways and patios. ``In two months, I've
had to turn down probably a quarter of a million dollars worth of
work.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got more than I can handle,'' said Art Bennett, a
blacksmith who has shoed horses for 30 years. ``This is the best
business I've ever had.''
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone welcomes the changes.
</P>
<P>
   The newcomers move out ``for all the right reasons _ desire for
a country life and dreams of owning a horse. The problem is that
there's only so much room,'' said Dennis Foster, executive director
of the Masters of the Foxhound Association, which oversees all
mounted fox hunting in North America. ``The same people coming out
for the lifestyle may be finding that the lifestyle is not here any
more.''
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   In local lore, at least, the equine lifestyle harkens back to
the English gentry who colonized Virginia. An early aristocracy
established large estates _ 1,000 or so acres of cornfields and
pastures crossed by bubbling streams called ``runs'' and bounded by
trim hedgerows and miles of winding stone fences.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall, hounds still chase native foxes across this
countryside, spiritedly pursued by horse-borne men and women in red
riding jackets.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is fox hunting heaven for the United States,'' said
Joseph Neusch, the Master of the Fairfax Hunt. ``Some of these
high-tech, nouveau riche people see those wonderful old prints ...
that show hunters socializing in the field and they say, 'I want to
do that.' ``
</P>
<P>
   And Neusch _ who trains both riders and horses at Paper Chase
Farms _ is happy to oblige the aspirants.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes about a year with the right trainer and the right
horse,'' he said. ``They get so hooked that they can't talk about
anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   The 110-acre farm is located a few miles outside of Middleburg,
beside the John S. Mosby Highway _ named for Confederacy's
legendary ``Gray Ghost'' who led calvary raids nearby during the
Civil War. It is owned by Neusch and his wife, Jan Neuharth, a
former Los Angeles lawyer and the daughter of USA Today founder Al
Neuharth.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Starcher, the stable manager, is also an avid fox hunter.
</P>
<P>
   The sport is often misunderstood, he said. For instance,
``dropping the fox'' _ setting loose a fox to chase _ ``is
absolutely not done.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, a wild, local fox is sniffed out by the hounds, who
have bad eyesight and ``run by scent,'' Starcher explained. The
chase usually lasts from five to 20 minutes and the fox almost
always gets away _ crossing a hard road or running through a herd
of cows or flock of sheep or otherwise maneuvering so the hounds
lose the scent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to catch the fox,'' he said. ``Without foxes, we
don't have a hunt.''
</P>
<P>
   Spring is for steeplechases _ cross-country horse races whose
name dates back to England, where riders would gallop toward church
steeples peeking over distant hills. The courses are carefully
mapped nowadays, but racers must still jump their horses over
fences and hedgerows and across brooks.
</P>
<P>
   For both events, socializing and tradition are nearly as
important as riding. Wearing tweed in the fall and seersucker in
the spring, onlookers and participants eat and drink at lavish
tailgate parties and discuss the bloodlines of horses, hounds and
humans in their exclusive subculture.
</P>
<P>
   Fox hunts and steeplechases both require expanses of fields,
meadows and woodlands for the riders to gallop tally-ho across. And
therein lies the concern of some traditionalists, who regard
10-acre lots as high density housing.
</P>
<P>
   Dividing large estates into ``farmettes'' threatens the sports,
said Foster. As head of the national Masters of the Foxhound
Association, he said his main concern has become urban sprawl.
</P>
<P>
   A farmer who has welcomed 30 fox hunters onto his land for years
has second thoughts when the group increases to 150 riders, Foster
said.
</P>
<P>
   The newcomers ``love horses,'' so ``obviously, these are the
kinds of people you like to see here,'' he said. ``But it's getting
to the point that there are more hunters than ground to hunt.''
</P>
<P>
   Traditional fox hunts and steeplechases are increasingly being
augmented by equine sports that require less space _ polo, dressage
and even western rodeo events, said Peter Winants, a veteran fox
hunter and director of the National Sporting Library in Middleburg.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a boom in all the horse sports,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   In Middleburg, a village of 800 residents, the importance of the
horse is impossible to miss. Townswomen get their hair styled at
``The Pony Tail'' and buy dresses at ``The Finicky Filly.'' A local
photographer displays 35-year-old prints of Jackie Kennedy in
riding togs with her toddler son, John-John.
</P>
<P>
   Middleburg is home of the ``Chronicle of the Horse,'' a national
magazine whose average subscriber has an annual income of $168,000.
Publisher Robert Banner said the many of the region's newcomers are
enthusiastic equestrians who are infusing new spirit into the
sporting scene and new money into the local economy.
</P>
<P>
   The Hunt Country lifestyle can be costly. Most area horses cost
from $5,000 to $25,000, with top show ring performers going for as
much as $100,000, said Starcher, the Paper Chase Farms stable
manager. Upkeep can be expensive as well. For instance, he said, it
costs from $100 to $300 to shoe a horse, and they have to be reshod
every five weeks or so.
</P>
<P>
   But the computer industries have created considerable wealth,
said Matheson, the stone mason. ``My clients are from 24 years old
to their 40s and work in a high-tech field. They're changing the
place for the better. They're nice people. Easy to deal with.''
</P>
<P>
   Blacksmith Art Bennett likewise welcomes the brisk business from
the new resident equestrians.
</P>
<P>
   The income ``trickles right on down,'' he said. ``When I was a
boy, my father took me to a horse race and pointed to the barn and
said, 'That's the only place you'll ever make money at a
racetrack.' And he was absolutely right.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Kim Mendes said her family loves living in Hunt
Country and is thinking about buying a bigger spread.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband is getting very wrapped up in this horse
business,'' she said. ``We thought bringing our children up in the
country would be a better way of life. It seems to work for us.''

 &HT;    HIGH-TECH TRADITIONALISTS STAMPEDE INTO HUNT COUNTRY
 &HT;    1130&AMP;add. Moving in (a) national and (l) lifestyle categories
for release Sunday, Aug. 15.

   MIDDLEBURG, Va. _ The license plate on the Lexus said it all:
``POLO MOM.''
</P>
<P>
   The scents of money and manure have long mingled in Hunt
Country, the historic name of this piedmont in the shadow of the
Blue Ridge Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Stables are as common as garages, and blacksmiths are as vital
as baby-sitters for young families. Polo is actually a
johnny-come-lately pastime in a rolling green region where, for
several centuries, the major sporting seasons have been fox hunting
in the fall and steeplechases in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``A horse is absolutely a necessity'' for Hunt Country living,
said Kim Mendes, whose family has two and is shopping for a third.
</P>
<P>
   With a new house and a newer barn on five acres of former
farmland along a gravel road, the Mendes family is part of a
population boom that is changing the region's culture and
demographics while clinging to its horsey heritage. With two
children, they added the barn shortly after moving down from New
York and discovering that they had the room and the hankering for
horses.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Mendes, a telecommunications company executive, is typical
of Hunt Country newcomers. He commutes 35 minutes to work in the
high-tech corridor near Dulles International Airport where America
Online, Orbital Sciences, Comsat, Star Technologies and dozens of
other digital industries are headquartered in a suburb of
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Loudoun County, home to both the stables of Middleburg and the
servers of AOL, is one of the fastest growing areas in America. In
what was mostly a rural economy two decades ago, 75 percent of
county's new employers are in high-tech fields. Unemployment is
practically nonexistent.
</P>
<P>
   Land values are soaring in the rural areas an hour's drive from
the nation's capital. Sandy Lerner, co-founder of Cisco Systems
Software, paid about $7 million for the 800-acre Ayrshire estate in
Loudoun County. Robert Johnson, chairman of Black Entertainment

million. ``Farmettes'' with a house and a stable on five- to
10-acre lots start at around $500,000.
</P>

   The high-tech influx is fueling a boom in low-tech trades that
have survived in Hunt Country since colonial times.

   ``This tech money is keeping us all very busy,'' said Malcolm
Matheson, a stone mason who said he can't keep up with the demand
for pillars, chimneys, archways and patios. ``In two months, I've

LIVING THE `GQ' LIFE IN THE `THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WESLEY MORRIS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Whenever she can, insurance investigator Catherine Banning (Rene
Russo) refers to Thomas Crown (Pierce Brosnan), her billionaire
playboy prey, as ``Tommy.''
</P>
<P>
   The boyish nickname is part tool of reductive seduction, part
nominal territory-marking, part Banning's way of informing Crown
that she doesn't take his smooth-operator comportment seriously.
</P>
<P>
   But in the context of John McTiernan's designer makeover of
Norman Jewison's 1968 ``Thomas Crown Affair,'' the only person I
really could think of is that other Tommy _ the one who makes
several lines of clothes Thomas Crown likely would deem too urban
for his more uptown and, yes, urbane taste. But it's a tacit,
coincidental fashion allusion in a film stylized to the hilt.
</P>
<P>
   While purporting to be about a fortysomething corporate
money-bags who gets off on nabbing his favorite paintings, and the
woman trying to nab him, ``TC '99'' is a GQ-W magazine team-up, a
fashion-spread sex story _ not at all disguised as a heist caper _
about a clothes-horse and his mare. Against all odds, the cat falls
for the mouse and jet-setting ensues. Of course, McTiernan (``Die
Hard'') imagines the whole affair to be a sexy way of persuading a
pair of chic yuppies to get over themselves.
</P>
<P>
   After ``Eyes Wide Shut'' and the upcoming adaptation of Chuck
Palahniuk's ``Fight Club,'' about apathetic young metropolitan
suits who turn to refereed death matches to ``feel something,'' the
upper crust is in crisis, afflicted with restlessness and boredom.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Cruise visits an orgiastic secret society on Long Island,
Tommy Crown stuffs a Metropolitan Museum of Art Monet in a hi-tech
briefcase that you should expect Coach to offer in the fall. The
boy can't help it.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Thomas Crown'' finds a less pretentious way of sating
hedonistic desire _ namely by doing away with that inane fauxrotic
chess-playing business between Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaway in
the original and going directly for the horizontal gusto.
</P>
<P>
   Crown and Banning have movie sex on every surface in his
Manhattan brownstone, from the marble staircase to a mahogany desk
from which all the dog-eared books and mags are wiped to the floor.
The film wants you to believe that these are a couple of
have-it-alls charged by the multifold meanings of mergers and
acquisitions. But what starts coming into McTiernan's film that was
irrelevant in Jewison's is a sense that Crown and Banning find
compatibility in their middle-aged miseries.
</P>
<P>
   McTiernan's film mines what substance it has from its two stars,
but is admittedly about keeping up its own appearances. ``Thomas
Crown's'' dizzying, cool finale multiplies the guy with the bowler
hat from a Magritte painting into a sea of Savile Row extras
through which Crown attempts to replace his booty. Composer Tom
Conti's hand claps and toe taps intertwine with Nina Simone's
gospel-soul arrangement of ``Sinnerman,'' and the film reaches its
cumulative watershed _ a clever, sexy, mildly inane engrossment.
Like Bruce Wayne et al., Crown, who made it to Oxford on a boxing
scholarship, lives alone (read: single, with suspiciously
omniscient butler), and his mid-40s bachelor status makes him
eccentric (read: a sociopath who wants to be caught).
</P>
<P>
   He owns a Magritte and babysits Monets, selecting ``San Giorgio
Maggiore Soleil'' for his booty. (And, in a Madison Avenue revision
of McTiernan's ``Die Hard'' and ``Hunt for Red October''
sensibilities, Crown steals the piece amid a clan of Romanians
pulling their own Metropolitan heist. It's another romanticization
of '80s-style movie theft, with these art-nappers treated with the
menace usually reserved for terrorists.)
</P>
<P>
   Crown also visits a shrink, played by Dunaway, to discuss his
intimacy issues.
</P>
<P>
   Brosnan merely could have have glided along on the oily panache
he oozes as James Bond or used to secrete as Remington Steele, but
Crown's arrogance is a front for his chronic discontent, which
Brosnan inhabits with a flaneur's aimless lassitude.
</P>
<P>
   It takes Russo about 20 minutes to appear, but it's as if the
film can smell her coming and hardly can wait for her to get there.
Tom Priestly's photography catches the vapors trying to capture
her, melting in and out around her as if the whole enterprise were
about to go weak in the knees. Russo's decked out in freshly
tousled burnt-umber bedhead and adult contemporary couture (ranging
from scintillating to sinful), as though she couldn't decide who
she most adored _ Ann-Margret, Angie Dickinson or Tina Louise.
</P>
<P>
   She's a feline hybrid of the three, infusing the experiment in
cosmetic amalgamation with enough sophisticated stardust to make it
clear that she's busting loose from her arm-candy status.
</P>
<P>
   Banning gets to be jealous of the Euro toy (supermodelicious
Esther Canadas, with an expletitive-laced evil eye) Crown is
spotted with. And there's also enough girlish glee in Russo to
rescue her from being the preening vamp Banning could have been.
</P>
<P>
   Russo also saves herself from some of the more unintentionally
farcical things she's made to wear. An oversized alabaster parka
and one XL turtleneck come to mind.
</P>
<P>
   Even Denis Leary _ at his most irascible, brittle and
susceptible to emotion as the jealous NYPD detective working with
Banning _ has a tough time resisting a smirk. Though his character
has a Today's Man air about him that, under these circumstances,
makes him a fashion emergency with a badge.

THE UNFLAPPABLE `FRASIER' HEADS INTO SEVENTH SEASON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK McGUIRE  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ It has been one of television's better
teases, the pining of the lovelorn Niles for the oblivious Daphne.
</P>
<P>
   But it's been six years now. Something has to give with those
kids from ``Frasier.'' Otherwise, David Hyde Pierce says, ``It
starts being unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   The time has come for Dr. Niles Crane (Pierce) and Daphne Moon
(Jane Leeves) to either hook up or press on, Pierce said in an
interview last week in Pasadena.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know they are going to shake up me and Daphne,'' said
Pierce, 40, a native of Saratoga Springs, N.Y. ``I'm not entirely
sure the direction they are going, whether they are bringing us
together, or whether they are going to sort of seal it for a while.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all feel like it is time to really toss that up in the
air.''
</P>
<P>
   If Pierce has his way, his alter ego will be hitting the singles
scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``My vote would be to send them off in opposite directions,'' he
said. ``I think it would be fun, maybe come up with some
interesting people for Niles to go out with.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not want to see them together yet,'' he continued. ``I
could understand sending them so far apart that it stops being an
issue, so that at a future date they could get back together.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Frasier'' is up for 10 Emmy nominations from last season,
including outstanding comedy, comedy writing, lead actor (Kelsey
Grammer, as Frasier Crane) and supporting actor (both Pierce and
John Mahoney). With 64 Emmy nominations and 20 wins in five years,
it is one of the most lauded series of all time (10 more Emmy wins
and it will pass ``The Mary Tyler Moore Show'' for the most ever).
</P>
<P>
   The outstanding comedy Emmy winner the past five years?
``Frasier,'' ``Frasier,'' ``Frasier,'' ``Frasier'' and ``Frasier.''
It is a string unmatched by any other show in any category.
</P>
<P>
   Do I think it should be six-for-six? No. NBC compatriot
``Friends'' had a better year, and look for CBS' ``Everybody Loves
Raymond'' to be a strong dark horse candidate (although Ray Romano
has a better chance in the lead actor category). Like others, I had
trouble with how last season started for ``Frasier,'' with the good
doctor left out of work. However, I thought the sitcom regained its
footing as its sixth season wore on and Frasier returned to the
radio studio.
</P>
<P>
   But Pierce disagrees with the opinion the show sagged somewhat
at the onset of last year, conceding only that viewers were caught
off-balance by what he thought was good storytelling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't stumble,'' he said. ``People had a lot of trouble
with Frasier being out of work. The show has been on long enough
that people actually care about the characters.
</P>
<P>
   ``They found it uncomfortable to see him not have a job. When he
finally went back, people were relieved.''
</P>
<P>
   Dad somewhat disagrees, to a point. Mahoney, who plays patriarch
Martin Crane, was not crazy with the story line, but thought it was
well done.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, I didn't like him being out of work,'' Mahoney
said. ``I didn't find it particularly humorous.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that is not to say it wasn't well-written, well-acted and
good. It was just as well-written, just as well-acted, but people
were uncomfortable with that story line.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mahoney is all for changing up the stories and even adding
characters, especially in a situation comedy that is entering its
seventh season long past the life span for most comedies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just signed contracts for years seven, eight and nine. I
don't want to spend those years doing what we did for the first
six,'' he said. ``I want to mix it up a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Pierce and Mahoney agree that projections for this
multiple-Emmy show were skewed when it was moved last season into
the coveted 9 p.m. Thursday time slot previously held by the
exalted ``Seinfeld.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not `Seinfeld,''' Mahoney said. ``No show in television
was going to do those numbers. It was an unreal expectation.''
</P>
<P>
   It may be the only expectation this legendary comedy hasn't at
least met.

GOT MILK? NO, IT'S `MYSTERY MEN' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WESLEY MORRIS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Mystery Men'' is an opulent farce teeming with idiosyncratic
nonsense and directed by Kinka Usher as though all the scrapbooks
of commercials he's done entitled him to come up with something
this visionary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mystery Men'' doesn't aspire to the heights the Wachowski
brothers were trying to climb with ``The Matrix,'' but then it's
not saddled with the marketing hurdle that once was Keanu, either.
</P>
<P>
   It's too preoccupied with maintaining the self-respect of its
participants, but exactly the embarrassing hipper-than-thou pop
traffic-jam the trailers and television spots make it out to be.
</P>
<P>
   Embarrassment is something the film seems programmed to avoid.
``Mystery Men'' thinks it's cool _ Usher lets the ad-libs and
improvs fly. But Usher wants it to be (slightly) more than a
collection of Gen-X trading cards of Ben Stiller, Janeane Garofalo,
William H. Macy, Kel Mitchell, Hank Azaria and Paul Reubens.
</P>
<P>
   This spin-off from Bob Burden's ``Flaming Carrot'' comics didn't
need these people to grace it with their coffeehouse-street-cred
verve, but that's part of the film's
``hey-let's-make-a-Hollywood-movie'' self-consciousness. Usher and
Co. aren't peddling cynicism so much as they're looking for
sardonic ways of saying ``I like myself'' without committing to
anything real enough to get them called sellouts and evicted from
The Garden of Indie.
</P>
<P>
   The film, written with a perpetual smirk by Neil Cuthbert,
revolves around a band of struggling blue-collar superheroes
looking for their big break into superstardom like their arrogant
idol, Captain Amazing (Greg Kinnear). He's the Batman of Champion
City, and like the products endorsed _ Ray-O-Vac batteries, for
instance _ on his NASCAR-biker costume (courtesy of designer
Marilyn Vance's inspired Goodwill-hunting), his services have
gotten old. But that's because he's either destroyed or
incarcerated every foe in town, and, in an inspired whiff of
jokiness, he's reduced himself to taking out assembly-line villains
who attack nursing homes as though they were bum-rushing a Gotham
City debutante ball.
</P>
<P>
   The corporate sponsors want to drop him, so, disguised as his
alter ego, Lance Hunt _ whom no one recognizes behind his
horn-rimmed glasses _ Amazing shows up at the 17th parole hearing
of his archest enemy, Casanova Frankenstein (Geoffrey Rush, doing
Klaus Kinski gone Studio 54), and gets him released, only to try to
lock him up again. Amazing's plan backfires and Frankenstein holds
him hostage, allowing Frank and his disco henchmen to ransack the
city.
</P>
<P>
   A trio of depressed pals _ whose powers range from the ability
to get uselessly angry (Stiller) to the gifts of wielding a shovel
(Macy) and kitchen utensils (Azaria) _ seize Amazing's kidnapping
as the occasion for their coming out. They wind up reluctantly
enlisting a guy called the Spleen (Reubens), whose power is his
silent-but-deadly gas, and a black teen called Invisible Boy
(Mitchell), who, in an inversion of Ralph Ellison's assertion,
believes that if no one's looking at him, he can't be seen.
</P>
<P>
   This downtrodden justice league's big score comes in the form of
a head case called The Bowler (Garofalo), whose bowling ball is
possessed by her father, whose skull is encased there.
</P>
<P>
   By the time The Sphinx (Wes Studi) gets the gang to attend his
Yoda-esque ``Iron John''-for-self-esteemless-superheroes woodland
getaway, Usher's mocked the fact that these guys can't do anything
right. But he admires their scrappy determination, rewarding the
cast, particularly Garofalo, by keeping the one-liners bouncing off
the walls.
</P>
<P>
   The film obviously hates the blond, blue-eyed Amazing and how
his corporate-sponsored lifestyle has warped Champion City as much
as protected it: Why would anyone ever want to emulate Amazing,
when instead he could be part of their own multicultural
crime-fighting force that can stop selling out in a single leap and
bound?
</P>
<P>
   That's a bemusing paradox from the television visionary who made
``Got Milk?'' ads and that Nissan spot with Barbie, Ken and Van
Halen's ``You Really Got Me.'' One of ``Mystery Men's'' most
hilarious qualities is the way it turns its nose up at success and
unmitigated contentment as if a sneer were preferable to a smile
and having your best fringe buddies around you were enough to keep
the hounds of lost integrity at bay.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if crimes of crass commercialism are what the Mystery Men
are after _ I can see them going after villains like Star Buck or
the Tower Recorder or the Golden Arch in a sequel _ the gang would
be advised to first recruit David Arquette as Quirk, Parker Posey
as The JAP and Ben Affleck as The Ex-boyfriend, then head West to
fight cell phones and criminally overpriced espressos at Sundance.

ALL TRICKS AND LITTLE MAGIC IN `ILLUMINATA' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WESLEY MORRIS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Imagined as a love song to his wife about the strength of their
marriage, John Turturro's ``Illuminata'' uses the theater to craft
a flimsy version of ``The Ballad of John and Yoko.''
</P>
<P>
   But for better or worse, the wife, Kathryn Borowitz, is no Ono,
and the ensemble piece _ about the serious/screwball antics
revolving around a playwright's (Turturro) unfinished work _ that
she's nestled into is robbed of the vitality, wryness, wit, depth
and passion it deserves.
</P>
<P>
   Set in 1900s New York, ``Illuminata'' was co-written and
directed by Turturro, and neither ideology nor plot nor his wife,
for that matter, seems to be what's inspiring Turturro to work,
here _ it's directing.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the film takes place on a boundless stage _ conceived
and designed by Robin Standefer, Donna Zakowska and Roman Paska _
that looks as if it's in the process of being both constructed and
razed.
</P>
<P>
   And between several scene transitions and during the opening
credits, a puppet sequence designed and performed by Paska is more
alluring and achingly sensual than most of the interactions between
humans.
</P>
<P>
   Music video cinematographer Harris Savides frames shots with
painterly diligence. He also supplies the film with so much of the
blue that most of the action looks as though it's unfolding in
Atlantis _ with Christopher Walken, Susan Sarandon and Ben Gazzara
splashing around in it.
</P>
<P>
   Borowitz, as an actress, doesn't seem enchanted with the beauty
undulating around her. She's pensive, churning and too focused on
the bad dialogue and frissons of profundity, as if she's trying to
make sense of the artificiality of her surroundings. She, as well
as the rest of the cast, would've benefited by having drunk more of
whatever was in the mermaidenly Georgina Cates' water.
</P>
<P>
   Turturro tricks you into thinking there's magic realism
streaming through this ode to art and committed love _ despite
there being little magic and not a trace of reality to speak of.

COMING OF AGE IN `MY LIFE SO FAR' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WESLEY MORRIS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sometimes an out-of-touch kids-find-sex movie can be quaint in
its need to pretend that yesterday is better than now _ or that
yesterday is a lot like now. For instance, those little girls
learning that their Miss Jean Brodie was a prime specimen of lust
was precious.
</P>
<P>
   But ``My Life So Far,'' by ``Chariots of Fire'' director Hugh
Hudson, is neither a reminiscent throwback nor mild allegory, it's
a willfully turgid demonstration that if a filmmaker puts his mind
to it he can tell a tale about a boy sexually coming of age as if
the birds, bees and educated fleas were the only one's doing it.
</P>
<P>
   The film is based on the childhood memoirs of British television
mogul Dennis Forman, but produced by the occasionally
thrill-seeking David Puttnam (``Midnight Express,'' ``Cal''). Did
he think was making the United Kingdom answer to last year's
``Permanent Midnight,'' the Ben Stiller vehicle about heroin-fiend
TV writer Jerry Stahl. The more innocent ``My Life So Far'' is one
of those indulgent little U.K. adventures in which the kid knows
more about the nasty than the grownups who feign belief in storks
and immaculate conceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Encouraged as a toddler by his father (Colin Firth) to
communicate in ``dog'' and surrounded by a bunch of uptight
geriatrics like matronly Gamma (Rosemary Harris), Fraser was raised
in the '20s in a manner Wilson and screenwriter Simon Donald would
have you believe is eccentric. It's an era when impure thoughts are
detectable and _ psst! _ ``incorrigible.''
</P>
<P>
   The story of Fraser's philandering inventor father (played by a
squandered-again Firth) and his attempt to seduce his French
sister-in-law (Irene Jacob) without alienating his wife (Mary
Elizabeth Mastrantonio) would have been vaguely more watchable were
they seen through Hudson's eyes and not Fraser's. Though the value
of what they both would witness would have been interchangeably
dull.
</P>
<P>
   But Hudson gets more than a piffling performance from Norman,
who spends the film looking like he's entered its prudish Scottish
environs through the Phantom Tollboth and would probably rather be
getting to know Gamma's apple pie than Gamma herself.

CUNNING, FEAR UNITE IN `THE SIXTH SENSE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By AMY BIANCOLLI  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Sixth Sense'' sneaks up on you _ slowly, on tip-toe,
slinking up the cellar stairs until it's hovering right behind you,
hissing down your neck. Then it pounces. And when it pounces,
you'll find yourself reeling from the craftiest, most tub-thumping
jerk of a plot twist since Jaye Davison got personal in ``The
Crying Game.''
</P>
<P>
   That's all we'll say about it. That's all anyone ought to say
about ``The Sixth Sense,'' a cunning paranormal thriller about a
boy who sees dead people and the child psychiatrist who tries to
help him.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that its premise is an unoriginal rehash of every
spooky-kid movie since ``The Shining'' _ and the fact that yet
another spooky-kid movie, the smartly acted ``Stir of Echoes,'' is
due for release next month _ only adds to the surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, a movie about a child with supernatural powers can indeed
be an intelligent, chilling, trim and nuanced film. It can also be
the vehicle for a terrifyingly apt performance by 11-year-old Haley
Joel Osment, who played Forrest Gump Jr. and here delivers the most
precocious (and prodigious) thespian feat of the summer. That it
pops up in a film of minimal hype by a virtually unknown
writer-director (M. Night Shyamalan, who made the equally mystical
but far inferior ``Wide Awake,'' released last year) gives one
faith in the caprice of filmmaking.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Willis is Malcolm Crowe, a prosperous Philadelphia shrink
with a palatial home and a wife (Olivia Williams) on the verge of
feeling ignored. One night, while the pair are kvelling over a
shiny new award, a lathering ex-patient named Vincent Gray (Donnie
Wahlberg, freakish and unrecognizable) bursts into their bedroom
and starts howling about futile psychiatry.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't know so many things!'' he yells. ``Do you know why
you're afraid when you're alone? I do. I do.'' Then, after accusing
Malcolm of failure, he shoots the doctor in the gut and kills
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Jump ahead to the next fall. Malcolm is outside the home of Cole
Sear (seer _ get it?), a worried, jitter-riddled boy who scoots
down the street as if he's being chased. Dutifully, the doctor
reads from his notes: 9 years old, divorced parents, anxiety
problems, possible mood disorder. Malcolm follows Cole into a
church, where the boy plays with toy soldiers in the sanctuary of a
pew. There they begin the psychological pas de deux that marks
their relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm, seeing in Cole a chance to redeem his failure with
Vincent, tries to nudge him into confessing his secrets. He plays
games, does goofy magic tricks, intuits truths about the boy's
parents. But the boy keeps his ghosts to himself, allowing the film
to focus not on Cole's spectral visitors _ which aren't seen until
the second hour _ but on the terror they bring to his face.
</P>
<P>
   In this the movie is similar to the paranoiac ``Blair Witch
Project,'' which emphasizes the fruits of fear rather than its
cause. Unlike that film, ``The Sixth Sense'' does deliver the
ghouls, and they're damned scary when they appear. But scarier
still is the ravaged vigilance in Cole's sad face, his eyes as wise
and worn as a tired old man's.
</P>
<P>
   The lion's share of the movie's scenes are one-on-ones between
doctor and patient, thoughtfully scripted sequences that emphasize
the humanity, and the pain, on both sides: It isn't long before
Cole is counseling Malcolm on how to communicate with his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Willis, as those who loathed ``Moonlighting'' will be relieved
to learn, has permanently deep-sixed his squint. His face has
become gaunt and block-like with age, and more honest; his acting
is as clear and uncluttered as it once was tic-ish. Toni Collette
drums up compassion in her small role as Cole's struggling mom,
adding believable pathos to Cole's battered home life.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sixth Sense'' has its weak points (there are plot holes
that loom ever larger on reflection), but none is serious enough to
collapse the framework. Because Shyamalan's script is so narrow in
its focus (boy, shrink, mom, wife, ghosts), he gets away without
the busybody bosses and nattering sidekicks that normally clutter
movies about patients and shrinks. It's a film about fear _ Cole's
_ and regret _ Malcolm's. The cadaverous ghosts are secondary.

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The sixth game of the 1996 World Series was one of the high
points of Ilene Lang's career _ literally. That was the year of the
AltaVista blimp, a great airship that hung above Yankee Stadium,
silhouetted against the Manhattan skyline.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, Lang ran AltaVista, the Internet software business
unit of the old Digital Equipment Corp. She and her colleagues had
decided to lease a blimp to raise the profile of the AltaVista
Internet search service, but they'd never expected quite so high a
profile.
</P>
<P>
   The Goodyear blimp had been damaged in a storm, and the Fox
Network, which televised the game, was desperate for an aerial
camera platform. Out went the call for a blimp. Lang was happy to
oblige, and 20 million baseball fans were introduced to the
AltaVista brand name.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was so new,'' she recalls. ``We started getting press,
and it brought more traffic to the site than you could have
imagined.''
</P>
<P>
   Alas, it was pretty much downhill from there. Digital reneged on
its plan to turn AltaVista into a separate subsidiary, a retreat
that led to Lang's departure from the company. ``I was extremely
disappointed,'' she says now, but adds, with a shrug in her voice,
``Life goes on.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, Lang, 55, is once again trying to build an Internet
business under the aegis of a larger parent company. This time it's
NewsEdge Corp., a 400-person Burlington, Mass. firm that uses
computers and humans to serve up electronic news reports to
corporate executives.
</P>
<P>
   Lang's job is to deliver some of the same services to anybody
with an Internet browser. She's the president and chief executive
of NewsPage.com Inc., a NewsEdge subsidiary that lets visitors
create a personalized news portal on line.
</P>
<P>
   Lang is one of the leading women in the Massachusetts high-tech
community, a curious fate for someone who majored in history and
literature at Radcliffe. After graduating in 1965, she landed her
first job as a technical writer, cranking out contracts for MIT. It
turned out that her knowledge of Chaucer came in handy. Unlike many
technically trained people, ``I knew what English was,'' she says,
laughing.
</P>
<P>
   By 1971, her employer was staggering toward collapse, and
Harvard Business School was finally accepting women. Lang spent the
next two years there, then after graduating spent the next decade
in the retail picture-framing business. Only in 1982 did she get
back into technology, as an executive at artificial-intelligence
pioneer Symbolics Inc., where she spent five years. Several other
high-tech assignments followed.
</P>
<P>
   Then in 1993, Lang went to Lotus Development Corp., where she
took over worldwide responsibility for the company's SmartSuite
office software line. It was a thankless task; SmartSuite was being
hammered by Microsoft Corp.'s Office software, and Lotus was
pouring most of its resources into an up-and-coming new product
called Notes. Three months after IBM Corp. acquired Lotus, Lang
made the move to Digital.
</P>
<P>
   ``There wasn't an AltaVista when I went there`` in November
1995, she says. At least, there was no business unit of that name.
Instead, AltaVista was the code name for a powerful Internet search
service. It was one of about 25 networking products that Digital
wanted to combine into a separate business unit under Lang's
direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked at all the products on the first day,'' she recalls,
``and I basically said the only ones here that are worth trying to
build a business around are these new Internet products.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the theory, anyway. By 1997, Digital had changed its
mind about spinning off AltaVista through a public stock offering,
and Lang changed her mind about working for Digital. Digital was
acquired last year by Compaq Computer Corp., while Lang, after a
brief stint as chief executive of Internet utility company
Etility.com, came to NewsPage.
</P>
<P>
   Like many Internet services, NewsPage is free; the service hopes
to make its profits by persuading big-name companies to buy ads on
the site. Once a user signs up, he or she can ask to receive a
daily news briefing covering 1,400 topics, from politics to
technology. NewsPage's electronic and human editors scour 52 media
outlets, from wire services to trade magazines, to find stories
related to the subscriber's interests. The system sends a short
e-mail news summary each morning, as well as a link to the NewsPage
Web site, where the subscriber can read each story in full.
</P>
<P>
   Sound familiar? NewsPage was born in 1995 at Individual Inc.,
another Burlington firm that was in the forefront of the old fad
for Internet ``push'' services. Back then, companies vied to make
software that would automatically dump large amounts of Internet
data onto people's desktops. But push systems swamped both
individual users and corporate data networks with useless
information. Soon people turned their backs on the concept, and
push pioneers fell on hard times. Indeed, NewsEdge was born last
year when its predecessor company, Desktop Data, acquired a
moribund Individual for $83 million.
</P>
<P>
   There's no surprise that Lang says, ``We don't like to use the
word `push,' because of the concept there. It's a very intrusive
concept.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she says, NewsPage is a friendlier service. Users don't
have reams of data pushed onto their hard drives. Instead, they
visit their own customized NewsPage, read the stories that interest
them, and ignore the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Making it all go is the same information-processing
infrastructure that parent company NewsEdge uses. Former Pentagon
data analyst Donald McLagen started Desktop Data in 1988. McLagen
and his colleagues have devised sophisticated algorithms that can
enable computers to sort 10,000 documents a day, cross-linking each
of them to the likely interest of various readers. For instance, a
story about the Microsoft antitrust case would probably be of
interest to antitrust attorneys, but not criminal attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   News-analysis software is all very well, says McLagen, but ``at
the end of the day, it gets you about 40 percent of the way
there.'' So NewsEdge also has a couple of dozen people who skim
through the day's news stories to sharpen up the process. For
instance, several news services will cover the same event; the
editors will choose the best-written account and discard the rest.
``People do that real fast,'' McLagen said.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting newsfeed is sent to about 1,400 clients, including
some of the world's largest businesses. KPMG LLC, the accounting
and consulting firm, recently made NewsEdge part of its KWorld
internal data network. The KWorld intranet currently links 15,000
KPMG employees; eventually all 100,000 employees worldwide will be
linked. And NewsEdge will provide a customized package of news on
such matters as tax law and corporate finance issues.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Avishai, KPMG's director of intellectual capital, says
NewsEdge helps the company's workers make the most efficient use of
their time. ``They can be one click away from the five or 10 most
relevant stories,'' instead of wasting time on fruitless Internet
searches, Avishai says.
</P>
<P>
   Lang's NewsPage site offers a subset of the NewsEdge service.
While NewsEdge corporate subscribers can choose from 2,000 data
sources, NewsPage uses only 52. David Curle, a senior analyst for
Outsell Inc., a California-based market research firm, says that's
why the free NewsPage service probably won't cannibalize NewsEdge
customers. ``There's a lot of premium content that a service like
NewsEdge provides,'' Curle says.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, NewsPage's Lang will focus on attracting a large
audience of readers for the more limited offerings on her service.
So far, NewsPage has nearly a million registered users, with about
half that number being regular visitors to the site. With top
portal sites such as Yahoo getting more than 30 million visitors a
month, NewsPage has a lot of growing to do before it can attract a
profitable share of Internet ad revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Lang is confident she can do it, even though NewsEdge lacks the
vast resources that Digital could command. Indeed, she thinks that
Digital was too large and unwieldy to make a good corporate parent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Digital can't really be faulted, in some sense, because no
other big company has been able to do this kind of thing
particularly well,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``NewsEdge is a nice-sized company, but it's still small,'' Lang
adds. ``It's very entrepreneurial, and it hasn't forgotten its
roots. . . . It's a perfect kind of situation for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, almost. There's no blimp.

JONES BELIEVES HE HAS HIS POSITION COVERED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SMITHFIELD, R.I. _ Sophomore jinx or sophomore hijinks?
</P>
<P>
   To hear the Patriots tell it, Tebucky Jones has a better chance
for boisterous fun than a second-season letdown.
</P>
<P>
   Already splitting time with veteran Steve Israel on the first
team, Jones is beginning to act more like the cornerback the
Patriots had envisioned when they drafted him in the first round as
a strong safety out of Syracuse a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Jones (6 feet 2 inches, 215 pounds) started out as a running
back at Syracuse and was moved to strong safety two years ago,
playing one year on defense at college before the Patriots
braintrust saw his athleticism and decided to turn him into a
bump-and-run corner.
</P>
<P>
   As much as the Patriots tried to push the process along last
season, it never clicked well enough for the coaches to trust Jones
against big receivers such as Keyshawn Johnson and Marvin Harrison.
</P>
<P>
   But it seems Jones is starting to figure it all out.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's night and day from a year ago,'' said Patriots defensive
backs coach Ron Lynn. ``And understandably so. Last year he had
never lined up at that position. He understands the calls better,
understands the technique better. He has caught a million balls
from this angle now that he'd never seen before. He's so much
better. You used to think he was in a total body spasm when the
ball came down and he was nowhere near the ball. Now he's right on
it. He knows how to turn for the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   The new Tebucky Jones won't be unveiled until the first of four
exhibition games, Aug. 13 against the Washington Redskins. He's
been guaranteed at least two starts and he'll have plenty of
opportunity to prove he's ready for prime time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have way more confidence now than I did last year,'' said
Jones. ``It all started in the offseason. I started working out
again in January and I felt I had the edge on everybody else
because of it. Then the minicamps started and at that first one we
had, I started to cover guys and I was finding that I was staying
with them. That feeling started to build itself up and up and I
haven't come down from it yet. When I'm out there on the field, I
think I can cover anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots want someone who can get their hands in the face of
bigger receivers and get physical with them at the line of
scrimmage. Jones is big and tough enough to handle those tasks.
</P>
<P>
   The problems for Jones may come in staying with his man off the
line while not being flagged for holding or interference. At times
last season, he hung on receivers too much, which is something Lynn
has worked on with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He thinks he's the baddest guy in the world and he doesn't
have to be that way all the time,'' Lynn said. ``He's tried to get
too physical with those guys and what we're telling him is that
he'll get his chances to be physical, but he also knows when he has
to be able to get off a guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynn considers Ty Law, Israel, and Jones all starters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how it's going to shake down as to who steps on
the field for the first play, but he's going to play a ton,'' said
Lynn. ``He'll be fine. He could step in and hold his own.
Eventually, I think he's going to be a dominant player if the
officials let guys play bump and run. I don't mean holding and
grabbing or anything illegal past the 5-yard area, but Tebucky is
going to be a player.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones may be the best athlete in the backfield. Law is an
All-Pro, but Jones can do a lot of things. Law says he'd like to
play on both sides of the ball, but Jones has actually done it in a
big-time college setting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give me the ball,'' said Jones. ``I'd love to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   But he says he's focused on learning to be a corner. The
Patriots have never even hinted Jones might move to safety, even
with the release of free safety Willie Clay. Safety would seem to
make sense for Jones as he could use his ability to hit people from
a strong safety spot and he wouldn't have the cover
responsibilities he'll have at the right corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be a corner,'' said Jones. ``I haven't even thought
about safety since I played it in college. I can play corner and
now I have to go out and show it to everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Pete Carroll has never wavered on the topic. He's wanted Jones
to play corner from the moment he saw him at a Syracuse workout
before last year's draft. And Carroll thought he was worth the
gamble of a first-round pick.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference now is I know what I'm doing,'' said Jones. ``I
learned a lot of things about playing the position last year. I've
taken those things and just gotten better at them because I
understand them better.''
</P>
<P>
   Receivers don't like to go up against because they can figure on
getting hammered at some point. Terry Glenn said, ``He's very
physical. I'm not going to go up against someone that physical in
the regular season. He gives everyone a good test at the line of
scrimmage. If you can get away from him, you're doing a good job.''
</P>
<P>
   If Jones doesn't cut it as the opening day right corner, he said
he won't be disappointed. But he expects to take advantage of every
opportunity and give the Patriots something to think about.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they'll give me the chance and the rest is up to me,''
said Jones. ``I have to continue to be a good special teams player
and contribute to this team as best I can in all areas. If I play
in the nickel, then I have to do the job there, too. I have all
season to show them that I can be a starter and a good player in
the regular defense. I feel I've reached that point.''

ROLLINS STEPS FROM ROCK TO A HARDER PLACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Henry Rollins talks about ``more adrenalin and more
testosterone,'' you wake up and listen. Here's a guy who has made a
career of these things, yet he's upping the ante even more. The
former leader of the seminal punk band Black Flag is not going
quietly into the night.
</P>
<P>
   These days are peak times for hard rock _ look at the success of
Limp Bizkit and Korn. And now comes the return of Rollins, who has
a new version of the Rollins Band and a new determination to
pulverize every audience in sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the last tour, there was just a certain level of adrenalin
and testosterone that I was missing,'' says Rollins. ``And I felt I
wasn't going to get it done with the guys I had. It's just not
where we were headed. I wanted to rock out _ and a straight 4/4
thing is really not what they do.''
</P>
<P>
   Rollins, 38, has a new unit that is ``ready to kick out the
jams'' every night.
</P>
<P>
   Members of his last band have caught on elsewhere _ drummer Sim
Cain joined the J. Geils Band reunion tour and guitarist Chris
Haskett is doing studio work for David Bowie. Meanwhile, Rollins
found a bunch of hard-rock devotees in Mother Superior, a
pre-existing band that backs him on this club tour and on a new
album, ``Get Some Go Again,'' due out in January to greet the new
millennium.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll come into the millennium with a definite roar, that's
for sure,'' says Rollins. ``My manager said, `Hey, there's never
been a better time for you to make a hard-rock album.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to describe his new sound, Rollins notes, ``It's not like
we're doing heavy metal. And it's not some speed-metal thing. It's
kind of like older rock 'n' roll. It sounds like Thin Lizzy and
Black Sabbath and John Lee Hooker or Lightnin' Hopkins on a lot of
hormone shots. It's like the MC5. It's not rocket science. It feels
good and it rocks.''
</P>
<P>
   The album includes a Thin Lizzy cover song, ``Are You Ready,''
done as a present to Lizzy singer Phil Lynott's mother. ``I sent it
to her and she loved it,'' says Rollins. ``She sent us a nice
letter back, saying `God bless you boys.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Rollins will finish these band dates, then embark on a
spoken-word tour, before reuniting the group for a winter tour once
the album is released.
</P>

   Aerosmith's Joe Perry on Woodstock: An exhausted Aerosmith
arrived back home in Boston last week, ready to begin a month-long
vacation after 2 1/2 years of touring. But fatigue didn't stop
guitarist Joe Perry from mustering anger at the small group of
youths that ran amok at the end of Woodstock '99 and torched 12
tractor trailers, leaving a sad legacy after most other attendees
had a great time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of those kids have everything and they still want more,''
says Perry. ``They came to party and hang out, but they still had
to burn things. We've just been abroad and you see how much tougher
some of the kids have it over there, even in the civilized
countries. And then you see kids over here, torching the place
where they're partying. It made me disgusted. These kids have it
too easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Aerosmith was initially booked at Woodstock '99 (after enjoying
great success at Woodstock '94), but dropped out a few weeks before
the event. Some observers suggest that Aerosmith was smart to do
so, but Perry says, ``No, we don't feel that way. We don't have any
crystal ball about how things are going to turn out. We just wanted
more control over the production, which we wouldn't have had.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted us to sign over all our rights on the
pay-per-view, and on the concert album,'' Perry adds. ``Plus, they
wanted us to go out there with no soundcheck and no (stage) lights
of our own. . . . Some of that stuff wasn't brought up to us until
later. And then when we got a contract about it coming out of our
fax machine, we said the hell with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Perry remains a fan of the Woodstock concept of mass
social gatherings. ``I hope they can keep it together and have
future festivals. Europe has festivals like this all the time _ we
just played 10 of them. Some went for one night, some for three or
four nights. Every country has one or two of them, it seems. It's
no big deal over there. They have them every year. It's not like,
`Gee, I wonder if this will be as big as the one in 1994 or 1969?'
Who cares? Let's just have a festival and get some music
together.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Aerosmith dropped out of Woodstock, Perry was still
rumored to be a possible participant in a Jimi Hendrix tribute
conceived as Woodstock's finale, but which ended up just being a
video tribute. ``I was never contacted,'' Perry says.
</P>
<P>
   He did recently head down to Florida, though, for the unveiling
of a new roller coaster ride at Disney World entitled ``the Rock
'n' Roller Coaster Starring Aerosmith.'' Each car on the coaster
has its own stereo that booms Aerosmith songs. ``We took the kids
and had a great time. It was a blast,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   New album releases: Look for new albums within the next few
months from AC/DC, Alice In Chains (a boxed set), Michael Bolton,
Nine Inch Nails, Sting, 'N Sync, Creed, Melissa Etheridge, David
Bowie, Tony Bennett, Tori Amos, Method Man, Redman, Primus, Kenny
Wayne Shepherd, Toni Braxton, Mariah Carey, Eric Clapton, Celine
Dion (a hits collection), Ice Cube, Paul McCartney, Metallica, Nas,
Puff Daddy, Rage Against the Machine, LeAnn Rimes, Stone Temple
Pilots, and Barbra Streisand. And, according to Billboard, look for
new Christmas discs by the Backstreet Boys, Paula Cole, George
Strait, Amy Grant, Jewel, Garth Brooks, Reba McEntire, and, whoa,
Ringo Starr.

REALITY CHECK: FUNDAMENTALS DO MATTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is reality check time for Internet stocks. The results aren't
pretty.
</P>
<P>
   Many Internet stocks rallied Thursday after dropping sharply in
the morning. But most have fallen dramatically this week and are
now trading at prices 50 to 60 percent below the highs they reached
this spring.
</P>
<P>
   The simplest explanation for the selloff: a growing realization
by investors that the old-fashioned rules of economics apply to the
Internet sector, too.
</P>
<P>
   Investors are starting to appreciate that growth rates matter,
that companies need strategies that eventually will lead to
profitability, and that fierce competition will produce winners and
losers. Even something as dull as rising interest rates can have an
impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stocks can only detach from the fundamentals for so long,''
warns Nick Moore, a money manager with Jurika &AMP; Voyles in Oakland,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past few weeks, some drops of rain have fallen on the
Internet parade.
</P>
<P>
   In July, Amazon.com, the on-line bookstore, reported that its
second quarter sales were 7 percent higher than its sales in the
first quarter. For most companies, that would be good news. But for
a company that is supposed to be growing at light speed, the
numbers were disappointing.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were not as explosive as we have seen in the past,'' says
Eileen Leary, an analyst with State Street Research, a Boston
investment firm. It didn't help matters that Amazon once again said
it would not be profitable in the foreseeable future while it makes
investments in staff and a distribution system.
</P>
<P>
   Just this week, an influential Wall Street analyst threw cold
water on another set of high fliers, the on-line brokerage firms.
Credit Suisse First Boston analyst Bill Burnham said the volume of
electronic stock trading in the third quarter might not be any
greater than it was in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The news immediately drove down the share prices of companies
like ETrade and Ameritrade, two of the pioneers in electronic
brokerage.
</P>
<P>
   Competition also reared its ugly head this week, reminding
investors that gluts can develop even in brand-new fields. Tuesday,
four different Internet companies all launched initial public
offerings, the latest in a long line of dot-com companies to sell
stock this year. All four ended the day at prices below their
offering price, a sign that the appetite for Internet stocks is not
unlimited.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there was the latest round in the battle between
Microsoft and America Online, in which Microsoft hinted that it was
planning to offer Internet access service like AOL's at prices far
below the $21.95 that AOL charges per month.
</P>
<P>
   Whether you sell Internet access or tractors, a price war
inevitably leads to lower profits. ``The stock market can do the
math,'' says money manager Nick Moore. AOL's stock fell 4 3/16
Thursday to close at 83 1/4, about half the value it had in April.
</P>
<P>
   Where do we go from here?
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, opinions vary widely. Alan Loewenstein,
manager of John Hancock's Global Technology Fund, predicts that a
divide is coming. He thinks investors will begin to sort Internet
stocks into two categories: winners that have a business model that
can produce profits and losers that can't differentiate themselves
from the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, two Internet companies, Internet Capital Group and
HomeStore.com, both had successful IPOs. Internet Capital debuted
at 12 and closed at 24 7/16, while HomeStore, opening at 20,
finished up at 22 3/4. Such results suggest that Wall Street hasn't
given up on the whole field.
</P>
<P>
   Eileen Leary thinks investors will wait for more information.
She thinks the upcoming Christmas season will be crucial for
retailers like Amazon, who must prove they can get back on the fast
growth track.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Moore doesn't have to wait for more information. He has
made up his mind. ``The selloff isn't over by a mile,'' he says.
``Phase one may be over, but even the highest-quality companies in
this group are still three times as expensive as they should be.
We've had a correction, but the bubble isn't pierced yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore predicts it will take another round of disappointing
numbers to trigger the kind of rout he envisions.
</P>
<P>
   Who's right here? We aren't smart enough to know. But one thing
is clear: Keeping track of the Internet stocks isn't going to be
boring.

TOUR MAY BE OVER, BUT SEASON GOES ON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN BICKELHAUPT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What do you think cyclists do when they finish _ even win _ the
Tour de France? Here's a hint: They don't grin at the camera and
announce they're going to Disney World.
</P>
<P>
   No, they just keep riding.
</P>
<P>
   In football, baseball, hockey, the Super Bowl, World Series or
Stanley Cup playoffs signal the end of the season. Not so with
cycling. After the Tour, there are stage races in Europe and the
national criterium championship in America until the season finally
wraps up with the World Championships in Italy in October.
</P>
<P>
   So even though the US Postal Service team has dispersed, most of
the Tour riders are still competing.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Vaughters was the first to pack up and leave Europe
when he was part of the massive pileup on the Tour's second day of
racing. He was out of the Tour, but not out of racing. Vaughters
came back to the States and immediately entered the Red Zinger
Classic, a small stage race in Colorado. And his brush with the
Tour must have boosted his confidence; he won the Red Zinger.
</P>
<P>
   Tyler Hamilton, of Brookline, Mass., went back to his home in
Girona, Spain, after finishing 13th in the Tour. He and other
teammates will be riding in races in Spain, Denmark, and Germany,
with a visit to the USPRO Criterium championships in Chicago on
Aug. 22. Hamilton also plans to be in New England on Aug. 21 to
defend his title in the Mt. Washington race. He made it up the
mountain in 51:56 two years ago, and the record still stands. Some
of the team also will go to the stage race in Killington, Vt., over
Labor Day (won by Postal rider George Hincapie last year), before
going back to Europe for the worlds.
</P>
<P>
   Tour winner Lance Armstrong has by far the busiest schedule. The
day after finishing first in Paris, Armstrong was off to Belgium
and Holland to ride in some traditional post-Tour criterium races.
Then he jetted to New York, where he was feted by Mayor Rudy
Guiliani and interviewed on talk shows for two days until he was on
his way back to Europe.
</P>
<P>
   He's returning stateside next week, where his hometown of
Austin, Texas, will welcome him with a ticker-tape parade Monday.
The next day he'll go to the White House to meet with President
Clinton, then head West, where he'll tour the Nike campus (They're
one of his sponsors) in Oregon and do the Los Angeles talk-show
circuit.
</P>
<P>
   After some moutain bike races, including one in Mt. Snow, Vt.,
on Aug. 20, Armstrong likely will put away his cleats for the
racing season and think about his first offseason job _ fatherhood.
His wife, Kristin, is due to give birth to their first child in
late October.
</P>
<P>
   The team is busy, too, fielding calls from new potential
sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're definitely a hot commodity now, and it's exciting,''
said director of operations Dan Osipow from the Postal Service
team's headquarters in Sausalito, Calif. ``But there's only so many
names you can fit on a jersey.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the US Postal Service logo emblazoned on the
front of the jersey, half a dozen other sponsors own some real
estate on the shirt, including Visa, Trek, Volkswagen, Yahoo!, and
Shimano.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's show time
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The third annual Bicycle Show and Swap will be held next Sunday,
Aug. 15, at the Larz Anderson Museum of Transportation in
Brookline, Mass. The day will feature displays of classic bicycles,
a swap meet, clinics, and a centennial tribute to Massachusetts
native Major Taylor, who was the 1899 world champion. Admission is
$5 for adults, $3 for children . . . The folks at Mt. Snow, Vt.,
will be host for more than 2,000 mountain bike racers in the
National Off Road Bicycling Association series finals Aug. 19-22.
An NBC crew will be there, too, taping a program to air Sept. 11.
But they are cautious about saying Tour winner Armstrong will be
there. Armstrong said in France that he'd be at the race, though,
and his agent, Bill Stapleton, repeated it this week: ``Lance and I
will be there,'' he said. . . . US cyclists cleaned up at the Pan
American Games that finished earlier this week in Winnipeg,
Manitoba, as 20 of the 21 Americans won a medal. Karen Dunne, of
Colorado Springs, Colo., was the last winner with a victory in
Wednesday's women's 51-mile road race. It was the 11th gold medal
for the US team. Earlier in the week, both Alison Dunlap of
Colorado Springs and Steve Larsen of Bend, Ore., won golds in their
cross-country mountain bike races, and Elizabeth Emery of
Albuquerque , won the women's time trial. Sean Petty, director of
athlete performance at USA Cycling, attributed the US victories to
America's success in the Tour de France. ``Everyone had momentum
after Lance's win,'' he said.

HEAT ON CARROLL, PATRIOTS

   CNN/SI launches its NFL Preview show Aug. 15, and its analysts
wasted little time picking on the New England Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   Trev Alberts, a former All-American linebacker and first-round
draft pick of the Indianapolis Colts in 1994, told reporters that
the Patriots would have a disappointing season.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Bill Parcells left that team, there was a definite drop
in discipline on players, there was a definite difference in the
physical nature of the makeup,'' Alberts said. ``That's why I think
the Willie Clay thing was so interesting. I don't think this team
makes the playoffs, and I think the pressure will build throughout
the entire season on Coach (Pete) Carroll.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Patriots coach Ron Meyer is another analyst on the
hour-long show. He was also puzzled by the handling of Clay. ``I
was shocked,'' Meyer said. ``I looked at the numbers, and I thought
they could have juggled elsewhere and resolved that situation. I
don't know if it's a personality conflict nor do I know defensively
what they're thinking. . . I think Clay is a pretty good player.''
</P>
<P>
   Meyer was more optimistic about the Patriots' chances this
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they are going to get in and probably lose in the
opening round of the playoffs, simply because of Bledsoe and I like
their defensive attack as a whole,'' Meyer said. ``However, I think
its going to be a tough year for Pete. Bob Kraft wants more, so do
those fans up there. You saw a little indication of this last year
in the offseason when he changed up his coaches. That's always a
bad sign when you're the remaining coach on that staff. In other
words, it's who do we throw to the sharks first?''

Denver and brought rebounder Danny Fortson here. Mercer had more
interesting things to say. ``I would do anything to stay in
Boston,'' Mercer said Tuesday night. ``But I want what's fair.
(Rick) Pitino has his value. No one said anything when he signed
with the Celtics as head coach and he got his money _ what was fair
for him. You think Pitino would have went to the Celtics for $30
million instead of $50 million? That's the question you have to
ask.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- It was 3:34 p.m. Wednesday, 11 minutes before his
flight was scheduled to leave Logan Airport, and the 30-something
man in the business suit had received bad news at the United
Airlines gate. Because of a computer glitch, his first class seat
had been given away; he would have to travel coach. Nothing to be
done about it.
</P>
<P>
   In a huff, the man headed toward a bathroom, but the gate
attendants waved him back. More bad news: the flight was leaving
now, so he would have to use the restroom on the plane. That's
when, to put it nicely, the passenger lost his cool.
</P>
<P>
   ``You people are out to screw us!'' he shouted, according to
gate agents and passengers who watched him, mouths agape.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes after the man departed for good, airline workers
lamented the new state of affairs: Air travel is not so civil
anymore.
</P>
<P>
   These travelers aren't just venting inside cramped airplane
cabins, but at crowded ticket counters, airline gates, and baggage
carousels. Airport workers say it can make for tense and unpleasant
encounters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's getting tough these days, there's no doubt about it,''
said gate agent Lorna McKibben. ``It seems like they're getting
uglier and uglier.''
</P>
<P>
   Among airline workers, they are known as ``irates,'' these
passengers, battered by airport snafus, who release their
frustrations on the nearest employees. ``I've already had two
irates come in today,'' one baggage clerk said on a routine, sunny
Wednesday. And that, he said, was a good day.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since airlines were deregulated in the late 1970s, the
number of air travelers has skyrocketed, from 275 million in 1978
to 614 million in 1998. The sharp increase in passengers, fueled by
cheaper fares, has meant more flights, more planes, more
overcrowding, more delays, and the phenomenon known as ``air
rage.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been some dramatic examples of late. On a stormy
night in July, a Continental Airlines passenger, enraged over a
boarding pass dispute, pushed a Newark gate agent to the floor. As
such anecdotes pile up, some airlines are taking action, seeking
ways to train employees in handling angry fliers and pledging
vigilant prosecution of people who threaten their workers.
</P>
<P>
   Still, acts of airport violence are rare. About 26 million
passengers flew out of Logan Airport last year, Massachusetts Port
Authority officials said. That year, State Police were called about
a dozen times to remove unruly passengers from airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   Far more common, employees say, are the small, unreported
examples of tempers flaring. There's a sizable dent in the wall of
Logan's Delta Airlines baggage claim office where a furious
customer recently laid a punch. One baggage clerk said passengers
have hurled cups of coffee at the wall behind him.
</P>
<P>
   Another said a minister recently launched into a screaming fit
when his bag didn't arrive. Some clerks say they call for a police
officer, as a deterrent, several times a week.
</P>
<P>
   Some frustration, of course, is understandable. Air travel is
full of annoyances big and small, from the ride to the airport to
the trek through the parking lot, from the risk of delay to the
chance that the baggage simply won't arrive.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly Jorgenson, a 26-year-old engineer from Albuquerque, stood
slumped against an airline counter Wednesday, looking defeated. Her
car rental company had given her the wrong directions to her hotel
_ twice. The travel agent had messed up her reservations _ twice.
The hotel sent her wakeup call to the room next door.
</P>
<P>
   And when she finally arrived at the airport, thankful to be
headed home, she discovered that her flight was canceled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what road rage feels like,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And Stuart Kauffman, a noted chaos theorist who waited behind
Jorgenson in line, said there's little that compares to the chaos
of air travel.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can be in the clutches of a given airline from before noon
to 9 or 10 at night without being given anything more than a tiny
bag of pretzels,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But while frustration is inevitable, said Reg Brown, a
supervisor for United Airlines' Logan operations, a tantrum should
still rank as unacceptable behavior. There's something about air
travel that makes people lose their self-control.
</P>
<P>
   ``People only act like that at the airport,'' Brown said.
``Where else do you see people behave that way?''
</P>
<P>
   At United, spokesman Joe Hopkins said, a task force is studying
ways to train employees to handle customer rage. The airline has a
``zero tolerance'' policy, promising to arrest menacing passengers.
</P>
<P>
   But many airline employees said they have learned on their own
how to defuse a passenger's rage. The trick, they say, is a veneer
of calm and a bit of peer pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many times, I'll just sit there and look at him like that,''
said Business Express flight attendant Carol Coleman, raising her
eyebrows and throwing a give-me-a-break kind of glare. At that
point, she said, other passengers often chime in to help, saying,
``It's not her fault'' or ``leave her alone.''
</P>
<P>
   A little information helps, too, Brown said. When Denver airport
workers recently neglected to put two carts of luggage on a flight
to Boston, clerks kept the updates flowing, and the crowd of 108
potential irates remained calm.
</P>
<P>
   Full disclosure _ about delays, fares, and schedules _ is a
major theme of the ``passengers' bill of rights,'' a list of
initiatives the airline industry has proposed in the wake of
consumer and government pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the overtures, though, many passengers aren't appeased.
</P>
<P>
   And some are using the law to voice their frustration. The
passenger who attacked the Newark gate agent last month has sued
Continental, contending that his outburst was caused by poorly
trained employees and bad airport conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Many airline employees say air rage more often stems from
factors beyond an airport worker's control: increased air traffic,
poor weather, and flowing alcohol. Airline workers, they say, want
everything to go smoothly for their charges.
</P>
<P>
   Which is exactly what gate agents said they told the fuming
businessman who was angry at being called back from the airport
lavatory Wednesday: ``If we were out to screw you, we wouldn't have
told you, and you would have missed your flight.''

AWASH IN SPENDING IDEAS, PARTIES PUT THEIR FAITH IN THE NUMBERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ALOYSIUS FARRELL AND AARON ZITNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ They can't help themselves; it's the nature of the
beast. Whether it's Republicans pushing for a big tax cut or
Democrats trying to cover the cost of prescription drugs through
Medicare, politicians here are drooling over a projected
multitrillion-dollar budget surplus and vying over ways to spend
it.
</P>
<P>
   It was the GOP's turn Thursday, as the House and Senate passed a
historic $792 billion 10-year tax cut. President Clinton, with his
own plans for the money, promised a veto.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrat or Republican, only a few have paused in their
reveries to ask: What if the number crunchers are wrong?
</P>
<P>
   It is no casual question, for if recent experience is a guide,
the 10- and 15-year budget projections on which elected officials
are relying could be elusive and ephemeral.
</P>
<P>
   ``These future budget surpluses are . . . based on `pie in the
sky' projections,'' said Senator Robert Byrd, a Democrat from West
Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think `pie in the sky' is right,'' Byrd said, upon
reflection. ``The projections are so far out into the stratosphere
_ more than a decade away _ that we would need the Hubble Telescope
to track them down.''
</P>
<P>
   Lyndon Johnson. Jimmy Carter. Ronald Reagan. George Bush. That's
just a partial roster of US presidents whose optimistic economic
projections ultimately failed to materialize, and so gave them
considerable political pain. And none of them ever had the temerity
to claim they could see 15 years into the economic future, which
Clinton has done. Because of the difficulty of making long-term
projections, the House traditionally forecasts spending and tax
revenues for no more than five years, the Senate for 10.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason for the anticipated huge budget surpluses _
$5.9 trillion over the next 15 years by one administration measure
_ is the failure of congressional and White House analysts to
predict the feverish growth of the economy when compiling the
federal budgets over the last six years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Office of Management and Budget and the Congressional
Budget Office have been wrong _ horrendously wrong,'' said Stephen
Moore, an analyst with the Cato Institute. ``Three years ago they
were predicting $100- to $200 billion deficits, instead we got
$100- to $200 billion surpluses.''
</P>
<P>
   The OMB at the White House and the CBO on Capitol Hill are the
two agencies that most of official Washington relies upon when it
comes to predicting budget deficits and surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995 the CBO predicted that the nation would face a $400
billion budget deficit in 2005. Within three years, as the economy
continued to exceed expectations, the CBO changed that prediction
to a $100 billion surplus: a swing of a half-trillion dollars. A
key reason was that the economy grew faster than most economists
expected.
</P>
<P>
   The list of variables that could eat up a projected surplus is
long and multifarious: A recession. A slump in the dollar. A leap
in health care costs. A drag in productivity gains. A failure by
Congress to respect its current caps on discretionary spending.
</P>
<P>
   The current projections are under suspicion for some reasons
that are beyond the forecasters' control. No one can claim to know
how fast the economy, or the work force, or the cost of living will
grow. Moreover, government forecasters must assume that the
spending caps will remain in law.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is fiddling with the numbers,'' said Henry Aaron, an
economist with the Brookings Institution who studies government
spending policy. CBO and OMB ``are using the methods they've used
all along.'' The agencies have never built a deep recession into
their forecasts and today's economy gives few reasons to do so,
Aaron said. And CBO and OMB ``are duty-bound'' to assume that the
existing laws on spending will hold, even if many people believe
Congress will change them.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, under the guise of emergency spending, the discretionary
budget caps are already eroding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just the other day the House of Representatives determined
that the money to pay for the decennial census in the year 2000
required an emergency appropriaton outside of those limits,'' said
Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a Democrat from New York. ``All of
a sudden, we have made it into an emergency.''
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill, ``because we have these big surplus
projections, people are saying now we can go on another spending
spree,'' said Moore.
</P>
<P>
   Yet economic ``expansions don't always last forever. Governments
tend to go through boom and bust cycles,'' said Moore. ``When there
is a boom cycle, like where we are now. . . . The politicians say,
`This is going to last forever and we can spend and spend and
spend.' And then when the expansion ends we go from 7 percent to 2
percent growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can make the case these surpluses are a curse because they
have been an excuse to break down all semblance of fiscal
discipline,'' Moore said.
</P>
<P>
   Moore, a libertarian, sides with the House and Senate
Republicans who Thursday gave final passage to the sweeping $792
billion tax cut. The GOP plan would be the largest tax cut since
1981, trimming the bottom 15 percent income tax rate to 14 percent
in 2003 and reducing the other rates by 1 percentage point in 2005.
It would also give two-income couples relief from the ``marriage
penalty,'' gradually repeal the federal estate tax and trim the
capital gains tax rate for most investors.
</P>
<P>
   But Byrd and others think that the inherently risky business of
making economic projections is a reason to forestall such a large
tax cut. The Clinton administration, which has opposed the size of
the tax cut, is exploring the idea of using the surpluses to buy
back Treasury securities and thus reduce the $5.5 trillion national
debt.
</P>
<P>
   During the debate on the tax bill last week, Moynihan charged
that the secret strategy of tax-cutting Republicans since the
Reagan years has been to use robust budget projections as an excuse
to cut taxes _ and thus starve the federal government when the
projected revenues don't materialize.
</P>
<P>
   A series of ``rosy scenarios,'' issued by OMB during the Reagan
administration, resulted in annual deficits of $150 to $200 billion
in the late 1980s and early 1990s, Moynihan noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deficits _ that had presumably been the horror of conservative
financial thought _ now became something attractive because they
could be used to reduce the size of government itself,'' said
Moynihan. ``The secret solution was to let the federal budget
deficits rise, thus leaving Congress no alternative but to cut
domestic programs.''
</P>
<P>
   The GOP is at it again, said Moynihan: ``We are proposing to
spend a surplus, sir, that does not exist.''
</P>
<P>
   Tax-cutting Republicans and Democrats, however, argue that their
tax cut is but a meager 25 percent of the expected surplus _
leaving plenty of room for error. And Moore and others point out
that the projections could just as well be too pessimistic as
optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Robert Kerrey, a Democrat from Nebraska, defended the
CBO projections when explaining his support for the tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``The congressional budget office, though they obviously will
from time to time make mistakes, forecasts that there will be $3
trillion more coming in over the next 10 years than we have in
obligated expenditures,'' said Kerrey. ``I think one would have to
imagine some pretty unusual economic circumstances to imagine a
downturn in the economy that would eliminate a $3 trillion
forecast.''

CENTER STAGE SEEN DIVIDING GORE FROM LIBERAL WING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore's campaign strategy has been
unshakable for months. Stay to the center, court the suburban
middle-class, and keep focused on the general election. The
strategy presumed that traditional Democratic constituencies such
as labor, minority groups, and women would tag along.
</P>
<P>
   But even as polls show Gore with a healthy lead over his lone
Democratic challenger, former senator Bill Bradley, a potentially
serious weakness has been exposed in the vice president's campaign.
Though Gore has locked up support from most of the party
establishment, he seems out of sync with many liberal party
activists who are crucial to winning the nomination, and that could
cause him serious trouble in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, sensing that Gore has left his left flank exposed, has
rushed to rally the liberal wing. The former New Jersey senator,
for example, has moved to the left of Gore on gun control,
suggesting that every handgun be registered, while Gore has said
only that new handguns should be licensed. Bradley also has made a
strong pitch to minority groups, including a high-profile speech in
Chicago Thursday, and has said his top issue is race relations. And
he is trying to persuade the AFL-CIO to stay neutral during the
primaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is this huge void because the vice president has not
connected to progressive Democrats,'' said Senator Paul Wellstone,
the liberal Minnesota Democrat who has endorsed Bradley. ``I think
that will be real important for the nomination because so many of
the organizers, the people who are really willing to do the work
for you, are the progressive Democrats. It is critically
important.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore aides insist that the vice president carries his liberal
credentials proudly and provided a long list of examples of
endorsements from members of minority groups, union leaders, and
others. ``The vice president has very strong support among the
progressive element of the Democratic Party,'' said Gore campaign
spokesman Roger Salazar.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Gore's problem was emphasized, unintentionally, when
President Clinton recently took a ``poverty tour'' across the
United States. When the president visited Appalachia, Indian
reservations, and other areas relatively untouched by the nation's
economic prosperity, many liberal activists viewed the trip as
proof of their point that the prosperity touted by the Clinton-Gore
administration has left too many people behind.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley sent an early signal that he would court the liberal
wing when he sought and won the endorsement of Wellstone, who
dropped out of the presidential race after considering it for
months. Now, Bradley hopes to win the endorsement of Senator
Patrick Moynihan of New York, who has criticized the Clinton-Gore
administration's effort to overhaul welfare..
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Bradley is not running as a self-described liberal.
Rather, he prefers to shun such labels and to portray himself as in
tune with the county's ``idealism.''
</P>
<P>
   For Gore, the disconnect with his party's liberal wing is a deja
vu experience. In 1988, Gore lost his bid for the Democratic
nomination to former Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis, who
swept to a series of primary victories with help from liberal
constituencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are very important to you,'' Dukakis said, referring to
the liberal activists who helped him win the nomination. ``I am the
only person who beat Al Gore in an election.''
</P>
<P>
   Dukakis, however, lost the general election when Republicans
castigated him as a liberal, and the lesson of the ``L word'' is
well remembered by the Democratic party establishment. When Bill
Clinton ran for the presidency in 1992, he adopted a centrist New
Democrat agenda, with Gore as his running mate. The Clinton-Gore
administration has since had a rocky relationship with liberals on
issues ranging from gay rights to welfare to affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   The potential defection of liberals to Bradley is significant
because this group generally is not among those who suffer from
``Clinton fatigue'' as a result of the Monica Lewinsky affair and
the impeachment proceedings. Instead, if liberals are put out with
Clinton, it is because they have long been at odds with the
administration's ties to the Democratic Leadership Council, the
party's leading centrist organization. To many liberals, especially
those from urban areas, Gore's focus on issues such as suburban
sprawl does not resonate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore is in the unenviable position of having to reconcile the
`New Democrats' with (AFL-CIO head) John Sweeney and the Reverend
Jesse Jackson,'' said Norman Birnbaum, one of the founders of the
Campaign for America's Future, a coalition of unions and
humanitarian and environmental groups. ``Bradley doesn't carry any
of this baggage and is moving to get this vote by saying that
poverty and race are the central American problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Amy Isaacs, national director of Americans for Democratic
Action, the nation's leading liberal political organization, said
that her 75,000-member organization is ``pretty evenly split'' in
supporting Gore and Bradley, indicating a surprising softness of
support for the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's effort to woo members of minority groups is at the
center of his campaign strategy, according to Jacque DeGraff, a
senior Bradley adviser and the campaign's director for delegate
selection. He said Bradley can win the nomination if he makes
``substantial inroads into the black vote.''
</P>
<P>
   ``President Clinton is highly regarded in the African-American
community; we don't dispute that,'' DeGraff said. ``But the
question about who will occupy the White House for the next four
years is a different question.''
</P>
<P>
   DeGraff maintained that Gore was not warmly embraced by blacks
during the 1988 campaign, while he said Bradley has longstanding
credibility among blacks that will pay off during the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But Representative Charles Rangel, a New York Democrat and one
of Gore's leading black supporters, disagreed, saying: ``I think
Bill Bradley is just an alternative right now to Gore. When it all
settles, Gore will be the candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Bradley target is organized labor. Both Bradley and Gore
have had their differences with labor, with both supporting the
North American Free Trade Act, which was opposed by the AFL-CIO.
Gore, as the incumbent vice president who has been supported by
labor in the past, is expected to be endorsed by the AFL-CIO. That
endorsement is considered crucial because the unions spend so much
time and money working on behalf of their presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the AFL-CIO requires a two-thirds vote of its board for a
presidential endorsement. ``Gore doesn't have two-thirds right
now,'' said a top-ranking labor official who spoke on condition of
anonymity. While Gore is strongly backed by the educational and
service unions, he is facing some opposition with the industrial
trade unions, such as the steelworkers and auto workers, who are
upset with the administration's trade policies. While no one thinks
Bradley will get the AFL-CIO's endorsement, it is possible that the
union will not have enough votes to back Gore, which would be a
major embarrassment for the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bradley has worked it real hard,'' said Steven Rosenthal, the
AFL-CIO's political director. ``He has people around him'' who know
labor unions very well. But Rosenthal said Gore ``has done a very
good job of developing relationships with leaders in the labor
movement.''

PLAIN TRUTH IS A PITINO PLAN IS NOT POSSIBLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ron Mercer went to Denver. Six seconds later the moaning began.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pitino has no plan!'' they shrieked. ``All he does is react.''
</P>
<P>
   Plan. That sounds good. The Marshall Plan. Stalin's Five-Year
Plan. The Slim-Fast Plan. It always sounds so great, so organized,
so authoritative, so brilliant. Life will be great if only you
stick to your plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plan?'' inquires Rick Pitino. ``I had a plan when I came out
of Kentucky. My plan was to get (Tim) Duncan or (Keith) Van Horn.
Now my plan is to get 10 good players.''
</P>
<P>
   A plan was possible in Ye Olden Days. Red Auerbach never
announced any plans, did he? He had Bill Russell (getting him was
the entire plan). But Red had a plan, all right. The plan was to
keep Bill Russell happy. Everything else took care of itself
because the players he got weren't going anywhere if Red decided
otherwise. There was no free agency. There were no agents
whispering in players' ears.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents were free to implement one, three, or five-year plans,
if they chose. With full control of player movement, management
actually could build a team, step by painstaking step.
</P>
<P>
   It's a seller's market now. Good players have the leverage. They
go where they want to go and leave when they want to leave,
sometimes in advance of a contract expiration by making themselves
a poison pill who must be traded.
</P>
<P>
   A good team cannot count on maintaining any long-term plan,
because recent NBA history teaches us that there is an inevitable
squeaky wheel. Just being an integral part of a very successful
team is no longer a primary goal. No matter what they say, most
players are far more interested in getting the Big Score than in
getting The Ring. When an accomplished, but ringless, player gets
to be 30 or so, he sometimes decides he'd like the jewelry, usually
because ``I've got all the money I need.'' Even then, you don't see
too many guys go for really short money.
</P>
<P>
   It's a different talent pool, too. All drafts aren't created
equal, except in the sense that the typical NBA draft these days is
overpopulated with immature kids who really aren't ready to be
professionals in any sense, be it technical or emotional. Anyway,
people are very upset that Pitino has now dealt away both his 1997
No. 3 pick (Chauncey Billups) and his 1997 No. 6 pick (Ron Mercer).
What kind of madness is this?
</P>
<P>
   Pitino shrugs. ``When you look at the draft this year,'' he
says, ``would I be surprised if any player in it is traded when his
time is up?''
</P>
<P>
   The answer, of course, is no. It's a very so-so draft, starting
with the No. 1 pick (Elton Brand, in case you've forgotten
already). There will be lots of movement among these people over
the next two or three years, as GM after GM will say, ``Hey, let's
see if your guy looks better in my uniform, and my guy looks better
in your uniform, because it certainly isn't working out the way it
is now.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking back at the '97 draft, everyone knew it was top-heavy.
You had a 100 percent guarantee in Duncan and a 98 percent
guarantee in Van Horn. The drop-off after that was Niagara Falls.
Pitino, it turns out, made a mistake in Billups at No. 3 and a very
good decision in Mercer at No. 6. Now Mercer and his agent team
have major delusions of financial grandeur, and he is an ex-Celtic
as a result.
</P>
<P>
   This just isn't the same NBA Pitino left in 1989, and give the
guy credit for trying to adjust. Two years ago, he couldn't
understand why a team could no longer average 116.7 points a game,
the way his '88-89 Knicks did. He knows now. Two years ago, he
decided that in order to win a championship you needed three
All-Stars. We now have a champion with just two, but the right kind
of two.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did think you needed three,'' he admits. ``San Antonio
proves you can do it with two great ones surrounded by the right
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitino may not have what you call a plan, but he most certainly
has an idea. He knows how he wants to play next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had too many guys who wanted to score last year,'' he
points out. ``We have changed. People will have their roles.
Antoine and Paul will get shots. Vitaly and Danny want to kill
people and get rebounds. Battie wants to block shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Now comes Calbert Cheaney. He is a 28-year-old mid-sized talent
whose career has slid continually backward after a promising start.
``He turned down a sign-and-trade for more money to come here,''
beams Pitino. ``If we can get him back where he was . . .'' Having
played for Bob Knight, Cheaney should have no trouble adjusting to
the volume level at practice.
</P>
<P>
   The two key players remain Antoine Walker and Kenny Anderson,
each a highly-flawed diamond.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've given Kenny an ultimatum,'' says Pitino. ``I said,
`You've got yourself a track coach; now get yourself into the best
shape of your career. This has got to be your bust-out year. Either
that, or you're going to be a bust, period.' We know he has
offensive talent, but there is no reason he can't play better
defense. He's got the foot quickness and hand speed.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Antoine, Pitino sounds threatening. ``If he comes in
great shape and totally changes what I feel needs to be changed,
great,'' Pitino coos. ``But there will be no more babying. It's
either (excrete) or get off the pot. I will not hesitate benching
anyone who doesn't play with the idea of pass first and shoot
second and who isn't willing to work.''
</P>
<P>
   (This doesn't sound like something Antoine wants to hear.
Perhaps he should, how you say, plan to be somewhere else next
year.)
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, does any of this constitute a Capital P, Plan? Nope.
He's talking a team for next season, not a concept for 2002. You
and I may disagree, but he thinks it's a team that can compete in
the Eastern Conference in 1999-2000. Forget about a Plan. The
original Plan A is playing in San Antonio. The original Plan B is
playing in New Jersey. Rick Pitino's Plan C is waking up every day
looking for someone who might make you one percent better than you
were yesterday.

COMING SOON: AN UPDIKE MUSICAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Who'd a thunk it? Cameron Mackintosh's next big musical
extravaganza will be John Updike's ``The Witches of Eastwick.''
</P>
<P>
   The London-based Mackintosh, producer of such hits as ``Miss
Saigon,'' ``The Phantom of the Opera,'' and ``Les Miserables,''
says he submitted a list of ideas for potential musicals to two
young American writers he likes, John Dempsey and Dana Rowe. The
team picked the Updike story, best known to the public via the Jack
Nicholson/Cher/Michelle Pfeiffer movie, filmed in Cohasset 13 years
ago. Mackintosh then bought rights from Updike's West Coast agent,
Dan Sherman. ``Updike is very pleased that he's becoming a
musical,'' the producer says. ``But, as with the movie, he doesn't
want to have anything to do with the creation itself.'' No comment
from the sage of Beverly Farms.
</P>
<P>
   The British press has been pumping star names like Catherine
Zeta-Jones and Nicholson-esque dirty old man Michael Douglas for
the London premiere, but Mackintosh says casting hasn't been
finalized. ``These roles will have to be played with terrific
panache,'' he says. ``Famous film stars aren't used to doing eight
shows a week for a year.'' Although he hasn't booked any American
dates for the show, he describes ``Witches'' as a ``contemporary,
traditional American musical comedy,'' written and staffed by
Yanks. Apart from the writers, Mackintosh says he has recruited the
``cream of Connecticut'' _ the late Michael Bennett's
choreographer, Bob Avian, production designer Bob Crowley, and
director Eric Schaeffer _ to work on ``Witches.''
</P>
<P>
   The show starts rehearsing in March, and should open in late May
or early June at the Theatre Royal Drury Lane. Mackintosh thinks
his writing team has produced at least two show-stopping tunes,
``Dance With the Devil'' and the finale, ``You're the Man.'' ``It's
very funny and at the same time it will have Updike's special
twists on life.''

   When the Improper Bostonian recently asked local notables about
their summer reading plans, the self-effacing Alan Dershowitz felt
compelled to mention his own forthcoming novel, ``Just Revenge.'' A
reviewer for Publishers Weekly also spent time with the book, and
rendered this opinion: ``Subtlety is not Dershowitz's strong suit,
nor is literary finesse, but he makes up for these shortcomings
with the dramatic and tragic events that frame the plot, and the
intensity of his moral argument.'' . . . Damage control time
(again) at the Christian Science Church, as Caroline Fraser's
``God's Perfect Child: Living and Dying in the Christian Science
Church'' finds its way into bookstores. Fraser, a former Scientist
and a careful (if prolix) writer, has been working on this tome for
several years, and, put gently, its publication will not win any
new converts to Mary Baker Eddy-dom. Former Scientist Spalding Gray
gives it this blurb: ``For me, `God's Perfect Child' acted like an
excellent deprogramming map, freeing me from that demented, magical
world I thought I'd left behind.'' I can't mention this book
without putting in a plug for my friend Thomas Simmons's excellent
``The Unseen Shore: Memories of a Christian Science Childhood,''
which you can get at a library or through bibliofind.com. . . .
Friends? Plugs? That would lead me directly to John Spooner's new
book, ``Do You Want to Make Money or Would You Rather Fool
Around?'' which is excerpted in this month's Playboy. If you buy
the magazine, you get not only Spooner but also, um, a Joyce Carol
Oates short story! What a deal!

   John Harrington, who edits the ``Insider's Guide'' series that
failed to capture my imagination a few weeks ago, notes that his
Cape Cod guide does mention Provincetown's delightful Portuguese
bakery, in a sidebar that escaped my attention. My mistake.
Faithful reader Amy Whorf McGuiggan, who spent her childhood
summers in P-town, points out that the cognoscenti call the
bakery's fried-dough patties that I enjoyed ``flippers.'' A detail
not to be found in the ``insider's'' guide.

POSTS ARE A GOOD SUB FOR CONCRETE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Q. I am building a 10- by 24-foot addition to the house. The
contractor suggested using Lally columns set in concrete for
supports instead of a foundation. I realize this is within code,
but I am concerned about plumbing freezing in that open crawl
space. Is this OK?
</P>
<P>
   SUSAN ROE, Bedford, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Lally columns are steel posts filled with concrete; they are
OK, and a lot less expensive than a foundation of any kind. As for
the open crawl space under the addition, water lines could freeze
in winter. To prevent this, make sure the lines are between the
joists under the floor, then insulate between the joists with
6-inch fiberglass insulation, with the paper backing up, touching
the floor boards above.
</P>
<P>
   As for the open crawl space, you can have a skirt board
installed, which will make the addition look better, help insulate
the crawl space, and keep out vermin. Your contractor will know
exactly what that means, and could put one in. Make sure the crawl
space is well ventilated from spring through autumn.
</P>

   When Benjamin Chernoff of Brookline, Mass. asked if a rotted
rail on the bottom of his paneled wood garage door could be fixed,
the handyman must have seen the forest and not the trees, or seen
the trees and not the forest, because he did not give enough
information.
</P>
<P>
   The handyman said the bottom rail can be cut off and replaced,
which is true enough, but three readers said there is a better way.
</P>
<P>
   And that is to replace the entire bottom panel, replacement
parts of which are available at overhead door companies.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Stevens of Framingham, Mass. said he bought a replacement
panel at Door Systems Inc. of Framingham (508-875-3508; a Boston
number is 617-237-0404). The section cost $130, said Stevens. He
undid the hinges, threw away the rotted panel, rehinged the
replacement, tacked on a new gasket, and was done.
</P>
<P>
   John Barrett of Reading, Mass. said he got his door panel from
Overhead Door in Danvers, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   And, wrote Michael Boyle of Reading, Mass.: ``Atlantic Overhead
Door of Winthrop will replace the bottom section of a garage door
for a reasonable price . . . I found Atlantic Overhead door in the
Yellow Pages.''
</P>
<P>
   Thank you, gentlemen, the handyman stands corrected. But it
won't happen again.
</P>

   Q. I have discovered lead in my water. I can get a filter to
remove it but, in the meantime, can I shower with this leaded
water?
</P>
<P>
   CONCERNED
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes, you can shower, even bathe in your leaded water, because
lead does not enter the body through the skin, according to the
National Safety Council's Regional Lead Information Center. Most
city and well water does not contain lead, but if it does there are
filters you can buy to remove it. You may be getting lead in the
water because your plumbing lines and solder on copper lines
contain lead. Water is picking up the lead as it passes through the
pipes, more so if it sits in the pipes for a time. Sometimes
letting the water run for a few minutes before using will purge the
lead.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. After replacing the sill in a window (circa 1974), I find it
difficult to open and close; it really takes effort. Did I do
something wrong? I did put in new jambs a while ago.
</P>
<P>
   PERPLEXED
</P>
<P>
   A. I am only guessing, but I believe you reduced the distance
between jambs at the bottom of the window, making the sash tighter
in the jambs. Measure the distance between jambs at the top of the
window, then at the bottom. If the measurements are just an eighth
inch or so different, then try spreading the bottom part of the
jambs just a bit.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I had new paper put in the bathroom. In two weeks, the paper
above the shower stall started to tear, and some seams came loose.
I used Seam Sealer, a super sort of wallpaper paste, which helped a
little, but some of it still is coming up. What's wrong?
</P>
<P>
   NANCY McGANNON, Hanover, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. The fix is easy and inexpensive, and within your realm. You
can continue with Seam Sealer or PolySeamSeal, an adhesive caulk. I
like the idea of the PolySeamSeal because it comes in a caulking
cartridge with a nozzle for inserting small beads of caulking.
These pastes and the PolySeamSeal can be applied thinly, but may
take a while to grab. You have to hold down the paper until it
sticks permanently. Don't make the caulking too thick; you will end
up with a lump in the paper.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. There is some cheap plywood paneling in the seasonal cottage
I am buying in Maine. I'd like to put vertical boards over this
paneling. Can I nail the boards into the paneling?
</P>
<P>
   LINDA ROEMER, Peabody, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. No; the plwyood is too thin to hold a nail for long.Easiest
and fastest is to nail 1 x 2 or 1 x 3 horizontal furring strips,
driving nails through the plywood and into the studs. Then nail the
vertical boards to the strips, which should be placed 16 24 inches
apart.

THE FLOW OF BLOOD AND MONEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Journal of the American Medical Association delivered the
latest reason why gun makers cost us more than they are worth.
</P>
<P>
   In the last decade, annual gun sales have fluctuated between
$2.1 and $3.5 billion. In this week's JAMA, a study found that the
cost of treating gunshot wounds in 1994 was $2.3 billion. Of that
$2.3 billion, $1.1 billion was paid by American taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In addition to the enormous human toll of gun violence, the
costs of treating these injuries imposes a financial burden on
society,'' the study said.
</P>
<P>
   The study, led by Philip Cook of Duke University's Sanford
Institute of Public Policy, analyzed new hospital data from New
York and Maryland as well as past studies. A round of bullets costs
a few dollars. A single name-brand handgun costs a few hundred
dollars. The cost of a nonfatal hospitalization and follow-up care
for a gunshot injury is $35,367 a year.
</P>
<P>
   The cost for fatal wounds, obviously much less since there is no
``follow-up,'' was between $12,000 and $13,000. The average cost of
all gunshot injuries was $17,000.
</P>
<P>
   The more expensive the injury, such as wounds to the spinal
cord, the more likely the government has to pick up the costs. Only
18 percent of the cost for gunshot wounds are picked up by private
insurance. Taxpayers pay 49 percent. The other 33 percent falls
under a category called ``self-pay.'' That is a dubious category,
since so many gunshot victims are poor. The study cited data in
Massachusetts that suggest that ``self-pay'' cases are nearly six
times more unlikely than other cases to ever pay their medical
bills and thus, increase charges for other patients.
</P>
<P>
   The study said that it was the first one of its kind to give a
nationally representative estimate for the sources of payment for
medical costs for gunshot wounds. Its overall numbers echo other
studies. A study at Charity Hospital in New Orleans that was
presented at the 1996 meeting of the American Academy of Orthopedic
Surgeons found that the average cost of gun injuries was $19,000.
</P>
<P>
   At that hospital, gunshot victims took up one-third of the
orthopedic beds and consumed 20 to 30 percent of hospital
resources. Because 51 percent of gunshot victims were uninsured,
the hospital had to eat $6 million in costs in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``Treating gunshot wounds was probably the single biggest drain
on our orthopedic resources,'' said study co-author Dr. Robert
Barrack of Tulane University. ``It is not elective whether the
trauma center provide treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   If it is not elective to treat such costly gunshot victims,
handguns should no longer be an optional purchase for Americans.
The cost has become so great that it has spurred lawsuits from many
cities, including Boston, which says gunshot injuries cost the city
$10 million a year. The cost has become so great in the hospitals
that an editorial in Orthopedics Today in 1996 said:
</P>
<P>
   ``We can no longer afford to have the safety of our society, the
costs to our society of health care and the prevention of mortality
and morbidity of gunshot wounds dictated by groups such as the
National Rifle Association . . . under the guise of civil rights
and the Second Amendment. The risk of unregulated handguns far
outweighs the occasional legitimate need for personal defense. The
days of the Wild West are over. . . . As professionals whose time
is spent caring for the victims of this social problem, whose
responsibility it is to prevent epidemic disease, we must take a
stand on gun control. There is no place for assault weapons and
semiautomatic firearms on our streets or in our homes. Handguns
must be regulated nationally or equally from state to state.
</P>
<P>
   ``We eliminated lead from paint because of the dangers to our
children. We require air bags and restraints in our cars to prevent
highway fatalities. We have created safety codes for the
construction industry to reduce accidents in the home. But we are
unable to control handguns even though it has been conclusively
shown that they are responsible for increasing numbers of
accidental injuries and deaths. Our legislators are unable to stand
up and be counted because of the corrupting influence of powerful
lobbies and special interest groups.''
</P>
<P>
   The concerns of Orthopedics Today are being played out in New
Orleans. The city is suing the gun industry. But the NRA-backed
Louisiana Legislature and Governor Mike Foster have passed a law
that attempts to block the suit.
</P>
<P>
   A gun costs no more than a television set. Bullets cost no more
than a can of soda out of a machine. Their carnage has emergency
rooms across the nation expending resources beyond reason. Gun
sales were $2.2 million in 1997. It is not worth the $2.3 billion
in blood and money, at the trauma center.

`MY LIFE' ROAMS AN INNER LANDSCAPE 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
MY LIFE SO FAR 
Directed by: Hugh Hudson 
Screnplay by: Simon Donald (based on Denis Forman's memoir) 
Starring: Colin Firth, Rosemary Harris, Irene Jacob, Tcheky Karyo,
Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, Malcolm McDowell, Kelly McDonald,
Robert Norman 
Running time: 93 minutes 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The producing-directing team of David Puttnam and Hugh Hudson
has, artistically speaking, led a charmed life on Scottish soil,
first with ``Chariots of Fire,'' then with ``Greystoke'' and now,
again, with ``My Life So Far.'' The new film is based on the
between-the-wars boyhood of Sir Denis Forman, a British TV and
opera impresario, who came of age in the Scottish Highlands near
Argyll, almost magically coccooned in a great stone nest known as
Kiloran House. Puttnam and Hudson made atmosphere count in
``Chariots of Fire,'' and it counts for even more in this luminous
family chronicle bathed in mists and teeming with the energetic
members of a loving, eccentric family.
</P>
<P>
   As far as 10-year-old Forman surrogate Fraser Pettigrew, played
by Robert Norman, is concerned, everything that takes place there
is instantly mythologized. But if he's wide-eyed, he's also
clear-eyed. He begins by worshipping his exuberant and romantic
crackpot father, Edward, played by Colin Firth with a kind of fizzy
stiffness. Edward's passions include Beethoven, the Bible, sphagnum
moss and, in a lapse that cracks the family's united front, a
charming French cellist. She's been brought to Kiloran as the bride
of Fraser's uncle and Edward's brother-in-law and rival, the rich
Morris, whose love of jazz is matched by Edward's hatred of it, and
whose love for Irene Jacob's sparkling Heloise is unfortunately
shared. Which means that in the space of a year the hitherto
adoring son must ask himself if he can understand and forgive his
reduced-in-stature father.
</P>
<P>
   The showdown built around this jolting instance of sexual
waywardness in the otherwise puritanical family never altogether
obscures the golden benevolence of life at Kiloran. Although Morris
and Edward are rivals for the eventual control of Kiloran, the
ascension is not an immediately looming thing, thanks to the silken
strength of the family matriarch, Rosemary Harris's Gamma. Although
she doesn't have much screen time, the reliably flawless Harris
sees to it that there's no doubt that her presence shapes the tenor
of life in the great stone pile. Her ironclad rule seems to result
less in a feeling of control than in a reassuring climate of
harmony. But then the film is too generous-hearted not to draw all
its characters richly. It's an enchanted story of childhood
idealizations that beguile and move us.
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm McDowell's Uncle Morris, stern and pushy as he may be on
the outside, obviously has a loving heart. And Edward's idea of
harvesting and selling the copious quantities of moss on the estate
is hardly divorced from practicality, given the World War I
battlefield discovery that moss, used when bandages ran out, not
only has absorbent qualities, but anti-bacterial ones. The children
are managed and disciplined, but never in ways that crush their
spirits. Although we don't realize it until we feel the force
behind one of the film's payoffs, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio's
Moira is more than the children's passive mother and Edward's
indulgent wife. When the crunch comes, she reveals convincing
degrees of strength that mark her as her mother's daughter.
</P>
<P>
   It's rare that a film gives us a family that feels like a
family, but this one does, and at no cost to their distinctive
personalities and individual traits. Young Norman does all that can
be asked in the role of the boy who learns a lot between his 10th
and 11th birthdays. Without ever descending to cuteness, the film
convinces us as well that the adults must manage a bit of growing
up, too, and do. The detailing is beautiful and loving, not just
the period authenticity and visual handsomeness, but the emotional
detailing. ``My Life So Far'' is one of those rare films that gives
us a life, several lives in fact. It deepens steadily, not just in
nostalgia, but like a novel whose characters stay with you. And yet
its most magical moments _ as when a French aviator lands in a
field on the estate and romances one of Fraser's teenage sisters _
seem just as natural a part of the rituals of life at that sweet
little latter-day Camelot called Kiloran.

`MYSTERY MEN' UNRAVELS COMIC HEROES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
MYSTERY MEN 
Directed by: Kinka Usher 
Screenplay by: Neil Cuthbert &AMP; Brent Forrester (based on Bob
Buirden's comic book) 
Starring: Hank Azaria, Claire Forlani, Janeane Garofalo, Eddie
izzard, Greg Kinnear, Jenifer Lewis, William H. Macy, Kel Mitchell,
Lena Olin, Pras, Paul Reubens, Geoffrey Rush, Ben Stiller, Wes
Studi, Tom Waits 
Running time: 120 minutes 
Rated: PG-13 (comic action violence and crude humor) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Mystery Men'' begins terrifically, then dwindles away to
overextended ordinariness in its action sequences. Maybe it's
because its comic-book anti-heroes don't really specialize in
action, but in aspiration. The fact that they don't even have much
in the way of powers, let alone superpowers, is the gimmick in this
film drawn from the popular Dark Horse comic book. ``Mystery Men''
goofs with ironic verve on the whole idea of comic strip heroes.
There's something desperate, and desperately funny, in the idea of
a team of losers trying to parlay their miniscule gifts into heroic
displays of crime-fighting prowess.
</P>
<P>
   In an apocryphal Champion City, stylistically in the dark comic
book gothic mainstream with its looming, nocturnal,
half-futuristic, half-retro look, three would-be gangbusters begin
by falling on their faces while a gang of thugs is routed by the
city's official hero, Greg Kinnear's Captain Amazing. So The Blue
Raja, The Shoveler and Mr. Furious decide to beef up their team. To
their amazement, Hank Azaria's Blue Raja (who wears a turban,
affects a British accent and throws forks and spoons at the enemy),
William H. Macy's hard-hatted digger called The Shoveler and Ben
Stiller's Mr. Furious, whose temple veins bulge when he gets angry
though nothing else happens, find that most of the applicants don't
even measure up to their miserable level.
</P>
<P>
   Still, from beneath this commentary on the type of person who
needs a heroic alter ego, there emerge four more team members. The
best of them is Paul Reubens' flatulence-spewing character known as
The Spleen and Janeane Garofalo's Bowler, who routs bad guys by
aiming at them a supernatural bowling ball in which is encased her
murdered father's presumably vengeful skull. Amusingly, the story
has Captain Amazing trip himself up on his own hubris. Because he
has run out of villains to look heroic against, the muscular but
dim Captain suggests that arch-criminal Casanova Frankenstein,
played by Geoffrey Rush, be paroled. He is, and the first thing he
does is take out Captain Amazing.
</P>
<P>
   So re-enter The Mystery Men and Garofalo's Mystery Woman. It's
at this point that the film begins to slide and eventually plummet
downhill. Rush is a wonderful actor, but there's nothing scary
about this Frankenstein, which means that he's left with little
more than empty posturing to work with in Frankenstein's disco
castle. In his maroon velvet, he suggests an ``Austin Powers''
refugee. Unlike the sardonic dialogue in the film's first half, the
material in the second half is remarkably punchless. Macy, Stiller
and Garofalo, whose character should have been called The Martini
because she's that dry, give it what diminished pizazz it has,
although Claire Forlani's tough waif of a waitress and Tom Waits'
junkyard genius are plusses, too. ``Mystery Men'' certainly is more
fizzy and original than most of what's come down the pike this
summer, although that's not saying much. Too bad its second half
doesn't live up to its first half.

CLAUDIO ABBADO'S FULL CIRCLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD DYER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LENOX, Mass. _ Forty-one summers ago a 25-year-old Italian
musician arrived in Boston, where a customs inspector read his
visa. ``Conductor,'' it read on the line for ``profession.'' ``Do
you mean you drive a bus?'' the inspector asked Claudio Abbado.
</P>
<P>
   Abbado was en route to Tanglewood, where he planned to spend the
summer as a student at the Berkshire Music Center (now the
Tanglewood Music Center). He didn't know anyone, and he didn't
speak much English. But a young couple befriended him and offered
him a ride to Lenox in their car. They wished him good luck and
told him they were sure he would excel, and he did; they were in
the audience when it was announced that he had won the Koussevitzky
Prize as the most promising and accomplished conductor of the
summer _ which took some doing, because one of his classmates was
Zubin Mehta.
</P>
<P>
   Abbado has spent the last three decades at the summit of his
profession. He has held some of the world's most prestigious
musical posts, including artistic director of La Scala in Milan,
music director of the Vienna State Opera (a post in which he will
be succeeded by Seiji Ozawa), and music director of the Berlin
Philharmonic. Today he holds the post of artistic director of the
Salzburg Easter Festival, and serves as artistic director of the
Chamber Orchestra of Europe and the Gustav Mahler Youth Orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   The youth orchestra is currently in residence at Tanglewood,
where Abbado will conduct it Saturday night in a performance of
Mahler's Seventh Symphony, Abbado's first appearance in the
Berkshires since his student days.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday noon he joined his manager, assistant conductor, and
members of the Tanglewood Music Center Orchestra and the youth
orchestra for lunch in a tent set up next to Seiji Ozawa Hall; a
special guest at the table was violinist Robert di Pasquale, whose
brother, Joseph di Pasquale, was formerly principal violist of the
Boston Symphony Orchestra, and one of the first musicians to greet
Abbado in 1958. The conductor is interview-shy, having been
scorched by the press in Italy and Austria, but agreed to let this
reporter sit in.
</P>
<P>
   The maestro, looking trim and at least two decades younger than
his 66 years, spoke with great affection of his earlier time at
Tanglewood, and of the opportunity to hear such great conductors as
Charles Munch and Pierre Monteux. ``What did I conduct myself?
Well, I remember Schubert's `Unfinished' Symphony, the First Violin
Concerto of Prokofiev, with the concertmaster as soloist,
Tchaikovsky's `Romeo and Juliet,' and a piece by Anton von Webern.
That summer Eleazar de Carvahlo did most of the teaching.''
</P>
<P>
   Abbado is the founder of the youth orchestra, and his eyes light
up when he talks about it. ``It all goes back to 1978 when I helped
start the European Community Youth Orchestra. When we played
concerts in Salzburg and in Lucerne, young musicians came to see me
because they were unhappy that they could not play in the orchestra
_ Austria and Switzerland were not members of the European
Community. They didn't think it was right that they couldn't play,
and I agreed with them . . . But it just couldn't work for legal
and bureaucratic reasons, so when I went to Vienna in 1986, I
decided to form the Mahler Youth Orchestra so that we could include
young players from Austria, from Prague, from Bratislava, and other
places. It was not so easy at the beginning. I remember when we
were supposed to perform Schoenberg's `Gurrelieder' in Berlin, I
was told that the young players from East Berlin would not be
allowed to play. I told them that if that were the case, I would
not be allowed to conduct, so visas and permissions were granted
for the young players from Leipzig, Dresden, and East Berlin. That
was a start.''
</P>
<P>
   Later the youth orchestra played in Moscow, with young Evgeny
Kissin as soloist. Mikhail Gorbachev attended the concert and
afterward talked to Abbado. ``This was always my dream,'' Gorbachev
said, ``to have all Europe working together.'' Today there are
musicians from Russia, Kazakhstan, and all of the Baltic republics
in the orchestra. Abbado is proud that musicians led the way. ``Of
course, everything is easier with musicians than it is with
politicians!''
</P>
<P>
   Over the 13 years of its existence, the orchestra has produced
many alumni who are playing in the major orchestras of Europe _
there are 11 alumni in the Vienna Philharmonic, for example, and
eight in Dresden's Staatskapelle.
</P>
<P>
   The orchestra rehearses, performs, and tours at Eastertime and
in the summer. Over the years Abbado has conducted many of the
symphonies of Mahler with the orchestra. He chose it to play for
performances of Mozart's ``Don Giovanni'' in a staging by the
legendary Peter Brook at Aix-en-Provence in France. The orchestra's
guest conductors have included Bernard Haitink, Pierre Boulez,
Daniele Gatti, and Kent Nagano; Seiji Ozawa will lead the orchestra
in concerts in Salzburg next season. At Abbado's urging, the
orchestra has also created an Akademie for advanced musical study
in Bolzano, Italy; it will meet in the winter, and all the students
will be supported by scholarships. Five European cities, in
rotation, host the orchestra for rehearsals. ``This is a joy and an
honor for us,'' Abbado says, ``and it is good for the cultural life
of the town.''
</P>
<P>
   The two weeks in Tanglewood lead off a tour that will take the
orchestra to Venezuela and Cuba. ``There used to be fantastic
orchestras in Cuba,'' Abbado says. ``Erich Kleiber was a music
director there. They asked us if we could please do something; they
are in danger of losing a great musical culture. They lack many
basic things today, so all of our players are bringing along things
like good strings. Now the Tanglewood musicians have joined them in
making gifts, which is a very nice gesture.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the tour, Abbado is conducting Mahler's Seventh
Symphony; at the close of the tour it goes to Berlin to play the
work in a Mahler festival that will encompass the composer's
complete works. The Seventh Symphony is probably the least-often
played of his cycle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason for this,'' Abbado says, ``is that it is one of the
most difficult. Mahler was a genius who wrote way over the limits
of his time. Even today the Scherzo sounds crazy. For me, the
second movement is the most beautiful. In it you can hear a direct
connection to Schubert.''
</P>
<P>
   Abbado's homes are in Engadin, Switzerland, and on the northwest
coast of Sardinia; he is looking forward to spending more time
there. ``The fantastic thing about music,'' he says, ``is that
there are not limits. You can always find something new in a great
score, no matter how often you have studied and conducted it. I
learned a very great lesson from Peter Brook when we were working
on `Don Giovanni.' We took all the time we needed _ and `Don
Giovanni' is an opera I have already conducted many times. We
auditioned more than 100 singers for the roles, and then we took
months to rehearse it. The young British conductor Daniel Harding
was my assistant, and he conducted one of the performances; he did
it so well that I told him he could take over the production the
next summer. It was wonderful to be able to take all the time I
wanted to, all the time the work needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have commitments through 2002, but after that I plan to
spend more time for myself, studying more. There is so much more to
discover in a work like Wagner's `Tristan und Isolde.' I did it
this season in a semi-staged performance with the Berlin
Philharmonic, and next summer I will do it again in Salzburg. But
`Tristan' is not something you can prepare in two weeks or two
months. I ask myself why there are all these limits set by the
system.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in the late 1970s and early 1980s, Abbado conducted some of
the finest Boston Symphony Orchestra concerts of the period,
including a Mahler ``Resurrection'' Symphony that no one who heard
it will ever forget. Naturally BSO management figures have been
anxiously scrutinizing Abbado's face for signs of renewed interest
in the orchestra and in Tanglewood, particularly now that Ozawa has
announced his resignation _ ``You need to be careful,'' was
Abbado's advice to his successor in Vienna. ``You should do only
what you like to do.''
</P>
<P>
   In response to a direct question about whether he is having a
good time at Tanglewood, Abbado smiles and says yes, he is. He was
in the audience Sunday afternoon for Ozawa's concert with the
combined Mahler Youth Orchestra and the TMC Orchestra. It was
``fantastic,'' he says. ``Afterwards, Seiji made a speech and said
how it was his dream that young musicians from all over the world
could come together like this to play. He's right _ this is a very
big dream.''

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- In a small anteroom up the stairway adjacent to the
home clubhouse at Fenway Park, the entire unwieldy morass was
condensed into a tidy, if awkward, microcosm.
</P>
<P>
   Rich Garcia, Mike Reilly, Laz Diaz, and Brian O'Nora had just
worked last Friday night's Red Sox-Yankees game seamlessly,
unobtrusively, in complete cooperation, the ideal of all umpires.
Now the crew members were preparing to go their ways. Their
separate ways, which wouldn't have been the case a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   This group, headed by Garcia, represented the ideological
spectrum in the imbroglio that has resulted in the dismissal of 22
of the 66 major league umpires, effective Sept. 2. It also has
created a gulf of dissension within the union ranks, turning
longtime friends against one another on some issues and in other
cases making enemies of people who invariably describe their select
fraternity as ``like a family.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcia, a 25-year American League veteran, will be out of work
next month. Reilly, who has been in the big leagues for 22 years,
the last 14 on Garcia's crew, will be retained. Diaz and O'Nora,
both young minor league officials who are sporadically called up to
fill in for vacationing or injured major leaguers, will become
full-time, full-fledged AL umpires.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia, vice president of the Major League Baseball Umpires
Association, was among the 57 members who convened in a
Philadelphia airport hotel meeting room July 14 and, at the urging
of counsel Richie Phillips, submitted their resignations en masse,
effective Sept. 1, as a method of expediting negotiations on a
collective bargaining agreement for next year. Within days, several
umpires solicited private counsel, were advised that the
resignations, rather than being a bargaining spur, left them
vulnerable to dismissal at the discretion of the American and
National Leagues, and rescinded their letters.
</P>
<P>
   Aware that this sundering of solidarity severely compromised
their position, the remaining umpires who had signed resignation
forms rescinded them July 27. But by then, the leagues already had
hired 25 replacements _ mostly Triple A International and Pacific
Coast Leaguers who had some major league exposure as fill-ins. As a
result, there wasn't room for all the would-be returnees, and only
some of the rescisions were accepted. Garcia's was not among them.
</P>
<P>
   So on this night at Fenway, he was sitting in a corner of the
umpires' room, sipping a soda during a lengthy rant to reporters
about the injustice he perceived. He called Major League Baseball
officials ``cowards,'' criticized those umpires who had rescinded
their resignations before July 27 as ``making things easier for
Major League Baseball to do what it wants to do _ kick the umpires'
ass, teach us renegades a lesson'' _ and vowed to fight ``all the
way to the Supreme Court if I have to; I want my job back.''
</P>
<P>
   While Garcia harangued, there was only silence among his
partners. Reilly, one of the group that withdrew their resignations
before July 27, finished shaving and dressed, declining to comment
about his action ``because I've said everything I had to say about
it and I don't want to keep going into it.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Nora and Diaz nervously ate their postgame meals, with
Garcia's oratory as background, and refused to discuss their good
fortune, which will result in a salary boost from $12,000 to the
major league minimum of $75,000 annually. It's not that they were
left speechless by this chance of a lifetime; rather, they could
see no benefit in injecting themselves further into such a
sensitive situation. ``It's my personal preference not to say
anything,'' said O'Nora.
</P>
<P>
   Looking down at the floor, Diaz said, ``I'm not going to comment
on anything.'' Asked if the crew members were staying at the same
hotel, he said, ``I'm not going to comment on anything.''
</P>
<P>
   As Garcia's colleagues left the room _ Reilly with his son, Diaz
and O'Nora in tandem _ they looked almost sheepishly his way,
waving goodbye. Garcia interrupted his denunciations and called out
enthusiastically, ``Hey, see you guys later.''
</P>
<P>
   Clad only in a towel, he proceeded to address the conflict for
another hour, emphasizing that, as his farewells had indicated, he
was trying not to take this personally.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like what these guys did but I respect them
professionally,'' he said. ``When we're on the field, it's
forgotten. They work their (expletive) asses off. Anyone who
doesn't work his (expletive) ass off, I don't want him on my
crew.''
</P>
<P>
   In that regard, these crew members are welcome to Garcia. And
they do indeed stay in the same hotel. But he won't deny that the
union chasm has created palpable tension, if not open hostility.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike Reilly told me what he was going to do and said, `I don't
want it to ruin our friendship,' '' recounted Garcia. ``I said, `I
hope it doesn't ruin our friendship.'
</P>
<P>
   ``And these kids, I taught most of them, worked with them in
spring training and on off days, not because I had to but because I
wanted to. I've had them all over to my house (in Clearwater, Fla.)
for dinner. My wife has cooked for them. Brian O'Nora has been like
a son to me. I can't say what I'd do if I were one of those kids
because I've never been in that situation.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the defectors, ``these are grown men with families,''
said Garcia. ``Everyone is entitled to their own opinions. I just
wish they'd expressed their opinions at the meeting or in the
conference calls we had about every other day afterward. Nobody
ever did, but then we'd start hearing, `This guy's rescinded; that
guy's rescinded.' If they'd let us know that beforehand, we
wouldn't have taken the action we did.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no hostility on my part, but I've told them all how
disappointed I am. I'm hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The declarations of independence _ or suicide notes, as some
umpires consider them _ were ready and waiting when the union
members were summoned to Philadelphia for a mandatory meeting the
day after the All-Star Game in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``What did they think when nine umpires didn't show?'' wondered
Dave Phillips, a 29-year AL veteran who was at the meeting but soon
rescinded his resignation. ``Did they figure all these guys had
flight connection problems or were going to Disney World? They were
rebelling.''
</P>
<P>
   Tension and speculation were at a full broil on this scalding
July day. Many umpires were under the impression that they would be
taking action on a proposed one-day wildcat strike, even though
their current collective bargaining agreement contains a no-strike
clause.
</P>
<P>
   There had been an air of suspicion ever since last November when
commissioner Bud Selig named former Oakland Athletics general
manager Sandy Alderson as executive vice president for baseball
operations. One of his mandates was to evaluate the umpiring with
an eye toward centralizing the operation rather than giving each
league jurisdiction over its own crews.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took action because of what was coming out of Major League
Baseball,'' said Garcia. ``They were going to straighten us out,
weed out the lower-rated umpires, fire people.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a matter of interpretation. Hoping to get a jump on
negotiations before the current collective bargaining agreement
expires Dec. 31, Alderson and special assistant to the commissioner
for baseball operations Ralph Nelson met with union president Jerry
Crawford, an NL umpire for 23 years, at Phoenix in late May.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way it has been portrayed was that we had a list of 20
umpires we wanted terminated,'' said Alderson. ``I don't know where
that came from. There's never been a list of 20 umpires; there's
never been a list of one.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, added Alderson, who flew in for the Phoenix meeting on
his son's birthday because he considered it vital, he reassured
Crawford that MLB had no intention of firing any umpires.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our intent was and is to set up standards for the umpires to
meet,'' said Alderson, whose house in California's Marin County was
barraged by marbles recently, an incident that is under
investigation. ``Most would meet them right away. There was never
any intent to dismiss those who didn't; that wouldn't be fair.
Rather, we'd give them time and support in the form of training and
programs.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson has a similar recollection. ``I distinctly remember Sandy
saying, `I don't want to make a blanket statement that we're not
going to fire an umpire if there's cause,' '' he said, `` `but it
is not our intention to fire anyone for what they do on the field.'
''
</P>
<P>
   Crawford's response, according to Nelson: ``I don't trust you,''
meaning management.
</P>
<P>
   The union president recalls an entirely different message from
the meeting: ``My impression was that there were going to be
firings. My feeling all along from my discussion with Sandy was
that his intent was to make things easier for firing. He wanted us
to grease the skids.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Alderson and Nelson departed believing they had
made significant headway and told Crawford that they hoped to have
a proposal ready for the union's consideration by July 1.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Nelson began devoting 12-hour days to
formulating a centralized umpiring system, which would include
five-man crews so that minor leaguers wouldn't have to be brought
in as vacation replacements; a considerable reduction in travel
schedules; and substantial cost reduction.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson calculated that each umpire's travel would be decreased
by 12,000-15,000 miles annually, a savings of $250,000 in that
department alone. ``And what we contemplated,'' said Alderson,
``was giving that money back to the umpires in the form of
increased per diem'' from the current $240.
</P>
<P>
   Centralization long had been a point of contention, especially
in the NL, ``but we were going to grandfather it,'' said Nelson,
``so that umpires who wanted to stay in one league could choose
that schedule.''
</P>

him in July.

<P>
   ``The Iron Giant'' is a solid, not to say ironclad, winner in
the less than overcrowded family animation arena. Set in 1957, at
the height of atomic and Red Scare paranoia, it justifies its
period look and avoids the deadening pall of political correctness
lurking in its antiweaponry allegory. In transferring the story
from Ted Hughes's famous children's book, ``The Iron Man,'' and
Americanizing this British classic, director Brad Bird had a lot of
little decisions to make and one big one. He gets the big one
resoundingly right by putting the friendship between a 9-year-old
boy and a giant robot at the film's center and keeping it there.
</P>
<P>
   In the book, the huge robot emerges mysteriously from the sea.
In this new animated version, it drops from space, landing in the
ocean off the coast of Maine, just in time to rescue a storm-tossed
fisherman before disappearing into the woods. The charm of the
robot lies in the fact that while it's big, it's also an innocent.
Like a big baby animal, its appetite is as huge as it is. It meets
the spunky kid named Hogarth Hughes by creeping out of the pine
forest one night and scarfing down Hogarth's TV antenna. Hogarth,
at home alone because his mother, Annie, must work late as a
waitress, follows the metal-eating robot into the woods and saves
its life by shutting off the juice when the robot starts chomping
on a power station.
</P>
<P>
   The boy and the robot reverse parent-child roles and become
friends. When the pragmatic kid realizes he's got to hide his big
friend because the nearby town with the tongue-in-cheek name of
Rockwell can't handle the reality of the robot, he cleverly
persuades the neighborhood hippie, a beatnik sculptor, to hide the
robot in his junkyard, which also solves the food supply problem.
The goatteed hippie named Dean, slyly designed to invoke early
Brando, and voiced with an engaging drawl by Harry Connick Jr., is
a plus. So is Hogarth's spirited and loving single mom, voiced by
Jennifer Aniston. The film's need for a heavy is filled by a nasty
fed played with sneering duplicitous lowness by Christopher
McDonald.
</P>
<P>
   But it's in the chemistry between the boy and the robot that the
payoff is to be found. The drawing and construction of ``The Iron
Giant'' are more sophisticated than its deceptively simple style
might lead you to believe. The film actually succeeds in making you
believe that the big hunk of iron not only has feelings, but
feelings of childlike purity that are shaken when he sees a deer
shot by hunters and Hogarth explains what to the robot are the
hitherto alien concepts of killing and dying. The film makes a
laudable distinction between dying, which it presents as part of
the natural cycle of death and rebirth, and killing, which is
aggressively different.
</P>
<P>
   This distinction is brought to a dramatic climax when Hogarth
discovers that the robot is a formidable weapon that goes into the
attack mode, but only in self-defense. When the hysterical fed
calls down the wrath of the armed forces upon the robot, the
question becomes who and what, if anything, will be left standing.
There's more than one moral to be taken from this allegorical fable
with its engaging central characters. Fittingly enough, given its
'50s atmosphere and references to Cold War politics and period
sci-fi, ``The Iron Giant'' is a plea for arms control that must
have been reassuring in the nuclear world of Hughes's own two
children, for whom he wrote the story in 1968, after the death of
their mother, the poet Sylvia Plath. When the robot unleashes a
death beam and the boy stops it from doing more by rebukingly
saying, ``Guns kill,'' it may have made kids feel a little less
helpless in a world filled with terrifying forces. There's a lot to
like in this film that only the NRA could hate.

`SIXTH SENSE' SUFFERS FROM A REFINED SENSIBILITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
THE SIXTH SENSE 
Written and directed by: M. Night Shyamalan 
Starring: Bruce Willis, Haley Joel Osment, Toni Collette, Olivia
Williams, Trevor Morgan, Donnie Wahlberg, Mischa Barton, Glenn
Fitzgerald, Bruce Norris 
Running time: 115 minutes 
Rated: PG-13 (intense thematic material and violent images) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Sixth Sense'' is the kind of flawed movie that's worth
sticking with. It's got an eerie flavor all its own. Also, a lot of
things that appear not to add up eventually do make sense in light
of the film's surprise ending. Getting to that ending is sometimes
a chore, but the grave clarity with which the story is filmed helps
knit together what seem its disjointed parts. At times, ``The Sixth
Sense'' seems unanchored, floaty, like a dream. It's somber and
heavy, but justifiably so, since its protagonist is an
eight-year-old Philadelphia boy who sees ghosts. Young Haley Joel
Osment's face looks strained and pained, again understandably so,
since the ghosts are of people who died unhappy.
</P>
<P>
   It is this legion of troubled spirits that get the boy down. His
face, too pinched for one so young, is also wise with the knowledge
that the ghosts, some of whom died horrific deaths, mean him no
personal harm. It's just that he's stuck with their unrest because
he happens to be sensitive to them. And he knows they wish to use
him to get even. Enter Bruce Willis, as a children's therapist, in
a performance as subdued as any he's ever given, in keeping with
the mournful tone of the film. Essentially, the doc sets himself
the job of becoming the boy's exorcist, following a traumatic
experience that he himself recently underwent when a troubled
patient (Donnie Wahlberg, who makes you feel the character's
torment) invades the doc's home, excoriates him for failing to
help, then shoots the doc and turns the gun on himself, fatally.
</P>
<P>
   Willis's doc, slow to recover, finds his confidence shaken and
would prefer not to add to his stress levels by facing up to the
fact that his marriage is drifing into trouble, much of which stems
from the fact that he has grown distant to his wife (Olivia
Williams), an antiques dealer. Writer-director M. Night Shyamalan
has no trouble steeping the film in disquieting atmosphere. Adding
to the overall uneasiness is the boy's loving but bewildered single
mom, played by Toni Collette. She shuttles between protective
instincts and frustration at her inability to make sense of the
things her son tells her, things she can only regard as troubling
fantasies. Willis's soft-spoken doc believes the boy, though, and
is resolved to lift him out of the trough of despond into which he
has slipped.
</P>
<P>
   It seems likely to the psychologist that there's more than
divorce trauma working on the eight-year-old boy, who has evolved
rituals involving toy soldiers and religious figures in an
improvised safety zone where he hides when it all becomes too much
for him. As the film progresses, so do the boy's terrifying visions
of people who died violent deaths. Not that Shyamalan is
exploitative in terms of splashing gore across the screen. Just the
reverse. There's a dolorous integrity about ``The Sixth Sense''
that unfortunately translates into ponderousness much of the time.
``The Sixth Sense'' is the only horror film this year that
underplays its horrors. But it's also the kind of film you respect
more than you're grabbed by.

`BEAUTIFUL MAN' SHOWS EXCESSES OF ANOTHER ERA 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
THE MOST BEAUTIFUL MAN IN EXISTENCE 
The Scandalous Life of Alexander Lesassier 
By Lisa Rosner 
University of Pennsylvania Press, 202 pp., $29.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He was a novelist of little merit, a faithless husband, and a
physician who faked his thesis. He was by turns vain, charming and
seductive, and lazy and entitled and, ultimately, hobbled by
scandal. In fact, Alexander Lesassier is a rogue more likely to pop
up as a character in a Restoration comedy than anywhere else. But
in historian Lisa Rosner's hands, the trunk full of journals he
left behind provide fresh insights into the development of the
medical profession and English society in the early 1800s.
</P>
<P>
   For a modern reader, ``The Most Beautiful Man in Existence'' is
also an oddly reassuring reminder that no single era has a corner
on sexual license, lying, family feuds, and overextended credit.
</P>
<P>
   Rosner, professor of history at Richard Stockton College in New
Jersey, could have made Lesassier a buffoon. Instead, she sees him
as a rather hapless figure in a pivotal time for medicine. Medicine
was turning into a science, and although antibiotics, germ theory,
and a full understanding of anatomy were still in the future,
Rosner documents their stirrings in London, Edinburgh, and the
British military. With Lesassier as her foil, she is able to do so
with humanity and humor. She is aided by Lesassier's penchant for
self-creation and for recording every small triumph, slight insult,
and steamy sexual liaison in the pages of his diary.
</P>
<P>
   Raised in genteel poverty by an irascible father, Lesassier
began his journal in 1803, when he was 16, with a teen-age lament:
``This day through the ill usage of my Father I resolved on leaving
him: but am not yet certain what part of the world to move to.''
</P>
<P>
   Resources were scarce in the family, and Lesassier had to
scramble to try to realize his daydreams of independence and
leisure. Without the money for a formal medical education, he
served an apprenticeship with an apothecary and audited courses at
the Royal College of Physicians in Edinburgh, finally winning a job
as hospital mate in the military.
</P>
<P>
   The life of a soldier not to mention the splendid uniform and
cocked hat appealed to Lesassier. ``The fifteen months that
Lesassier spent with the 42nd Regiment in England were probably the
happiest of his life,'' Rosner writes. He took long walks, read
romantic potboilers and plied the social circuit. ``He lived, in
fact, as much like an independent gentleman as he would ever
manage, drawing his pay with very little work, since there were
very few calls on his medical or surgical skills.''
</P>
<P>
   And he womanized. ``As the historian Anthony Fletcher has noted,
beneath the facade of sophistication of Georgian society was a
`deeply selfish set of sexual mores and an unabashed male
hedonism.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Lusty subplots run throughout Lesassier's journals. Although he
marries, hoping for an inheritance, he energetically pursues
affairs with single women, married women, maids, and contessas. He
begins an obstetrical practice and has sex with scores of patients.
Short of cash, he writes ``Edward Neville,'' a novel based on his
fantasy of family and redemption, but it sells poorly. If only he
had applied the same energy to medicine; his blunders there were
``legion,'' Rosner writes. Crisis seems inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scandal, to borrow his earlier phrase, was poised to attack
him openmouthed, and in the fall of 1822 he set a consecutive chain
of events in motion that linked his name with scandal for years to
come.'' His affair with Lady Louisa Kintore became the talk of
Edinburgh after a letter was intercepted by her husband. His wife,
Catherine, divorced him, and his creditors sued.
</P>
<P>
   As he approached middle age, his roistering behavior began to
pall. As a plaintive journal entry on his 40th birthday in
September 1827 puts it: ``I am shocked to say I am forty!! .. I
blush to think how very old I am, &AMP; how little good I have done
either for others or myself.'' Ever the escape artist, he rejoined
the military and died in 1839 during the First Afghan War.
</P>
<P>
   Lesassier's personal papers, used as evidence in his divorce,
languished in a trunk at the medical college in Edinburgh until
1987, when they were put in order by an archivist. He is a fluid,
vivid writer, Rosner notes, and is never boring. His journals were
``his most trusted friend. He imparted every thought to them,
confided every misfortune, sought consolation, commanded their
secrecy. Whether in the end they served faithfully, or betrayed
him, I leave to you, Dear Reader, to decide.''

A `CROWN AFFAIR' TO REMEMBER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR 
Directed by: John McTiernan 
Screenplay by: Leslie Dixon &AMP; Kurt Wimmer (based on Alan R.
Trustman's script for the original) 
Starring: Pierce Brosnan, Rene Russo, Denis Leary, Ben Gazzara,
Frankie Faison, Faye Dunaway, James Saito 
Running time: 114 minutes 
Rated: R (some sexuality and language) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Thomas Crown Affair,'' with Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo
playing the roles Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaway originated in
1968, is a little more than just your average remake. It switches
the locale from Boston to New York City and goes a few other places
the original didn't go. The first time around, the jaded
thrill-seeking zillionaire engineered a bank heist. This time it's
an art heist, a Monet from the Met. Art thefts are inherently more
interesting than bank robberies, especially when the rich thief
actually steals the painting with his own hands, as he does here,
instead of just masterminding the caper from afar, which was the
case the first time out.
</P>
<P>
   But the real motor of ``The Thomas Crown Affair,'' then and now,
as the double entendre in its title proclaims, is the sexual chess
between Crown and the insurance investigator who goes after him
frontally, telling him she's convinced he's the thief and that
she's going to get him, figuring that he'll be unable to resist the
sexual challenge, since challenge is all that turns him on at this
stage in his life. Neither character is deficient in the hubris
department, which adds to the fun. It feeds the feeling that we're
watching two jungle cats stalking one another, trying not to lick
their lips.
</P>
<P>
   The original version peaked in one of film's great sex scenes _
an actual chess game between McQueen and Dunaway in Crown's Beacon
Hill mansion. The only nakedness involved was the nakedness of the
sexual power struggle between two characters so heavily armored and
self-protective that it was hard to like either of them. Then
McQueen literally blinked first, becoming the first one to show
vulnerability, leaving himself open to checkmate. In the new film,
Russo's ex-bounty-hunter turned insurance investigator is the more
vulnerable of the two. She's the one who falls for Crown, yet seems
the stronger for being able to gamble on jettisoning a bit of the
control that has served her so well.
</P>
<P>
   Russo has it all. She's glamorous, tough, full-blooded. Brosnan
isn't bad, but he seems to have brought with him from his James
Bond films a little more suavity than the film needs. When McQueen
played the role, he brought to it a restlessness that made him seem
about to jump out of his skin. We could believe in his need to push
the envelope by speeding, gliding, making high-stakes bets on the
golf course and aimlessly tearing up Cape Cod's beaches by racing
his dune buggy up and down them. In these environmentally conscious
days, dune buggy sequences would be unthinkable. Instead, Brosnan's
Bond pushes the envelope with a catamaran. He's OK, especially in a
wittily choreographed climax, but at times seems imprisoned in
elegance in a way that McQueen, who spoke a louder body language,
wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   This new ``Thomas Crown Affair'' is more elaborate and inventive
than the first, from a Trojan horse beginning to a bravura
Magritte-flavored closing caper. But while Russo fills the screen
with tempestuousness, this slicker but more hollow new version
misses the primal predatoriness of the original. It tries harder to
humanize the characters, coax them out from behind their defenses,
have them talk more about trust and feelings. This new earnestness
is not always a plus. The original had more fun with the shallow
mercenariness of its characters. But Denis Leary's working-class
police detective, always expressing more than he's saying, unsure
of whose side Russo is on, represents one of this film's undisputed
advances over the original. And there's a bonus. Dunaway, written
in as Crown's therapist, appears in a series of punctuating
vignettes that are actually pretty funny. Instead of holding his
hand, she laughs at his Peter Pan immaturity and his fearful
concealments during his sessions with her. Dunaway dished out tough
love the first time around and she dishes it out here, too.

SPIEGELMAN TAKES HIS PROVOCATIVE CAARTOONING INTO OPERA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By IAN SHAPIRA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Art Spiegelman loves to provoke, firing unpredictably
and with vitriol.The Queens, N.Y.native is as famous (or infamous)
for his 1992 Pulitzer Prize-winning Holocaust cartoon book,
``Maus'', as he is for his New Yorker covers alluding to sensitive
news stories, such as portraying a Hasidic Jew smooching with an
African-American woman in 1993, and, in March, a New York beat cop
aiming a gun at miniature human targets in a shooting gallery. (The
illustration sparked a protest by members of the New York Police
Department.)
</P>
<P>
   Now Spiegelman, 51, is experimenting, interested less in
triggering controversial issues and more with amplifying his
medium. But into what? Try opera. For the past few years,
Spiegelman has been testing his hand at writing a libretto,
attempting to mix the seemingly opposite art forms into a
cartoon-musical theater. These ``comic operas,'' as he prefers,
involve musical theater amid projected cartoons. At the American
Repertory Theatre, he is presenting ``Drawn to Death,'' a
work-in-progress that serves as the penultimate program this summer
of the Institute of the Arts &AMP; Civic Dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   Like all of the Institute's programs, ``Drawn to Death''
harnesses its artistic energies to contemplate social issues. In
four scenes, the comic opera explores the tumultuous career and
characters of the comic book industry near the middle of the
century. In between those scenes, Spiegelman will insert his own
short comments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see `Drawn to Death' as a kind of requiem to comics, that
it's about the rise and fall of the American comic, a medium that
was born and flourished in the 1930s and has now become
overshadowed and supplanted by television and movies,'' Spiegelman
explained in his Cambridge hotel room, smoking his eighth cigarette
in less than an hour.
</P>
<P>
   The four scenes delve into the industry's more audacious _ not
to mention deranged _ comics pioneers, such as Bob Wood, author of
the popular 1940s comic book ``Crime Does Not Pay,'' who later went
on to bludgeon his wife; and Jack Cole, the creator of Plastic Man
and famed Playboy cartoonist, who ended up committing suicide in
1958.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, ``Drawn to Death'' is also very much about the
demise of the comics book industry. Led by music director Richard
Gordon and composer Van Dyke Parks, the four vocalists _ including
two from the Boston Lyric Opera Company _ perform parts of the 1954
U.S. Senate Hearings on Comic Books and Juvenile Delinquency; in
the final scene, they sing the actual Comics Code, laws that
hamstrung the artists' penchant for lurid violence and sexual
imagery.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were even comic book burnings,'' Spiegelman said. ``We
all know there was a lot of censorship in that period, but
burnings?''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Drawn to Death,'' Spiegelman's cartoons aren't the only
things that dramatize comics' run-in with the First Amendment.Sure
enough, it's his libretto, together with Parks's score, that helps
symbolize the industry's raging but short-lived economic success in
American history.
</P>
<P>
   ``The songs have a very Kurt Weill feel to them,'' Gordon said.
``There's a Germanic, ominous tone but Van Dyke has managed to
bring a pop/rock feel as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Though this performance depends on plenty of opera basics _
singing, spoken dialogue, and instrumental accompaniment _ ``Drawn
to Death'' relies unabashedly on technology. First, Spiegelman
draws his comics with computer programs such as Illustrator and
Photoshop. Then, those images are linked up via Apple G3 computers
to two projectors that splash the images onto a 40-by-25-foot scrim
divided into three panels.
</P>
<P>
   The show depends heavily on the digital projector in the back of
the theater. Looking like a boat's motor, it taps its power from
three microchips ``the size of postage stamps,'' explained
projectionist Paul Warner. Each of these chips contains some 80,000
hinged mirrors off which 8,000 lumens of light bounce.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the lumens are reflecting -- instead of going through a
piece of film or panel _ they maintain more of their inherent
light, not getting diffused by passing through any medium,'' Warner
said.
</P>
<P>
   For Spiegelman, seeing his comic strips magnified to the nth
degree can be satisfying, but stretching the medium's capabilities
presents even more of a challenge _ if only because comics do not
necessarily depend on the passage of time, whereas theater does.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be interesting to see how a comic strip would move if
it was onstage, because comics are a way of murdering time and
turning it into space,'' Spiegelman said.
</P>
<P>
   Huh?
</P>
<P>
   ``Comics allow you to go back in time by shifting your eyes
left,'' he said. ``It's a mistake to think of (one) as a storyboard
for a film; comics have properties of their own: directness,
intimacy _ the fact that you're able to hold a temporal even in
your head by seeing it. . . . Now I'm trying to see what happens
when the elements of theater and comics collide.''
</P>
<P>
   It's this kind of reverence for his craft _ and a willingness to
remain versatile in an age of increased specialization _ that makes
Art Spiegelman one ofthe world's most acclaimed and most vilified
arts figures.
</P>
<P>
   His New Yorker covers, especially, have made his work more
accessible and has given the publication's strait-laced image a
jolt. ``When I was putting together an early draft of the Institute
on the Arts and Civic Dialogue back in 1993, I thought about those
New Yorker covers because every special issue was a big chat,''
said Institute director Anna Deavere Smith. ``So I met up with Tina
Brown and she said, `You have to talk to Art Spiegelman.' '' The
cartoonist, however, is under contract with The New Yorker
(Spiegelman's wife, Francoise Mouly, is the art director) and will
not be working with Brown's Talk magazine anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   Smith likes to think of Spiegelman as a provocateur: ``His
characters capture visually (the) problems, challenges, and
anxieties we all have. He's a trickster.''
</P>
<P>
   But not all have warmed to his work. In fact the Aug. 3 Village
Voice cover story by syndicated cartoonist and columnist Ted Rall
skewered Spiegelman, attacking his New Yorker covers _
``embarrassing vestiges'' in Rall's opinion _ as more of a
``softball pitch than kick in the privates.'' He also wrote that
Spiegelman's ``Maus'' was ``facile'' and ``one-dimensional.''
</P>
<P>
   Spiegelman would not go on the record about Rall's story, but
was certainly miffed.
</P>
<P>
   But for most people in the art world, Spiegelman is up to a lot
of good _ and welcome good.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a wonderful artist who uses the medium of cartooning _
and not just political cartoons, these are comic strips _ to make
powerful art,'' said ART artistic director Robert Brustein. ``Only
a few artists emerge out of that kind of field: Charlie Chaplin
being one of them, Art Spiegelman being another.''

AIRLINES MOVE TO PROVIDE BENEFITS TO DOMESTIC PARTNERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RACHEL GORDON  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ American Airlines will follow in the steps of
competitor United Airlines and offer a full package of benefits to
employees who have unmarried partners.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time was right, for our employees and our company,''
American Airlines spokesman Tim Kincaid said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement by American, a unit of the AMR Corp. of Fort
Worth, Texas, came less than a week after United became the first
passenger air carrier in the country to provide benefits to
same-sex and opposite-sex domestic partners.
</P>
<P>
   The two carriers join a growing number of companies,
universities and government agencies that do the same.
</P>
<P>
   The offers generally require employees to have a joint residence
and financial interdependence with an unmarried partner.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement by the two airlines is particularly
significant, however. They are part of an industry-supported
lawsuit challenging San Francisco's 2-year-old Equal Benefits
Ordinance. The law requires companies doing business with the city
to provide the same benefits to workers with unmarried partners as
they give to married employees.
</P>
<P>
   The airlines, in a lawsuit brought by the Air Transport
Association, contend that local jurisdictions have no authority
enacting mandates on the federally regulated industry.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge has ruled that airlines do not have to provide
equal health and pension benefits to domestic partners, but must
provide other perks, such as flight discounts and bereavement
leave. The airlines are required to offer the limited package of
benefits even as they appeal that decision.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Chicago-based United, a division of the UAL Corp.,
and American have decided to go beyond the court order.
</P>
<P>
   They will extend medical and dental coverage, pension and life
insurance to employees worldwide who have domestic partners. United
has 97,000 employees around the globe; American has 110,000.
Neither company would speculate on how many workers would benefit
from the new policy.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Aftergut, chief assistant city attorney who has taken the
lead in defending San Francisco's law, welcomed the news.
</P>
<P>
   ``These airlines are recognizing that they were on the wrong
side of history and they're moving to the right side,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kincaid downplayed the role the San Francisco law had in the
company's decision, saying American already had been weighing
whether to offer the benefits. And, he noted, American and the
other airlines involved in the litigation, including United, are
pressing forward with their case.
</P>
<P>
   ``This always was about principle. This never had anything to do
with discrimination against gays and lesbians,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco's ordinance becomes effective only when companies
enter into new contracts with the city or extend old ones. So far,
United and Federal Express are the only airlines flying into and
out of San Francisco International Airport that must adhere to the
ordinance.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Express, based in Memphis, Tenn., has yet to say whether
it will offer domestic partners benefits.

 BOSTON: ... for two weeks.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Among the umpiring union hierarchy, two possible strategies were
evolving. One was to strike, despite the contract stipulation to
the contrary.
</P>
<P>
   ``The board had authorized me to call the meeting to discuss a
strike,'' said Crawford. ``We felt there were unfair labor
practices going on and we had the right to strike. They had changed
the working conditions in the sense that Major League Baseball was
controlling things where the leagues in fact had done so before.''
</P>
<P>
   The other ploy, mass resignations, also was in the works, though
it was news to the nine-man board. ``It was never discussed in the
conference call preceding the meeting,'' said Dale Scott, who
resigned from the board in protest within a week of the
Philadelphia conclave, rescinded his resignation soon after, and is
being retained by the AL.
</P>
<P>
   Should the board have been consulted?
</P>
<P>
   ``Absoutely,'' said Scott. ``Richie maybe talked to one or two
people.''
</P>
<P>
   One, in fact. ``Richie had discussed the resignation plan with
me,'' said Crawford, who rescinded his resignation with the
majority of the group July 27 and will keep his job. ``The reason
we didn't discuss it with anyone else was that we didn't want it to
get out.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the 57 umpires gathered, the strike talk was quickly
dismissed. Then came the alternative proposal from Phillips, who
has been the union counsel since 1978 and whose confrontational
style has made him a lightning rod for criticism but also has
earned his constituency raises from less than $20,000 to a salary
range of $75,000-$225,000, plus an extra $20,000 per man from the
playoff pool, vacation time during the season, and greatly enhanced
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made the case,'' said Crawford. ``I stood up and said, `It's
a very seriuous thing. I want legitimate questions, no rah-rah.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Questions were raised, according to some participants, but no
opposition was voiced. ``Dave Phillips gave a great speech,'' said
union supporter Terry Tata, who is being fired after 27 years in
the NL. ``Then he jumped ship.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a lie,'' said Phillips. ``This was a scam meeting.
(Richie Phillips) already had the resignation letters to be signed.
It was portrayed as being no big deal. They were to be used as a
negotiating tool. They were not necessarily going to be sent in. I
got up and said, `This may be the best idea you've had since 1979'
'' _ when the umpires staged the watershed strike that brought them
far better working conditions _ ``because he had intimated the
letters never were going to be sent out.''
</P>
<P>
   Not true, according to others in the room. ``We were under the
impression that he was going to send in the letters,'' said NL
umpire Dana DeMuth, a union supporter who will be retained.
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, the letters were distributed to the rank-and-file.
``One man created this fiasco, point blank _ Richie Phillips,''
said Dave Phillips, who not surprisingly is no relation. ``This was
going to be mass suicide, like Jim Jones in Guyana.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't quite as massive as the union figured. ``We passed out
the letters and the guys passed them back,'' said Garcia. ``We
didn't check them one by one. It turns out some guys hadn't signed
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, the fallout was almost immediate. Dave Phillips
arrived home in Lake St. Louis, Mo., that night to discover four
reporters waiting to ask him about the resignations, which Richie
Phillips _ who did not return several calls from the Globe seeking
comment _ had announced on TV. Dave Phillips, who is on disability
leave because of back problems and had expressed concern outside
the meeting room to one of Richie Phillips's associates, Pat
Campbell, about the possible impact on his health benefits,
maintains that Campbell had reassured him, ``Don't worry, Dave.
We'll tear yours up.''
</P>
<P>
   Dave Phillips called the union office the next day and asked,
``Who's going to tear my letter up now, G. Gordon Liddy?''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the letters were faxed to the leagues that day, July
15, while opponents of the strategy went to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``When guys got home,'' said Joe Brinkman, ``they talked to
their wives or whatever and thought, `What the hell did we just
do?' ''
</P>
<P>
   AL veterans Brinkman and John Hirschbeck, both of whom skipped
the Philadelphia meeting in protest, did more. They sought advice
about the situation from veteran sports agent/attorney Ron Shapiro,
who told them the action was illegal.
</P>
<P>
   That seems to be the prevailing opinion among labor and legal
experts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite many disputes and quite a few strikes,'' said
legendary former players' union executive director Marvin Miller,
``there was never one day of a (player) strike during the pendency
of a collective bargaining agreement. It was always months after a
collective bargaining agreement had expired. It's an important
principle: Not only did (the mass resignations) not honor the
contract, it put the members at a tremendous disadvantage. It was
(an illegal) concerted action. It's so appalling to have given
management so many options or weapons to use. I can't imagine what
was going through the minds of Phillips and the umpires. They gave
Major League Baseball carte blanche to break the union completely
or, as they have chosen to do, to select which ones they want to
keep.''
</P>
<P>
   Roger Abrams, dean of the Northeastern University Law School who
teaches a course in sports law, doesn't consider the strategy
folly, just extremely risky.
</P>
<P>
   ``It requires a lot of pieces to fall into place,'' he said.
``What happens if you call a mass quit and nobody comes? They
really made some faulty predictions on what people would do.
Getting the minor leaguers to agree not to come up (which they
refused to do) was a tough one. If they'd pulled it off, it
would've been really interesting to see what would've happened,
though my guess is that (MLB) would have found someone on the
street to come in.''
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't necessary. Brinkman and Hirschbeck retained private
counsel and started calling their fellow umpires urging them to do
likewise. Now the exodus was on. And even staunch union supporters
felt compelled to join the rescision parade.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's either all or none,'' said DeMuth. ``That's the only way
you have a union.''
</P>
<P>
   With their umpiring ranks now overflowing, the leagues last week
announced the casualties among the veterans. The union countered
this week by filing an unfair labor practices charge with the
National Labor Relations Board in New York. While umpires hope
their position will be upheld, Abrams, for one, is dubious.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somewhere deep in baseball's central offices is a memo that
explains why they are keeping some and not others,'' he said.
``It's been drawn up by their skillful lawyers to protect them from
any action.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, men who have worked, traveled, and socialized with
one another for years are left to battle it out among themselves,
Garcia's claims of a tenuous peace to the contrary.
</P>
<P>
   Tata, who as a minor league umpire in 1970 rejected an offer to
serve as a fill-in during a proposed playoff strike by his major
league counterparts, branded this year's new hires ``scabs'' and
said of the veteran defectors, ``If there's a small fire on the
ship, you put it out. You don't jump overboard into the waters with
the sharks. I can tell you I'll be saving some postage this
Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Scott, ``It's put a lot of guys at odds. Some who have been
friends for years aren't even speaking.''
</P>
<P>
   The bitterness has filtered to the families. NL umpire Ed
Montague's wife, Marcia, sent a letter to Hirschbeck's wife,
Denise, July 28 in which she called Hirschbeck a ``Judas'' and
added, ``He shamed us all.'' Carbon copies were sent to every
umpire's spouse, prompting Major League Baseball to announce it
wouldn't tolerate harassment and exposing Ed Montague to possible
NL sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine why it would,'' said Marcia Montague. ``It was
definitely my words. I came up with it on my own. I hope people
appreciate that.''
</P>
<P>
   Denise Hirschbeck said, ``I really don't have any comment on the
letter because I'd like to put it behind us.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is no question her husband is hurt by the reaction to
his activities. Garcia, ``who is like my flesh and blood,'' said
Hirschbeck, accused him and Brinkman of unwittingly helping Major
League Baseball break the union. This particularly wounds
Hirschbeck, for Garcia was among several umpires who served as
pallbearers when Hirschbeck's 8-year-old son John died of
adrenoleuko dystrophy in 1993. ``When people talk about us being
like a family,'' said Hirschbeck, ``nobody knows that better than
the Hirschbecks.''
</P>
<P>
   Hirschbeck and several of his colleagues insist that the dispute
will not dissolve relationships because ``you don't stop being
friends with someone who's like family.''
</P>
<P>
   But also to be considered is the impact on baseball. While
Garcia maintained that resentment doesn't spill onto the field, he
added a cautionary note. ``What Major League Baseball wants is
going to hurt the integrity of the game,'' he said. ``If a young
umpire goes out there and knows he can be fired because of a
major-market team's clout if he makes a mistake, it will hurt the
integrity of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Not even the veterans are immune. Montague worked the plate in
Miami Wednesday night, ``and the pitcher looked in at me and I
jumped him. Then I jumped the bench. Normally, I'm pretty
easygoing. But this is with us constantly. The tension is so high,
it's with you every inning.''
</P>
<P>
   It reaches all the way down to the minors. Marvin Hudson, who
will become a full-time NL umpire in September after his
apprenticeship as a vacation fill-in, was working one of his final
IL games in Pawtucket, R.I., last week. He didn't want to talk
about his situation. He's 35, has a wife and two children, has
worked his way up from the godforsaken Appalachian League in the
past eight years, and now is headed for the main stage. When he got
the call informing him of his promotion, ``I was excited,'' he
said. ``You'd be crazy not to be excited.''
</P>
<P>
   As he said this, his voice was a monotone, his face
expressionless, his eyes dead. He may have been excited about his
big break, but he sure didn't seem to be enjoying it.

   PARTY _ In 1992, Ross Perot led an impassioned following of
angry, disaffected voters that caused fits for the campaigns of
President Bush and then-Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton. His independent
candidacy won almost 20 percent of the vote, the best showing for
an independent or third party presidential candidate in more than
half a century. And it sparked a debate that continues today about
whether he might have sealed Bush's defeat, even though exit polls
show that he probably drew almost equally from Democrats and
Republicans. Flash forward to 2000. Could a third-party candidate
wield that kind of political clout again? 36. David Goldstein.

   COOK: Steven Cook had been dead so long that his body had begun

Kansas City apartment. Another heat victim, authorities said. But
it was a needless death, say officials with the local Mental Health
Association, Legal Aid and a patient advocate group. They're
outraged because Cook was only 40, and no one had checked on him at
the Campbell Street group home where he lived, even though he was
taking a drug for schizophrenia that made him heat sensitive.
Officials are concerned because many mental patients live in
low-rent midtown apartments with no air-conditioning and are on
similar medications. Apparently, there's no procedure in place for
checking on these people when temperatures soar. Photo. Alan

there is not yet an epidemic of them, it seems that some kids are
trying to take advantage of advanced technology to get liquor.

DETECTIVES SNOOP FOR FRAUD AT RACETRACK

   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. _ One of the most notorious switcheroos
in horse racing happened in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   South American stakes winner Cinzano entered the United States
and the New York racing circuit falsely identified as a claimer
horse named Lebon.
</P>
<P>
   The ruse resulted in a jail sentence for a Long Island
veterinarian, after he collected unearned winnings at Belmont.
``Nowadays the only switches we discover are accidents, when horses
are put in the wrong vans,'' said James Zito, chief horse
identifier charged with protecting bettors and breeders from fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Mistakes are usually caught before a horse reaches the paddock,
he said, and no substitutes _ either inadvertent or orchestrated _
have appeared at Saratoga Race Course this season.
</P>
<P>
   At Saratoga, Zito and his team of five ``detectives'' review
coat markings and paperwork of 14 to 20 horses each day. The
thoroughbreds travel from around the world to make their debuts
here.
</P>
<P>
   ``We photograph 2,000 to 3,000 horses a year at all three (New
York Racing Association) tracks,'' said Zito, a former agent with
the Thoroughbred Racing Protective Bureau who is no relation to
trainer Nick Zito. ``NYRA is the only one in the country to use the
photo system, and we have for about 30 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Early Thursday morning, assistant identifier Carol Delgado and
photographer Janet Reid set out for Barn 51, stall 7 on the
backstretch. They followed in the footsteps of equine tattooist
Frank Rossi, who inscribes a unique set of numerals on the inside
upper lip of horses that were not branded prior to arriving at
Saratoga.
</P>
<P>
   The tattoo matches the numerals on the Jockey Club foal
registration certificate, but is not always legible, so Delgado
relies on other identifying characteristics.
</P>
<P>
   River Emperor is a bay gelding who belongs to Dakar Stables. He
allowed photographer Diane Connor to flip his lip so she could read
off the inscription to Delgado.
</P>
<P>
   Groom Mike Webster pulled River Emperor into the light for
Delgado to compare the horse's markings to what his certificate
reported.
</P>
<P>
   ``It says he has neck cowlicks, beneath the right falling mane,
and an irregular diamond star with a cowlick, which he has,''
Delgado said, stroking beneath the gelding's forelock after she has
confirmed all the whorls of fur.
</P>
<P>
   Any stockings or socks _ lighter hair around a horse's fetlocks
_ would be noted if River Emperor had them.
</P>
<P>
   Zito said cowlicks appear in every foal and are permanent, and
that another set of markings called chestnuts _ markings on the
back of a horse's four knees _ are comparable to human
fingerprints.
</P>
<P>
   ``The theory is that the legs rest against each other in the
womb,'' Zito said. ``The markings mirror each other. There is also
an Indian term for them, night eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   The women have been a team for five years and work quickly. They
speak to each other in short hand as Connor moves about River
Emperor's hooves to first photograph the chestnuts, then the body
while Delgado and Webster lead the thoroughbred about the walking
circle: ``More daylight (between the legs); (move the) front leg;
(give me his) full face.''
</P>
<P>
   A facial portrait, full-body profile and shot of the derriere,
with tail raised in an undignified fashion to capture fetlock
markings are taken. They go into a black binder compiled for each
race by the women.
</P>
<P>
   When owners, jockeys and racehorses gather in the paddock to
parade before each race, Zito is there with the black book to make
a visual inspection of each contestant.
</P>
<P>
   Zito said the entrance requirements for foreign horses are
stricter now, and that a repeat of the Cinzano incident was
unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to be burned again,'' Zito said. ``Once was
enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Delgado and Connor said they never had a trainer try to pass off
one horse for another. And that includes using shoe polish to
disguise a thoroughbred's markings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone asks us that,'' said Delgado, laughing. ``But we
never know what we'll discover in the morning.''

<P>
   The DNA police will soon be on the trail of dope dealers. A new
swab test can reveal if suspects have handled cannabis. It's so
sensitive that there are worries that innocent people could be
incriminated.
</P>
<P>
   The DNA-based test, which will be described fully in a
forthcoming edition of the journal Science and Justice, was
developed at the forensic science unit at the University of
Strathclyde. Researchers identified DNA sequences within the part
of the plant cell responsible for photosynthesis _ the chloroplast
_ that are specific to Cannabis sativa, but which are not found in
any other species.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery makes it possible to test samples, such as a swab
taken from someone's hands, for these sequences. The samples have
to be sent to a lab, where the polymerase chain reaction is used to
amplify the target sequences. If any are found, cannabis must be
present.
</P>
<P>
   Because the patented test (WO 98 24929) multiplies the amount of
DNA, it works on minute amounts of a sample, unlike existing
techniques.
</P>
<P>
   ''This test is as sensitive as you can ever get,'' says Adrian
Linacre, one of its inventors at Strathclyde. ''Theoretically, it
could pick up the presence of just one molecule of cannabis DNA.''
This means a swab can be taken from a suspect's hands to see if
they have been in contact with the drug, even if nothing is
visible. However, Linacre says that he has calibrated the test so
that only relatively large quantities of DNA give positive results,
in an attempt to exclude those who have unknowingly been
contaminated.
</P>
<P>
   But the threshold level is likely to be controversial. Chris
Evans of Surescreen Diagnostics in Derby, a company that markets
drug testing kits, says it would be easy for innocent people to be
incriminated. ''If you have been driving a second-hand car and a
previous owner has been using cannabis, you could get enough on
your hands to test positive,'' he warns. He also points out that
many banknotes carry trace amounts of drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Linacre is now developing the test to detect the DNA profiles of
different strains of cannabis, such as those grown in South Africa
or Thailand. ''We will be able to use genetic evidence to link
different batches of cannabis and trace them back to their original
source,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The development of the cannabis DNA test follows that of a
saliva test, by Oxfordshire-based Cozart, for a number of drugs
including cannabis. Unlike the Strathclyde development, the saliva
test is aimed at users rather than dealers, and is likely to be
used by the police, sports governing bodies and employers. &QL;

<P>
   Here is a sobering message for footballers launching themselves
into a new soccer season: an overactive sex life could give you a
career-threatening injury. A study obtained by New Scientist
suggests that players are especially prone to arthritic knee
injuries triggered by sexually transmitted bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   The study, a masters dissertation completed by Paul Oyudo when
he was a student at Queen Mary and Westfield College in London,
analyzes the cases of 10 sportsmen with persistent knee injuries.
Of the 10, six were football players and five of these played in
the Premiership, England's top soccer league.
</P>
<P>
   The study was made available by John King, a consultant
orthopedic surgeon at the London Independent Hospital. King, who is
president of the British Sports Doctors Association, hopes to make
football players aware of the risk to their careers posed by
frequent unprotected sex.
</P>
<P>
   While most football players' injuries are sustained on the field
of play, the cases studied by Oyudo involved sexually acquired
reactive arthritis, or SARA. It is triggered by the same bacteria
that cause nonspecific urethritis, an inflammation of the urethra.
In eight of the 10 cases reviewed by Oyudo, the sportsmen clearly
had nonspecific urethritis. Three had cloudy discharges in their
urine and two tested positive for Chlamydia trachomatis, a
bacterium implicated as a cause of SARA.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the sportsmen revealed the full extent of their sexual
activities to their doctors is unclear, but five of them admitted
having had more than 11 sexual partners in their lifetime. Only
about one in four British men in their mid-20s reports having had
this many partners. ''The level of promiscuity among these
sportsmen calls for concern,'' Oyudo wrote. ''Footballers appear to
be the greatest culprits.''
</P>
<P>
   Previous studies have shown that SARA is most prevalent among
men between the ages of 18 and 34. Frequent travelers and
entertainers are most at risk. ''Sportsmen fall well within this
group,'' Oyodo wrote, adding that football players have more sexual
opportunities than most: ''They are very rich and have lots of
spare time.''
</P>
<P>
   On average, each of the five Premiership football players had
spent eight months struggling with their knee injury before being
diagnosed with SARA.
</P>
<P>
   The disease is difficult to diagnose. Sufferers usually have eye
and urethral irritations, as well as tender, swollen joints. A test
that measures the speed at which red blood cells settle out of a
blood sample helps doctors to make a diagnosis. This occurs faster
in infected individuals.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Football Association says that young players
are routinely given ''general sex education,'' including advice on
avoiding sexually transmitted diseases.

   Regular doses of worms might rid people of inflammatory bowel
disease, say researchers in Iowa. They believe this distressing
condition, which is increasingly common in the developed world, is
caused by the absence of intestinal parasites.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're living in sterile boxes, breathing sterile air and
drinking sterile water,'' says Joel Weinstock, who led the
research.
</P>
<P>
   Weinstock and his colleagues at the University of Iowa have
already fed six sufferers eggs that hatched and developed into
parasitic worms. The results were so dramatic that they are
planning a larger trial this autumn. ''Between the second and third
week after treatment, five of the six patients went into complete
remission,'' says Weinstock. A single dose of worms eased symptoms
for about a month.
</P>
<P>
   Inflammatory bowel disease _ an umbrella term for ulcerative
colitis and Crohn's disease _ appears to be caused by an overactive
immune system. Symptoms include diarrhea, abdominal pain, bowel
obstruction and bleeding.
</P>
<P>
   Weinstock noticed that the rise in inflammatory bowel disease
was preceded by a decline in intestinal worm infections. Seventy
years ago, he says, 40 per cent of American children had worms such
as Ascaris lumbricoides, which grow up to 20 centimeters long. As
recently as the 1940s, many were infected with smaller whipworms
(Trichuris trichuria).
</P>
<P>
   ''By the 1960s, kids no longer had it,'' says Weinstock. ''The
worms living in the gastrointestinal tract have been with us for 3
million years or longer,'' he says. ''Our immune systems have grown
used to their presence.'' And without such parasites, Weinstock
believes the immune system is more likely to produce powerful
inflammatory agents such as gamma-interferon, which fire up the
activity of white blood cells called macrophages. ''As we've
de-wormed, people have developed immune systems which are not
damped,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The six patients in the initial trial were chosen because
steroids and other drugs designed to dampen down the immune system
had not helped.
</P>
<P>
   Working with his colleagues David Elliott and Robert Summers,
Weinstock gave each patient a drink containing microscopic eggs of
a species of intestinal worm that doesn't normally infect people.
Although these worms can survive in the human gut, growing to about
1 centimeter, they cannot reproduce and are eliminated after a
couple of months.
</P>
<P>
   Balfour Sartor, an expert on inflammatory bowel disease at the
University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill, is intrigued by
Weinstock's experiment.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's an appealing way of using something that's of fairly low
toxicity to treat a set of diseases that for now we don't have a
cure for,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Sartor is himself experimenting with Lactobacillus and
Bifidobacterium gut bacteria, again with the idea that they may
have dampening effects on the immune system.
</P>
<P>
   However, there is still a long way to go before doses of worms
or bacteria emerge as an accepted treatment for inflammatory bowel
disease. Larger controlled trials are needed to show that the
results obtained so far aren't merely due to the placebo effect. &QL;

ICE AGE MEGAFLOODS CARVED NORTHWEST LANDSCAPE

<P>
   After the ice came the deluge. As warmth began to return to the
Earth 15,000 years ago, at the end of the last ice age, giant
floods of glacial meltwater engulfed North America and Eurasia.
</P>
<P>
   And not wimpy Mississippi-scale floods, either. just one of them
could equal the combined flow of all the planet's rivers. In the
American West, megafloods carved out a vast region called the
Channelled Scablands, spanning hundreds of kilometers from Spokane,
Wash., west to the volcanic Cascades Range.
</P>
<P>
   When the waters receded, they revealed geological features that
are positively Wagnerian in scale: bars of gravel and sediment
heaped up more than 250 meters high; deep gorges gouged hundreds of
meters into the bedrock; and house-sized boulders that had been
scattered across the landscape with the ease of a child kicking a
beachball.
</P>
<P>
   It's enough to impress even a geologist _ Richard Waitt, for
instance. Waitt, who is with the U.S. Geological Survey in
Vancouver, Wash., has visited the Scablands hundreds of times to
trace the story of the megafloods through the record preserved in
sediment. ''I've been around this stuff for many years,'' he says,
''but there's still places I go sometimes and, you know, my jaw
just drops. It's just so huge.''
</P>
<P>
   Like grand opera, the tale of the megafloods is replete with
exotic adventures and tragic heroes. It all started in the 1920s,
when a geologist from the University of Chicago named J. Harlan
Bretz concluded that the overblown topography in the Scablands was
created by a sudden deluge, not the slow, uniform processes of
erosion and glacial scouring. Scenting the unfashionable odor of
catastrophism, many of Bretz's colleagues turned their backs on the
flood. Exit martyred hero, stage left.
</P>
<P>
   But not for long.
</P>
<P>
   By 1940 Bretz's ideas had won the day, after a U.S.G.S.
geologist named James Thomas Pardee supplied the missing piece of
the flood story. Near Missoula in western Montana, Pardee found
ripples on an ancient lakebed just like the ones that form on
streambeds, but of absurdly large proportions: 15 meters high and
hundreds of meters long. Only a staggering flow of water could have
made them.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to these pioneers, the full story of the Missoula floods
began to take shape. At the end of the ice age, a lobe of the vast
Cordilleran Ice Sheet oozed into the gap between two mountains near
the present-day town of Sandpoint, Idaho. A deep lake of meltwater
formed behind the frigid dam, filling several valleys in Idaho and
western Montana.
</P>
<P>
   This piece of geography, now just a fossil lakebed, is known as
glacial Lake Missoula. Pardee estimated that the lake once held as
much as 2500 cubic kilometers of water, the equivalent of Lake
Ontario and Lake Erie combined. If you gaze up the valley slopes
from downtown Missoula, you can still see parallel lines marking
ancient shorelines carved by windblown waves. The highest line
stands 600 meters from the floor of the valley.
</P>
<P>
   Then, some time around 15,000 years ago, the dam broke.
</P>
<P>
   Studies of modern ice-dammed lakes give us some idea of what
probably happened. Glacial outburst floods, known as jvkulhlaups,
occur when the water rises to about nine-tenths of the height of
the dam. At that point the ice barrier becomes slightly buoyant and
rises a bit from its mucky foundations. This allows water to
insinuate itself underneath and drill tunnels through the ice.
</P>
<P>
   ''At first this is only a trickle, but once the flow is
established, the heat from the water enlarges the incipient
tunnel,'' Waitt explains. ''To get from a trickle to a reasonable
flood can take weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   When the tunnel is big enough, the dam caves in. Lake Missoula
spilled out onto the lowlands in a rumbling, frothy flood peppered
by chunks of the shattered ice dam. Surging into the Spokane
Valley, the waters headed west. At the southwest corner of the
present-day Scablands, the flood water pooled, forming another
large lake before it drained into the Columbia Gorge and then into
the sea. The whole Noachian spectacle probably lasted only a few
days.
</P>
<P>
   The surging waters carved landforms unlike anything else on the
continent. As Bretz remarked, the Scablands are aptly named, for
they represent an unhealed wound in the skin of the Earth. The
waters scoured off the soft, windblown soil near the surface and
eventually reached bedrock, the hardened lava of the Columbia
Plateau.
</P>
<P>
   Where the water cascaded off precipices in cataracts and crashed
into the rock below, it scoured out vast pits several kilometers
wide called plunge pools. In the northern tract of the Scablands,
the water cut backward into the rock and carved the Grand Coulee, a
gorge twice as high as Niagara's and several times wider.
</P>
<P>
   Down in the Columbia River valley, the waters piled up gravel
and other debris into ridges as big as battleships. There are
hundreds of them in the Scablands.
</P>
<P>
   In making sense of this histrionic landscape, Bretz and Pardee
also left many puzzles unsolved, including the question of how many
floods there were.
</P>
<P>
   In 1977, Waitt found evidence of dozens of floods in the
Scablands, at the very least. Poking around in a canyon in the
Walla Walla Valley of eastern Washington, he found 39 stacked
layers of sediment deposited by water. Some of the layers showed
unmistakable evidence of multiple deluges: volcanic ash that had
rained down on one flood-borne layer before being covered by the
next; also rodent burrows dug through the lower reaches of the
formation and then filled in by later floods.
</P>
<P>
   Similar formations on the Columbia River suggest there may have
been as many as 100 floods. Waitt estimates that about 25 of them
were on a Noachian scale, though some other investigators think
only a handful were in that class.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, unknown to the Americans, Russian geologists were
finding the footprints of megafloods in Siberia. Not long after the
Soviet Union collapsed, an American geologist named Vic Baker went
over to take a look. Earlier, in the 1970s, Baker had used a
computer model to prove that the floods Bretz proposed were
physically possible and mighty enough to have carved the Scablands.
</P>
<P>
   Baker, now at the University of Arizona in Tucson, confirmed
what the Russians suspected: megafloods had occurred in Asia, too,
when its ice sheets retreated. In fact, an ice-dammed lake in the
Altay Mountains had released deluges of comparable scale to the
Missoula floods. Other floods also happened at the margins of all
the major northern ice sheets _ the Laurentide and Cordilleran in
North America, and the Fennoscandian and Eurasian sheets on the
other side of the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   How could geologists have overlooked such an important process
for so long? Perhaps because, as they scurried around like ants in
exaggerated landscapes, it was hard for them to get the big
picture. ''You go out there in the field,'' Waitt says, ''and once
you get your eyes adjusted to the colossal scale of things you are
just astonished.''  &QL;

   &UR; By MICHAEL MCGOUGH &LR;  &QL;

</P>
<P>
   In the early evening of Oct. 16, 1978, the newly elected Pope
John Paul II appeared on the balcony of St. Peter's Basilica and
told the crowd that he had accepted election even though ``I was
afraid in receiving the nomination.''
</P>
<P>
   If so, it was the first and last time that the former Cardinal
Karol Wojtyla of Krakow had known fear.
</P>
<P>
   Six days later, when he was invested as pope, John Paul II was
commending the Christianity of courage. Echoing the assurances of
the angel who told Mary of Nazareth that she would conceive and
bring forth the son of God, the 58-year-old pope told the throng in
St. Peter's Square: ``Be not afraid.''
</P>
<P>
   John Paul II is not afraid--of religion's cultured despisers, of
geopoliticians who find his near-pacifism naive, of liberal
Catholics who accuse him of betraying the spirit of the Second
Vatican Council (''Vatican II''), of feminists who suspect that he
sees only two acceptable roles for women--virgin and mother.
</P>
<P>
   He is unafraid of his own infirmity, caused by advancing age and
by the residual effects of a 1981 assassination attempt.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, and perhaps most interesting, John Paul II has
intimated that he might be unafraid even of a downsizing of the
papal authority his charisma has done so much to dramatize.
</P>
<P>
   Born in 1920 to the wife of a Polish soldier, the future pope
was a precocious intellectual, actor and poet who worked in a
quarry and a chemical plant during World War II. Imbued with the
popular Catholicism of Poland--marked by effusive devotion to the
Virgin Mary (an aspect of John Paul II's spirituality that
discomfits Protestants and liberal Catholics)-- Wojtyla began
studies for the priesthood in 1942 in an ``underground'' seminary
made necessary by the Nazi occupation.
</P>
<P>
   After the war he studied in Rome, boarding an ecclesiastical
fast track: auxiliary bishop of Krakow in 1958; archbishop in 1964;
and cardinal in 1967. Though Communist officials regarded him as
more pliable than other churchmen, he proved unafraid to confront
them in the cause of freedom for the Polish church.
</P>
<P>
   When Wojtyla was elected pope, after the 33-day reign of the
Italian John Paul I, the international press portrayed him as the
darkest of dark horses. In hindsight, his ecclesiastical networking
during and after Vatican II made him a logical candidate once it
was clear no Italian cardinal could win election.
</P>
<P>
   The rest is history, from which liberal and conservative
Catholics draw strikingly contrary conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   The pope took the Gospel and his magnetic personality on the
road--forsaking the throne, on which past popes were carried
through St. Peter's Basilica, for the Popemobile.
</P>
<P>
   The year after his election, John Paul II returned to Poland for
nine days and encountered a rhapsodic reception that more than one
biographer credits with helping to sow the seeds of the Solidarity
movement's later challenge to the Communist regime.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere on his world tour, which has passed through 119
countries, he kept faith with his predecessors John XXIII and Paul
VI in defending the dignity of workers and anathematizing the arms
race. He called for negotiations rather than the use of force in
the Gulf War and in Bosnia and Kosovo. He has been critical of
international sanctions against Iraq, and he hopes next year to
visit the birthplace of the biblical patriarch Abraham there.
</P>
<P>
   These and similar initiatives pleased political liberals inside
and outside the church; not so the Vatican's use of its
quasigovernmental status to oppose population-control initiatives
that the pope feared would contribute to the ``culture of death.''
</P>
<P>
   The style of John Paul II's papacy has occasioned as much
comment as its substance. Past popes were remote and magisterial
figures, but capitalizing on his relative youth, his actor's
panache, and a mastery of mass communications, John Paul II changed
all that--unafraid of diluting the papal mystique through
overexposure.
</P>
<P>
   The pope's roadshow has never had an exclusively Catholic cast.
He has met with Rome's chief rabbi and has joined in worship with
Lutheran bishops and, in a historic 1982 ceremony in Canterbury
Cathedral, with the spiritual leader of the Church of England,
which broke with Rome in the 16th century.
</P>
<P>
   Some would dismiss this as photo-op ecumenism and note that
Anglicans are not invited to take Holy Communion in Roman Catholic
churches, despite agreements by an Anglican-Roman Catholic
theological commission on the meaning of that sacrament. Anglicans
were also dismayed when Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, the pope's
doctrinal watchdog, signed a document that seemed to rehabilitate a
much-criticized 1896 papal bull declaring the holy orders of
Anglican clergy ``absolutely null and utterly void.''
</P>
<P>
   It isn't only in his policy toward other churches that John Paul
II is accused of preaching reform and practicing reaction. Vatican
II gave rise to a less hierarchical and more outward-looking
Catholicism and set the stage for once-unthinkable innovations like
plainclothes nuns and the celebration of the Mass in English and
other modern languages.
</P>
<P>
   Liberal Catholics concede that John Paul II may follow the
letter of the council's decrees but, mindful that ``the letter
killeth, but the spirit giveth life'' (2 Corinthians 3:6), they see
in Vatican II a trajectory of further change that this pope has
frustrated.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul II is not oblivious to these criticisms, just
contemptuous of them. It is his duty, he writes in ``Crossing the
Threshold of Hope,'' to ``interpret [Vatican II] correctly and
defend it from tendentious interpretations.''
</P>
<P>
   It seems the pope enjoys confounding his critics. He recalls
that on one trip to Poland he offended local adherents of the
``enlightened agenda'' by emphasizing the Ten Commandments. ``For
such people,'' he said, ``the pope becomes persona non grata when
he tries to convince the world of human sin.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the liberal Catholic case against the pope deals with
sexuality. It is even said that he has a ``woman problem,'' which
supposedly finds expression in his defense of church positions on
an all-male clergy, contraception, and abortion. Yes, abortion is
anathema to John Paul II, who is bemused by suggestions that he has
an ``obsession'' with the subject, but he condemns abortion because
he sees it as not only anti-life but also anti-woman.
</P>
<P>
   The pope has endorsed sexual equality in the workplace and in
society, but there is no doubt that he subscribes to a Christian
version of difference feminism. In a 1988 apostolic letter on the
``dignity and vocation of women,'' the pope warned that ``in the
name of liberation from male domination, women must not appropriate
to themselves male characteristics contrary to their own feminine
'originality.' ``
</P>
<P>
   What is so ``original'' about women? In a 1962 retreat for
university students in Krakow, the future pope, espousing what
sounds like the Gospel According to Carol Gilligan, told female
participants that ``women are more feeling and intuitive people and
become involved in things in a more sensitive and complete
manner.''
</P>
<P>
   In separate remarks to male students, Wojtyla argued that ``in
men, the intellect has a certain supremacy over the heart, and this
is why Christ entrusted responsibility for the Gospel as idea to
them.''
</P>
<P>
   This view of sexual differences suggests that for John Paul II,
opposition to women priests is not simply a tradition inherited
from his predecessors or even an emulation of Jesus' decision to
call only men as apostles. For John Paul II, as for Paul VI, the
male monopoly on priesthood is required by ``theological
anthropology.'' The pope has ratcheted up its importance by
decreeing that the male monopoly on priesthood is an article of
faith that must be ``definitively held by all the Church's
faithful.''
</P>
<P>
   His obstinacy on the issue is cited as proof that John Paul II
is indifferent to one of the major themes of Vatican II: Christian
reunion. The picture is more complicated. While the pope has warned
the archbishop of Canterbury that the ordination of women as
Anglican priests poses ``an increasingly serious obstacle'' to
reconciliation between Rome and Canterbury, he has indicated a
surprising willingness to compromise on a seemingly more
fundamental obstacle to reunion: the papacy itself.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1995 encyclical, John Paul II broached the possibility
that, in the interests of Christian unity, he or his successors
might ``find a way of exercising the [papal] primacy which, while
in no way renouncing what is essential to its mission, is
nonetheless open to a new situation.'' He went on to note that in
the first 1,000 years of Christianity the bishop of Rome ``acted by
common consent as moderator'' when Christians disagreed about
belief or discipline.
</P>
<P>
   This tantalizing suggestion of a scaled-down papal office was
seized on by the Anglican-Roman Catholic International Commission
this May in a report that suggested Anglicans should accept a
circumscribed papal primacy as a ``gift to be shared.''
</P>
<P>
   The pope's suggestion also dovetails with a new interest among
some Protestant theologians in a ``universal primate'' who would
serve as a focus of unity for world Christianity. (What it does not
comport with, ironically, is the papal role as John Paul II has so
effectively enlarged it. Would a ``tiebreaker'' bishop of Rome have
any use for an airplane or a Popemobile?)
</P>
<P>
   Here is perhaps the ultimate example of John Paul II's
fearlessness: a willingness at least to consider some diminution in
the scope of his office in exchange for an improvement on the
current ``imperfect unity'' of Christendom.
</P>
<P>
   But churches that ordain female clergy might have their own
``woman problem'' in accepting a scaled-back papacy that came with
theological strings attached. The pope surely knows this, which
suggests that his target might not be the churches of the
Reformation, but the Orthodox and other ancient churches of the
East.
</P>
<P>
   Although estranged from Rome for hundreds of years, these
tradition-rich churches long have fascinated John Paul II, who
comes from a part of the world where Latin and Byzantine
Christianity overlap. And one more thing: The Eastern churches do
not, and likely never will, ordain women.

   &UR; By MICHAEL MCGOUGH &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   In the early evening of Oct. 16, 1978, the newly elected Pope
John Paul II appeared on the balcony of St. Peter's Basilica and
told the crowd that he had accepted election even though ``I was
afraid in receiving the nomination.''
</P>
<P>
   If so, it was the first and last time that the former Cardinal
Karol Wojtyla of Krakow had known fear.
</P>
<P>
   Six days later, when he was invested as pope, John Paul II was
commending the Christianity of courage. Echoing the assurances of
the angel who told Mary of Nazareth that she would conceive and
bring forth the son of God, the 58-year-old pope told the throng in
St. Peter's Square: ``Be not afraid.''
</P>
<P>
   John Paul II is not afraid--of religion's cultured despisers, of
geopoliticians who find his near-pacifism naive, of liberal
Catholics who accuse him of betraying the spirit of the Second
Vatican Council (''Vatican II''), of feminists who suspect that he
sees only two acceptable roles for women--virgin and mother.
</P>
<P>
   He is unafraid of his own infirmity, caused by advancing age and
by the residual effects of a 1981 assassination attempt.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, and perhaps most interesting, John Paul II has
intimated that he might be unafraid even of a downsizing of the
papal authority his charisma has done so much to dramatize.
</P>
<P>
   Born in 1920 to the wife of a Polish soldier, the future pope
was a precocious intellectual, actor and poet who worked in a
quarry and a chemical plant during World War II. Imbued with the
popular Catholicism of Poland--marked by effusive devotion to the
Virgin Mary (an aspect of John Paul II's spirituality that
discomfits Protestants and liberal Catholics)-- Wojtyla began
studies for the priesthood in 1942 in an ``underground'' seminary
made necessary by the Nazi occupation.
</P>
<P>
   After the war he studied in Rome, boarding an ecclesiastical
fast track: auxiliary bishop of Krakow in 1958; archbishop in 1964;
and cardinal in 1967. Though Communist officials regarded him as
more pliable than other churchmen, he proved unafraid to confront
them in the cause of freedom for the Polish church.
</P>
<P>
   When Wojtyla was elected pope, after the 33-day reign of the
Italian John Paul I, the international press portrayed him as the
darkest of dark horses. In hindsight, his ecclesiastical networking
during and after Vatican II made him a logical candidate once it
was clear no Italian cardinal could win election.
</P>
<P>
   The rest is history, from which liberal and conservative
Catholics draw strikingly contrary conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   The pope took the Gospel and his magnetic personality on the
road--forsaking the throne, on which past popes were carried
through St. Peter's Basilica, for the Popemobile.
</P>
<P>
   The year after his election, John Paul II returned to Poland for
nine days and encountered a rhapsodic reception that more than one
biographer credits with helping to sow the seeds of the Solidarity
movement's later challenge to the Communist regime.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere on his world tour, which has passed through 119
countries, he kept faith with his predecessors John XXIII and Paul
VI in defending the dignity of workers and anathematizing the arms
race. He called for negotiations rather than the use of force in
the Gulf War and in Bosnia and Kosovo. He has been critical of
international sanctions against Iraq, and he hopes next year to
visit the birthplace of the biblical patriarch Abraham there.
</P>
<P>
   These and similar initiatives pleased political liberals inside
and outside the church; not so the Vatican's use of its
quasigovernmental status to oppose population-control initiatives
that the pope feared would contribute to the ``culture of death.''
</P>
<P>
   The style of John Paul II's papacy has occasioned as much
comment as its substance. Past popes were remote and magisterial
figures, but capitalizing on his relative youth, his actor's
panache, and a mastery of mass communications, John Paul II changed
all that--unafraid of diluting the papal mystique through
overexposure.
</P>
<P>
   The pope's roadshow has never had an exclusively Catholic cast.
He has met with Rome's chief rabbi and has joined in worship with
Lutheran bishops and, in a historic 1982 ceremony in Canterbury
Cathedral, with the spiritual leader of the Church of England,
which broke with Rome in the 16th century.
</P>
<P>
   Some would dismiss this as photo-op ecumenism and note that
Anglicans are not invited to take Holy Communion in Roman Catholic
churches, despite agreements by an Anglican-Roman Catholic
theological commission on the meaning of that sacrament. Anglicans
were also dismayed when Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, the pope's
doctrinal watchdog, signed a document that seemed to rehabilitate a
much-criticized 1896 papal bull declaring the holy orders of
Anglican clergy ``absolutely null and utterly void.''
</P>
<P>
   It isn't only in his policy toward other churches that John Paul
II is accused of preaching reform and practicing reaction. Vatican

Catholicism and set the stage for once-unthinkable innovations like
plainclothes nuns and the celebration of the Mass in English and
other modern languages.

 &HT;    MICROSOFT TRIAL TO REACH KEY MILESTONE
 &HT;    800&AMP;add. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories
for release Sunday, Aug. 8.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Soon after the financial markets close Tuesday,
rival attorneys from the Justice Department and Microsoft Corp.
will descend on the federal courthouse, each bearing thick legal
opinions.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides in the epic struggle recognize that U.S. District
Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson is all but certain to lay aside their
proposed verdicts in the Microsoft antitrust case and issue his
own. Nevertheless, the voluminous briefing books, with
diametrically different story lines, were being meticulously edited
late last week in a bid to sway not only the judge, but also the
media and legal scholars.
</P>
<P>
   As the Microsoft case approaches another milestone, that outside
``jury,'' which also includes financial analysts, appears largely
persuaded that Jackson will find that the company has failed to
obey the antitrust laws. At the same time, some informed observers
doubt the judge will be swayed by recent government feelers to
investment bankers on how best to break up Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   ``In forming his own conclusions, the judge will place a lot of
weight on the credibility of the courtroom witnesses,'' said Daniel
Reznek, a retired partner in the law firm of Arnold &AMP; Porter, who
has followed the case closely and who has known Jackson for many
years. ``That's what he needs to do to dampen the chances of being
reversed on appeal,'' Reznek added.
</P>
<P>
   In his comments from the bench during the non-jury trial,
Jackson often seemed favorably disposed to the searing
cross-examination of Microsoft witnesses waged by David Boies, the
lead prosecutor. ``But that predisposition doesn't mean that he'll
buy wholesale into any government-written remedy package,'' Reznek
cautioned.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's lawyers privately see the revived breakup talk as a
harassing tactic aimed at gaining bargaining leverage in renewed
settlement talks, which could follow any preliminary indication
from Jackson that the world's largest software company remains in
legal trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Such a signal could come shortly after closing oral arguments
are heard in mid-September. In the interim, the legal combatants,
in addition to filing their rival opinions, formally known as
``findings of fact,'' will also prepare rebuttal briefs, also due
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, the prosecutors contend that it is normal
procedure, as the landmark trial moves toward a climax, for them to
explore potential remedies.
</P>
<P>
   The proscutors asked Wall Street investment bankers to estimate
Microsoft's future worth if it were broken up _ either to compete
against itself as several ``Baby Bills'' or else by spinning
Windows off from such applications as Microsoft Office.
</P>
<P>
   But the bankers were reluctant to do so, pointing out that a
company that chiefly sells intellectual property represents a
different model than the ``Baby Bells'' that were successfully spun
off from AT&AMP;T to meet antitrust issues in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been looking at possible remedies, but it's premature,''
said Justice Department spokeswoman Gina Talamona. ``The judge
hasn't even ruled on whether Microsoft is liable. We've said all
along we would talk to experts, asking for a wide variety of
options. But we haven't even made a decision on what kind of
remedies we may or may not ask for.''
</P>
<P>
   In the course of the 71-day trial, the Justice Department and 19
state attorneys general built a methodical case against the
software giant. It is based on both direct testimony from 13
prosecutorial witnesses and e-mails from Microsoft chairman Bill
Gates and his top lieutenants.
</P>
<P>
   The government contends that Microsoft broke the law by bullying
rivals in the computer industry in an effort to protect its
lucrative Windows monopoly and to dominate the market for Internet
browsing software.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's rivals dismiss the rapid changes that have occurred
in the high-tech sector since the case was filed some 15 months
ago, asserting that they have not altered Microsoft monopoly power
over the market for personal computer operating systems. It is a
monopoly, they argue, that if left unchecked would enable Microsoft
to unfairly dominate Internet commerce and squash its weaker
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the arguments likely to be advanced in the dueling
briefs, a deal that would short-circuit the trial and avoid a
lengthy appeals process remains a viable option. Earlier sporadic
settlement talks proved fruitless.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the judge accepts some limited portion of the government's
clims, a renewed settlement effort would make a good deal of
sense,'' said Michael Lacovara, a key member of Microsoft legal
defense team. ``As I see it,'' he added, ``the trial has been a
distraction (for Microsoft) and it would be good to move on _ if a
fair and sensible way could be found to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Despite his openness to the idea of a striking a bargain,
Lacovara, a partner in the New York law firm of Sullivan &AMP;
Cromwell, said his client is dealing from a position of strength.
</P>
<P>
   Lacovara noted that the government case has been specifically
aimed at Windows 98, an operating system shipped by Microsoft a few
weeks after the suit was filed.
</P>
<P>
   Windows 98 includes a built-in browser known as Internet
Explorer. Even as large computer makers widely pre-loaded that
system on their Intel-based machines, the government argued in
court that their customers should regain the freedom to buy an
unbundled version. It is a ``freedom,'' Microsoft says, that users
have never sought and that is technologically impossible to
achieve.
</P>
<P>
   Around the time Jackson is due to rule, most likely before the
year's end, Windows is due to be supplanted by Windows 2000, a
heftier operating system based on another file structure. A
consumer-oriented version of Windows 2000, code named Millennium,
is likely to be released early next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be our firm position that, whatever else might
happen, the government, if it chose to do so, would have to build
an entirely new case with respect to Windows 2000, which has never
been part of this case,'' Lacovara said during an interview in the
conference room of his law firm's Washington offices, which
features spectacular views of the White House complex.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the broader sense,'' he said, ``the development and
forthcoming release of Windows 2000 underscores the truly dynamic
structure of this industry, a reality that the government has
adamantly refused to acknowledge.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1,000 or so pages that Microsoft's lawyers will present to
the judge boil down to this: The company did nothing to harm
consumers while adding features such as browsers simply to meet
their needs. Its overall behavior has, in fact, fostered
competition. It lacks monopoly power because of the continual
competitive threats it faces. Low Windows' pricing patterns reflect
such real world restraints.
</P>
<P>
   On one level, the issues in the trial have hardly moved since
Attorney General Janet Reno announced the broad attack against
Microsoft. ``Government intervention into a healthy, competitive
and innovative industry will adversely impact consumers and a U.S.
company's ability to improve its products,'' the company claimed on
the day the suit was filed. It has never wavered from that view.
</P>
<P>
   But, on another level, the issues are also as immediate as the
day's technology headlines. Thus, as Microsoft attempts to loosen
America Online Inc.'s grip on millions of instant-messaging
customers, it is also reflects the ongoing legal struggle between
the nation's top software maker and its leading online service.
</P>
<P>
   In the course of the trial, AOL absorbed Netscape Communications
Corp. at a cost of $10 billion. In suing Microsoft, the government
had held that the company had illegally sought to destroy
Netscape's business in order to extend its monopoly power to
Internet commerce. Its complaint cites Netscape 130 times.
</P>
<P>
   ``But market dynamics do matter,'' Lacovara contended. ``In the
course of discovery, we were able to see what the parties were
saying to each other. And those exchanges greatly bolster our
case.''

lengthy appeals process remains a viable option. Earlier sporadic
settlement talks proved fruitless.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the judge accepts some limited portion of the government's
claims, a renewed settlement effort would make a good deal of
sense,'' said Michael Lacovara, a key member of Microsoft legal
defense team. ``As I see it,'' he added, ``the trial has been a
distraction (for Microsoft) and it would be good to move on _ if a
fair and sensible way could be found to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Despite his openness to the idea of a striking a bargain,
Lacovara, a partner in the New York law firm of Sullivan &AMP;
Cromwell, said his client is dealing from a position of strength.
</P>
<P>
   Lacovara noted that the government case has been specifically
aimed at Windows 98, an operating system shipped by Microsoft a few
weeks after the suit was filed.
</P>
<P>
   Windows 98 includes a built-in browser known as Internet
Explorer. Even as large computer makers widely pre-loaded that
system on their Intel-based machines, the government argued in
court that their customers should regain the freedom to buy an
unbundled version. It is a ``freedom,'' Microsoft says, that users
have never sought and that is technologically impossible to
achieve.
</P>
<P>
   Around the time Jackson is due to rule, most likely before the
year's end, Windows is due to be supplanted by Windows 2000, a
heftier operating system based on another file structure. A
consumer-oriented version of Windows 2000, code named Millennium,
is likely to be released early next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be our firm position that, whatever else might
happen, the government, if it chose to do so, would have to build
an entirely new case with respect to Windows 2000, which has never
been part of this case,'' Lacovara said during an interview in the
conference room of his law firm's Washington offices, which
features spectacular views of the White House complex.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the broader sense,'' he said, ``the development and
forthcoming release of Windows 2000 underscores the truly dynamic
structure of this industry, a reality that the government has
adamantly refused to acknowledge.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1,000 or so pages that Microsoft's lawyers will present to
the judge boil down to this: The company did nothing to harm
consumers while adding features such as browsers simply to meet
their needs. Its overall behavior has, in fact, fostered
competition. It lacks monopoly power because of the continual
competitive threats it faces. Low Windows' pricing patterns reflect
such real world restraints.
</P>
<P>
   On one level, the issues in the trial have hardly moved since
Attorney General Janet Reno announced the broad attack against
Microsoft. ``Government intervention into a healthy, competitive
and innovative industry will adversely impact consumers and a U.S.
company's ability to improve its products,'' the company claimed on
the day the suit was filed. It has never wavered from that view.
</P>
<P>
   But, on another level, the issues are also as immediate as the
day's technology headlines. Thus, as Microsoft attempts to loosen
America Online Inc.'s grip on millions of instant-messaging
customers, it is also reflects the ongoing legal struggle between
the nation's top software maker and its leading online service.
</P>
<P>
   In the course of the trial, AOL absorbed Netscape Communications
Corp. at a cost of $10 billion. In suing Microsoft, the government
had held that the company had illegally sought to destroy
Netscape's business in order to extend its monopoly power to
Internet commerce. Its complaint cites Netscape 130 times.
</P>
<P>
   ``But market dynamics do matter,'' Lacovara contended. ``In the
course of discovery, we were able to see what the parties were
saying to each other. And those exchanges greatly bolster our
case.''

 &HT;    AS HMO'S DROP ELDERLY, ALL SIDES SEEK TO ASSIGN BLAME
 &HT;    For release Sunday, Aug. 8.
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two years after Congress expanded managed care
choices for Medicare, nearly 200 HMOs have dropped coverage for
roughly three-quarters of a million elderly Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Of those dropped by their health maintenance organizations, more
than 50,000 this year and nearly 80,000 next year will be forced
back into traditional fee-for-service Medicare because there
weren't any other managed care plans locally available.
</P>
<P>
   Some lawmakers are blaming the federal Health Care Financing
Administration for the HMO withdrawal, claiming HCFA misinterpreted
what Congress intended when it passed the Balanced Budget Act.
</P>
<P>
   Two congressmen, Reps. Michael Bilirakis, R-Fla., and Peter
Deutsch, D-Fla., have introduced legislation to block HCFA from
slashing managed care reimbursement rates by $11.2 billion over
five years. Bilirakis is chairman of the House Commerce
subcommittee on health which has partial jurisdiction over
Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   At a hearing before the panel last week, the managed care
industry argued that the implementation of the ``Medicare+Choice''
program had created a ``fairness gap'' between payments to HMOs and
the fee-for-service system. But HCFA officials argued there was
little evidence that low payment rates were behind the decisions to
drop Medicare participation.
</P>
<P>
   The Medicare+Choice program was designed to expand the choice of
health plans available to the elderly by allowing a variety of
managed care-type plans in addition to HMOs, which restrict
enrollees to using only their medical providers.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, just before Medicare+Choice took effect, 346 health
plans participated in Medicare covering 6.2 million people, about
17 percent of all Medicare beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   When the program took effect in January, 99 plans had dropped
out or reduced their geographic coverage area _ 45 withdrawals and
54 reductions _ affecting 407,000 people, of whom 51,000 were
unable to rejoin a plan because none was available.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, another 99 plans announced plans to drop out or
curtail coverage effective Jan. 1, 2000. This time, 41 plans
withdrew and 58 reduced territory, affecting 327,000 people. Of
those, 79,000 don't have another plan in their area.
</P>
<P>
   Offsetting the withdrawals, 41 plans have expanded or joined the
program and another 22 are awaiting approval.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Ignagni, president and chief executive officer of the
American Association of Health Plans, warned Bilirakis's panel that
the Medicare+Choice program was facing a crisis and its survival
was in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beneficiaries stand to lose a great deal,'' Ignagni said. ``If
you don't act this year, we look forward to far more beneficiaries
being affected.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials and their supporters testified that the
turbulence in the Medicare+Choice program has not reduced total
Medicare HMO enrollments and has forced relatively few into the
fee-for-service system.
</P>
<P>
   Robert A. Berenson, HCFA's director for health plans and
providers, said there are now nearly 6.5 million Medicare
beneficiaries enrolled in managed care, slightly more than when
plans began dropping out last year. He noted that 95 percent of
Medicare managed care beneficiaries have not been affected by the
cutbacks and less than 2 percent will be forced back into
fee-for-service.
</P>
<P>
   Marilyn Moon, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute, said the
``withdrawal of plans from certain markets is a natural by-product
of choice and competition. They should not only be expected, they
are a necessary part of the process.''
</P>
<P>
   Ignagni claims that a major reason so many plans are dropping
coverage for next year is a new HCFA formula which adjusts payments
to the expected risk each enrollee brings to the health plan.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, HMOs have received 95 percent of the average cost of
treating local Medicare fee-for-service patients. But studies have
indicated that an average tied to fee-for-service payments has
grossly overpaid managed care plans which historically have
enrolled younger, healthier beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   HCFA's new risk adjustment formula is projected to trim $11.2
billion over five years from HMO payments. That's on top of more
than $22 billion in payment cuts over five years imposed through
other provisions of the Balance Budget Act.
</P>
<P>
   Ignagni said the cuts imposed by the risk adjustment formula
treat HMOs unfairly and are not what Congress intended.
</P>
<P>
   ``The impact of this risk-adjustment methodology will be to
restrict new market entrants and leave beneficiaries with fewer
options, reduced benefits and higher out-of-pocket costs,'' Ignagni
said. ``Overpaid health plans do not leave a market. Overpaid
health plans do not reduce benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Berenson argued that the fight over the risk adjustment formula
is designed to hide the fact that some managed care plans have been
unable to find a market in certain areas, particularly rural
communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inadequate reimbursement to plans does not explain plan
decisions to trim participation in the program,'' he said.
``Payment is rising in all counties this coming year by an average
of 5 percent and will rise by as much as 18 percent in some
areas.''

REPEAT AFTER ME: THINK, THEN BUY

By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I have a PC with a 300-MHz AMD processor with
Windows 98 installed. I click the print button and nothing happens,
so I click it again and still nothing, then I click it a third
time. By then, my printer would start, and I would get three
copies. When I click and drag something, nothing seems to happen
until about three seconds later. When I use Microsoft Word, what I
type doesn't show up until about three seconds later. This problem
has existed since the computer was new. Unfortunately, it was
purchased at a computer show, and the supplier is out of business.
Can you give me a hint as to what my problem is?
</P>
<P>
   _Delayed Reaction
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DELAYED: Yes. You probably spent about three seconds
researching your purchase.
</P>
<P>
   I certainly hope you didn't buy the thing without playing with
it at the show. Such cruddy performance is unacceptable, and you
should have seen that right away. If the guy you dealt with was
legit, he would have refunded your money or fixed the problem,
assuming you were unhappy from the start.
</P>
<P>
   But, all that's academic. You're stuck with a lemon, so let's
make a nice, tall pitcher of lemon daiquiris.
</P>
<P>
   Everything you've mentioned points to a tremendously
underpowered machine. It's trying to do too much with limited
resources, and it falls behind, like a chimpanzee taking the SAT.
Maybe the chip isn't even a 300. Not everybody is as forthrightly
honest and above-board as I am, so maybe this weasel re-labeled the
chip. Regular people don't know the difference, and there's really
no way to tell what speed a chip is without running benchmark
tests. If I didn't know who I was dealing with, that's the first
thing I'd want to see. It may seem rude, but you can afford to be a
lout when it's your bank balance on the line.
</P>
<P>
   Next, I'd check the RAM. Nothing slows down a PC, especially one
running Win98, like inadequate memory. If you have less than 32
megabytes, you're just begging for things to run in slow motion,
especially with something as bloated and RAM-hungry as Word.
Windows juggles a lot of stuff around in memory. When it starts to
run short, it uses space on your hard drive to simulate more, but
that results in another slowdown.
</P>
<P>
   Also, how much stuff is going on at once? Remember that the
microprocessor has to divide its attention between all programs
that are running. It may take it a while to get back to the one
you're expecting instant results from. Close down everything you
don't need. And even if you only have one thing going, remember
that Windows always has a bunch of stuff messing around in the
background. If you hit Control-Alt-Delete, you'll get a list of
everything running. You won't have any idea what most of that stuff
is, but you can try shutting down some of the processes to see if
they're needed or not.
</P>
<P>
   Most of them get loaded automatically. See if any are in your
Startup folder, then dump what you don't need. Others are launched
from a mysterious place deep within Windows called the Registry. In
Win98 you can selectively whack these by going to Run on the Start
menu, then typing in Msconfig (Enter). This kicks up a sweet little
utility that lets you play with your startup procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Well, we live and learn, I suppose. But I admire a guy like you
who's not afraid to take a chance on a bargain. Now, I don't
usually do this, but there's a great little Internet startup I know
I can interest you in. Cash only, please.

IF PACHYSANDRA AND IVY DON'T COVER THE GROUND 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By PATRICIA A. TAYLOR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   At times it seems as if I were the only member of the ``anything
but pachysandra'' group. Pachysandra, the ubiquitous and _ yes, I
admit it _ highly useful evergreen ground cover, smothers
landscapes throughout my central New Jersey community and many
other parts of the country as well.
</P>
<P>
   So deep is my aversion to pachysandra's boring, reliable
greenness, that I accepted plugs of ivy from a neighbor 10 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Now, I'm thinking of starting an ``anything but pachysandra or
ivy'' club.
</P>
<P>
   A reasonable response to such an assertion is: ``Well, what else
is low maintenance, grows no higher than eight inches and provides
a welcome touch of green in dreary winter months?'' After much
research and years of experimentation, I have an answer.
</P>
<P>
   There are at least three evergreen ground covers that fill the
bill, all little-known native Americans. I treasure them for their
resistance to disease and pests as well as for their elegant
beauty. And all three provide a bonus: colorful spring flowers.
</P>
<P>
   The first to bloom, Waldsteinia fragariodes, has a most
unfortunate common name: barren strawberry. It conjures up images
of the horrible wild strawberries that streak through my organic
lawn. If not for the recommendation of an expert gardener, I never
would have tried this plant.
</P>
<P>
   Waldsteinia has leaves three to four inches wide, glossy green
and three lobed. Over time, it forms dense, spreading mats, with
new leaves appearing on top of those from the previous year and
concealing them. Though the foliage resembles that on cultivated
strawberries, there is no noticeable fruit.
</P>
<P>
   In spring, golden yellow flowers open on slim, seven-inch stems
and look like fairy stars sparkling above a rich green floor. This
year, the flowers bloomed for five weeks, starting in mid-April.
</P>
<P>
   Waldsteinia truly comes into its glory in winter, when repeated
blasts of cold weather infuse the leaves with a purple flush. The
two tones, dark green and purple, are especially lovely when
emerging from a sparkling blanket of snow.
</P>
<P>
   Some of my garden books say the common name derives from the
plant's preference for barren areas or flat open spaces. Others
declare it is a woodland plant. I compromised and placed it as an
underskirt in a border filled with dwarf deciduous shrubs. There,
its colorful foliage is exposed throughout winter.
</P>
<P>
   In spring, Waldsteinia's flowers shine among the emerging leaves
and flowers on the shrubs. Hidden beneath the shrubs through summer
and fall, Waldsteinia serves as a protective mulch that conserves
water and inhibits weed growth.
</P>
<P>
   While the leaves of golden ragwort (Senecio aureus) are about
the size of Waldsteinia's, they are rounded, rather than lobed, and
have minute notches as an edging. April breezes seem to induce a
color reaction in the rich, dark green foliage: the undersides turn
a lovely purple.
</P>
<P>
   In early May, golden, asterlike flowers open for almost three
weeks on top of two-foot stems. The flowers then metamorphose into
rounded white seed heads, which look like fluffy buttons as they
bob above the dark green foliage.
</P>
<P>
   Though I have yet to find any seedlings sprouting, the
rhizomatous roots started to take off after a year or two. Golden
ragwort spreads easily, and is thus ideal for large spaces.
</P>
<P>
   Since I do not have large spaces, I have begun to pass clumps on
to friends. That's how I learned how adaptable this plant is.
Conventional wisdom decrees that one should place it in lightly
shaded, moist garden soil, as I did.
</P>
<P>
   One friend placed it on a dry wooded slope resting on a shale
outcropping. It flourishes there and is also completely avoided by
the groundhogs that feast on most other vegetation.
</P>
<P>
   Foamflowers (Tiarella) are a woodland genus, interbreeding at
will. Four of its five members hail from North America.
</P>
<P>
   Until the 1990s, gardeners could choose only between an
aggressive spreader (T. cordifolia) and a more restrained clumper
(T. wherryi). The spreader has white flowers, which bloom for two
to three weeks in April, and the clumper has pink flowers, which
open for six to seven weeks in mid- to late spring and often
repeat-bloom.
</P>
<P>
   Plant breeders have changed all this, creating many lovely
hybrids that combine features of both species, plus two others from
the Pacific Northwest, T. trifoliata and T. unifoliata. Leaves are
now described as heart shaped, maplelike and oaklike; many have
veins etched in maroon.
</P>
<P>
   I have tried hybrids over the years, most notably Tiger Stripe
and Elizabeth Oliver. On my grounds, they have produced their own
little hybrids, so that I now have many different leaf forms,
though all the plants bear spiky, pink-tinged flowers, none of
those taller than 12 inches.
</P>
<P>
   Each is charming in the shade garden throughout the growing
season. Elizabeth Oliver takes center stage in winter. Its foliage
mat, a luscious maroon in the cold, provides a welcome touch of
elegance in a season of bare earth.
</P>
<P>
   It may be lonely here in the ``anything but pachysandra'' group,
but it certainly has its rewards.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   While other teen-agers stuffed Frisbees and flippers into duffel
bags last month, Michael Granat packed long pants and collared
shirts for a camp where things don't get much looser than a casual
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Michael, 14, of New City, N.Y., was headed for his second summer
of business camp, where there are treks to the Federal Reserve Bank
of New York, hikes through a Ferrari dealership and lessons on
tying knots on acquisition targets. At mealtime, there is
instruction in business etiquette.
</P>
<P>
   One recent tip: Eat before lunching with the boss to avoid that
wolfish look.
</P>
<P>
   Even though it will be years before Michael and his fellow
campers, ages 13 to 16, have an actual boss, some seem as if they
can't wait to be 40. At the Julian Krinsky Summer Camps at
Haverford College, they don't have to. They get a leg up on future
rivals for Wall Street partnerships, or for financing their
E-commerce start-ups, by learning corporate skills in their teens.
</P>
<P>
   For Michael, who left home with a case of sodas to sell at a
profit to other campers, ``business has always been a passion,''
said his father, Steven Granat. Granat, a self-employed middleman
in the footwear industry, said his son has been reading the stock
tables since elementary school, when he bought Disney. (Well, a
share or two.)
</P>
<P>
   If, in the age of Bill Gates, Michael Eisner and 26-year-old
dot-com moguls, business is cool, the message hasn't quite reached
Michael's teen-age friends back home in Rockland County. ``Kids
think, why don't you just go skateboarding?'' his father said.
``That's why he loves the camp. He can meet kids with the same
interests.''
</P>
<P>
   There are campers like Adam Wynn, 15, of Scarsdale, N.Y., who
plans to start a company called LABA Associates with six friends.
The name means nothing, Adam said _ but then again, neither does
Haagen-Dazs. ``Business should be something society will benefit
from,'' Adam said, and proving he'd paid attention in class, he
added, ``and you should also have brand equity so everyone will
know your name.''
</P>
<P>
   The four-week camp, which attracted about three dozen youngsters
in two sessions this summer (ending August 13), is one more sign
that business leaders have become pop figures, serving as role
models to impressionable minds, and that many families think it's
never too early to get on track for a corner office.
</P>
<P>
   The business camp, which costs $3,400, is an outgrowth of golf
and tennis camps on the Haverford campus run by Krinsky, a South
African-born former tennis star who played at Wimbledon, and a
partner, Adrian Castelli. In the morning, the 200 campers pursue
special interests, which besides business include drama and
cooking; in the afternoon, sports and other activities.
</P>
<P>
   Preparing teen-agers for business and the corporate world, an
idea Krinsky conceived five years ago, seemed like a good fit with
the existing camp because, he said, ``We truly are teaching
business persons' sports _ tennis, golf and squash.''
</P>
<P>
   On a recent morning, the campers were given a tour of the
University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business by the
coordinator of its undergraduate division, Sharon Mulholland. The
tour ended in a lecture hall, where Mrs. Mulholland urged campers
to apply to Wharton's bachelor's program, rather than end up as
``poets'' _ the school nickname for MBA candidates who did not
study business as undergraduates. She ticked off admissions
requirements, offered tips for writing the application essay (``use
Spellcheck'') and urged them to check on applications themselves
(``a mother drove us crazy'').
</P>
<P>
   ``Does everyone have a resume?'' she asked, and was answered
with nods. Writing one is a camp activity.
</P>
<P>
   Next stop was a meeting with Michael G. Rubin, 27, the chairman
of Global Sports Inc. in nearby King of Prussia, Pa. On the way
over, Felipe Valdez, 16, and Nadia Schwartz, 14, exchanged
reminiscences about Trunk Bay in the U.S. Virgin Islands like two
attorneys comparing vacations. But the next minute, they were
giggling about the camp's Crazy Olympics, which included an event
involving pantyhose and a tennis ball, proving they are still
teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   As on all field trips, campers adhered to a dress code fit for
cubicle life: slacks and shirts with collars for boys, skirts for
girls.
</P>
<P>
   Nadia, poised and post-feminist in a gray stretch miniskirt and
``hoodie'' (a hooded vest) and electric-blue nail polish, looked
older than her years. Until she recalled a recent lesson on futures
trading. ``I finally got it,'' she smiled, flashing braces.
</P>
<P>
   A number of campers mentioned the futures-trading course as a
high point. ``I guess it's about the only thing they don't teach in
school,'' said Nicholas J. Cirillo, the instructor and a former
floor trader at the New York Mercantile Exchange. ``They don't
teach you how to make money.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At the offices of Global Sports, the campers were ushered in to
meet Rubin, who had ``role model'' written all over him. By age 14,
he had opened his first sporting-goods store. At 22, he was dubbed
a mogul by The Wall Street Journal. Now, his company is shifting
focus to the Internet. He asked the campers what Web site they
associated with CD's.
</P>
<P>
   ``CDnow,'' they chorused.
</P>
<P>
   ``Books?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Amazon.com.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Toys?''
</P>
<P>
   Not one of the ex-children dared answer.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Oyarzun, 16, a camper from a French suburb of Geneva, asked
about Rubin's past ownership of bars, which Krinsky had mentioned.
``That was one of my big mistakes,'' Rubin said. ``A nightclub is a
very difficult business.''
</P>
<P>
   Nick was undeterred. Traveling back to camp, he told about his
dream of running a club someday. After all, what did Americans know
about serving food and drink? Nick, on his first visit to the
United States, was pleased with the camp but revolted by American
food. ``It's just junk food,'' he said. He was particularly
horrified by the sight of scrambled eggs at breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   This day's lunch was not likely to improve his opinion. Campers
brought trays of pizza and steak hoagies into a room where Krinsky
taught a lesson in etiquette, substituting for the usual lecturer,
a newspaper columnist who writes under the name Miss Demeanor. He
asked if anyone knew the proper way to dip a spoon into soup.
Felipe demonstrated. His father, Abelardo Valdez, had been chief of
protocol at the White House during the Carter Administration.
</P>
<P>
   The young people listened as Krinsky, 49, discussed the
intricacies of napkin and fork use. Nick wanted to know if
Americans actually used toothpicks in public.
</P>
<P>
   Soon the campers were showing signs of boardroom fatigue. They
were itching for the afternoon activities, when they would mix with
the general camp population. Nick had signed up for tennis.
Michael's name was on a list for a facial and a manicure.
</P>
<P>
   Krinsky has found the market for summer business instruction for
teen-agers to be steady, but not a growth business. Two other
business camps, one run by Babson College in Wellesley, Mass., and
the other by the Breakers resort in Palm Beach, Fla., failed in
recent years for lack of campers.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the National Foundation for Teaching
Entrepreneurship, a nonprofit group, operated about 15 ``Biz
Camps'' this summer for low-income youngsters, all of whom attended
on scholarships underwritten by corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Mariotti, the founder of the camps, said his mission is to
teach business skills to poor youth, because ``it's one of the best
strategies to get them out of poverty.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's painful for people if they're not competent with money
and don't understand ownership and markets,'' he said. ``The sooner
that children can learn this, the better.''
</P>
<P>
   Next summer, he hopes to revive the Babson College program with
a mix of low- and upper-income campers. ``I want a camp where kids
from the South Bronx and Watts would mix with kids from
Greenwich,'' he said. ``It's healthy for both groups.''
</P>
<P>
   Krinsky agreed, but said his camp can offer only an occasional
scholarship. He said camp is a great opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there's always the other opportunity. ``Next year,''
Nadia said, ``my parents want me to get a job.''

 &HT;    MICROSOFT TRIAL TO REACH KEY MILESTONE
 &HT;    Eds: Corrects ``Tuesday'' to ``Sept. 10'' in graf 7.
 &HT;    800&AMP;add. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories
for release Sunday, Aug. 8.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Soon after the financial markets close Tuesday,
rival attorneys from the Justice Department and Microsoft Corp.
will descend on the federal courthouse, each bearing thick legal
opinions.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides in the epic struggle recognize that U.S. District
Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson is all but certain to lay aside their
proposed verdicts in the Microsoft antitrust case and issue his
own. Nevertheless, the voluminous briefing books, with
diametrically different story lines, were being meticulously edited
late last week in a bid to sway not only the judge, but also the
media and legal scholars.
</P>
<P>
   As the Microsoft case approaches another milestone, that outside
``jury,'' which also includes financial analysts, appears largely
persuaded that Jackson will find that the company has failed to
obey the antitrust laws. At the same time, some informed observers
doubt the judge will be swayed by recent government feelers to
investment bankers on how best to break up Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   ``In forming his own conclusions, the judge will place a lot of
weight on the credibility of the courtroom witnesses,'' said Daniel
Reznek, a retired partner in the law firm of Arnold &AMP; Porter, who
has followed the case closely and who has known Jackson for many
years. ``That's what he needs to do to dampen the chances of being
reversed on appeal,'' Reznek added.
</P>
<P>
   In his comments from the bench during the non-jury trial,
Jackson often seemed favorably disposed to the searing
cross-examination of Microsoft witnesses waged by David Boies, the
lead prosecutor. ``But that predisposition doesn't mean that he'll
buy wholesale into any government-written remedy package,'' Reznek
cautioned.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's lawyers privately see the revived breakup talk as a
harassing tactic aimed at gaining bargaining leverage in renewed
settlement talks, which could follow any preliminary indication
from Jackson that the world's largest software company remains in
legal trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Such a signal could come shortly after closing oral arguments
are heard in mid-September. In the interim, the legal combatants,
in addition to filing their rival opinions, formally known as
``findings of fact,'' will also prepare rebuttal briefs, due Sept.
10.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, the prosecutors contend that it is normal
procedure, as the landmark trial moves toward a climax, for them to
explore potential remedies.
</P>
<P>
   The proscutors asked Wall Street investment bankers to estimate
Microsoft's future worth if it were broken up _ either to compete
against itself as several ``Baby Bills'' or else by spinning
Windows off from such applications as Microsoft Office.
</P>
<P>
   But the bankers were reluctant to do so, pointing out that a
company that chiefly sells intellectual property represents a
different model than the ``Baby Bells'' that were successfully spun
off from AT&AMP;T to meet antitrust issues in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been looking at possible remedies, but it's premature,''
said Justice Department spokeswoman Gina Talamona. ``The judge
hasn't even ruled on whether Microsoft is liable. We've said all
along we would talk to experts, asking for a wide variety of
options. But we haven't even made a decision on what kind of
remedies we may or may not ask for.''
</P>
<P>
   In the course of the 71-day trial, the Justice Department and 19
state attorneys general built a methodical case against the
software giant. It is based on both direct testimony from 13
prosecutorial witnesses and e-mails from Microsoft chairman Bill
Gates and his top lieutenants.
</P>
<P>
   The government contends that Microsoft broke the law by bullying
rivals in the computer industry in an effort to protect its
lucrative Windows monopoly and to dominate the market for Internet
browsing software.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's rivals dismiss the rapid changes that have occurred
in the high-tech sector since the case was filed some 15 months
ago, asserting that they have not altered Microsoft monopoly power
over the market for personal computer operating systems. It is a
monopoly, they argue, that if left unchecked would enable Microsoft
to unfairly dominate Internet commerce and squash its weaker
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the arguments likely to be advanced in the dueling
briefs, a deal that would short-circuit the trial and avoid a
lengthy appeals process remains a viable option. Earlier sporadic
settlement talks proved fruitless.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the judge accepts some limited portion of the government's
claims, a renewed settlement effort would make a good deal of
sense,'' said Michael Lacovara, a key member of Microsoft legal
defense team. ``As I see it,'' he added, ``the trial has been a
distraction (for Microsoft) and it would be good to move on _ if a
fair and sensible way could be fouons of instant-messaging
customers, it is also reflects the ongoing legal struggle between
the nation's top software maker and its leading online service.
</P>
<P>
   In the course of the trial, AOL absorbed Netscape Communications
Corp. at a cost of $10 billion. In suing Microsoft, the government
had held that the company had illegally sought to destroy
Netscape's business in order to extend its monopoly power to
Internet commerce. Its complaint cites Netscape 130 times.
</P>
<P>
   ``But market dynamics do matter,'' Lacovara contended. ``In the
course of discovery, we were able to see what the parties were
saying to each other. And those exchanges greatly bolster our
case.''

legal trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Such a signal could come shortly after closing oral arguments
are heard in mid-September. In the interim, the legal combatants,
in addition to filing their rival opinions, formally known as
``findings of fact,'' will also prepare rebuttal briefs, due Sept.
10.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, the prosecutors contend that it is normal
procedure, as the landmark trial moves toward a climax, for them to
explore potential remedies.
</P>
<P>
   The proscutors asked Wall Street investment bankers to estimate
Microsoft's future worth if it were broken up _ either to compete
against itself as several ``Baby Bills'' or else by spinning
Windows off from such applications as Microsoft Office.
</P>
<P>
   But the bankers were reluctant to do so, pointing out that a
company that chiefly sells intellectual property represents a
different model than the ``Baby Bells'' that were successfully spun
off from AT&AMP;T to meet antitrust issues in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been looking at possible remedies, but it's premature,''
said Justice Department spokeswoman Gina Talamona. ``The judge
hasn't even ruled on whether Microsoft is liable. We've said all
along we would talk to experts, asking for a wide variety of
options. But we haven't even made a decision on what kind of
remedies we may or may not ask for.''
</P>
<P>
   In the course of the 71-day trial, the Justice Department and 19
state attorneys general built a methodical case against the
software giant. It is based on both direct testimony from 13
prosecutorial witnesses and e-mails from Microsoft chairman Bill
Gates and his top lieutenants.
</P>
<P>
   The government contends that Microsoft broke the law by bullying
rivals in the computer industry in an effort to protect its
lucrative Windows monopoly and to dominate the market foe But, on
another level, the issues are also as immediate as the day's
technology headlines. Thus, as Microsoft attempts to loosen America
Online Inc.'s grip on millions of instant-messaging customers, it
is also reflects the ongoing legal struggle between the nation's
top software maker and its leading online service.
</P>
<P>
   In the course of the trial, AOL absorbed Netscape Communications
Corp. at a cost of $10 billion. In suing Microsoft, the government
had held that the company had illegally sought to destroy
Netscape's business in order to extend its monopoly power to
Internet commerce. Its complaint cites Netscape 130 times.
</P>
<P>
   ``But market dynamics do matter,'' Lacovara contended. ``In the
course of discovery, we were able to see what the parties were
saying to each other. And those exchanges greatly bolster our
case.''

 SAN FRANCISCO: Bay area.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The acquisition, which was for cash, includes ``SF Gate,'' the
Bay Area's No. 1 Web side for online news, information and
entertainment, according to the announcement by Frank A. Bennack
Jr., president and chief executive officer of The Hearst
Corporation, and John B. Sias, chairman and chief executive officer
of The Chronicle Publishing Co.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst also announced that it is seeking a buyer for the San
Francisco Examiner, a six-day afternoon newspaper owned by Hearst.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1965, the Examiner and the Chronicle have been printed and
distributed under a joint operating agreement.
</P>
<P>
   If a qualified buyer is not found, Hearst said it would combine
the Examiner with the morning Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement noted that the San Francisco JOA is the 12th of
these arrangements to be terminated in the last 15 years.
Terminations of JOAs have occurred in cities such as Knoxville,
Nashville, Columbus, Pittsburgh, Miami, St. Louis and, earlier this
year, Chattanooga, Tenn. The parties noted that they have notified
the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice of these
planned transactions, and will make the pre-merger filings required
by federal law.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst said the purchase of the San Francisco Chronicle and ``SF
Gate'' was both an ``affirmation of its belief in the City of San
Francisco and a continuing opportunity to be of service to the Bay
Area community.''

   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Hearst Corporation announced Friday that it
has agreed to buy the San Francisco Chronicle, a morning newspaper
published in the San Francisco Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition, which was for cash, includes ``SF Gate,'' the
Bay Area's No. 1 Web side for on-line news, information and
entertainment, according to the announcement by Frank A. Bennack
Jr., president and chief executive officer of The Hearst

</P>
<P>
   Hearst also announced that it is seeking a buyer for the San
Francisco Examiner, the six-day afternoon newspaper owned by
Hearst.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1965, the Examiner and the Chronicle have been printed and
distributed under a joint operating agreement (JOA).
</P>
<P>
   If a qualified buyer is not found, Hearst said it would combine
the Examiner with the morning Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement noted that the San Francisco JOA is the 12th of

Terminations of JOAs have occurred in cities such as Knoxville and

Bay-Area community.''
</P>
<P>
   Following the transaction, Hearst said, all of the San Francisco
Chronicle newspaper employees and all employees of the San
Francisco Newspaper Agency will be offered continued employment. If
the Examiner is combined with the Chronicle, Hearst will also offer
continued employment to all of the employees of the Examiner. If
the Examiner is sold, any employees not offered employment by the
buyer will be offered continued employment by Hearst at the
Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco Chronicle, with a circulation of 482,268
daily, is the largest newspaper in northern California and the
second largest on the West Coast. It was founded in 1865 by Charles
and Michael deYoung and has been owned and operated over the
succeeding 134 years by their heirs.
</P>
<P>
   William Randolph Hearst founded what is today The Hearst
Corporation in 1887 when he assumed control of the San Francisco
Examiner. For the last 112 years, the Examiner has been
continuously published by Hearst. It has a daily circulation of
114,776. Hearst and the Chronicle jointly produce and distribute
the San Francisco Sunday Examiner &AMP; Chronicle, which has a
circulation of 605,356.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the joint operating agreement, since 1965
Hearst and the Chronicle have jointly owned all of the assets used
to produce and distribute the newspapers. In addition, the parties
created the San Francisco Newspaper Agency to act as agent on
behalf of both companies and to perform all business functions of
the newspapers, including circulation, advertising sales, printing,
distribution and personnel. The news and editorial departments of
both newspapers have remained entirely separate and have been
independently operated.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco Bay Area is one of the most competitive media
markets in the United States. The 11-county San Francisco region
contains 18 daily newspapers and 15 Sunday newspapers. In addition
to newspapers, the media-rich Bay Area has 20 television stations

NO SPEECH BY FONDA? THAT'S GOOD NEWS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By J.R. LABBE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Attorney Ronald Bliss' office at Fulbright &AMP; Jaworski is a long
way from the Viet Cong prison camps where he spent almost seven
years of his life. But utter the name ``Jane Fonda,'' and the trip
down a very rugged memory lane only takes a second.
</P>
<P>
   ``She prolonged that war, according to (North Vietnamese)
General Vo Nguyen Giap,'' the Houston attorney said this week in a
telephone interview. ``While our boys were dying in the fields and
being shot out of the skies, she helped convince the American
people that we couldn't win and convinced the North Vietnamese that
they could.''
</P>
<P>
   It's no surprise, then, that the former Air Force captain was
elated by the news that the
actress-turned-self-proclaimed-youth-advocate has canceled her
scheduled appearance next week at the American Bar Association's
annual convention in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ABA officials released a brief statement last week saying that
because of a scheduling conflict, Fonda would not be speaking
Tuesday at the Silver Gavel Awards luncheon. In her place will be
CNN anchor Judy Woodruff.
</P>
<P>
   Bliss, a member of the ABA who practices intellectual properties
law, doesn't buy the explanation.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Texas, we say that just doesn't pass the smell test,'' he
said. ``There's always a scheduling conflict in my mind if she's
going to be on the agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Bliss has good reason to want to avoid contact with the actress
who took her vocal protests of the Vietnam War on the road in 1972
_ the road right to Hanoi. As a 23-year-old fighter pilot, he was
shot down over Vietnam on Sept. 4, 1966, while at the stick of a
single-engine, single-seat F-105 Thunderchief.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was affectionately called the Thud because that's the sound
it made when it hit the ground,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bliss was first held at the infamous Hanoi Hilton, the old
French prison downtown, where the Viet Cong began their
``treatment'' of prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a special group of seven cells called Heartbreak
Hotel,'' Bliss recalled. ``Permanent leg irons, hooks in the
ceiling, all the bells and whistles. They knew how to do it
right.''
</P>
<P>
   Eight or 10 days later, Bliss said, he was thrown into a cell
with another officer, a naval aviator, and then both were moved to
a camp called The Zoo on the outskirts of the city. He wasn't
released until March 4, 1973 _ 18 days before his 30th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason I got a roommate so soon was because the Viet Cong
had left this guy in one of their little rope tricks for too long,
and he had lost the use of his arms for about six months,'' Bliss
said. ``They needed me to take care of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Bliss said these extra duties were the cloud with a silver
lining. ``He was a heck of a guy, and it was an honor to know
him.''
</P>
<P>
   In a matter-of-fact way, Bliss recounted hearing the propaganda
tapes that Fonda made for the North Vietnamese.
</P>
<P>
   ``They played her tape for us for quite a while. Some people in
the camp were squeezed to meet with her _ put under physical and
mental duress,'' Bliss said.
</P>
<P>
   Left unspoken by Bliss, but filled in by Amarillo lawyer Charles
White, who organized a write-in campaign to the ABA against Fonda's
convention appearance, was the fact that Bliss was one of the
prisoners ``squeezed'' by the North Vietnamese for resisting their
demands to see her.
</P>
<P>
   White, who was an Army first lieutenant, spent 1968 between the
DMZ and Da Nang, where his field artillery unit was attached to the
3rd Marine Division.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came back unscathed,'' was all that the civil trial lawyer
wanted to say about his year in-country.
</P>
<P>
   White was largely responsible for the flak that the ABA received
from angry veterans shortly after its June announcement of Fonda's
appearance. According to news reports in the ``New York Post'' and
the ``Atlanta Journal and Constitution,'' the ABA downplayed any
part that protest letters may have played in Fonda's cancellation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did have a few people who criticized her, but that is not
uncommon,'' ABA spokeswoman Nancy Slonim told the ``Post.''
</P>
<P>
   White would like to argue Slonim's definition of ``few.'' As a
civil trial lawyer, he's well equipped to do so. And he has the
scores of e-mails copied to him by other Vietnam veterans who
participated in the write-in campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the true reason for the change in speakers, Bliss
is thankful for White's efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charles, God bless you,'' Bliss wrote to White after hearing
the news. ``I'll be happy to buy you dinner anytime you can get to
Houston. It is a quiet, warm realization that people still
appreciate right and wrong!''
</P>
<P>
   Bliss acknowledges that there are people in this country who
want to put Fonda's actions in the past. But he can't _ not ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say it's a lot of water under the bridge. We're a
forgiving country; shouldn't we forgive her? For someone who really
wants to ask that, I say go visit the Gold Star mothers, the
uncles, the brothers who lost loved ones. Go see the children who
never knew their fathers. Go to the VA hospitals and look at those
men missing parts of their faces, parts of their bodies, the
mentally distraught. Then come back and ask that question.''

REFORMER PAT AND SEN. SPRINGER?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Random comments on people in the news:
</P>
<P>
   HILLARY CLINTON: OK. Why did the first lady talk about her
beloved husband being ``scarred by abuse'' in the context of his
chronic philandering if she wasn't trying to palm off Bill
Clinton's allegedly troubled childhood as an excuse for his
revolting personal behavior as an adult?
</P>
<P>
   Hillary made the comments in a magazine interview and then
reacted to the ensuing uproar by insisting that her remarks were
not intended to let hubby off the hook. The president seconded her
... uh ... clarification.
</P>
<P>
   So. What are we supposed to believe? As is always the case with
this pair of dissembling manipulators, we can believe whatever we
want to. If they ever tell the truth about anything, it's because
they were caught off guard and couldn't think of a lie to tell.
</P>
<P>
   BILL CLINTON: The president says that he plans to veto the
Republican tax cut because it's fiscally irresponsible. Well,
Clinton might have his reasons for opposing the tax cut _ maybe
even a good one or two _ but the American people can count on this:
Whatever reason he states in public is not the real reason.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton is constitutionally incapable of telling the truth
_ even when the truth makes a better story than a lie. On this
particular issue, of course, the lie makes a better story because
the truth is that Clinton wants to keep all that tax money flowing
into government coffers so that he can do what liberal Democrats
always do with money that flows into government coffers: spend it.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton doesn't care about paying off the national debt. He
doesn't care about saving Social Security and Medicare. He doesn't
care about fiscal responsibility. Most of all, he doesn't care
about all those just plain taxpayers who keep forking over their
hard-earned bucks to pay for an endless parade of government
programs that most Americans don't want or need.
</P>
<P>
   PAT BUCHANAN: Rumors persist that the
columnist/commentator-turned-perennial presidential candidate will
quit the Republican Party and sign on with the Reform Party.
Buchanan denies the rumors, but it makes sense that he might be
tired of waging no-hope campaigns for the Republican presidential
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The Reform Party, disenchanted with founder Ross Perot and
apparently unable to lure wrestler-turned-politician Jesse Ventura
into the presidential race, might be thrilled to hook up with a
political karate expert such as Buchanan. Besides, Buchanan really
parted ways with the Republicans when he helped torpedo the GOP's
White House hopes in 1992 and 1996 by conducting disruptive primary
campaigns against eventual nominees George Bush and Bob Dole.
</P>
<P>
   Why not make it official? Maybe Buchanan could talk Ventura into
being his running mate.
</P>
<P>
   JERRY SPRINGER: The much-maligned TV talk-show host is said to
be considering a run for the U.S. Senate from Ohio, where he once
served as mayor of Cincinnati. This does not sit well with
occupants of the world's greatest deliberative body _ or at least
not with Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   According to news reports, Daschle considers Springer a ``joke''
and wants no part of him _ even though Springer's election would
add a Democratic seat to Daschle's Senate minority.
</P>
<P>
   Daschle is entitled to his opinion, needless to say. But why
wouldn't he welcome a joke like Springer to a place that's
populated by more clowns per capita than a traveling circus?
</P>
<P>
   MARK McGWIRE: The St. Louis Cardinals' slugger took lots of heat
last season for using the dietary supplement androstenedione _ even
though the substance is perfectly legal in major-league baseball.
Some dolts in the media went so far to suggest that the supplement
was the reason that McGwire hit 70 home runs _ even though there's
not a shred of evidence to support such a theory.
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, McGwire has stopped using androstenedione because
he didn't want to be perceived as encouraging kids to use it. Once
again, Big Mac proves that he's not just a great ballplayer _ he's
a great role model.

U.S. DRUG CZAR APPLAUDS MCGWIRE'S DECISION TO DROP ANDRO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A day after joining the elite 500-home-run club,
Mark McGwire won the praise of White House drug policy director
Barry McCaffrey Friday for saying no to the dietary supplement
androstenedione.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message Mark McGwire sends to our young people by walking
away from this substance is a powerful one,'' McCaffrey said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. McGwire's home-run exploits have made him a hero to
thousands of young people across the nation ... However, doctors
and scientists have raised serious issues concerning the safety of
androstenedione use,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire, who is only the 16th player to reach the 500-homer
mark, disclosed late Wednesday that he had stopped using the
controversial supplement, also known as andro, because he was
worried about the possible influence that his continued use of it
could have on children.
</P>
<P>
   But he also said he still did not believe there was anything
wrong with the legal supplement and that adults should be allowed
to use it.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire acknowledged taking andro last summer. Later the St.
Louis Cardinals' first baseman set a major-league record of 70 home
runs in one season. On Thursday night, before hitting career homers
No. 500 and 501, he was asked about his Wednesday comments and said
he has not taken the supplement for the last four months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel I need to prove anything, but this (message) is
for young children who think they need it,'' he said. McGwire
didn't explain why he waited four months to say he had dropped
andro.
</P>
<P>
   Since it became known that McGwire was using it, sales of the
supplement surged from $10 million to more than $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   Andro is sold legally over the counter and on the Internet in
the United States even though some medical experts say it is
essentially an anabolic steroid. The supplement is banned by the
National Football League, the National Collegiate Athletic
Association and the International Olympic Committee because
organization officials say it enhances one's performance and could
be a potentially harmful drug. But baseball authorities have not
banned it and have refused to condone or condemn it publicly.
</P>
<P>
   In his statement, McCaffrey said his office has asked the
federal Drug Enforcement Agency to test andro to determine if it
has steroid characteristics.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us who care about the vitality and beauty of sport need
to take seriously the threat of drug use and doping to the
legitimacy of athletic competition,'' McCaffrey said.

IT'S A DRAGONFLY SEASON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By VICKI CROKE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   They are the hot-dogging ace pilots of the bug world. Often
decked out in iridescent colors of green and blue and red, they are
agile aerialists. In fact, if Igor Sikorsky and Tinker Bell had had
a baby, it would have been a dragonfly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Extraordinary powers of flight and sight, unequaled among
animals,'' boasts Philip S. Corbet in the definitive and scholarly
``Dragonflies: Behavior and Ecology of Odonata'' (Cornell
University Press).
</P>
<P>
   Dragonflies are everywhere this summer, with various species
emerging in waves throughout the season into fall.
</P>
<P>
   In the commercial arena, they are embroidered on pillow cases
and pajamas. They festoon dresses and dangle as earrings.
</P>
<P>
   In the natural world, the insects with four wings and six legs
ply their trade mostly near ponds and moist meadows, zigzagging
around us as we walk or garden. They capture our imaginations as
deftly as they do flying pests, including mosquitoes, gnats, and
black flies.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Carpenter, of the Nature Conservancy in Rhode Island,
and author of ``Dragonflies of Cape Cod'' (now out of print) has
long been intrigued by these creatures. ``They are top predators
and just spectacular to observe,'' she explains by phone. ``Also,
there are still so many mysteries left in insect studies.''
</P>
<P>
   The lifestyles of dragonflies turn out to be as intriguing as
their looks.
</P>
<P>
   They start out as ``nymphs'' _ water-dwelling larvae that are as
lethal in babyhood as they will be as adults. According to the
``Insects'' volume of the Peterson Field Guides (Houghton Mifflin),
dragonfly nymphs snag prey with ``peculiarly modified labium,'' a
prehensile organ that juts out at lightning speed.
</P>
<P>
   This nymph stage can last for years in some species. But
eventually, the skin splits and the dragonfly appears. After
casting off the exuvia, and a few hours of recovering from the
exhausting process of emergence, the dragonfly is ready for its
maiden flight to hunt and mate.
</P>
<P>
   In the spring, Carpenter says, when so many leave their nymph
days behind, ``they emerge explosively from the water,'' ready to
launch into life.
</P>
<P>
   These great flyers do (itals)everything(unitals) while airborne.
They can grab and gobble a mosquito in flight. And many also wing
it when it comes to sex. They may fly in tandem, and then,
employing something like a space-age docking system, they lock into
place with a series of grooves and notches. This act is sometimes
accomplished with ``an audible click,'' according to field reports.
</P>
<P>
   Even stranger is the fact that the parts that need to line up
force these creatures into strange contortions. During this
Flying-Wallendas-meet-Dr.-Ruth maneuver, the male's abdomen can
become ``dented.''
</P>
<P>
   Myth has it that dragonflies sew up the lips and ears of
unsuspecting humans, and interestingly, some members of the family
are in fact called darners. And even though they don't sting, they
may bite when handled, according to the Peterson guide.
</P>
<P>
   But Carpenter says it is perfectly fine to handle them. You can
catch them with a net, she says, without fear of hurting them, if
you're careful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dragonflies are really sturdy _ they've been around for 250
million years,'' she says. ``And insects' skeletons are on the
outside. You can net them and be able to look them right in the eye
and then release them.''
</P>
<P>
   There are 190 species of dragonfly in New England. A couple of
species to look out for now, Carpenter advises, would be the green
darner (at 3 inches long, Carpenter says, they will ``jump out and
grab you'') and the lady skimmer, a large bluish-black active
specimen.

   CONGRESS-RECESS (Washington) _ With its tax cut behind it,
Congress left for its August recess today setting the stage for a
high stakes autumn confrontation with President Clinton over what
should be the nation's fiscal policies in an era of budget
surpluses. That battle is the most far-reaching of many
ideologically charged policy disputes to come in the fall, also
setting the stage for a high stakes election battle. Other issues
on the agenda for the fall are health care, gun control, campaign
finance reform and the question now is whether there will be a

   MCDOWELL-ANTIQUES (New York) _ The movie star, Malcolm McDowell,
recently spent an afternoon indulging his other passions: antique
watches, painted Shaker furniture and 19th-century flywheel toys.
McDowell, 56, collects with the same wild-eyed intensity that makes
him such a distinctive, often disturbing actor. By Rick Marin.

   TEEN-BUSINESS-CAMP (New York) _ While other teen-agers stuffed
Frisbees and flippers into duffel bags last month, Michael Granat
packed long pants and collared shirts for a camp where things don't
get much looser than a casual Friday. Michael, 14, of New City,
N.Y., was headed for his second summer of business camp, where
there are treks to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, hikes
through a Ferrari dealership and lessons on tying knots on
acquisition targets. At mealtime, there is instruction in business
etiquette. By Marcia Biederman. Photo.
</P>
<P>
   MONEY-CLIPS (New York) _ Recently, I've noticed more and more
men doing away with the conventional wallet, replacing it with a
money clip and a slim-line credit-card case. A few months back, I
spotted my friend Adam Wiener, an executive producer at CBS New
Media, pulling out a brown leather credit-card holder, made by
Fossil, with a brass clip attached to the front. ``My old wallet
just took up too much space,'' he said. By Douglas Century.
</P>
<P>
   MUSTACHE-MODEL (New York) _ The burning question at last month's
menswear shows was not about the masculine merits of clamdiggers or
the demise of the backpack in favor of an over-the-shoulder bag
with a strap as wide as a Miss Universe sash. The query on
everyone's lips was, ``Who's the guy with the mustache?'' The man
causing the flurry of interest in an otherwise uneventful three
days of shows in New York for Spring 2000 was Eugene Hutz, a model
who also is a member of a Ukrainian punk rock band called Gogol
Bordello. Hutz, 25, appeared in only two fashion shows _ for the
designers Marc Jacobs and Nigel Curtiss _ but he garnered the
lion's share of notice. By Frank DeCaro. Photo.
</P>
<P>
   DESIGNER-TAILORS (New York) _ Taking a cue from professional
clothes hangers and social swans like Blaine Trump, who have
quietly frequented tailors for years, many insist that a $500
custom suit or dress made in the style of a Gucci or a Dior is just
as chic and often more deftly constructed than the $2,000 original.
(To avoid any legal questions about copying the designs of others,
the tailors say they make minor modifications in the fabric, shape
and details.) But savings isn't the major draw for tailoring's
newest devotees. Young professionals who can well afford
high-fashion beading or Savile Row draping forgo such luxuries for
the thrill of outfoxing the system and playing designer themselves.

   ``It's something else to do, away from the damn movies,''
Malcolm McDowell said, throwing himself into an afternoon of
indulging his other passions: antique watches, painted Shaker
furniture and 19th-century flywheel toys. ``And it's a lot of
fun.''
</P>
<P>
   McDowell, 56, collects with the same wild-eyed intensity that
makes him such a distinctive, often disturbing actor. In New York
last week to promote his latest movie, ``My Life So Far,'' McDowell
invited his dealer along for the excursion. Steven Weiss, of Gemini
Antiques, has supplied much of the early Americana that fills
McDowell's home _ a barn outside Santa Barbara, Calif., where he
lives with his third wife, Kelley.
</P>
<P>
   As the car inched across the Upper East Side, Weiss made the
mistake of likening McDowell's new film, a tony period piece, to a
Merchant Ivory production.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't know what he's talking about!'' an appalled
McDowell bellowed from the back seat. ``I associate Merchant Ivory
with sentimental stuff.'' Not exactly McDowell's genre.
</P>
<P>
   First stop, Evergreen Antiques, on Third Avenue at 72nd Street.
McDowell strode into the shop with the cocky, bowlegged gait of the
psychotic thug he played in ``A Clockwork Orange'' and started
poking around, without breaking anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wow!'' he said, spotting an 18th-century cabinet priced at
$38,000. It passed the McDowell test by looking great from three
feet, 15 feet and 45 feet away. ``It should have impact from all
those distances.'' The same might be said of McDowell, whose
twisted verve was now being benignly channeled into a collector's
boyish enthusiasm. He settled on two tramp-art boxes ($65 and $85)
before bidding the politely starstruck owners farewell.
</P>
<P>
   Time for Time Will Tell, a small vintage-watch store on Madison
Avenue at 76th Street. The owner was out. McDowell greeted the
saleswoman behind the counter with ``What have you got, darling?''
and zeroed in on a 1927 Patek Philippe: 18-karat gold, porcelain
dial with italicized Roman numerals, $7,200. Peering through a
jeweler's loupe, he marveled, ``The finest movement ever made!''
Then, ``This isn't a reconditioned dial or anything, is it?'' His
mercurial actor's face shifted to momentary disgust at the thought
that anyone might have tampered with such an exquisite timepiece.
</P>
<P>
   Throwing around chronophile lingo like ``bubbleback'' and
``California dial,'' he picked up a Rolex Prince from the '30s.
``You know who used to collect these?'' he asked. ``You couldn't
get one while he was alive. Andy Warhol. He had 150 Princes!''
</P>
<P>
   McDowell's watch collection is more modest. About 60, of
different makes, he said. Today, he wore a 1916 Longines, its clear
white face as large as a pocket watch. Telling the saleswoman he
would call the owner to wrangle for a better price on the Patek, he
made his exit from the little shop, sucking much of the air out
with him.
</P>
<P>
   In the back seat again, he stressed that there is a limit to
what he can spend on such trinkets: ``I'm not a millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   At Weiss' apartment cum showroom on West End Avenue, McDowell
pressed this point on his dealer, who was showing off two
portraits, of a little boy and girl, by Joseph Whiting Stock, in
the American-primitive style. Weiss valued the pair, painted circa
1845, at $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're dreaming!'' McDowell said. He squinted at the better of
the two pictures, the girl. ``What are you asking for it?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, 30,000,'' Weiss said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not to me, darling. What'll you sell it to me for?''
</P>
<P>
   They moved on. After an hour's haggling and an impromptu
performance from a gangster film he had just finished shooting,
McDowell bought a wooden milliner's head for $850. On the way out,
he took off his 1916 Longines and gave it to Weiss.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's for you,'' he said. ``You've always wanted a good
watch.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Mark Heithoff decided to abandon his signature
orange trousers and velour Korean flight jacket for something a
little more subtle, he ventured into Seize sur Vingt, a custom
clothier to the downtown set, on Elizabeth Street.
</P>
<P>
   James Jurney, the store's denim-clad tailor and part owner,
fitted Heithoff for a dapper but casual cotton shirt that perfectly
suited his tastes. ``I'm tired of being a billboard for somebody
else's style,'' said Heithoff, who wanted a businesslike but hip
alternative to the ``stuffed shirt looks'' he usually finds on the
racks.
</P>
<P>
   Farther uptown, about a three-minute walk from Bloomingdale's,
Joanne Weill stood rail-backed under the chandelier at Eva
Devecsery's custom atelier, careful not to dislodge the pins
securing the seam of her green velvet gown.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband picked out the fabric in Paris,'' she murmured.
``Yes,'' chimed in Mrs. Devecsery, a diminutive Hungarian-born
woman with a tape measure slung around her neck like a rope of
pearls. ``It's his contribution to the design.''
</P>
<P>
   Heitfhoff, 30, a portrait photographer, and Mrs. Weill, the
impeccably coiffed 50-ish wife of the financier Sanford I. Weill,
have joined the expanding circle of New Yorkers deserting designer
labels now and then for the personalized services of a custom
tailor or dressmaker. Working in downtown lofts with peeling walls
and muslin-curtained fitting rooms or in Old World-style salons
appointed with pretend Louis furnishings, such establishments have
lately become magnets to shrewd bargain hunters.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a cue from professional clothes hangers and social swans
like Blaine Trump, who have quietly frequented tailors for years,
many insist that a $500 custom suit or dress made in the style of a
Gucci or a Dior is just as chic and often more deftly constructed
than the $2,000 original. (To avoid any legal questions about
copying the designs of others, the tailors say they make minor
modifications in the fabric, shape and details.)
</P>
<P>
   But savings isn't the major draw for tailoring's newest
devotees. Young professionals who can well afford high-fashion
beading or Savile Row draping forgo such luxuries for the thrill of
outfoxing the system and playing designer themselves. Visiting a
tailor is the ``perfect pursuit for the creatively challenged,''
said Lisa Gabor, 35, an editor working on a start-up magazine for
Time Inc. ``They're the kinds of people who know what they want but
would sew their fingers together if they went near a needle and
thread.'' Heithoff likens the process to a think-tank exchange in
which the client retains creative control _ the sartorial
equivalent of a director's cut.
</P>
<P>
   One need not be style-struck to take part, but it helps. Just
ask Ms. Gabor, whose closet teems with Armani and Gucci look-alikes
whipped up by Joseph Ting of Dynasty Custom Tailor in midtown
Manhattan. Or Michael A. Schub, a New York lawyer, who said, ``At a
tailor you can indulge your fantasy and create any sort of
variation on a style that comes to mind.'' He recently persuaded
Ned Mateosian of Ned on lower Fifth Avenue to fit him for a
double-breasted suit with a notch collar, creating a stylistic
hybrid that, Schub said, ``you don't easily find off the peg.'' Or
check with Sharon Scott, who works in a New York accounting firm.
Ms. Scott had her heart set on a Versace dress to wear to a recent
gala, persuading Joan Weston, her dressmaker in the Bronx, to run
up a line-for-line copy. The price of her new blue and white
one-shoulder silk evening dress: $350, a trifle compared with the
$5,000-plus for the made-in-Milan original.
</P>
<P>
   Until the advent of designer ready-to-wear in the late 1960's,
dressmakers' salons were mainly the province of fashionable matrons
ordering copies of the Paris haute couture. But that has changed.
``There is clearly an element of remarkably young, very successful
people going to tailors without fail,'' said Suzanne Kilgore, the
executive director of the 300-member Custom Tailors and Designers
Association in Washington. Her observations are anecdotal, since
there is no official client profile or tally of American tailors,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Running mostly small, independent businesses, tailors generally
drum up trade through word of mouth _ no easy feat, given that
clients tend to guard their clothiers' identities jealously.
Marjorie Gubelmann, 30, a private venture capitalist, said she is
thrilled that her dressmaker shares her taste for vintage Balmain
and dresses photographed on contemporary royalty, which run her
$1,500 to $3,000 _ a fraction of the cost of a Paris original.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I can't tell you his name,'' she said. ``If he became
commercial, he'd be too busy, and probably too expensive. And I
would no longer have the best little secret in New York.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Others _ including more than a few fashion stylists and
socialites _ have another secret they'd prefer not get out: they
buy garments off the rack, engage a tailor to knock them off, then
return the originals to the stores. They are content to reproduce
the current runway hits. More daring customers may invent a look
outright, their creativity hemmed in only by the size of their
wallets and their imagination.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of our clients _ he never carries a briefcase _ asked to
have 50 secret pockets stitched inside the lining of his suit
coat,'' said Luna Song, Dynasty's design adviser. Few requests are
too esoteric or challenging for Ms. Song, who adapts or interprets
even the most eccentric ideas with a little judicious tweaking.
``One lady asked us for a wedding dress modeled on a crinoline gown
that that she'd seen in `Gone with the Wind,''' she recalled. ``But
we cut down the skirt so the client could actually move in it.''
</P>
<P>
   When clients come in clutching ``swipe'' _ magazine tear sheets
or film stills they want copied _ she is encouraging, sometimes
going so far as to send them to museums, libraries or movies for
inspiration. ``Designers do it all the time,'' said Ms. Song, whose
workroom runs up samples for J.Crew and Gene Meyer, a men's wear
specialist. ``Why shouldn't ordinary people?''
</P>
<P>
   On his first visit to Ned, where a custom jacket with a
hand-stitched canvas runs about $750, Frank Perich implored the
tailor to interpret one of his long-cherished fantasies. ``I asked
for a three-piece version of the black suit Cary Grant wore in
`North by Northwest,''' said Perich, an actor who appears in
``Summer of Sam.'' Two fittings later, Perich was so happy with his
purchase that he proceeded to order a ringer for Grant's trademark
black topcoat, followed by duplicates of his blue blazer and gray
flannels. Perich finds the process addictive. ``I don't smoke, I
don't drink, I don't buy sex,'' he said, laughing darkly. ``This is
my obsession.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it's impatience that sends people to a custom
workroom. ``I do a lot of weddings,'' said Bill Bull, whose
clients, mostly fashion insiders, have access to pri-cey bridal and
evening-wear salons but lack the forbearance to put up with lengthy
fittings or delayed deliveries. ``They want something simple, but
they don't want to wait nine months for a Vera Wang,'' Bull said.
</P>
<P>
   More commonly, clients ask him to duplicate a favorite pair of
Daryl K trousers or Audrey Hepburn's little black dress from
``Breakfast at Tiffany's.'' And then there are people who ask for
the moon. He declines to identify the well-known model who showed
him a badly battered Victorian lace dress, begging, ``Make me be
able to wear this.'' Part couturier, part textile conservationist,
Bull obliged, reconstructing the flea market frock, tier by tier
and bead by bead, and supplying an underskirt in the bargain. At
$1,200, such services are beyond most people's reach, but to his
client, he maintained, they are worth every penny. ``Her closet is
full of Pradas,'' he said with a shrug, ``but she wants to wear
vintage lace.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people need look no farther than their closets for
salvageable relics. Elaine Hershcopf, the wife of a Manhattan real
estate lawyer and a confessed couture pack rat, hangs onto the
Chanel suits and Dior evening dresses she bought in Europe in the
1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have very beautiful, expensive things I can't discard,'' she
said, ``so sometimes I'll change a detail or raise the shoulders.''
The latter, a labor-intensive procedure, may run her $100. ``But it
pays,'' she said. ``When I wear my old couture dresses I get more
compliments than when they were brand-new.''
</P>
<P>
   If Mrs. Hershcopf's best ideas start with an old dress, Ms.
Gabor's frequently originate with a piece of fabric. Not long ago
she traveled to Bangkok, carrying along her tailor's yardage
requirements for a shirt. She returned with a length of fuchsia
silk, which Ting promptly transformed into a replica of that
season's rage, a close-fitting long-collar Gucci top. The price:
About $160, fabric not included. The fit: Perfect. ``I might have
bought that shirt off the rack,'' Ms. Gabor acknowledged. ``But
let's face it, some of us aren't born with the contours to wear
whatever happens to be going on this season.''
</P>
<P>
   The occasional extreme request doesn't faze Ned Mateosian, whose
clients include the basketball star Charles Oakley, for whom he
constructed a chrome yellow suit, one of about 100 similar styles
he cut for Oakley in every hue of the spectrum. ``He likes bright
colors,'' Mateosian said simply.
</P>
<P>
   Some tailors, however, insist on saving clients from themselves.
When a buxom celebrity asks for a dress better suited to Gwyneth
Paltrow's lithe frame, ``my job is to talk her out of it,'' Ms.
Song said. The same for the recalcitrant 12-year-old dragged into
the shop by her exasperated mom. ``The girl wants a tube top,''
said Ms. Song, who is quick to suggest a more demure alternative.
Why, she wondered, does she have to look like a Spice Girl?
</P>
<P>
   Most tailors defuse such potentially explosive encounters with a
bluntness tempered by infinite tact. ``Your shoulders slope,''
Jurney of Seize sur Vingt told Heithoff, but seeing his client's
look of alarm, was quick to put in, ``Of course, that's common with
people who work out.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gabor reported that visits to Ting are usually balm for the
ego. ``You know the best thing about Joseph?'' she said. ``When you
walk in, he always asks, `Have you lost weight?'''

 &HT;    Strong NEA a key to future, critic says
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, August 8.
 &HT;    By Dan Hulbert
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even a demanding observer of the American theater _ Robert
Brustein, critic of The New Republic magazine and artistic director
of American Repertory Theatre in Cambridge, Mass. _ has hope for
the art form's future.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a sea change,'' he says. ``Plays are making a comeback
on Broadway. I don't see a diminishment of writing talent. David
Mamet is in his prime. We have Paula Vogel, Anna Deavere Smith,
Suzanne Lori-Parks, Tony Kushner.''
</P>
<P>
   Top playwrights also include August Wilson, David Henry Hwang,
John Guare, Jon Robin Baitz, Wendy Wasserstein, Richard Greenberg.
Few are prolific, yet they can't be expected to spend all their
time on $10,000 play commissions when television and movies offer
up to $1 million for scripts.
</P>
<P>
   The key to making their challenging plays economically viable,
Brustein says, is support beyond the box office.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must beef up the National Endowment for the Arts,'' he
declares, ``and return to making grants for excellence instead of
sociology. Without public funds, theaters are forced toward
commercial work or pleasing the tastes of private benefactors. The
deficit then becomes artistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a revolution in arts education,'' the critic-director
added, ``because children are taught that art is just
self-expression and are not being exposed to the best that's been
created.''
</P>
<P>
   If the language-centered playwright is uncertain of his
audiences, the image-centered theater artist will be in sync with
future tastes. ``The Who's Tommy'' (1993), a triumph in elegant,
computerized slide projections, appealed to graying baby boomers
and teenagers. The technological savvy and deconstructed language
of avant-garde auteurs _ Robert Wilson, Peter Sellars, Elizabeth
LeCompte and their younger followers _ speak the visual language of
a generation raised on MTV.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet as tool for ticket sales and theatrical information
is tapping new audiences.
</P>
<P>
   But there is justifiable worry over ``corporatization'' on
Broadway and on the road. Replacing the colorful, David
Merrick-style independent producers of yore are diversified
entertainment giants and theater owners such as Disney (the
forthcoming ``Hunchback of Notre Dame''); SFX, owner of Pace
Theatrical Group (the forthcoming ``Seussical''); and the
financially troubled Livent (``Ragtime''). Disney's ``Beauty and
the Beast'' and Pace's ``Jekyll &AMP; Hyde'' show the sterile, plastic
quality of corporate products.
</P>
<P>
   ``With costs running from $8 million to $10 million for musicals
_ and some of us believe `Lion King' cost twice that _ the smaller
player has trouble,'' said Miles Wilkins, chairman of Pace, whose
many national tour packages include the Atlanta Broadway Series.
``The advantage of (corporate producers) is having resources to
meet rising expectations of the public, to keep projects in lengthy
development.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was talk of the `death of the mega-musical,''' Wilkins
added, ``but I don't buy it. Folks want it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, theater's best hope may be an intangible, timeless
factor that transcends economics or technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only times theater has died, civilization died with it,''
says Zelda Fichandler, who ran the Arena Stage of Washington for 40
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who's seen `Iceman Cometh' (on Broadway with Kevin
Spacey) knows there's nothing like being drenched in the same
emotions that characters are feeling in the instant. Theater won't
die. We all yearn to breathe the same air as the person telling the
story.''

   UNDATED: and the Seattle Repertory Theatre.
</P>
<P>
   The `marriage' crumbles
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, as people moved to the suburbs and fell in love with
their TVs in the 1960s and '70s, serious plays were increasingly
shunned on Broadway, unless _ like Edward Albee's ``Who's Afraid of
Virginia Woolf?,'' a ferocious little cocktail hour gone wrong _
they could offer titillation. Only Neil Simon in his early sitcom
phase thrived as a nonmusical playwright.
</P>
<P>
   Off- and off-off Broadway were the creative caldrons from the
late '60s through the late '70s. The Negro Ensemble Company
flourished under Douglas Turner Ward; playwrights Amiri Baraka and
James Baldwin distilled black rage into cool eloquence. Charles
Ludlam raised gay camp to literate art in his Ridiculous Theatrical
Company. The Living Theater amazed (and annoyed) patrons with such
demands as ``Give me all your money!'' Sam Shepard waited tables at
the Village Gate and captured the heady, hallucinogenic moment in
the Beat spirit of Jack Kerouac, usually _ but not always _ waiting
for the drugs to wear off before writing. When a boyish Sam
Waterston, in 1967's ``La Turista,'' ran through the wall of the
set and left a body-shaped hole, a new genius left his mark.
Shepard was blasting through the old walls of the American theater.
</P>
<P>
   Until the mid-'80s and his second, movie-acting career, Shepard
was the most prolific, original playwright in America _ his subject
was America, embodied in self-invented rock stars, cowboys, con
men. The most damning fact about Broadway is that no producer dared
to produce Shepard there in all those years.
</P>
<P>
   The marriage of art and commerce was on the rocks.
</P>
<P>
   A loss of joy
</P>
<P>
   These were hard transitional years for the musical, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hello, Dolly!'' with Carol Channing and ``Fiddler on the
Roof'' with Zero Mostel, in the mid-'60s, marked the end of its
golden age. Bob Fosse (``Sweet Charity'') and Michael Bennett (``A
Chorus Line'') maintained excitement through the '70s with sensual
dances, but each died before his time. Stephen Sondheim learned at
Hammerstein's knee, but his lyrics had more biting wit, his tunes
less hummability. His ``Company'' and ``Follies'' _ John Updikian
dissections of marriages _ brought refreshing reality to the art
form but weren't about to blanket the nation in high school and
amateur productions.
</P>
<P>
   ``After `Hair' (1969), it got to be that you never see musicals
on contemporary subjects _ with a rare exception like `Rent' _ and
that's a problem,'' Uhry says. ``What's lacking in musicals _ and I
include my own work _ is joy.''
</P>
<P>
   Post-Vietnam and Watergate, the theater reflected a nation with
less to be joyful about. Although David Mamet's exposes of
capitalism's jungle law (1977's ``American Buffalo,'' 1984's
``Glengarry Glen Ross'') were 10 times funnier than Miller's, they
were so savage that they ran a fraction as long on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   In the '80s, the monologist (Spalding Gray, Eric Bogosian, Karen
Finley) rekindled the primal fascination of the lone storyteller.
Playwrights saw AIDS as a national emergency (Larry Kramer's ``The
Normal Heart''), likewise persecution of gays. But many mainstream
theatergoers felt too distantly affected by either issue to connect
with the plays, unless _ like Tony Kushner's masterwork, ``Angels
in America'' _ they addressed a range of issues with a compelling
narrative.
</P>
<P>
   By 1991, most of Broadway's income came from British
blockbusters (``Cats,'' ``The Phantom of the Opera,'' ``Miss
Saigon'') catering to the one-show-a-year tourists. Plays of
thought and substance became like old photo albums and broken
musical instruments, pushed into attics and garages. The new
magazine Entertainment Weekly only mentioned a play if a young
movie star happened to be in it.
</P>
<P>
   Art and commerce got a divorce.
</P>
<P>
   To diversity, to the Bard
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, regional theaters, typically covering their bets with
a mixture of art (classics, new dramas) and commerce (musicals,
comedies) gathered strength. A breakthrough was the 1977 launch of
the Humana Festival of New American Plays at Jon Jory's Actors
Theatre of Louisville, where Beth Henley's ``Crimes of the Heart''
debuted. Regionals began premiering and exporting _ not just
importing _ new plays.
</P>
<P>
   The theater scenes blossomed in turn: Chicago and San Francisco
and Minneapolis in the '70s, San Diego and Seattle in the '80s,
Atlanta in the '90s. In this last decade, artistic directorships
diversified swiftly, with the appointment of blacks (Kenny Leon at
the Alliance, George C. Wolfe at the New York Shakespeare Festival)
and women (Molly Smith at the Arena, Carey Perloff at A.C.T),
though the new multicultural plays they promoted were rarely hits.
Buffered from the vicissitudes of contemporary playwriting,
companies specializing in Shakespeare _ in Washington; Ashland,
Oregon; Montgomery _ gained in luster. By 1999, there were 189
professional theaters running nationwide, playing to an annual
audience of 14.5 million _ 3 million more than Broadway's record
mark of that season.
</P>
<P>
   Yet nonprofits are financially insecure, as dependent on
politically sensitive grants as the bouncing box office. Sometimes
it seemed audiences were never fully satisfied with anything but
``A Christmas Carol.'' Again and again.
</P>
<P>
   ``This worries me,'' says Robert
</P>
<P>
   Brustein, critic for The New Republic and artistic director of
American Repertory Theatre in Cambridge, Mass. ``The nonprofits
were set up as an alternative to the commercial sector, and many
end up imitating it, getting less adventurous over the years. ...
The Alliance Theatre's collaboration with Disney is something I
worry about, too, though I can see the need for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Alliance's cumulative deficit increased to $800,000
last season even with the record-setting ``Aida.''
</P>
<P>
   The new agenda
</P>
<P>
   The families of O'Neill's and Williams' plays, so startling for
their time, look like the folks next door compared to the
super-dysfunctional denizens of end-of-the-century plays.
</P>
<P>
   Consider characters in the recent Pulitzer Prize winners: the
idiot father who mocks his daughter's breasts in Paula Vogel's
``How I Learned to Drive''; the idiot doctor who calls a
50-year-old professor a ``girl'' in Margaret Edson's ``Wit.''
Although they're minor characters in otherwise strong plays, these
unreal men seem to serve as hollow vessels for their authors'
contempt. It's as if anger is being rushed onstage in raw chunks,
without undergoing the full transformative magic of the artistic
process.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, anger is the engine that drives the plays of Odets,
Miller, Mamet, Ntozake Shange (``For Colored Girls ...''). Even if
it means that theater becomes less visible in the culture, more
like a specialized cable channel than a broadcast network, anger
must have a place. The stage by its nature favors change.
</P>
<P>
   One who felt his world change in a theater was the late Frank
McMullen, a Yale drama professor. He told students that after
seeing the first act of ``Salesman'' in 1949, he fled to the
bathroom to weep. He was so shaken that it took several minutes to
notice that the people in the stalls on either side were wearing
high heels.
</P>
<P>
   Uhry recently saw the revival.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teenagers, old men, all kinds of people were sobbing,'' he
says. ``Now tell me that play doesn't still speak to America
today.''

 &HT;    How America became stage-struck
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, August 8.
 &HT;    By Dan Hulbert
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the summer of 1944, Horton Foote, a Texas-bred playwright
struggling to make it in New York, received a letter from his
equally penniless Southern friend Tennessee Williams, who was
peddling screenplays in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was so discouraged,'' recalls the 83-year-old Foote, who
won the 1995 Pulitzer Prize for ``The Young Man From Atlanta.''
``He wrote, `I've got a pretty good play, but it has no commercial
possibilities.' Tennessee was so hungry, he had to have a hit.''
</P>
<P>
   He had it. ``The Glass Menagerie,'' on March 3, 1945, began a
fabled Broadway run of 560 performances. Its success, both in
critical response and at the box office, came from Williams'
refusal to follow formulas that prevailed in the movie industry
(MGM had rejected an earlier draft, ``The Gentleman Caller.'')
Williams wrote fearlessly from his heart, spinning from the
strange, claustrophobic specifics of his sister Rose, mother Edwina
and himself a poetic drama of universal reach. He had no way of
knowing that Eugene O'Neill had already written ``Long Day's
Journey Into Night'' and locked it in a safe until after his death,
so nakedly did it expose his loved ones. The playwrights had
crystallized the defining form of American play in the 20th
century: the realistic family drama.
</P>
<P>
   Television was still little known, so ``Menagerie'' _ an event
seen by fewer than 1,000 people a night, ballyhooed on radio and
newspaper wire services _ could still capture the nation's
undistracted consciousness. It captured Foote's. As the
gate-crasher stood at the rear of Broadway's Playhouse Theater
(Williams smuggled him in through the stage door), Foote was struck
by ``how Laurette Taylor (as Amanda) and the rest of the actors
gave the words a complete life you missed on the page. Jo
Mielziner's set, too, was part of the magic. That night taught me
that this art form is so collaborative, so ephemeral.''
</P>
<P>
   When theater was king
</P>
<P>
   ``Menagerie'' was a magical marriage of two estranged traditions
in American theater _ commerce and art _ a union so improbable that
even the author could not see it coming.
</P>
<P>
   And how could he? With few exceptions until then, American
theater _ like America itself _ was about commerce. Before movies
learned to speak, theater and its raffish brother, vaudeville, were
among the leading sources of mass entertainment. Between 1900 and
1927, the number of New York theaters quadrupled, from 20 to 80,
and even smallish cities (Macon and Columbus, for instance) had
their classy venues for tours.
</P>
<P>
   Theater was more like the movies in that the writer was
secondary to the producer and star _ combined, for example, in the
person of George M. Cohan. Leftists and egghead writers such as
George Bernard Shaw were for tired, old, cloudy Europe; the sunny
triumphal conservatism of the Yankee Doodle Dandy was unchallenged.
It was the Age of Personality. One went to a show not for the title
or author but the sheer energizing presence of Al Jolson, Ed Wynn,
the Barrymores (John, Ethel, Lionel).
</P>
<P>
   Innocent young lovers warbled Victor Herbert's ``Ah, Sweet
Mystery of Life.'' ``The Wizard of Oz,'' ``Babes in Toyland'' and
``Peter Pan'' all debuted before World War I.
</P>
<P>
   But just as the madness of that war revolutionized other arts
(Stravinsky, Joyce, the dadaists), it sent subtler tremors under
the boards of Gotham. Mae West was thrown in jail for 10 days for
writing and playing a hooker in 1926's ``Sex'' (it was a smash,
even though the papers wouldn't print the ads). The explicitness,
not the subject matter, was new. Broadway had long leered over
titillating melodramas about cheating spouses.
</P>
<P>
   The staginess of melodrama hung on under O'Neill, even in bold
experiments such as the spoken thoughts or ``interior monologues''
of his seven-hour ``Strange Interlude.'' Robert Benchley of The
</P>
<P>
   New Yorker called it ``an interesting stunt carried about four
acts too far.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of O'Neill was new. As was said of Milton, he wrote a
mighty line, as seen in the updated Greek myth of ``Mourning
Becomes Electra.'' With O'Neill, American plays became not just
entertainment, but literature.
</P>
<P>
   There were even more experimental playwrights in the '20s and
'30s: Sophie Treadwell, whose ``Machinal'' showed life as a
male-run machine; Elmer Rice and Clifford Odets, whose America was
a capitalist-run machine. But with their limited audiences they
could have been on a different planet from the solidly crafted,
happy-making star vehicles: Helen Hayes in Maxwell Anderson's
costume dramas; Tallulah Bankhead in Lillian Hellman's ``The Little
Foxes''; Ethel Merman in Cole Porter's ``Anything Goes'' and the
Gershwin brothers' ``Girl Crazy''; and the Lunts in just about
everything else, it seemed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Show music was in sync with popular taste,'' says Alfred Uhry,
who studied under Frank Loesser (``Guys and Dolls'') on the way to
a 1999 Tony Award for best book of a musical (``Parade''). ``You'd
hear the hit song on the radio and go see the show.''
</P>
<P>
   Much has been made of the innovations of Jerome Kern and Oscar
Hammerstein II's 1927 ``Show Boat'' _ songs to advance dramatic
story, a black actor opening with the stupendous ``Old Man River''
_ but the producer was the same Florenz Ziegfeld who was packing
'em in for his leggy, gaudy ``Follies.'' Even ``Show Boat'' was
commerce first, with art far down the list of priorities.
</P>
<P>
   Five golden years
</P>
<P>
   ``The Glass Menagerie'' brought the two elements into balance.
Thus began a five-year roll of works that entertained with no
compromise in excellence: Rodgers' and Hammerstein's ``Carousel''
(darker, deeper than ``Oklahoma!'') and ``South Pacific'';
O'Neill's ``The Iceman Cometh''; Williams' ``A Streetcar Named
Desire''; and Arthur Miller's ``Death of a Salesman.'' In the last
two productions, director Elia Kazan perfected a poetic, gutsy,
uniquely American realism to rival the more abstract styles in
continental Europe and the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   No American burg could be mentioned in the same breath as New
York. If, in 1949, a fortuneteller predicted that ``Salesman''
would triumphantly return in a remount of a Chicago production (the
current Goodman Theatre staging with Brian Dennehy), she would have
been laughed out of her Times Square parlor.
</P>
<P>
   If she'd prophesied a Walt Disney version of ``Aida'' in little
ol' Atlanta, she'd be buckled into a straitjacket.
</P>
<P>
   What happened after 1950 _ Act 2 of the century _ to bring these
startling changes?
</P>
<P>
   Women on the `frontier'
</P>
<P>
   Talent was already ``out there'' _ west of the Hudson River, in
a few scattered semiprofessional outposts such as the Goodman of
Chicago and the Old Globe of San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Now a wave of regional talent arose, led by women. Margo Jones'
Theatre '47 was a few steps from the livestock pavilions at the
Texas State Fair grounds in Dallas, but her first season premiered
the Williams play that evolved into ``Summer and Smoke.'' Zelda
Fichandler started the Arena Stage in Washington in 1950, not on
the model of a Broadway house (a place that producers rent on a
per-project basis) but rather a European repertory house, a
nonprofit troupe offering a full season of artists in residence.
</P>
<P>
   The local actors and designers were shaky at first, but the
programming was sophisticated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been called a visionary, but I honestly couldn't see past
getting the toilets cleaned at first,'' says Fichandler, who
retired from the Arena in 1990 and now teaches at New York
University. ``Our modest mission was to bring theater, like
libraries and museums, to where people live. To let artists, whose
job is to interpret the life of the community, live there, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Chekhov and Moliere with local actors did not catch on
immediately in cities that had known only star tours, so the
National Endowment for the Arts (founded in 1965) was
indispensable. The next 15 years saw the founding of the Mark Taper
Forum in Los Angeles, the American Conservatory Theatre in San
Francisco, the Alliance Theatre in Atlanta, the Denver Center
Theatre and the Seattle Repertory Theatre.

 &HT;    Peters shines through bevy of Broadway tunes
 &HT;    By Kathy Janich
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   She is drama queen, imp, big bad wolf and girl next door. And
when she is good, as she is in most of this PBS pledge-drive
special, she doesn't just sing songs, she inhabits them.
</P>
<P>
   Bernadette Peters, one of Broadway's reigning divas, delivers 22
tunes in this 85-minute concert from London's Royal Festival Hall.
And, after a slow start _ ``You're in the Money'' in English and
pig Latin(!?) and her saucy, overexposed ``Broadway Baby'' _ she
hits the bull's-eye.
</P>
<P>
   This concert is similar to the one Peters did last October in
Atlanta but she mixes in just enough new songs to keep things
interesting. Metro fans didn't get the tender, tongue-in-check
``Raining in My Heart'' from ``Dames at Sea,'' for example, or the
exquisite ``Later'' from ``A Little Night Music.'' The latter is
one tough number, requiring operatic highs, deep and resonant lows,
and a heck of a lot of breath control. It's not done often, let
alone this well, and we're lucky Peters has added it to her
repertoire.
</P>
<P>
   At other times, Peters is patter perfect, from the
tongue-twisting lyrics of ``You Could Drive a Person Crazy'' to the
rapid-fire ruminations of ``Some People.'' You can tell the songs
she especially connects with. It's in her eyes, and often in her
tears.
</P>
<P>
   Other highlights include ``Unexpected Song'' from Andrew Lloyd
Webber's ``Song and Dance,'' and ``Moving On'' from Stephen
Sondheim's ``Sunday in the Park With George.'' In fact the entire
second act is devoted to her buddy Steve with numbers from
``Sweeney Todd,'' ``Into the Woods,'' ``Anyone Can Whistle'' and
``Merrily We Roll Along.''
</P>
<P>
   While this all makes for a very good night, it could be better.
Compared with other one-woman shows (Patti LuPone's 1995 Broadway
gig, for example), there are too few spontaneous moments. And we
don't always know what song Peters is singing or where it came from
(titles superimposed on the screen would help). Still, that's like
quibbling over the kind of olive in the best martini you've ever
sipped.
</P>
<P>
   Peters _ with her serious talent, china-doll skin, baby-doll
pout and crown of reddish curls _ is as superlative as that
cocktail can be. And just as intoxicating.

which is expected to carry over to the stock market. (Joyner,

owns the largest station. Other markets? Other media companies?

   MICROSOFT-PIRACY _ The owners of Microseconds, one of the
companies charged by Microsoft with selling pirate software,

   ECONOMY-JOBS _ The U.S. economy churned out far more jobs in
July than Wall Street expected, causing the biggest increase in
average hourly earnings in seven months and increasing the odds the
Federal Reserve will raise interest rates soon. The Labor
Department said Friday that non-farm payrolls rose 310,000 in July
as wages climbed six cents, or 0.5%, to $13.29. Both numbers
exceeded Wall Street expectations and caused a slump in bond prices
which is expected to carry over to the stock market. (Joyner,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 15.

 By DOUGLAS CENTURY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``You carry a money clip?'' my friend asked, staring
at me as we split the check after a recent dinner. ``Who do you
think you are _ Damon Runyon?''
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, I tossed my wallet into the trash and began
carrying my cash in an old-fashioned money clip. I was glad to get
rid of the wallet, since it had long stopped functioning as a
billfold and become a repository for bank deposit slips, bent
business cards, Post-it notes and other things too important to
throw out but not important enough to deal with promptly.
</P>
<P>
   It had become so fat and heavy, in fact, that when jammed into
my back pocket, I could no longer sit down without listing to the
left.
</P>
<P>
   There wasn't any space inside for cash, and I'd taken to shoving
my bills haphazardly into various pants pockets. My wife, annoyed
to catch me leaving crumpled bills behind in taxicabs, bought me a
money clip as a birthday gift.
</P>
<P>
   I'd never really paid attention to money clips before, but now I
can't imagine the disordered state of affairs without one. Mine is
gold-plated, hinged, with a little snapping-turtle action, and
engraved with my initials. For my ID and credit cards, I bought
myself the necessary companion, a slim gray leather card holder,
anchored with a single screw, which allows me to fan my plastic out
like playing cards.
</P>
<P>
   These days, virtually every man I know shares the common
complaint of a bloated and unwieldy wallet. Many are carrying more
gold and platinum plastic than necessary, or comfortable. And
without the luxury of those bottomless-pit handbags beloved by
women, most guys are forced to turn their wallets into traveling
file cabinets, stuffed with phone numbers, dry-cleaning receipts
and other clutter.
</P>
<P>
   But recently, I've noticed more and more men doing away with the
conventional wallet, replacing it with a money clip and a slim-line
credit-card case. A few months back, I spotted my friend Adam
Wiener, an executive producer at CBS New Media, pulling out a brown
leather credit-card holder, made by Fossil, with a brass clip
attached to the front. ``My old wallet just took up too much
space,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   This model, which retails for $18 to $20 at Lord &AMP; Taylor,
Stern's and Macy's, is marketed as a Front Pocket Wallet, and
according to Jim Cullen, an account representative at Fossil Inc.,
a maker of hip sunglasses, watches, belts and other accessories, it
is by far the company's hottest selling item this year, now
accounting for 25 percent of Fossil's total sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``It started as a golfer's wallet, because it's lightweight and
fits in their front pocket,'' Cullen said. ``Golfers wanted a money
clip attached to a gusseted credit-card case with room for just two
or three cards.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sharper Image advertises a similar design, a slim card
holder with a Velcro money clip attached, in grained leather
($39.95) or mock crocodile ($44.95). ``Instead of loading down your
back pocket with an overstuffed wallet _ tempting thieves,'' the
catalog copy reads, lighten up with our innovative Deep Pocket
Safety Wallet.''
</P>
<P>
   These all-in-one styles are gaining favor, but most
traditionalists insist on separating the clip and credit cards in
different pockets. The latest trend in money clips is the
leather-covered magnetic models by Coach ($30), Tumi ($18) and
Fossil ($15).
</P>
<P>
   They're a bit high-concept for my taste. I prefer the more
classic designs. Macy's Estate Collection of antique jewelry
features a sterling silver owl and a simple rectangular clip
engraved with a dollar sign.
</P>
<P>
   Nat Sherman, the cigar store, sells a cigar-decorated clip, and
Peter Stonehill, a salesman, said that sterling clips with the
logos of Cadillac, Mercedes-Benz and BMW have been selling briskly.
</P>
<P>
   At Barneys New York, Gabriella Vassallo, men's accessory buyer,
said, ``We're seeing a great business in customers using a flat
credit-card case and a money clip for their bills.'' The store
carries traditional rectangular money clips, in sterling, ranging
from $55 to $200.
</P>
<P>
   These models are more like the old money clips that were carried
to do away with pocket detritus and to make a style statement as
well. Cecil B. DeMille carried his cash in a clip bearing the
figure of an Oscar. The notoriously parsimonious Jack Benny gave a
gold money clip to his pal George Burns, featuring caricatures of
them both.
</P>
<P>
   John F. Kennedy's money clip was a first-anniversary gift from
his wife: it bore an image of St. Christopher, and he had it in his
pocket when he was killed in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Sinatra, ``went nowhere without his money clip,'' said
Bill Zehme, the author of ``The Way You Wear Your Hat: Frank
Sinatra and the Lost Art of Livin''' (HarperCollins, 1997). Sinatra
favored a gold triangular paper-clip design from Tiffany's and no
card holder. ``He never carried a credit card in his life,'' Zehme
said. ``He loathed them.''
</P>
<P>
   Alan King, in his memoir, ``Name-Dropping'' (Scribner, 1996),
recounts buying a gold money clip engraved with an image of the
Torah, from Swifty Morgan, a Runyonesque figure whom King describes
as carrying tissue-wrapped jewelry in every pocket.
</P>
<P>
   In King's account, the money clip had belonged to Rabbi Stephen
S. Wise, who had parted with it on his deathbed. King treasured the
clip for its rabbinical provenance until he spotted Sinatra in
Beverly Hills pulling out a wad of cash from an identical Torah
money clip. ``Oh, it's a great story,'' Sinatra told King. ``On his
deathbed, Rabbi Wise gave it to Swifty Morgan.''
</P>
<P>
   Money clips gradually fell out of favor when they became less
associated with swells than with old fogies _ like carrying a
fountain pen or a cigarette case _ and with mobsters, at least in
popular imagination, though not all gangsters seem to have actually
carried them.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Donnie Brasco,'' Al Pacino's character, Lefty Two Guns,
instructs Johnny Depp that a real wise guy always carries his cash
in a roll, with a $100 bill on the outside for flash.
</P>
<P>
   But Sidney Zion, the Daily News columnist who knew mobsters like
Meyer Lansky and Longy Zwillman, told me that the big shots, the
bosses, often didn't carry any cash. ``Their bodyguards carried
it,'' Zion said. ``There'd always be somebody around to throw down
the Benjamins when the time came.''
</P>
<P>
   Zion was surprised to hear that money clips were in vogue again:
``They're back? Like cigars and martinis?''
</P>
<P>
   In this digital age, with the easy swipe of debit cards and
online payments as quick as a mouse click, money clips may soon be
rendered obsolete again. But for now at least, I relish the crisp
sensation of folding my bills and snapping them tenderly inside my
money clip.
</P>
<P>
   As Zehme said, ``You want something cold and metallic to keep
that lettuce chilled.''

TEXAS LANDMARK WITH GRIM PAST TO REOPEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA TOLLEY  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ As an architecture student in the 1970s at the
University of Texas, Stanley Lars gazed up at the tall limestone
structure, often wishing he could get a closer look but rarely
thinking about the tragedies that prevented him from doing so.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Austin architect gets a first-hand look at that same
building every day as he oversees renovations that will allow
university officials to reopen the legendary tower next month after
a 24-year shutdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tower is kind of a mysterious thing, but opening it will
help people experience it and see how wonderful the view is,''
Stanley said Friday during a tour of the observation deck for
reporters and photographers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It connects you to the city in a unique way,'' he said. ``I
think it definitely will erase some of the stigma. Instead of the
mystery and foreboding, it'll be exhilarating.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``stigma'' is the slaughter that occurred on the grounds
below the tower 33 years ago when Charles Whitman toted sandwiches,
toilet paper and a rifle up to the deck and started shooting at
random.
</P>
<P>
   Within 96 minutes, he killed 14 people and wounded 32 others. He
was stopped when officers stormed onto the deck, killing him in a
hail of gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the bullet-hole scars in the limestone walls are carefully
concealed.
</P>
<P>
   An arched, stainless steel lattice designed by Stanley is being
erected around the deck, a safeguard against would-be jumpers. The
tower was temporarily closed to visitors after the Whitman
shootings and permanently closed in 1975 after several suicides.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, at the urging of some students, the UT System Board
of Regents finally voted to reopen the tower after certain safety
renovations were completed.
</P>
<P>
   The observation deck, 231 feet high, provides an unobstructed,
awesome view of the surrounding campus, the city of Austin and the
picturesque Texas Hill Country.
</P>
<P>
   While visitors Friday seemed captivated by the panoramic scene,
they also were compelled to look down on the peaceful-looking mall
where terror reigned on another hot August day 33 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The orange tower lights are turned on to celebrate a football
victory or some sports triumph, the building itself often serves as
a reminder of Whitman's horrific attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, when I'm walking through that open area, I'll think
about it,'' said Erin Shubel, a 23-year-old research assistant who
graduated from the University of Texas last spring. ``I'll think
how people were just walking through there too when someone opened
fire on them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's surreal, I can't imagine it. It's insane,'' she said.
``People must have just had targets on their heads.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet she supports reopening the tower.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sad to have something like that not accessible,'' she
said. ``By isolating it, it makes it that `evil place,' when really
it was just an evil person.''
</P>
<P>
   The tower is scheduled to be open to the public on Sept. 16,
though there will be a ceremonial opening the day before.
</P>
<P>
   The renovations will cost about $600,000. University officials
hope to offset some of the costs by charging visitors $3 each.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley, who studied under UT sculptor Charles Moore in the
1970s, designed the lattice to fit into the architectural and
historical context of the tower and adjoining building. It is made
of stainless steel for strength and because it blends well with the
limestone walls.
</P>
<P>
   An elevator also is being installed. Visitors will have to pass
through a metal detector before getting on it, and there will be an
armed guard patrolling the deck.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley said he's honored to help reopen the Texas landmark.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole state of Texas knows about this tower,'' he said.
``When people come here, it's one of the things they want to see.
It should be accessible to people. That's why it exists.''

for Sunday, Aug. 8, will move Saturday.

<P>
   _ On the dress page:
</P>
<P>
   (Moving in the `a' category)
</P>
<P>
   CONGRESS-GRIDLOCK-REVIEW (Washington) _ Congress has recessed
with little to show for itself beyond an arsenal of political
soundbites stockpiled to serve as campaign themes for a high-stakes
election that is still more than a year away. Still, hasn't it been
said that in a democracy the people get the government they
deserve? Can voters really expect anything but gridlock if they
elect a Democratic president, a Republican-dominated Senate and a
House nominally under Republican control but actually divided
nearly in two? By Alison Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   ELDERLY-REINVENT-REVIEW (Undated) _ The AARP is trying to
retrofit itself for the baby boomers, the next great wave of the
aged, who began turning 50 three years ago and thus became eligible
for that incredibly fraught rite of passage, membership in the
AARP. Officials say they have no intention of short-changing their
older members, who in many ways have more traditional expectations
of retirement and what they want from a senior citizens'
organization. But the boomers are different. And the mighty AARP's
struggle to adjust says a lot about how the boomers will remake the
aging process. By Robin Toner.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   MALLS-DECLINE-REVIEW (Undated) _ A look at why so many shopping
malls are dead or dying. One reason is greater competition _ in
some cases from re-imagined downtown blocks that developers, in an
interesting about-face, have remodeled to mimic malls. Usually,
where a mall has failed, a bigger, more state-of-the-art shopping
mecca looms on the horizon. Some are being `de-malled' to create
drive-up-to-the-door strip centers, which an increasing number of
shoppers find more convenient than the vast, multi-level centers
with miles of parking lots and walkways. But some critics feel
shopping centers have reached their saturation point. By Elin
Schoen Brockman.
</P>
<P>
   CLASSICAL-MUSIC-KIDS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Businesses across North
America are deploying symphonies to drive people away. In tactics
akin to psychological warfare, merchants, building owners and
transit officials switch on the classics to scatter loiterers,
especially teenagers. Criminologists trace the trend to a 7-Eleven
store in Victoria, British Columbia, which began bombarding its
parking lot with classical music in 1985 to dissuade teenagers from
congregating there. By David Wallis.
</P>

   FARM-AID-REVIEW (Washington) _ Federal farm policy is creating
bigger farms and fewer farmers, converting tens of billions of tax
dollars into cattle fodder, creating big profits for big
agribusiness and underwriting cheap hamburgers, but bringing little
benefit _ and, some argue, great harm _ to small farmers trying to
make a living. A system that began in the Depression to help
farmers survive is now `planting a seed that is going to destroy
American agriculture as we know it,' says Sen. Phil Gramm. By Tim
Weiner.

   DUBIOUS-SCIENCE-REVIEW (Undated) _ It seems that almost any
scientific-sounding extrapolation for taking off pounds or putting
on IQ points can quickly gain a seal of approval from public health
groups or educators and help set policy for untold years to come.
Sometimes it has nothing to do with science. By Gina Kolata.
</P>
<P>
   TEACHER-PAY-REVIEW (Undated) _ Ask a teacher what needs to be
done to improve dismal student performance, and it's a good bet the
first answer will be to raise teachers' salaries, thereby
attracting and keeping better teachers. But there is scant evidence
that higher salaries alone make a difference in student
performance. By Steven Greenhouse.

   PETS-FAKE-TESTICLES-REVIEW (Undated) _ `Neuticles' are
artificial testicles implanted for cosmetic reasons in dogs, cats,
horses and other pets that have been neutered. By Douglas Martin.

   WORLD-TREATIES-REVIEW (United Nations) _ Over the last decade,
many countries concerned about problems that transcend their
borders and threaten to overwhelm them have been signing on to one
treaty or convention after another aimed at reigning in abusive
regimes, ending the mistreatment of the weak and cutting back on
the proliferation of all kinds of weapons. Washington often watches
all this with an array of not-very-positive reactions: diminishing
enthusiasm in the White House, unease in the Pentagon, and mounting
outrage in Congress, always on the lookout for invasions of U.S.
sovereignty to beat back. By Barbara Crosette.
</P>
<P>
   BRITAIN-MYSTICISM (London) _ The approach of the first full
solar eclipse in Britain in 72 years, and the last of the
millennium, is being hailed by pagans, druids, doomsayers and New
Age Travelers who interpret it in many ways, from divine felicity
to the end of the world _ anything except celestial science. And
that says something about a nation whose stereotype of proud
pragmatism seems mirrored, or even challenged, by this strain of
mysticism and quest for alternative meanings. By Alan Cowell.
</P>
<P>
   SAFRICA-GUNS-REVIEW (Johannesburg) _ Guns are everywhere in
Africa, a legacy of conflict and a result of lax gun control. There
are gun stores in fancy malls, including designer gun shops where
the rich buy slick, showy little guns hoping to protect themselves
from the high crime rate. Police and army roadblocks are standard
practice all over the continent, manned by young men with huge
automatic weapons dangling carelessly from their shoulders. By
Suzanne Daley.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The burning question at last month's menswear shows
was not about the masculine merits of clamdiggers or the demise of
the backpack in favor of an over-the-shoulder bag with a strap as
wide as a Miss Universe sash. The query on everyone's lips was,
``Who's the guy with the mustache?''
</P>
<P>
   The man causing the flurry of interest in an otherwise
uneventful three days of shows in New York for Spring 2000 was
Eugene Hutz, a model who also is a member of a Ukrainian punk rock
band called Gogol Bordello. Hutz, 25, appeared in only two fashion
shows _ for the designers Marc Jacobs and Nigel Curtiss _ but he
garnered the lion's share of notice.
</P>
<P>
   It's not every day you see Snidely Whiplash on a runway.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he walked into casting, I said I have to have this guy in
my show,'' said Curtiss, an alumnus of Comme Des Garcons, who
showed his collection for the first time in New York on July 27.
``In his mustache, in his sideburns and in his eyes, he had such a
strong attitude,'' the designer recalled last week from his London
home. Hutz's mustache, he said, ``was so fresh and unexpected that
it captured everybody's attention.'' That, it did. No one else on
any runway was sporting anything close to the underbrush beneath
the model's nose.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, there was a little chin scruff here and there,
particularly in Jacobs' show, but no mustaches. Hutz's handlebar
managed to be what tattoos and body piercings no longer can be _
genuinely shocking.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this state of affairs exists purely on and around the
runway. Policemen, firemen, cowboys and the occasional macho
newspaperman like Phil Bronstein of San Francisco (Sharon Stone)
have never stopped wearing mustaches. But in fashion circles, the
look hasn't been popular in 20 years. As Curtiss said, ``You don't
see anyone at the right parties or the right places who has one.''
Even Mark Spitz, the Olympic star who wore his mustache as proudly
as his gold medals in the 1970s, was cleanshaven in a recent
television advertisement for a videogame. Although goatees and Van
Dykes have come and gone in the last five years _ and in many cases
come and stayed _ the mustache has shown little signs of a revival,
despite the enduring upper lips of mustachioed icons like Tom
Selleck and John Waters. In fact, it is one of the few vestiges of
the '70s that has not yet made a comeback, although some have
tried.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did a fashion story a couple of years ago for Paper magazine
about Burt Reynolds, and the response was incredible,'' recalls
Stefan Campbell, a freelance fashion stylist, who also styled
Curtiss' show last month. The magazine story, which coincided with
the 1997 release of ``Boogie Nights'' and re-created Reynolds'
famous Cosmo centerfold, was about the return of machismo and
featured a rugged young model with a mustache. The article followed
a 1996 runway show by John Bartlett that was a hirsute ode to the
mustachioed he-men featured in After Dark magazine.
</P>
<P>
   But the look didn't take off, except as camp. Mustaches sprouted
on cross-dressing women known as drag kings, in a Beastie Boys
video spoofing '70s cop shows and most recently, in a print ad for
Altoids mints. ``It's slowly taking its time to get here,''
Campbell noted wryly.
</P>
<P>
   But Hutz could speed things up a bit. ``I felt Eugene would be a
bit of a trendsetter,'' said Karen Long, director of the men's
division of DNA Models in New York, who signed Hutz to her agency
three months ago. ``He had a face that I thought would be appealing
to men because he's not your typical pretty boy.'' Because of his
mustache, Hutz is not boyish-looking at all, which is one reason
that some observers say mustaches have not come back. ``Everyone
wants youth and young and baby faces and a cleanshaven face and a
big buff body, but a mustache says maturity,'' Campbell explained.
In a youth-obsessed culture, most people figure why look any older
than you have to?
</P>
<P>
   A column in the current issue of Time Out New York magazine
suggests that because ``pop culture has clearly turned against
sub-nasal carpeting,'' mustaches have become an act of revolution
and should be embraced by the truly alternative among us. But there
are better reasons to embrace them. Now that the funny but
terminally uncool jokemeister Weird Al Yankovic has shaved off his
mustache _ he appears in his latest video, a ``Star Wars'' spoof
called ``The Saga Begins,'' free of facial hair and dressed as a
Jedi knight _ it's safe to grow one. As Curtiss said last week,
``It's a completely new look again.'' And unlike a tattoo, when you
get tired of it a few months later, you can remove it.
</P>
<P>
   But Hutz himself has the best reason for growing a mustache. ``A
goatee makes my face look like a skateboard. It's too long,'' he
said. ``This evens it out.''

<P>
   Brisk jet stream winds flowing near the boundary between chilly
air over eastern Canada and hot air over the southern states will
promote fast weather changes from the northern Plains to the New
England. The vigorous high-level winds will energize potent
thunderstorms which will move from the northern Mississippi Valley
on Saturday to the Northeast on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Heat will be unrelenting from the southern Plains to the
interior Southeast. Plentiful sunshine will cover most areas,
although a few afternoon thunderstorms will develop, especially
near the Gulf Coast and over the hills of western Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The hot, humid air will be drawn northern through the
Mississippi Valley by the circulation around low pressure moving
east from Minnesota. Converging winds near the low pressure zone
will lift the moist air, resulting in clouds and showers from the
eastern Dakotas to the western Great Lakes. Broken bands of strong
thunderstorms will develop in the heat of the day from Missouri to
Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Northeast will have ample sun, seasonable
temperatures and comfortable humidity as weak high pressure moves
into New England. Clouds will increase from west to east Saturday
afternoon and into the night as the disturbance approaches from the
Midwest. Thundershowers will sweep from the Ohio Valley to the
interior Northeast overnight.
</P>
<P>
   In the Northwest, clouds and showers will be common as
slow-moving low pressure swirls over the region. A few potent
thunderstorms will form over the interior in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: SNOW RECORD
</P>
<P>
   Just as football referees confer when deciding the outcome of a
controversial play, The National Climate Extremes Committee met
this week to decide whether this past winter's snowfall of 1,140
inches at Mount Baker set a national record. Measuring snowfall
breeds controversy because snow compacts, melts or is blown away by
the wind. But proper procedures were followed _ measurements were
taken once a day on a ``snow board,'' a flat surface made of
material such as tile that limits melting. The committee ruled that
Mount Baker's snowfall was a national record. It also broke the
world mark.

LAKESIDE GURU 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, August 08, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Guru is a Hindi word for personal spiritual adviser or teacher.
It has come into common usage in English during the past 30 years
or so to mean any charismatic leader highly regarded by a group of
followers. I don't know much about gurus, but I know one when I see
one.
</P>
<P>
   One such is a long-time Boston money manager named Dean LeBaron.
LeBaron is 66, and no longer active as a fund manager. But the
trajectory of his career may have something to say about
semi-retirement in the epoch of the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from Harvard College and, in 1960, the Harvard
Business School, LeBaron rose quickly in Boston's staid money
management community to become director of research at F.S.
Moseley, then at Keystone Investment Management Corp. In 1969 he
left to found Batterymarch Financial Management Corp., at a time
when even a growth fund was something of an innovation.
</P>
<P>
   He was a man in the right place at the right time, and rapidly
became one of the prophets of quantitative investing. He favored
computers for the sifting of massive data sets, economic models for
systematic analysis, and, when judgment was required to help choose
out-of-favor stocks, esoteric techniques of detachment gleaned from
Zen buddhism.
</P>
<P>
   For a time, he was a pioneer in the creation of index funds
designed to mimic the behavior of the market as a whole, on the
theory, that no investor, however shrewd, was likely to outsmart
the market consistently over time. Then, dramatically, he abandoned
the strategy in favor of active management based on various
intriguing new results from finance theory. In later years he would
self-deprecatingly quote performance arbiter Rex Sinquefield's
dictum that ``There are three classes of people who don't think
markets work: the Cubans, the North Koreans, and active managers.''
</P>
<P>
   His was one of those names that everybody knew, like Hayne
Leland and Barr Rosenberg and Fischer Black, before the community
itself grew so large and various as to come to be known
collectively simply as ``quants'' and ``rocket scientists.'' By the
early '80s, Batterymarch was managing as much as $18 billion and
training a new generation of quantitative investors.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble arrived in the late 1980s, in the form of a couple of
employee breakaways and a series of bad bets. In 1994 LeBaron sold
Batterymarch to the Baltimore brokerage firm of Legg Mason Inc. for
$60 million, with another $60 million contingent on its performance
over three years.
</P>
<P>
   So now LeBaron spends his time going back and forth between the
Santa Fe Institute (where he is a trustee) and the annual World
Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where he is a favored guest.
His latest project is a books on other gurus _ 30 or 40 little
profiles of fellow gurus, with little reading lists, Web addresses,
etc. _ the guru himself turned economic journalist.
</P>
<P>
   The volume begins with an e-mail exchange between LeBaron and
his friends and fellow gurus Robert Monks and Chrisopher Meyer
(head of the Center for Business Innovation for Ernst and Young.)
``At times we may seem glib and cavalier,'' writes LeBaron with his
coauthor, Romesh Vaitilingam. ``It is merely in our attempt to be
concise about things that defy precision.''
</P>
<P>
   The real locus of LeBaron's activities is his Web page,
www.deanlebaron.com. ``Welcome,'' he says, ``to this new, very
public, very global sandbox. I have grown up in the investment
world and witnessed continuous change in markets and technology,
but never with the rapidity as that occurring right now. We have
instantaneous access to people and resources. We have the tools.
Everything here is subject to change. The essence of the Web is
freshness and mental freshness is what we are trying to promote.''
</P>
<P>
   So what's there? Well, plenty of brief pensees on this and that
in the ``snippets notepad'' under ``Futurebytes.'' A daily video
commentary _ the guru as Walter Cronkite (except when his
3-year-old granddaughter fills in with some reflections on the New
Hampshire presidential primary). Some old speeches. An unpublished
book on his experiences in Russian markets called ``Climbing
Falling Walls.'' And a ``completely personal album of family
history pictures,`` which ``might amuse some of you and bemuse
others as a departure from my usual serious commentaries.''
</P>
<P>
   There are the remarkable family and friends. The beautiful
houses. (The one at the end of of Sagamore Road on Standish Shore
in South Duxbury, Mass. is ``right on the beach with a big front
lawn,'' he notes.) The Cessna Skymaster. And then there is ``Two
Lakes,'' a pair of web cameras transmitting pictures taken every
half hour from the front lawns of LeBaron houses on Lake Sunapee in
New Hampshire and the Wallensee in Switzerland. The lakes are
``similar in many respects, different in others,'' says LeBaron.
The Sunapee camera is out of service for the moment, having been
hit by lightning.
</P>
<P>
   Like most personal Web ages, therefore, LeBaron's is part
bulletin board, part scrapbook, part storeroom for old items whose
copyright no longer matters. In fact, the really interesting thing
on offer on LeBaron's Web site is neither the guru book nor the Web
page but something called ``The Ultimate Book of Investment
Quotations.'' It is what used to be called a commonplace book, 300
pages of quotations about the business of international investing
that have attracted LeBaron's attention over the years.
Unfortunately it doesn't seem to be available in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, LeBaron notes that in the 1950s, he was the
world's greatest expert on the shares of makers of fiberglass
boats: Glaspar, Glasstron, American Molded Fiberglass, and so on.
The concept was great: high fixed costs and low variable costs. The
builder would pay $300,000 for a mold, $50 for the material he put
in it, and would stamp out as many boats as he liked. Rather like
the Internet stocks, LeBaron notes. ``And who remembers the
fiberglass boat stocks now, 40 years later?''
</P>
<P>
   An equally striking parallel is to the boats themselves. Like
the fiberglass boat business, the guru industry reliably produces a
few big winners a year, year after year. But just as heavy hulls
whose designs sold only a few copies still litter many a beach, the
World Wide Web now assures that there will be an awful lot of gurus
attentively tending roadside, mountainside, and lakeside stands.

A LOT OF FUND POSITIONS? CHECK MID- AND SMALL-CAP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, August 08, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. My wife and I, aged 74 and 76 respectively, are in a dilemma
about rebalancing our portfolio, and about where to invest
additional funds. We find ourselves in a very fortunate position,
primarily because we began building mutual fund positions 20 years
ago and we have been buy-and-hold investors since. As a result, we
have significant, though unrealized, capital gains on most of our
holdings, although some are modest in size. Since we are not
dependent upon income from our investments, and since we now have
some additional funds to invest because of a home sale, we need
some advice. According to the ``experts,'' we have too many funds.
We hold eight Fidelity funds totaling $586,000, with more than
$200,000 each in Magellan and Contrafund, $82,000 in four
miscellaneous funds in other families, $33,000 in three TIAA/CREF
funds, and $30,000 in four Vanguard funds. We also have $150,000
available for investment. We have followed your advice in the
paper, and accordingly we have small amounts in Vanguard GNMA and
Vanguard Health Care, and are adding $250 a month to those, as well
as to some of the miscellaneous funds. We would prefer to invest a
large chunk of the house proceeds rather than let them languish in
a money market fund. Should we therefore raise our fund investments
to more substantial levels, or should we invest in other funds? We
are both mindful of the asset allocation principal and the
too-many-funds syndrome, so you can understand our puzzlement. What
do you suggest?
</P>
<P>
   W.R., Barnard, Vt. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Pooh on those ``experts.'' Sure, you have a lot of funds, but
you also are working toward a fairly nice diversification, aside
from the skew toward those large-cap blend funds that would
generate such big tax bills if you were to sell them. It seems to
me that there are only two disadvantages to holding a large number
of funds.
</P>
<P>
   One is that reviewing fund performance is more cumbersome than
if you limit yourself to a half dozen or so. But many people don't
find that chore onerous, and my guess, based on the fact that you
put this portfolio together to begin with, is that you are one of
them. The other disadvantage is that portfolios made up of many
funds often tend to get bunched up in one category, such as the
nine large-cap funds that probably make up about 75 percent of the
portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   My suggestion would be to look carefully at the tax consequences
of selling some of the large-cap holdings where gains have been
modest; if you find that you can sell one or two without horrible
tax consequences, you make the sales and increase your positions in
the mid- and small-cap sectors, and perhaps even increasing the
Vanguard Health Care position.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the large-cap dominance, it seems to me that the
major problem of this portfolio is its very small participation on
the fixed-income side. Since you don't supply exact amounts of your
investments in Vanguard GNMA and the TIAA/CREF Bond Plus accounts,
I'm going to guess, and my guess is that the level is a good deal
less than 5 percent of the total portfolio; in any event it
couldn't be more than 7.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Even though you don't need an income stream from this portfolio,
my suggestion, made for the sake of safety and proper asset
allocation, is to devote all of that $150,000 from the real estate
side to the fixed-income side. I'd even add one more fund, the
Vanguard High-Yield Corporate Bond fund. My idea would be
ultimately to divide the $150,000 between that fund and Vanguard
GNMA.
</P>
<P>
   But I am also aware that the bond market is pretty choppy right
now, so I would adopt a dollar cost averaging program, putting most
of the money in Vanguard's Prime Money Market fund and moving
$3,000 a month to each of the two target funds; if you achieve
average 5 percent returns from the money market fund, this would
spread the investment period out over the course of about 27 1/2
months.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, in order to keep the dominance of the large-cap funds
from growing, I suggest you take all the distributions from these
funds in cash, reinvesting the proceeds in the small- and mid-cap
and health care sector holdings.

<P>
   Q. Last summer we sold our house and cleared $200,000, of which
we put $150,000 in Fidelity Spartan GNMA. We invested in the GNMA
fund to provide a monthly income of about $750. Since then,
although we are still getting close to the original monthly check,
the principal amount has fallen to $145,000. How safe are GNMA
funds, and what's in the future?
</P>
<P>
   R.K., North Andover, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. With Ginnie Mae funds, you have to take a long-term view.
Although the federal government guarantees the principal and
interest payments on the mortgages that underlie GNMA securities,
they remain subject to changes in interest rates, with the
principal falling as interest rates rise (or as people worry that
they might) and with principal rising as interest rates fall (or
when lower rates are anticipated). But the important thing is that
over the long haul _ that's to say over a period of a decade or so
_ the better GNMA funds tend to go nowhere, with all the gains and
losses crossing one another out. In the interim, what you get is a
yield in the neighborhood of 1 1/2 percentage points better than
you would get from a money market fund or a CD. Your fund, now
merged into Fidelity GNMA, is a solid offering in the category, and
my advice is to ride out the bumps. The fund will do precisely what
you expected it to _ deliver a solid monthly check that you can
rely on in good markets and bad.
</P>
<P>
   Projecting what interest rates will do in the future is a good
way to get poor quickly, and it's not a practice I follow.
Certainly, there's a lot of talk about higher interest rates right
now, and I wouldn't be surprised if you saw further short-term
price erosion. But you also have to remember that we are in one of
the longest economic expansions in our modern history, and
eventually it's going to end. And when the economic worm turns, the
normal approach of government officials is to cut interest rates to
spur the economy _ and that's when you'll see your principal
account begin to gain.
</P>
<P>
   Stick with the fund; it's a solid offering and it should meet
your needs.

AUTO BUSINESS IN THE U.S. BOOMS ON  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 8) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mich.)   (af)  
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRAVERSE CITY, Mich. _ A true multinational corporation with 104
factories in 34 countries, the Honda Motor Co. constantly assesses
economies and vehicle demand around the world _ and the company's
leaders think they know where the strongest market will be over the
next few years.
</P>
<P>
   ``North America is the only place an investor would want to put
their money,'' said Hiroyuki Yoshino, Honda's chief executive and
president.
</P>
<P>
   Few industries play as large or as cyclical a role in the
American economy as automobile manufacturing. Last week, at the
University of Michigan's annual automotive conference here in
northwestern Michigan, Yoshino and a parade of other top executives
predicted that auto sales and the American economy would stay
strong through the rest of this year and into 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Before the 1990s, the auto industry never managed more than two
consecutive years of high, steady sales. But automobile sales have
been about 15 million every year since 1993. And just as industry
executives were worrying earlier this year that American garages
might finally be full, business became even better.
</P>
<P>
   Sales in July, reported by all the big auto makers last Tuesday,
showed the industry on course for its best year ever, roughly 17
million vehicles. That would exceed the record of 16.03 million,
set in 1986, when people rushed to take out car loans before the
end of tax deductions for the interest.
</P>
<P>
   Rising household incomes this year, along with fairly low
interest rates and gasoline prices, have fed demand. Yet prices of
new cars, after rebates and other discounts, have stayed flat,
helping hold down overall inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Fierce competition has led companies to pass on to consumers
much of the recent savings from simpler designs. Gary Valade, an
executive vice president of DaimlerChrysler, predicted here that
discounting would remain high through the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The three-year national labor contracts of General Motors, Ford
Motor and DaimlerChrysler all expire on Sept. 14. A generation ago,
the expiration of labor contracts in a time of such prosperity
would have prompted the United Automobile Workers union to demand
higher wages and benefits, giving rise to worries at the White
House and on Wall Street about an inflationary spiral.
</P>
<P>
   But these days, the UAW is more worried about job security. The
union's top priority is to stop auto makers from asking nonunion
suppliers to build large chunks of vehicles, instead of just
shipping parts to be bolted together at unionized assembly plants.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the union holds the line, auto makers' costs would not
rise. They might not fall quickly either, but in any case the
effect is unlikely to be inflationary.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, to some extent the economy is doing well now because
the auto industry is prospering, rather than the other way around.
For all the attention that the growth of high-technology companies
has received, GM still produces 1.5 percent of the nation's output,
and Ford adds about 1 percent, the two largest roles played by any
companies in the American economy, according to the Commerce
Department.
</P>
<P>
   Even with GM's spinoff in May of Delphi Automotive Systems, an
auto parts company larger than the Intel Corp., GM remains eight
times the size of Microsoft. When a strike hurt GM in June and July
of last year, knocked 0.6 percent off the growth rate of the entire
American economy in both the second and third quarters.
</P>
<P>
   So brisk is demand now that auto factories across North America
are straining to meet it. Toyota's assembly plant in Cambridge,
Ontario, has increased the speed of its assembly line five times in
the last seven months and slowed it only once, in a constant effort
to meet demand for its Corolla and Solara cars, said Ray Tanguay,
Toyota's vice president for Canadian engineering, production
controls and information systems.
</P>
<P>
   To manage the extra speed, Toyota has had to figure out how to
pare further the mere 90 seconds that a Corolla, for example,
spends passing through each work area on the assembly line as
different parts are attached.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to say to the team leaders, O.K., now we have to take
two seconds out,'' Tanguay said. To help match production with
demand, Toyota hopes to start filling custom orders for specific
paint and options combinations on the Solara within five days.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody here was even talking about the possibility of a
recession. But the next downturn could be particularly severe if
Americans decide that their garages are full of vehicles that don't
need replacing because they are still running well after years of
use.
</P>
<P>
   The average age of American cars fell during previous economic
expansions as older cars were traded in, but cars have become so
dependable that their average age is climbing now by almost two
months each year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've worried about that for a long time,'' said Thomas Davis,
a GM group vice president, ``because they've been getting more
reliable for a long time.''

IRA DENIES ALLEGATIONS OF ULSTER PROTESTANTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)   (bl)  
 By JAMES F. CLARITY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN, Ireland _ The Irish Republican Army said Friday that it
was not responsible for two incidents that have led Protestant
officials in Ulster to call for the expulsion of Sinn Fein, the IRA
political wing, from the Northern Ireland Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   The two issues involved a gun-running operation between the
United States and Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic, and the
execution-style killing of a Roman Catholic man in Belfast last
week.
</P>
<P>
   The IRA has observed a cease-fire for two years. But the
political work of the Assembly has been blocked for more than a
year in a dispute over disarming the guerrillas and the
participation of Sinn Fein in a new Ulster Cabinet intended to give
Catholics additional political power in the predominantly
Protestant British province.
</P>
<P>
   In the spring of 1998, Sinn Fein was temporarily excluded from
the peace talks after the Irish and British governments had
concluded that the IRA had killed two civilians in Belfast.
</P>
<P>
   Sinn Fein insisted, as it always has, that it is separate from
the IRA, a position that few people believe. After Sinn Fein had
returned to the talks, a new peace agreement was reached in April
1998 and approved in referendums in the North and in the
overwhelmingly Catholic Irish Republic.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement read to Irish national radio Friday afternoon,
the IRA said that there had been ``no breaches of the IRA
cessation, which remains intact,'' adding, ``The army council has
not sanctioned any arms-importation operation.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., police charged four people,
three Britons and an Irishman, in connection with an attempt to
export to Ireland more than 40 handguns and several hundred rounds
of rifle ammunition. In Dublin, a woman from Western Ireland was
charged with illegal possession of six handguns and ammunition. The
suspects were later indicted.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts and officials in Belfast said acquiring new weapons
may be an attempt by the guerrilla command to show hard-liners
opposed to peace talks that it was preparing to resume the
sectarian warfare if the peace effort failed or if it were required
to get rid of some of its weapons as part of the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The IRA denial Friday seemed to be partly in response to a
front-page article in The Irish Times on Thursday that reported
that security officials and some republican insiders had said that
the guerrilla command was responsible for the handcufffing,
blindfolding and point-blank shooting in the head of Charles
Bennett, 22, a Catholic taxicab driver in Belfast. The Irish Times
reported that the motive may have been an attempt to please IRA
hard-liners, but also quoted some republicans as saying Bennett was
an informer, which the family denied.
</P>
<P>
   In its denial of any role for itself, the IRA did not say
whether the responsibility for Bennett's death might lie with
dissident guerrillas. On Aug. 15 last year, a splinter group, the
Real IRA, exploded a huge bomb in Omagh, killing 29 people, the
deadliest atrocity of the 30 years of sectarian warfare.

<P>
   SHOOTINGS-BARTON _ ATLANTA _ By the time Mark Barton wrote his
chillingly elegant confession, the demons that had haunted him
since childhood had finally consumed him. As a shy teenager, he
broke into a drug store and made his own hallucinogens. In
business, he undermined his own success, sabotaging a colleague's
work and referring to his first wife by the nickname ``Stupid.'' In
his final months, he killed his daughter's kitten, then helped her
search for it. Why Barton became Georgia's worst mass murderer may
never be known. But clues emerge from several critical points in
his life: his teenage years in South Carolina, his business success
and downfall in Texas, his response to his first wife's murder, and
his final months of rage and madness. ``He had no compassion,'' his
former secretary said, ``no compassion for anything or anybody -
except himself.'' (Judd,/Schneider/ Longa, Atlanta

Clinton said today before leaving the White House for a weekend

AMERICA ONLINE IS NO LONGER INVINCIBLE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 8) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For long-term holders, the recent slide in America Online's
stock price is nettlesome, but little more. After all, since 1992,
when the company went public, until April 6, when it reached a
closing high of $167.50, the stock had surged nearly 8,000 percent.
</P>
<P>
   People who bought the shares over the last few months, however,
might be more perturbed. The stock is off about 50 percent from its
peak and has helped to drag down the high-flying Internet sector.
</P>
<P>
   Since early April, TheStreet.com's Internet index, which
includes America Online, Yahoo and Amazon.com, is down more than 30
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Blodget, a senior analyst at Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., took
time last week to talk about America Online's current problems, its
prospects and the selloff among Internet stocks. Here are excerpts
from the conversation:
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Beyond profit-taking, are there fundamental reasons
people have been selling America Online stock?(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   A. The summer is a slow time for Internet stocks. Also, since
these stocks trade at such high price-to-earnings multiples, they
are very vulnerable to higher interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to those broad-based problems, AOL is faced with the
introduction of free Internet access in Europe as well as bundled
access, where companies are bundling personal computers and access
to the Internet for a single price. Finally, there is the broadband
issue and the threat posed by cable companies.
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)And Microsoft might offer either free access to the
Internet or access at a much-reduced rate. How serious a threat is
that?(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   A. It is potentially serious. America Online derives about 75
percent of its revenue from Internet access, and Microsoft can
afford to provide access much more cheaply because it is not their
core business. They will be prepared to do that because they want
to insure they have a role in the post-personal computer world. As
the most powerful technology company in the world, Microsoft
presumably could lose a significant amount of money to gain market
share.
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Could competition from Microsoft jeopardize America
Online's existence?(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   A. No, I am not concerned that AOL will be put out of business.
But the danger is that the new users they get as a result of this
battle with Microsoft will be less profitable for them than the
subscribers they have now.
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)When will these threats be addressed?(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   A. Over the next 6 to 12 months we will get a lot of clarity on
how America Online will work these things out. It is very possible
they will work out a deal with the cable companies. And it is very
possible they will trump Microsoft, as they did once before.
</P>
<P>
   That said, we have been increasingly cautious in the way we look
at America Online. Competitive issues have become more of a
concern. We still have the stock rated as a ``buy,'' but we are not
as optimistic as we were six months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Given the Internet selloff, is now a good time to
buy some of these stocks?(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   A. The first decision to make in investing in the Internet is
whether to invest directly or indirectly.
</P>
<P>
   For most investors, the best strategy is do to it indirectly
through companies like Cisco Systems, Microsoft and AT&AMP;T, companies
that are taking advantage of the Net, but are not involved
directly.
</P>
<P>
   For those who are aggressive and have a tolerance for the
volatility of direct investing in the Internet, we recommend they
hold a portfolio of the best companies and limit the exposure in
those to somewhere between 5 percent and 10 percent of their
overall portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)What sort of companies do you favor?(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   A. We think it makes sense to own companies in three areas:
business-to-consumer, infrastructure and business-to-business. The
Internet is going to be very big, but it is impossible to know
which companies are going to win. A well-balanced portfolio will
reduce dependence on the success of one.
</P>
<P>
   America Online, Yahoo and Amazon.com are some leaders in the
business-to-consumer category. Inktomi is a leader in
infrastructure. And Ariba is a leading company in
business-to-business.
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)The recent selloff has already started talk about
consolidation. Are some of these companies going to get picked
off?(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   A. There are too many competitors in the market right now, and
there will be a shakeout. In most market segments, there are at
least five or six players. We think the top two in each will
survive, but that the others are suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)America Online has seen its market capitalization
fall by about half in the last four months. Could it be a takeover
target?(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   A. Despite the decline, AOL's market cap is quite a bit bigger
than it was eight months ago. It has been a spectacular stock, even
with the pullback. It is still in a tremendously powerful position,
and there is no need for them to merge with someone else.

CLINTON CAMP TO `FOCUS ON ISSUES' DESPITE GOP MOVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCHESTER, N.Y. _ A spokesman for Hillary Rodham Clinton on
Friday dismissed moves by Gov. George Pataki to unify the
Republican Party to counter the first lady's potential Senate
campaign in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton wrapped up her latest ``listening tour'' in the state as
Pataki said he would urge Rep. Rick Lazio to abandon plans to
challenge New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani for the Republican
nomination for Senate in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the Republicans do or don't do is up to them,'' said
Harold Wolfson, the spokesman for Clinton's exploratory campaign.
``Mrs. Clinton is going to continue focusing on issues and
listening to New Yorkers.''
</P>
<P>
   Pataki, who has had strained relations with the mayor in the
past, said Giuliani had ``earned the right'' to be the Republican
Party's candidate for Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to win, the Republican Party must be unified behind
one strong candidate,'' Pataki said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans are intent on winning the seat held by Sen.
Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a Democrat who is retiring, after losing
the state's other Senate seat last year.
</P>
<P>
   The latest polls show Clinton and Giuliani in a statistical dead
heat, while Clinton would swamp Lazio, a Pataki ally from Long
Island.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio has in the past threatened to run as a Conservative Party
candidate if he fails to win the GOP nomination, which could
benefit Clinton by pulling Republican votes from Giuliani, were he
to win the party's primary.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, finishing a three-day swing through western New York,
vowed to continue her exploration of a Senate race for months to
come, and she voiced fond childhood memories of a late
step-grandfather who was Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time during her exploratory campaign, she talked
about Max Rosenberg, a Russian-born Jew who married Clinton's
divorced maternal grandmother, Della, in 1933, seven years after
her split from Clinton's maternal grandfather.
</P>
<P>
   New York City's tabloid newspapers splashed the revelation in
editions published Friday. Jews are an active Democratic political
constituency in New York, representing about 12 percent of the vote
in the 1998 Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have very fond childhood memories of my grandfather,''
Clinton recalled. ``He was not my biological grandfather; he was, I
guess you'd say, my step-grandfather. But I used to delight in
going to a place called Kiddieland with him, which was one of our
favorite outings together as a child.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, a Methodist who grew up in Oak Park, Ill., said in the
wake of publication of her family ties to a Jew _ first reported in
the Jewish newspaper The Forward _ ``It has been wonderful to
rethink all of those good memories.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosenberg died in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   In her would-be Senate campaign, Clinton continued to avoid
partisan clashes with state Republicans or specifics on a variety
of touchy issues in the state, including the impact of the North
American Free Trade Agreement, the launch of independent public
charter schools and the revival of college programs in state
prisons that were suspended by Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   Fielding questions from reporters at the conclusion of her
fourth campaign-style tour across New York, Clinton declined to
criticize Republican direct-mail efforts that use her candidacy as
a goad for contributions. She skirted an invitation by a reporter
to go after Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I'm not in a campaign yet,'' Clinton declared at
Rochester's School of the Arts, where she discussed the benefits of
Rochester's partnership between city schools and businesses to
prepare students for work. Clinton added: ``There'll be plenty of
time to talk about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said what will be important in ``this Senate race is who
has the best ideas and who can best implement ideas that would be
effective to help improve the lives of most New Yorkers.''
</P>
<P>
   The first lady insisted that she has not reached any decision on
a Senate candidacy, saying that she would continue crisscrossing
the state for months to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more time I spend doing this, the more enthusiastic and
encouraged I am,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   She is scheduled to return to New York on Monday and Tuesday to
plunge for the first time into inner-city neighborhoods, including
the southeast Queens congressional district once represented by
retired Rep. Floyd Flake, D-N.Y., a prominent leader in the
African-American community.

   _ When asked about the North American Free Trade Agreement, the
5-year-old trade pact between Canada, Mexico and the United States,
Clinton said she was generally in ``favor of what is called free
trade.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to know more about what would be effective ways to
promote trade and promote exports but not to the disadvantage of
our farmers or our manufacturers or our small business people or
our workers who depend upon those jobs,'' she said.

   Critics contend that the deal hurts American workers by sending
jobs to Mexico, where labor costs are substantially lower, and to
Canada, where the strong American dollar has more purchasing power.

carefully'' how the law is implemented that allows local
jurisdictions in New York to establish independent public schools.

DASCHLE DENIES TRYING TO PROD THE NEWS MEDIA TO INVESTIGATE BUSH

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senate Democratic Leader Thomas A. Daschle says he
wasn't trying to prod the news media to investigate Texas Gov.
George W. Bush when he complained that reporters don't press Bush
about whether he has used cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement elaborating on comments he made to reporters
Wednesday, Daschle said he was trying to express his view that the
news media have a double standard.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's not so acceptable is for the media to arbitrarily hold
one public figure to one standard of disclosure and another public
figure to a far higher or lower standard,'' Daschle's statement
said.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Daschle chided reporters for ``respecting far more
(Bush's) privacy and his lack of willingness to discuss his past
than you might have been with others.'' He complained that when
Bush says he has made unspecificed mistakes, ``it appears the media
seem to accept that as a fact and then (are) ready to move on.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Daschle said, the news media relentlessly
question Hillary Rodham Clinton about her private life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like every time she gets out there, somebody's asking
her private questions,'' Daschle said.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady is campaigning in New York state where she's
expected to announce her candidacy for a Senate seat.
</P>
<P>
   At the Wednesday meeting, a reporter asked Daschle whether it
was fair to ask political candidates whether they have used
cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   Daschle responded: ``Sure, it's a legitimate question. The
second question is, if that person denies it, how many press people
_ investigators _ do you put on his tail to find out whether he is
telling the truth?''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Bush has declined to say whether he has used
cocaine, an illegal drug. Typically, Bush puts an end to such
questions by saying he has ``learned from my mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   In his statement headlined ``Daschle Clarifies Comments'' about
Bush, the senator said it was ``absolutely appropriate and
acceptable for Gov. Bush to refuse to answer questions about his
past personal behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Daschle said it has become increasingly hard for the media and
for public figures to know where to draw the line between people's
public and personal lives. ``The standards are not clear, and they
frequently are not applied consistently,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, campaigning Friday in Rochester, N.Y., was asked
whether there's a double standard on media coverage of Bush's
personal life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what the standard is or should be,'' she said.
``Whatever it is, it should be applied, I would expect, evenly.''
</P>
<P>
   And she also lamented a lack of privacy in her own life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it serves our nation or our political process
well for people to have every shred of their privacy taken away
from them,'' she said. ``I don't think that's good and I'm speaking
as someone who's been through it.''

STUDY CONCLUDES RED WINE DOES NOT HURT IMMUNE SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Ill.)   (bl)  
 By KAREN VOYLES   
 The Gainesville (Fla.) Sun   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHIEFLAND, Fla. _ Susan Percival already has people lining up to
take the place of the mice in her experiments. The experiments
involving red wine. The ones that require drinking as much as two
to three glasses of wine a day.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from a chance to sip the ``fruit of the vine,'' Percival's
experiments have yielded an interesting finding: Red wine, in
moderation, does not suppress immune systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wouldn't believe the number of people who want to `help'
me,'' Percival said with a laugh. Percival, a food science and
human nutrition researcher at the University of Florida, started
off by getting her laboratory mice established as moderate
drinkers, consuming the equivalent of two to three glasses of an
alcoholic beverage a day.
</P>
<P>
   What Percival found out was that red wine did not suppress the
immune systems in laboratory mice, making it different from many
other alcoholic beverages that can lower immunity.
</P>
<P>
   For the past several years, study after study has shown that red
wine helps prevent coronary heart disease and some cancers, but
Percival could find no studies on how it affected disease-fighting
functions.
</P>
<P>
   That's why she spent eight weeks studying her four groups of
mice: teetotalers who drank only water, ethanol drinkers, muscadine
wine drinkers and cabernet sauvignon wine drinkers.
</P>
<P>
   After the mice had become moderate drinkers, they were given a
chemical that made them slightly ill for a couple of days with
cold-like symptoms to challenge their immune systems. Those that
drank the ethanol suffered a weakened immune system, while the mice
that drank wine had normal immune systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this shows is that there is something in the wine that
prevents suppression of the immune system,'' Percival said. ``But
remember, while there were no harmful effects on the immune system,
too much wine can have other harmful effects, like on the liver.''
</P>
<P>
   What's next for Percival is a closer look at how the liver
processed muscadine wine compared with how it processed the
cabernet sauvignon while detoxifying the alcohol. Her theory is
that because muscadine grapes have a greater concentration of
antioxidants, it may offer humans more protection.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier research on wine includes a University of Illinois study
that found the skin of grapes works to block carcinogens, a Swiss
study that found that drinking wine with a high-fat meal may
minimize artery damage, and French research that suggests it also
may cut the risk of Alzheimer's disease.

FORD HOPING ITS EXCURSION WILL SUPPLANT SUBURBAN AS NATIONAL CAR OF
TEXAS
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanied by CARS-GLANCE) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Call it the Suburban-buster.
</P>
<P>
   That's what Ford wants Texans and other fans of the venerable
General Motors full-size sport-utility vehicle to think about the
new 2000 Ford Excursion.
</P>
<P>
   At 7.2 inches longer, 3.3 inches wider and 4.3 to 5.8 inches
taller than the Chevrolet/GMC Suburban, the Excursion is the first
sport-utility vehicle that fits into the Suburban's class, a market
segment that General Motors has owned for decades.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the Ford Expedition, introduced two years ago, has offered
some competition to the Suburban, but its size pitted it more
against the Chevy Tahoe/GMC Yukon than the Suburban. Those two
vehicles are just shorter versions of the Suburban, and the only
major difference between the Tahoe/Yukon and the Expedition has
been the availability of a third seat in the Expedition.
</P>
<P>
   But the Excursion is designed as a true Suburban competitor,
appealing to the ``bigger-is-better'' Texas culture that has long
made the Suburban the darling of the Lone Star State.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt about it, the Excursion is bigger than the Suburban.
It's a real hoss. Not only are its dimensions larger than the
Suburban, but it's also 2,000 pounds or more heavier.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's short enough _ at 226.7 inches or just under 19 feet
_ to fit in a standard residential garage, Ford officials say.
That's the first question most people asked me during my week-long
test drive of the Excursion, right before they asked me about the
gas mileage. Ford says the diesel engine has the best fuel economy
at 15 miles per gallon in the city and 18 on the highway. Expect
about 10 mpg city/13 highway for the optional V-10 gasoline engine,
or 12 city/15 highway for the base V-8.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't actually try to put the Excursion in my garage _
there's too much junk in there. But I parallel-parked it a few
times in downtown Fort Worth, and it did fit in a standard parking
space _ just barely.
</P>
<P>
   It's low enough for downtown parking garages, too. Never did the
roof of the Excursion hit one of those bars that hang down on
chains at parking garage entrances to let you know your vehicle is
too tall.
</P>
<P>
   All during my week's drive, the Excursion drew the crowds,
something I expected here in Texas, where General Motors sells 40
percent of the Suburbans it produces.
</P>
<P>
   Suburban owners were curious but a bit skeptical. After all,
they are a loyal lot. One longtime Suburban owner who went for a
drive with me in the Excursion found a lot to like about this
behemoth, except for the ride. ``It's a lot rougher than my
Suburban,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Excursion also drew hordes of truck fans who wanted to see
this vehicle that is challenging the almost-official car of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   At Taco Bell, a group of teen-age boys fell in love with the
Excursion, looking over every inch, opening the doors, sitting in
the front, middle and rear seats, and checking out the cargo
compartment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coooooool!!!'' was their collective assessment.
</P>
<P>
   Ford marketing folks aren't naive enough to believe that the
Excursion will knock the Suburban out of first place in the
full-size SUV class. The company plans to build just 60,000 of them
a year. GM sells three times as many Suburbans.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ford believes that some sales will come from current or
former Suburban owners, the biggest market for Excursions will be
owners of other Ford sport-utilities who want something bigger and
heavier, especially for towing large trailers. With the largest
engines available in the class _ a 6.8-liter gasoline V-10 and a
7.3-liter diesel V-8 _ the Excursion can pull trailers of up to
10,000 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   That's not enough to beat the current 2500-size Suburban, which
also can tow up to 10,000 pounds, but it is 2,000 pounds more than
the Expedition can tow. In Texas, horse trailers and campers tend
to be very heavy, and the Excursion should be able to handle them
with ease.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the third seat in place, the Excursion has 48 cubic
feet of cargo area. The capacity increases to a 100.7 cubic feet
when the seat is removed. The seat folds up and unhooks from the
floor easily, and is on rollers so it can be readily removed from
the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Removing the third seat and folding the second seat forward
creates a 146.4 cubic-foot cargo area that has a flat floor capable
of holding a standard sheet of plywood (4 by 8 feet) with the back
doors closed.
</P>
<P>
   Visibility to the rear is better than the Suburban with the
double rear cargo doors, thanks to the Excursion's flip-up rear
glass hatch combined with lower Dutch doors. The liftgate can be
raised for simple loading and unloading of groceries. The Dutch
doors, below the liftgate, can be opened for full access to the
cargo area. The doors, an arrangement similar to that of the Chevy
Astro van, are light because they are made of composite plastic,
the only plastic body panels on the Excursion.
</P>
<P>
   Getting into and out of the rear seating area is easier in the
Excursion than the Suburban, primarily because the rear doors are
5.5 inches longer than the Suburban's.
</P>
<P>
   The base engine is a 5.4-liter V-8 rated at 255 horsepower and
350 foot-pounds of torque. The V-10 engine raises that to 310
horsepower and 425 foot-pounds of torque, while the turbocharged
Power Stroke diesel ffers 235 horsepower and an unbelievable 500
foot-pounds of torque.
</P>
<P>
   Part-time, shift-on-the-fly four-wheel drive is standard with
the V-10 engine, but optional with the V-8 gas or diesel engines.
All Excursions come with a heavy-duty four-speed automatic
transmission with overdrive.
</P>
<P>
   Four-wheel disc brakes, with a four-wheel antilock system, is
standard on all Excursions. All of them also come with dual front
and rear air-conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   The cabin of the Excursion is quiet, which is a real
accomplishment for what is just a big, enclosed super duty Ford
pickup truck.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on the trim level selected, the Excursion's interior
ranges from functional to quite luxurious.
</P>
<P>
   The base two-wheel-drive XLT model, listing for $34,135
(including $675 transportation), comes with cloth interior and a
whole load of standard equipment, including power windows and door
locks and the 5.4-liter V-8. That price is $3,840 more than a
comparably-equipped Expedition, $242 more than the Suburban 1500,
and $1,206 less than the heavier Suburban 2500.
</P>
<P>
   The uplevel model, called the Limited, carries a base price of
$37,775 (two-wheel drive), which is $2,142 more than the comparable
Suburban 1500 LT, but just $694 more than the Suburban 2500 LT.
</P>
<P>
   Four-wheel-drive Excursions range from $37,450 to $40,880 (base
price). That's $377 less than Suburban for the entry-level model,
or $1,303 higher than Suburban for the fancier Limited version.
</P>
<P>
   Showroom-equipped Excursions _ with the most popular options
tacked on _ range from $36,580 for a two-wheel-drive XLT to $41,915
for a four-wheel-drive Limited.
</P>
<P>
   Driving the Excursions is a pleasure. Behind the wheel, they
don't feel as big as they look, and they are rather nimble in turns
for such large trucks _ just about any size driver could handle one
easily. There is ample power even with the base V-8 gasoline
engine, and if fuel-economy is important, the diesel offers the
best numbers while still providing plenty of power.
</P>
<P>
   For safety's sake, the Excursion offers the first system for a
sport-utility vehicle to protect against running over smaller cars
in a rear-end collision. The so-called Blocker Beam, a 50-pound
steel bar running across the vehicle under the front bumper, is
designed to prevent the Excursion from sliding over a car in front.
At the rear, the standard under-bumper trailer hitch is designed to
prevent a car from sliding under the Excursion if it hits the truck
from the rear.
</P>
<P>
   The fuel tank, mounted behind the rear axle, holds 44 gallons,
so even with poor gas mileage, the Excursion has good range.
</P>
<P>
   The official on-sale date is Sept. 30, but the first Excursions
began rolling off Ford assembly lines in late July. As soon as they
begin arriving at dealerships, they will be available for sale.
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect discounts anytime soon. Ford officials predict that
the trucks will bring full retail sticker price at least until
dealers are well-stocked, probably late next spring or early
summer.

<P>
   At the Wednesday meeting, a reporter asked Daschle whether it
was fair to ask political candidates whether they have used
cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   Daschle responded: ``Sure, it's a legitimate question. The
second question is, if that person denies it, how many press people
_ investigators _ do you put on his tail to find out whether he is
telling the truth?''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Bush has declined to say whether he has used
cocaine, an illegal drug. Typically, Bush puts an end to such
questions by saying he has ``learned from my mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   In his statement headlined ``Daschle Clarifies Comments'' about
Bush, the senator said it was ``absolutely appropriate and
acceptable for Gov. Bush to refuse to answer questions about his
past personal behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Daschle said it has become increasingly hard for the media and
for public figures to know where to draw the line between people's
public and personal lives. ``The standards are not clear, and they
frequently are not applied consistently,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, campaigning Friday in Rochester, N.Y., was asked
whether there's a double standard on media coverage of Bush's
personal life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what the standard is or should be,'' she said.
``Whatever it is, it should be applied, I would expect, evenly.''
</P>
<P>
   And she also lamented a lack of privacy in her own life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it serves our nation or our political process
well for people to have every shred of their privacy taken away
from them,'' she said. ``I don't think that's good and I'm speaking
as someone who's been through it.''

SANTA FE OPERA: A STRIKING NEW DESIGN FOR POULENC'S NUNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ANTHONY TOMMASINI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA FE, N.M. _ The Santa Fe Opera, now in its 43rd summer
season, regularly draws over half of its audience from out of
state. The quality of the productions is usually high. But what
particularly brings visitors is the company's spectacular open-air
theater in the mountains north of the city, and its commitment to
unusual repertory. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The 2,100-seat, acoustically impressive theater has gone through
some recent renovations, including, this summer, a new Electronic
Libretto System. Mounted on strips running across the back of each
row, the system is virtually identical to the one introduced at the
Metropolitan Opera in 1995. Indeed, the same team of engineers were
responsible for it.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of innovative repertory choices, Santa Fe regulars have
come to expect more of this company. Among the 116 operas presented
here in total, 9 have been world premieres and 39 others have been
American premieres. This summer's offerings are not particularly
adventurous: new productions of Bizet's ``Carmen'' and Mozart's
``Idomeneo;'' revivals of Strauss' ``Ariadne auf Naxos'' and
Emmerich Kalman's Viennese cream puff of an operetta ``Countess
Maritza.'' The most interesting is a new production of Poulenc's
``Dialogues of the Carmelites'' directed by the provocative
Francesca Zambello. The talented American director's productions
are always newsworthy. This one, which I attended Wednesday night,
finds her in strong form.
</P>
<P>
   Poulenc's 1957 opera is based on a true incident involving a
convent of Carmelite nuns in Paris who were executed during the
French Revolution. If Ms. Zambello's many critics were expecting
her to update the story, muddle it with symbolism or uncover some
psychosexual subtext, they have been disappointed. This is a humane
and historically sensitive production. Alison Chitty's set is not
its strong point.
</P>
<P>
   A tall, thick wall that can be spun around dominates the stage.
One side represents the world of the aristocratic Marquis de la
Force, the other takes us to the cloistered domain of the nuns:
their convent, their chapel and, eventually, the prison in which
they are condemned. The design concept is strong, but the wall
itself is a cumbersome, drab thing that leaves the singers little
room at times for movement. Ms. Chitty's costumes, however, are
perfect, especially the plain burlap brown robes of the nuns.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Zambello has received so much criticism for her staging
concepts that her excellence as a director of singers is often
overlooked. She draws full-dimensional and affecting performances
from her cast, none more so than the Blanche of the soprano
Patricia Racette.
</P>
<P>
   Some admirers of this opera may find Ms. Racette's
interpretation too large-scale and tempestuous. Blanche is usually
presented as a young, over-protected, painfully timid aristocratic
woman who seeks the convent as a refuge from her own life and the
crazed times she lives in. But Ms. Racette's gleaming voice and
dramatic intensity reveal the force of the inner demons that drive
Blanche to the convent. And you believe that among her sisters she
truly finds the solidarity to heroically embrace martyrdom.
</P>
<P>
   The contralto Sheila Nadler, as the old, informed prioress of
the convent, gave an unforgettable portrayal of a woman who
preaches firmness, moral judgment and acceptance of God's will in
life, but succumbs to blank fear, doubt and self-pity in the face
of harrowing illness and death. The fine young soprano Christine
Goerke summoned her lustrous voice and quietly commanding stage
presence for her portrayal of Madame Lidoine, who provides sureness
and spiritual calm to the sisters after the shockingly undignified
death of the prioress. And the soprano Lynette Tapia was beguiling
as the chatterbox Sister Constance, who beneath her girlish
cheerfulness possesses a simple wisdom that inspires her sisters to
courage. Judith Christin as the martyrdom-fixated Mother Marie, who
paradoxically escapes death herself, and Richard Stilwell as
Blanche's father, the Marquis, were also effective. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The one serious miscalculation in Ms. Zambello's work was her
decision to let the audience witness the actual executions by
guillotine of the 15 nuns. The libretto specifies that as the
Carmelites are marched one by one into the Place de la Revolution,
the audience sees them climb the scaffold, then disappear into the
darkness downstage. Their beheadings are represented musically,
however, in the horrific slicing orchestral chords that keep
interrupting the sisters' brave singing of the ``Salve Regina'' in
Poulenc's tender setting.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Ms. Zambello gives us an ineffective stage trick: we
see the heads of the nuns supposedly falling into a large basket.
All this does is distract our attention from the powerful music as
the ``Salve Regina'' is sung first by 15, then 14, then 13, voices
and so on, until only Constance's voice is left alone.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The French conductor Stephane Deneve, in his American debut, led
a supple, vividly characterized performance that did not wallow in
the music's religiosity. For all its beauty, this is a passionate
and, at times, violent score, and Deneve conducted it that way. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Santa Fe Opera first presented Kalman's ``Countess Maritza''
in 1995. This revival was back, apparently, by popular demand, and
the audience on Tuesday seemed to have a whopping good time.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I didn't share in it. The operetta is a piece of fluffy
silliness with a few catchy tunes. The story, set in Hungary, is
just a conceit: a wealthy, sought-after countess falls in love with
an impoverished count who is working incognito as her estate
manager to support his younger sister. If presented with wry wit or
comic restraint, this 1924 work could possibly come across as an
amusing, stylish remnant of a bygone era.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the director Daniel Pelzig encouraged all manner of
overacting, prankish antics and inanity. At one point, a chorus
line of Hungarian cabaret cuties, as they are called, come out to
dance and sing. Inexplicably they all start clicking their tongues,
like Anita in ``West Side Story'' singing ``Puer-r-r-r-r-to
R-r-r-r-ico.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The score was conducted spiritedly by John Crosby, the company's
founder. Sheri Greenawald tried to maintain some dignity as the
Countess. Two tenors, Kevin Anderson as the impoverished count and
Gert Henning-Jensen as a lusty Hungarian baron, were impressively
nimble at the leg-splits and leaps they were called upon to
execute.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But all in all, this vestige of musical theater from Vienna in
1924 just made the vitality of what was happening on Broadway at
that time seem all the more wondrous: Gershwin's ``Lady Be Good,''
Youmans' ``No, No Nanette,'' and Rodgers' ``Melody Man.'' I'll take
Manhattan. &QL;

`INTIMATE PORTRAIT': RECALLING WHEN BETTY FRIEDAN WAS OPENING
MINDS  
 `MODELS UNCOVERED': THE SEAMIER SIDE OF THE MODELING INDUSTRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: production notes at end of `Intimate Portrait' review)  
 (bl)  
 By ANITA GATES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's something depressing about having Joan Lunden, in all
her blond morning-television perkiness, introduce the life story of
Betty Friedan, the original, serious ``don't-call-us-girls''-era
feminist.
</P>
<P>
   But this is Lifetime's ``Intimate Portrait'' series, not known
for its depth or stunning insights. Normally the series is not
known for featuring particularly important women either; next week,
for instance, Lifetime viewers will have a chance to see ``Intimate
Portrait: Kelly Preston.'' Ms. Friedan is the subject Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Friedan, says Ms. Lunden, is a ``great American who made it
possible for me and all women to participate in the mainstream of
life.'' Ms. Friedan, now in her late 70s, concludes ``I've used my
life very well'' and says she has learned to ``use even the pain,
the setbacks, the mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   She began life as Betty Naomi Goldstein, a jeweler's daughter in
Peoria, Ill., who was, in her own words, ``often miserable at
home'' and couldn't wait to leave there every day and get to
school. She skipped two grades, went off to Smith College in 1938
and to graduate school at the University of California at Berkeley
four years later. Afterward she worked as a reporter, met and
married Carl Friedan and found herself dismissed from her job in
1952 because she was pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   That experience alone did not turn her into a feminist. But
later a Smith class reunion did, one at which all those well-bred,
well-educated Seven Sisters alumnae, it seemed, could talk about
nothing but baby formula and diapers. Ms. Friedan's horror at that
turned into a questionnaire, which turned into a magazine article
that nobody wanted to publish, which turned into a 1963 book ``The
Feminine Mystique.'' And nothing for American women _ or men _ has
been quite the same since.
</P>
<P>
   It's too bad that ``Intimate Portrait: Betty Friedan'' can't
convey that impact more forcefully. The documentary turns into
little more than a list, illustrated with old film clips, of
accomplishments and causes: the founding of the National
Organization for Women, the women's march in 1970, the striking
down of anti-abortion laws in 1973, the losing battle to ratify the
Equal Rights Amendment and the publication of three more books.
Early on, she also got a divorce.
</P>
<P>
   The most personal revelations are that Ms. Friedan never liked
her looks (``I wasn't at all pretty'') and that she's an
incorrigible flirt.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Things could have been worse for Betty Friedan. She could have
been born dazzlingly beautiful and been forced to endure the
agonies of being a supermodel.
</P>
<P>
   In this documentary, originally done for Channel 4 in London,
Christy Turlington says beauty is ``a gift and a curse.''
</P>
<P>
   Cindy Crawford acknowledges that the modeling business is ``a
little shady.'' Lauren Hutton declares, ``You're a moron to let a
15-year-old go into the business.'' And Anna Wintour, editor in
chief of Vogue, asked whether she would want her daughter to become
a model, says, ``I would do everything in my power to stop her.''
</P>
<P>
   The dangers seem to be drugs, too much freedom and lechers in
the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   Management comes off as openly sleazy in this film. It doesn't
help that John Casablancas, of Elite Model Management, is
interviewed while holding a glass of white wine in the back of a
limousine and F. David Mogull, who heads something called Model
Search America, in a hot tub. The only person who comes off worse
is the model Naomi Campbell; ``out of control'' is one of the nicer
descriptions of her.
</P>
<P>
   The show exudes its own sleaze at times (ogling as it condemns
ogling) but is often fascinating in spite of itself. One of its
finest scenes is of a mod, mod 1960s young blond woman solemnly
demonstrating how to get into a sports car in a miniskirt.
Remember?

NO GOLDBRICKING FOR GORDON AT BRICKYARD 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also CAR-NASCAR-IRWIN)

<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Jeff Gordon said he was surprised. Why, no one
knows.
</P>
<P>
   Simply put, Gordon owns Indy. On Thursday, he won the pole for
Saturday's Brickyard 400 with a record speed of 179.612 mph,
bettering Ernie Irvan's time of 179.394 mph run last year.
</P>
<P>
   It was Gordon's third pole in six races here. He has also
qualified third twice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to give a lot of credit to the guys on this race team
because I didn't feel like it was my best lap as a driver,'' Gordon
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went into one really hard and the front end slid up on me a
little bit. After that, I was a little more prepared for the other
three corners,'' Gordon said.
</P>
<P>
   Behind Gordon's Chevy were Mark Martin (Ford), 178.941 mph, and
surprising David Green (Chevy), 178.902 mph. Dale Jarrett (Ford),
the current Winston Cup points leader, was fourth at 178.859 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Martin ended up missing most of the afternoon practice when he
and Rusty Wallace collided in the pit area, damaging both cars.
</P>
<P>
   Neither driver had to go to a backup, though.
</P>
<P>
   Martin had this to say about Gordon: ``He's a better driver than
most of us if not all of us and he drives a better car than most of
us if not all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming from a guy like Mark, that means a lot,'' Gordon said.
``I personally think he's the best out there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know who the best driver is,'' Gordon said. ``It's
hard to make that evaluation unless you drive their race car. I
think it's whoever has the best combination, a driver who can feed
information back to the team so they can work with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of great drivers feel what the car's doing,'' Gordon
said, ``but they can't relay it back to the team.''
</P>
<P>
   While Gordon's performance didn't surprise anyone, Green's did.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say we needed this would probably be an understatement,''
Green said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been headed in the right direction, but we always seem
to hit a roadblock. We've had to regroup as a team, and I'm proud
of my guys for doing that.''

IRWIN SHOULD BURN RUBBER, NOT STRETCH IT 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also CAR-NASCAR-GORDON) 
(mk) 
 By PATRICK ZIER   
 The Ledger, Lakeland, Fla.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ It is like a rubber band being stretched to the
breaking point.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship between Kenny Irwin and his car owner, Robert
Yates, is obviously strained. Irwin's status has been in doubt
almost from the beginning of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to make this work, we're trying to stay focused on
making it work,'' Yates said while getting ready for Saturday's
Brickyard 400.
</P>
<P>
   ``Still,'' he added, ``at some point, we all know you have to
perform.''
</P>
<P>
   And right now, this car is not producing at a level that is
acceptable to Yates.
</P>
<P>
   It is also true that Irwin's Ford is, potentially, the most
attractive ride available for next year. Few think Irwin will be
back, but how seriously Yates has been looking for a replacement is
open to question.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, Terry Labonte was linked to Yates. Both denied they
had even talked. Labonte had a contract with Rick Hendrick through
2000, and Chevy and Hendrick moved quickly to extend it.
</P>
<P>
   Here at Indy, the names most mentioned as possible replacements
for Irwin are John Andretti and Ricky Rudd. It is almost certain
Andretti and Rudd have had preliminary conversations with Yates,
although no one will say as much.
</P>
<P>
   Andretti said he and his car owner, Richard Petty, have talked
and that he plans on returning to Petty Enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had some discussions about next year and I feel like
I'll be back unless they kick me out,'' Andretti, 36, said. ``I've
never left a team on the upswing, and I feel like things are
starting to come together here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to go someplace and have to start all over again.
I'm getting too old for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, while not confirming that he and Yates had met, Andretti
said, ``I'll talk to anybody. I talk to a lot of people.''
</P>
<P>
   Doug Yates, Robert's son, commented on Andretti's situation,
saying, ``I think he is comfortable where he's at.''
</P>
<P>
   Rudd, who is 42, could be a more viable candidate. He is losing
his sponsor and looking for another.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I'm trying to put something together to keep my
team,'' Rudd said. ``We had a sponsor ready to go, but we turned it
down because it wasn't enough money. I'm not going to do something
unless we have the money to do it right.''
</P>
<P>
   Rudd has set a mid-September deadline to work out a deal. If he
doesn't come up with one, he probably will shut down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've talked with some owners, and there's a possibility I
could end up driving for somebody else, but that's not my first
choice,'' Rudd said.
</P>
<P>
   As for Yates, Rudd said he hadn't talked to Robert Yates. ``But
he does have a son named Doug,'' Rudd added.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Irwin, who had his 30th birthday on Thursday, is just
trying to get through it all.
</P>
<P>
   He said that he had talked to Robert Yates during tests at Indy.
``Nothing was discussed about what we were going to change, if I
was gonna change or if he wanted to make a change,'' Irwin said.

CROSS-STITCHING CAN BENEFIT FROM A LITTLE COMPUTER-AIDED DESIGN  
 DRIVING GAME ZOOMS TO THE TOP

   For cross-stitchers, patterns are plentiful, but they're not
always what one might want. The collie in the pattern book may not
look exactly like the one at home. The little Hummel-like girl may
not look like the daughter who lives with the collie, either.
Perhaps you'd like to cross-stitch their likeness instead.
</P>
<P>
   It's not so difficult. With a computer, scanner or digital
camera, and a software program from M&AMP;R Technologies, photos can be
converted into patterns for cross-stitch.
</P>
<P>
   PCStitch (Windows; about $50-$60) has been around for 10 years,
long enough to be refined into Version 5, the one recently released
by the Ohio-based company. ``We designed PCStitch to be as simple
and easy-to-use as possible,'' said Mark Miller, M&AMP;R president.
``With each new version, we added more features, but PCStitch is
still one of the easiest craft programs on the market.''
</P>
<P>
   If you can scan pictures into the computer to use in e-mail or
greeting cards, you'll have no problem bringing images into
PCStitch. The program also has a built-in drawing program for users
who want to start from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   Once in the computer, the design can be handled just like a
picture: It can be enlarged, cropped and colors altered. Text can
also be added.
</P>
<P>
   Size is not a problem, either. The program can produce a
cross-stitch pattern up to 999-by-999 stitches. How fine the detail
of the finished product is depends on the number of colors
specified for the final output. For a simple picture, a few colors
may do. For a detailed landscape or portrait, a higher number of
colors may be needed. Up to a maximum of 150 floss colors can be
used.
</P>
<P>
   The program supports images stored in .BMP, .PCX, .JPG, .WMF, or
Kodak Photo CD formats.
</P>
<P>
   There are nearly 500 floss colors corresponding to floss colors
from Anchor, DMC and J&AMP;P Coats.
</P>
<P>
   The new version gives users the ability to print a design on one
page, complex designs can also be enlarged and printed on several
pages, then glued together, for easier use.
</P>
<P>
   A demo version of the product can downloaded from the company's
Web site (www.pcstitch.com). It can be purchased from the site, or
stores handling software. Hobby and craft stores may also carry it.
</P>
<P>
   For information: 1-800-800-8517.

<P>
   DRIVING GAME ZOOMS TO THE TOP
</P>
<P>
   Driver, a driving game from GT Interactive Software Corp. for
the Sony Playstation, has sold 1 million copies in the first month
it has been on the shelves, a company spokesman said last week.
It's also at or near the top of titles for rent.
</P>
<P>
   A computer version of the game is scheduled for release in
September.

SMALL TEXAS TOWN TO LOSE BIGGEST INDUSTRY, JUSTIN BOOT FACTORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BARRY SHLACHTER 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NOCONA, Texas _ ``I was `Given the Boot' at Nocona Boot'' read
little white lapel stickers that brought brief smiles yesterday to
the faces of some of the 160 boot company employees who were told
their jobs are gone.
</P>
<P>
   After hanging on through the booms and busts of a fickle cowboy
boot market, through two layoffs of 40 employees each, and years of
downsizing through attrition, the surviving boot makers of Nocona
are smiling through their tears. But their eyes are moister than
their grins are large.
</P>
<P>
   Justin Industries' decision to close the Nocona Boot Co. and
shift its production to Justin plants in El Paso and Missouri was a
double whammy for 40 of the workers who are employed couples here _
a triple whammy if they factor in a likely drop in home values,
said Liz Buck, 57, a plant supervisor who is herself married to a
co-worker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Six are married in my department alone,'' said Buck, who has
30 years under her belt at Nocona. ``It's been family. Now we're
devastated, just devastated.''
</P>
<P>
   She was handed a shoe box stuffed with money. It was to buy
flowers and food for an employee whose husband, a fellow worker,
died of cancer yesterday, the day after she lost her job at the
boot plant.
</P>
<P>
   Each department in the plant is closing as soon at it finishes
work on its current orders, and the whole plant is expected to be
shut down within six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The town is in mourning as if for a universally loved figure who
was always there for the community. Now the residents are not quite
certain how to respond.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Gene Fitzgerald immediately withdrew a draft city budget,
knowing that the town's biggest taxpayer (13.4 percent of the tax
base) won't be easily replaced. The plant's tax appraisal is $8
million, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we're not alone,'' Fitzgerald said. ``The county, the
schools and the hospital district are also going to be hurt
badly.''
</P>
<P>
   Nocona Boot Co., formed in 1925 after Enid Justin's three
brothers moved the H.J. Justin &AMP; Sons boot company to Fort Worth
for land and tax breaks, is the biggest employer and a landmark in
this North Texas town of 3,000.
</P>
<P>
   Its closing is equivalent to Fort Worth's losing 26,000 jobs _
the work forces of Lockheed Martin, Tandy Corp., Bell Helicopter
and Burlington Northern Santa Fe combined.
</P>
<P>
   Nocona's next largest employer is Nocona Athletic Goods, one of
the few remaining domestic makers of baseball gloves, which is
thriving with 100 employees. The third is Nocona Belt Co., which
recently changed hands and employs 85 people. Neither is likely to
absorb many of the laid-off boot makers, said Ricky D. Howard,
president of Nocona Banking Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``The town is not going to dry up and blow away,'' said Howard,
who predicted a gradual recovery.
</P>
<P>
   But the banker doesn't discount the psychological impact of the
boot plant's closing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sad thing, apart from the loss of jobs, is that it was
kind of our identity,'' Howard said.
</P>
<P>
   One thing for sure, as Howard and countless others said in
practically identical words, ``Miss Enid is rolling in her grave
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Miss Enid'' Justin was a strong-willed 6-footer who deeply
resented her brothers' closing the Nocona plant their father had
built. She learned the boot making business at his side after being
suspended from seventh grade for dancing at a party and never
returning to school. Though married, she borrowed $5,000 in her own
name, rented machinery and hired back skilled employees. She cooked
meals for oilfield workers and sold coal and washing machines to
help carry the firm through its early years.
</P>
<P>
   In those hardscrabble times, Justin drove a Model T into oil
boom towns, taking orders from roughnecks for boots tough enough to
last. ``I out-sold all my competitors and I wouldn't stop until the
factory had enough orders,'' she said in her 1985 autobiography,
``Miss Enid: The Texas Lady Bootmaker.''
</P>
<P>
   Employees recall a larger-than-life woman who could swear like a
sailor on the shop floor and uncannily collect debts from the
hardest accounts. Yet she was generous and inspired extreme loyalty
from employees. There were parties for their children and Christmas
bonuses. To generations of Nocona residents, she was the ``Cracker
Jack lady'' for the boxed treats she gave out each Halloween from
her large pink house, which matched her trademark pink Cadillacs.
</P>
<P>
   She wouldn't abide cohabiting by members of the opposite sex
before marriage, recalled Clara Beth ``Yankee'' Speights, 68, a
retired boot maker married to a current employee. ``They had to get
married or they didn't have a job,'' Speights said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, Enid Justin agreed to merge her firm with Justin Boots,
then changed her mind, said John Justin, her nephew, who ran the
Fort Worth firm at the time. ``She backed out and there was quite a
rhubarb, but we finally won in the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Using a wheelchair, she continued to visit the Nocona plant
after her retirement in 1982 at age 88. She died in 1990, aged 96.
</P>
<P>
   ``Miss Enid would be totally shocked if she learned this boot
company was closing,'' said Weldon Parr, 61, a 35-year employee who
minds a stockroom of exotic skins ranging from anteater to
stingray.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just glad she's not around to see it.''

WORSHIP AT ST. PAUL'S DEFIES DOUBTS ABOUT CHURCH OF ENGLAND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM JONES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Religion is not dead, not even dying, in England. At
least it did not appear that way to me on a recent Sunday at St.
Paul's Cathedral in the heart of London.
</P>
<P>
   When the large congregation from around the world began singing
``Angel voices ever singing 'round the throne of light,'' I felt as
if I were being lifted high into the lofty dome of the storied
church.
</P>
<P>
   The magnificence of the surroundings and the swelling sounds of
the pipe organ first installed in 1695 may have contributed to my
euphoria.
</P>
<P>
   I was among the first arrivals for the 11 a.m. service. At first
I was a little chagrined that I was an hour early. But that meant
that I would be seated up front almost directly under the richly
decorated dome 366 feet above me. The church is the masterpiece of
Sir Christopher Wren, England's most celebrated architect.
</P>
<P>
   Above me were frescoes showing Adam and Eve being expelled from
paradise and winged angels celebrating the birth of Jesus Christ.
</P>
<P>
   I had already been introduced to Wren's artistry. During
nighttime walks by the many ancient buildings of Oxford University,
I often passed the Sheldonian Theatre, another of Wren's
masterpieces.
</P>
<P>
   Wren was commissioned to rebuild St. Paul's after it was
destroyed by the Great Fire of London in 1666. Directly in front of
where I was seated, Wren's epitaph was inscribed in Latin on the
marble floor. It states: ``Beneath lies buried the founder of this
church and city, Christopher Wren, who lived more than 90 years not
for himself but for the public good. Reader, if you seek his
monument, look around you.''
</P>
<P>
   My arrival at St. Paul's also meant I had time to visit with
some people around me. A woman from Venezuela, Gladys Pinto, kept
looking back over the crowd searching for her husband, Ovideo.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, he arrived and she broke into a bright smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were looking for a Catholic church but could not find
one,'' she told me.
</P>
<P>
   They were worshipping in a cathedral of the Church of England,
the mother church of the worldwide Anglican Communion, which
includes the Episcopal Church in the United States. The Church of
England was born in the 1500s, when it separated from the Roman
Catholic Church under Henry VIII.
</P>
<P>
   The Pintos were not disappointed. The pageantry of the service
was enough to satisfy most Roman Catholics. Amid the grandeur of
the cathedral and its music, the clergy, dressed in crimson and
white, were led to the front of the cathedral by the bearer of a
huge golden crucifix.
</P>
<P>
   The Vicars Chorale sang ``''gloria in excelsis'''' and the
Nicene Creed in Latin.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting next to me was Pat Christie, a Londoner who said she
attends St. Paul's each Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such a privilege to worship here,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A Christian church founded by early Roman Catholic missionaries
has been on the site of St. Paul's since A.D. 604. But despite
England's impressive religious heritage, some clergy are worried
about the future of Christianity in this country.
</P>
<P>
   The Right Rev. Richard Harries, bishop of the Diocese of Oxford,
said in a recent address that the church is stagnating. Although
religious practice is increasing in Africa and many other parts of
the world, the reverse is true in England, the bishop said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are faced with a missionary situation in Western Europe as
challenging as any that has faced the Christian church in its
history,'' he said. ``We will need to discover wholly new ways of
trying to connect with people physically, culturally.''
</P>
<P>
   He is encouraging leaders of the Church of England to adopt a
new strategy for evangelism that will be considered in June 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Although the crisis may be real, I have every faith that
England, which has faced many crises in its long history, will meet
the challenge.
</P>
<P>
   And I believe that the stupendous worship experiences will
continue at St. Paul's Cathedral each Sunday as they've done for
the past 1,396 years.

PRIMO LEVI'S PLUNGE: A CASE AGAINST SUICIDE 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By DIEGO GAMBETTA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sometime after 10 a.m. on Saturday, April 11, 1987, on the
fourth floor of a late-19th-century building in Turin, the
concierge rang the doorbell of Primo Levi's apartment. Levi, who
was born in that apartment 67 years earlier, opened the door and
collected his mail, just as he did every day. He smiled, thanked
her and closed the door. The concierge descended the spiral
staircase, occupied in the middle by a caged elevator. She had
barely reached her cubicle on the ground floor, she later told the
police, when she heard Levi's body hit the bottom of the stairs by
the elevator. It was 10:20. The autopsy established that he had
died instantaneously of a ``crushed skull.'' No signs of violence
unrelated to the fall were found on his body. At noon I heard the
news on the radio in Rome. There was already mention of suicide, a
conclusion later reached by the police inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the shock it caused to his admirers, Levi's manner of
death was explained by most as the ``inescapable'' end of the life
of an Auschwitz survivor. ``Primo Levi died at Auschwitz 40 years
later,'' said Elie Wiesel. And Cynthia Ozick wrote that Levi, like
other writers of distinction before him, suggested ``by a
self-willed death that hell in fact did not end when the chimneys
closed down, but was simply freshening for a second run.''
</P>
<P>
   This explanation of Levi's death also led some people to
interpret it as a delayed victory for Nazism. That such an end
should befall Levi makes the thought doubly disturbing. Philip Roth
describes Levi's ``masterpiece on Auschwitz,'' ``If This Is a
Man,'' as ``his profoundly civilized and spirited response to those
who did all they could to sever his every sustained connection and
tear him and his kind out of history.'' That a figure of Levi's
stature emerged from the fumes of arguably the most savage act of
hatred to scar this century has been a powerful source of hope and
strength. How could he lose that strength and jump to his death?
</P>
<P>
   Italians, it seems, have felt too close to Levi to raise that
unsettling question. In the United States, by contrast, it readily
found a bitter answer. ``The efficacy of all his words had somehow
been canceled by his death _ that his hope, or faith, was no longer
usable by the rest of us,'' an anonymous journalist wrote in The
New Yorker. Leon Wieseltier, in the New Republic, wrote: ``He spoke
for the bet that there is no blow from which the soul may not
recover. When he smashed his body, he smashed his bet.''
</P>
<P>
   But do we have any evidence that Levi's death was a response to
Auschwitz? We know with certainty only that in the period leading
up to his death, Levi was going through a severe episode of
depression. Levi himself denied to friends any link between his
depression and Auschwitz.
</P>
<P>
   Circumstantial evidence that Auschwitz was haunting Levi at the
very end was revealed on the 10th anniversary of his death. At a
commemorative gathering in Rome, Elio Toaff, the chief rabbi of
Rome, disclosed that Levi telephoned him ``10 minutes before'' he
died. He did not say he was about to kill himself, Toaff
recollects, but said: ``I can't go on with this life. My mother is
ill with cancer, and every time I look at her face I remember the
faces of those men stretched on the benches at Auschwitz.''
</P>
<P>
   The most pressing question, however, is not why Levi committed
suicide but whether he committed it at all. Indeed, the possibility
of an accident has never been seriously examined, even though there
is no conclusive proof that Levi killed himself. As his friend, the
Nobel laureate Rita Levi Montalcini, said a few days after the
event, ``Did anyone see him jump over that banister? Did anyone
find a piece of paper announcing his intention to end his life?
Suicide is a far too quick conclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   And despite Rabbi Toaff's statement, I find it odd that Levi,
who was not religious, should approach a rabbi to whom, Rabbi Toaff
said, he had never spoken before. It is also puzzling that Rabbi
Toaff would answer the phone on a Saturday, the Jewish Sabbath, on
which observant Jews are not supposed to use any technical
equipment. Rabbi Toaff is out of town for the month of August,
however, and could not be reached to clarify this point.
</P>
<P>
   If Levi wanted to kill himself, it seems that he, a chemical
engineer by profession, would have known better ways than jumping
into a narrow stairwell. Indeed, the stairwell is so narrow that
Levi would have had to aim his fall just right to be successful.
The maximum distance between the stairs and the elevator cage is 5
feet 7 inches; the minimum distance is just over 3 feet 4 inches.
Rather than killing himself, Levi could have hurt himself bouncing
between the elevator cage and the railings of the lower floors. Had
he wished to jump, he could have chosen the street or the
courtyard, both easily accessible. Levi picked not just a hazardous
but a theatrical option, one that exposed his relatives to a
gruesome sight, in sharp contrast to his notoriously restrained
style.
</P>
<P>
   If he died accidentally, something must have prompted him to
open the door again, walk to the banister and lean forward. The
timing suggests that he might have been looking for someone _ his
wife, for instance, who was out shopping and returned minutes after
the event. Or he might have been looking for the concierge,
expecting to find her still in the staircase. The very old nurse
who was looking after Levi's ailing mother, according to his
cousin, Dr. Giorgio Luzzati, said that Levi had gone out to ask the
concierge about a letter he was expecting.
</P>
<P>
   Levi was not tall (5 feet 5 inches). But neither was the
banister (3 feet 2 inches), which reached approximately to his
navel. If he had been looking for someone below, he would naturally
have approached the banister at the 90-degree corner where the
landing meets the stairs and one has a better view of the lower
floors. The banister's height drops by six inches at every step and
offers decreasing protection. So perhaps he positioned himself to
look down by holding, arms wide, the horizontal banister with one
hand and the sloping one with the other. In such a position one's
balance is precarious because it depends on the grip of one's
hands.
</P>
<P>
   Levi had had a ``routine'' prostate operation just 20 days
before his fall, and he was still recovering. On the Thursday
before his death he called Luzzati and told him he felt tired and
was having dizzy spells. They agreed to schedule an appointment the
following week. David Mendel, a British doctor who corresponded
with Levi shortly before he died, also suggested that the
antidepressants Levi was taking could have caused dizziness. If he
became dizzy while looking down the stairwell, the weight of the
upper half of his body might have been sufficient to drag him into
the void.
</P>
<P>
   I believe an accidental death is more consistent with what we
know about Primo Levi's last moments than a suicide. It would
explain why he died in such an unlikely way, and why he left no
note. At the very least, it would point to an unpremeditated
suicide attempt.
</P>
<P>
   Why, then, were people so prone to believing it was planned
suicide? Devastating past events can set a cognitive trap: if one
survives Auschwitz, everything that happens subsequently tends to
be interpreted in the light of that experience. The Auschwitz hell
may kill survivors decades later, but it may also become a
magnet-explanation. The confidence with which Levi's death was
attributed to suicide perhaps springs more from this understandable
bias than from conclusive evidence.
</P>
<P>
   We shall never know whether Primo Levi committed an
unpremeditated suicide or died accidentally. Doubt is our only
option. One thing is certain, though. Levi's last moments cannot be
construed as an act of delayed resignation before the inhumanity of
Nazism. He never yielded. At most he snapped. On that tragic
Saturday, only his body was smashed.

TAIWANESE SIREN BRINGS SEXUAL SUGGESTIVENESS TO CHINA'S MUSIC
SCENE 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By SETH FAISON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ China is crazy about Ah-Mei. And she rocked Beijing on
Friday night, sending a stadium full of fans into a tizzy of
screeching adulation.
</P>
<P>
   Ah-Mei can sing all right, and her dancing does dazzle, oh yeah.
But it is Ah-Mei's sexy charm and suggestive stage work that seem
to have suddenly catapulted her to the No. 1 slot in rock-and-roll
popularity in China.
</P>
<P>
   One more thing: Ah-Mei is from Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   It is surely a measure of how increasingly irrelevant China's
political campaigns have become to ordinary people when a rock star
from Taiwan can draw more than 45,000 screaming fans to Beijing's
biggest stadium, at the height of a China-Taiwan political crisis,
and no one gives it a second thought.
</P>
<P>
   To the young people bopping to the rhythms and singing along,
loudly, Ah-Mei's attraction easily overpowered any consideration of
the current battle over who should have sovereignty over Taiwan,
which has badly distracted China's leaders in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is the coolest,'' said Li Chen, 28, who would not take her
eyes off the stage, even as she spoke about Ah-Mei, whose real name
is Zhang Hui-mei. ``I don't care where she's from.''
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan culture has so infused mainland China over the last 15
years that no one here seems to even think about it. The two most
popular television shows in China this year are both from Taiwan,
and Taiwan-style teahouses have become popular hangouts in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   China's newspapers may rant each day about the crisis they say
has been provoked by Taiwan's president, Lee Teng-hui, but the same
newspapers have displayed enormous photographs of Ah-Mei,
accompanied by adoring articles that describe her spunky and
lovable personality.
</P>
<P>
   Ah-Mei, 27, is becoming the Madonna of China. Her voice is fine,
her dancing better, but it is her animated persona and sexual
suggestiveness that really give a kick to her performances, and to
her raging popularity.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of her concert Friday night, Ah-Mei dragged a
long-haired young man up to stage center and lashed his wrists
together with a whip, making him sit still. Cradling a microphone
in her hands, she gyrated slowly up and down before him, as she
sang a slow love song about needing and controlling her man.
</P>
<P>
   Wild applause.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities were nearby, posting more than 2,000 armed
police officers on the ground level of the stadium, to make sure
things did not get entirely out of hand. The stadium scoreboard
flashed a reminder, ``Observe discipline, maintain order.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that anyone was watching. There was too much to see on
stage.
</P>
<P>
   In her third costume of the night, a skintight black halter top
and flowing black bell-bottoms, Ah-Mei looked as alluring as her
silky voice sounded when she launched into ``Are You Ready?'' the
number that got the crowd really rocking.
</P>
<P>
   A chant echoed through the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ah-MEI! Ah-MEI!''
</P>
<P>
   She followed with a wild series of hoots, something akin to a
moose's mating call. Wild cheers.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing's enthusiasm for Ah-Mei, it seems fair to say, has been
overwhelming. Early this week, ticket scalpers were already getting
$250 a ticket, roughly five times the average urban monthly wage
and nearly 10 times the original price.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to borrow from my mother,'' said Lei Xiao, 25, who came
with two friends. ``She thinks it's too expensive, but she likes
Ah-Mei, too.''
</P>
<P>
   China's media have given Ah-Mei a welcome to remember this week,
with extensive coverage each day. Friday's Beijing Youth Daily
wrote that it had discovered the secret to Ah-Mei's magic: her
father is a tribal chief in one of Taiwan's minorities of
indigenous mountain people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The girl we know as Ah-Mei is actually a princess,'' the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
   Another newspaper, reporting on everything about Ah-Mei from her
blood type (O) to her brothers and sisters (three brothers and five
sisters, two of whom are also singers) added her favorite pastime:
hunting.
</P>
<P>
   Ah-Mei is not the first Taiwan pop star to come to China. Though
virtually everything from Taiwan was banned for decades after the
Nationalist government retreated to Taiwan 50 years ago after its
defeat by Communist forces, a gradual loosening of restrictions on
Chinese society that began in 1979 allowed in a few singers who
were deemed acceptable. Teresa Tung and her sickly sweet love songs
were highly popular in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Yet China has never before seen anything quite like Ah-Mei.
</P>
<P>
   A taste of her distinctive persona lies in the name of her tour,
which will go to Shanghai and Guangzhou next week: ``I Am Me: Mei
Power 99'' _ a play on her name, with a synonym that means
``charisma.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah-Mei did not mention China's dispute with Taiwan, or any other
kind of politics, on stage Friday night. As close as she got was a
public thank-you to the Ministry of Culture for helping her appear.
The crowd booed.
</P>
<P>
   Then she thanked the Beijing Municipal government. The crowd
booed louder.
</P>
<P>
   Back to the music. ``Give Me a Feeling,'' her signature song,
got the crowd going full-blast, singing so loud it almost drowned
her out.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference earlier in the week, Ah-Mei charmed the
local news media, appearing in a skimpy tank top, tan jeans with
red dragons embroidered on the thigh, and monstrously large,
marshmallow-white platform shoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't always control my feelings,'' said Ah-Mei, appearing
pert and vulnerable at the same time. ``Everyone knows I love being
on stage.''

SCARRED BY U.S. EMBASSY BOMBING, KENYANS STRUGGLE TO RECOVER 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By IAN FISHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAIROBI, Kenya _ Until Aug. 7, 1998, one year ago Saturday,
Douglas Sidialo was a car salesman who drove around Nairobi for his
job. He tells a dark little joke about why that line of work is
closed off to him now: ``If I drove cars,'' he said, ``I would
knock people over.''
</P>
<P>
   He was blinded completely by glass and debris that exploded
through his windshield that day when terrorists bombed the U.S.
Embassy here. More than 200 people were killed and 5,000 wounded
here and in a simultaneous attack on the U.S. Embassy in Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   His story is one of the more inspirational. He started a group
of survivors _ called, with a vein of irony, Visual Seventh August
_ to provide counseling and job training and to watch over how aid
money was spent. He wears a smile and sunglasses, both oversized,
and works hard to set an example for other victims without his
resilience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't reverse the blast,'' Sidialo, 29, said. ``I have to
accept what happened and move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet he still has no job. The other day he went to the local Red
Cross, along with perhaps 100 other victims of the blast, to pick
up free food _ a few bags of corn meal and cooking oil _ to help
him survive.
</P>
<P>
   The bomb may have been aimed at Americans, as many people here
bitterly remind each other. But there is no question that Kenyans
have suffered the most and, a year later, are still coming to terms
with such devastation. It has been hard even for the optimistic
ones, like Sidialo, and simply grim for others.
</P>
<P>
   And so the nation's recovery from the bomb blast has come with
its own set of victories and setbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Many Kenyans, split by ethnic, religious and class differences,
say the blast gave them a greater sense of unity, just as they
pulled together a year ago hauling the wounded from the rubble or
donating blood en masse. A government fund to compensate victims
apparently did not fall prey to the nation's legendary corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Some outsiders who have helped Kenya recover from the blast _
the United States has donated $42.3 million _ say they have noticed
subtle differences in Kenyan society, some out of bomb-related
necessity.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I started, mental health was seen as a service only
provided to people who were blatantly psychotic,'' said Dr. Lorin
Minless, a Boston psychiatrist who is a consultant for counseling
services for some 2,000 bomb survivors and their families. ``The
idea of getting help outside of the family didn't exist. The bomb
blast helped sensitize people.''
</P>
<P>
   But on some level the unity was short-lived. People have not
even agreed how to commemorate the bombing's anniversary, marked in
a weekend of rallies, concerts and other events: there are four
separate memorial services on Saturday, each claiming to be the
official one.
</P>
<P>
   And the money handed out by the government that was supposed to
make life easier for the victims has backfired in some cases, the
compensation squandered or stolen.
</P>
<P>
   Doreen Auma's husband was a shoe salesman killed in the blast.
As she took the body to western Kenya for burial, she said, her
husband's family decided not to recognize the marriage and emptied
their house of everything _ furniture, dishes, even the stove.
</P>
<P>
   Of the roughly $9,200 the government paid for her husband's
death, his family took $6,500. Now she is nearly broke.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have spent everything,'' Ms. Auma, 25, she said as she too
collected the free Red Cross food to feed their two children, ages
6 and 7.
</P>
<P>
   There is also still much anger in Kenya over the blast. Some of
it remains directed at the United States, criticized in the early
days for seeming to care more about the 12 Americans killed than
the more than 200 Kenyans. Now, with unemployment sky-high and per
capita income dropping, many people say the United States should do
more.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the Americans gave to the victims was not enough,'' said
Julius Mashalia Isalambo, 37, a grocer in downtown Nairobi. ``It's
like we are fighting their war.''
</P>
<P>
   Isalambo is not a victim of the blast and, interestingly, most
of the victims themselves say they do not blame the United States
(even though some 2,500 of them have joined in huge class-action
lawsuits against the U.S. government).
</P>
<P>
   Francis Gitu Maina, 33, clenched his fists on a recent evening
when he was asked if he was angry at anyone over the blast.
</P>
<P>
   ``So much,'' he said. But he said he blamed ``the ones who came
to bomb,'' suspected to be Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile, who
has denied any role in the bombing, and his suspected associates,
eight of whom have been arrested. ``If they did not bomb, I would
not be in this trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   His trouble is worse than most: Maina was on the No. 126 bus,
stalled in traffic in front of the embassy, when the explosion went
off. He spent four days in a coma, then four months in the
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   He lost his right eye and cannot see well in his left. He can
barely walk because his right leg was broken so badly. When his
wife saw he could not provide anymore, he said, she left him with
their two children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was the king of ...'' he stared to say, then stopped. ``I'm
the husband. And now I got that trouble. That is why she went.''
</P>
<P>
   He said his life is now divided between the doctor and sitting
alone in his little room with walls and roof made of tin in the
town of Kiserian, about an hour to the southwest of Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
   A former clothes hawker, he has no clear vision of the future,
except that he would like to buy a little plot of land, build a few
apartments and start selling clothes again. But he does not have
the money.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation is very bad,'' he said. ``When I think about my
life before, I don't feel good.''

SOARING JULY JOB GROWTH HELPS TO BOOST WAGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Unemployment in July held firm at 4.3 percent, but an increase
of 310,000 jobs _ the second-biggest monthly gain this year _ put
more pressure on wages of US workers.
</P>
<P>
   The larger-than-expected job gains, exceeding the average
208,000 new jobs created each month during the first half of this
year, bumped wages up by 3.8 percent compared with wage levels in
July 1998, the US Department of Labor said in its monthly report on
employment. That was the biggest one-month jump in wages since
January.
</P>
<P>
   The news made it virtually certain that Federal Reserve Board
chairman Alan Greenspan will raise interest rates later this month
to limit the threat of inflation. Greenspan and the Federal Open
Market Committee, which sets interest rates, will convene on Aug.
24.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan is ``afraid if he doesn't do something about it, it's
going to explode in a burst of wage inflation,'' said William
Cheney, chief economist for John Hancock Life Insurance Co.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed, which boosted interest rates by a quarter percent in
July, to 5 percent, will likely raise rates another quarter point
at the next meeting, economists predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan fears that rising wages will force manufacturers to
increase prices, setting off a new round of inflation. By raising
interest rates and slowing economic growth, Greenspan hopes to ease
pressure on prices.
</P>
<P>
   But the market, fearing a slowdown in the economy, reacted
negatively. The Dow Jones industrial average ended the day down
79.79 points, after being down more than 100 points earlier in the
afternoon. The Dow closed at 10,714.03, down less than 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The benchmark 30-year US Treasury bond had its biggest jump in
yields since mid-May. The yield rose from 6.06 to 6.16 percent
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Financial markets were unhappy about a 6-cent rise in the
average hourly wages of US workers, to $13.29, from June to July _
the equivalent of a 6 percent annual increase.
</P>
<P>
   The spike in wages was the largest recorded in a single month
since January, when wages rose 4 percent over the prior year.
Despite fears of wage inflation, however, the Bureau of Labor
Statistics data show that wage gains were actually stronger in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   But the July increase was the latest in a steady drumbeat of
indicators in recent days that point to looming wage inflation,
including a slowdown in productivity growth and a 1.1 percent spike
in salaries and benefits in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Higher wages have not yet shown to be fueling consumer prices,
which are rising at a moderate 2 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas Perna, chief economist for Fleet Financial Group Inc.,
said these data ``virtually guarantee'' strength in July personal
spending figures due out soon, continuing to fuel an economic
expansion that has gone on for eight years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumer incomes are going to be strong again. Purchasing
power's going to be strong. If you're the Fed and you're looking at
this, you say everything is coming up roses _ maybe too many
roses,'' Perna said.
</P>
<P>
   Even manufacturers, who were hurt last year by a drop in
exports, added 31,000 jobs in July, a trend that contradicts
reports by purchasing manufacturers that showed signs of a slowdown
at the nation's factories. July was only the second month in the
past year in which factory jobs were added.
</P>
<P>
   The service sector, a huge and steady source of jobs during the
expansion, added another 110,000 employees in July, followed by
restaurants, stores, and other retail establishments, which added
91,000, the Labor Department's survey of non-farm businesses
showed.
</P>
<P>
   There were also big gains in demand for workers at temporary
help agencies, which posted their strongest increase in payrolls _
31,000 new temporary workers _ in 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no sign of any slowdown at this point,'' said William
Ferson, &UR;  &LR; economist in the Boston office of the department's Bureau
of Labor Statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Last month's job gain of 310,000 was far beyond analysts'
expectations. Analysts had forecast that just over 200,000 jobs
would be added in July, a significantly slower pace than was
recorded in June.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the miracle of the American job machine,'' Hancock's
Cheney said. ``It's something which we all expected was going to
slow down probably two years ago, and it just keeps on going and
going and going.''

TOP PUERTO RICO OFFICIAL CHARGES NAVY WITH `ENVIRONMENTAL RACISM' 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The attorney general of Puerto Rico charged Friday
that the Navy's use of the island of Vieques for gunnery practice
amounts to ``environmental racism.''
</P>
<P>
   The only reason the Navy is blasting the island, Jose Fuentes
Agostini told reporters, ``is that we are Puerto Ricans,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Vieques, a island that is part of Puerto Rico, is home to 9,300
civilians who live next to a 22,000-acre military preserve used by
the Navy and Marines to practice bombing, artillery and ground
maneuvers.
</P>
<P>
   The military has been shooting at the island for 58 years, and
the Puerto Rican government wants it stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Agostini told a four-member Pentagon panel appointed at
the request of President Clinton to resolve the dispute that ``the
Navy's continued use and abuse of the fragile ecosystem of Vieques
... is a glaring example of institutional environmental racism.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No other group has been required to live so close to such
hazardous conditions,'' he said. ``No other group would have had to
put up with this treatment for so long.''
</P>
<P>
   Citing the Navy's argument that it must use Vieques because
there is no alternative site, Agostini said ``there is no
alternative precisely because no other group of Americans could be
forced to tolerate such abuse.''
</P>
<P>
   Citing a report by the Puerto Rican government, Agostini told
the panel that the citizens of Vieques have endured ``significant
physical and mental health problems.''
</P>
<P>
   The Navy and Marine Corps want to resume training on the
22-mile-long island that was halted in April after a bombing mishap
in which a pilot mistakenly dropped two 500-pound bombs on an
observation post, killing a Puerto Rican civilian employee and
injuring four others.
</P>
<P>
   The accident ignited a political firestorm across Puerto Rico,
prompting the leaders of the island's 3.8 million U.S. citizens to
demand an end to the bombing and the withdrawal of the Navy from
the island.
</P>
<P>
   Agostini said that if the Pentagon panel doesn't recommend
ending the bombing, he will seek a court injunction, citing alleged
Navy violations of environmental laws. He also warned that Puerto
Ricans may start protesting in large numbers at the facility.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suspect they may take this into their own hands,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Navy officials argue that the gunnery range must remain open.
Navy Secretary Richard Danzig said that ``from a national security
standpoint this is an important and not a replaceable site.'' The
service examined 18 other sites for comparable training and
concluded that training must continue at the range on Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   The panel might make a recommendation to Clinton in the next few
weeks about the fate of the island.
</P>
<P>
   The White House decision has potential political repercussions
because First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton is exploring a U.S.
Senate race in New York, home to over one million Puerto Rican
voters.
</P>
<P>
   Agostini said that Mrs. Clinton will have to carefully consider
the Vieques issue as she mounts her campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``This issue would be of political interest to her,'' he said.

   JERUSALEM _ His hair a shellacked, platinum blond, his face
framed by a pair of hoop earrings, Miki Abutbul, 16, an Israeli
from a working-class suburb, was sprawled with friends on plastic
chairs in a crowded pedestrian walkway in central Jerusalem just
after midnight Friday morning, talking about violence in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even my 10-year-old brother carries a knife,'' Miki was saying
when shouts of a nearby fight suddenly pierced the cool air and
sent him and the rest of the crowd scurrying in different
directions. Within minutes, army troops and policemen descended on
Zion Square, broke up the trouble and arrested two Israeli youths.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't Harlem, but for every small thing someone seems to
pull a knife these days,'' offered Miki's friend, Shai Hugi, 16.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has always had a rough edge, always been a society where
aggression and rudeness were accepted as byproducts of life under
siege. Take immigrants from 100 countries, Israelis would say,
throw them together on a slice of parched, coveted earth surrounded
by enemies and you cannot expect automatic harmony. But there has
been an abrupt shift in this view in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   After several exceptionally brutal crimes _ two men killed their
wives and children and set their bodies on fire _ and new studies
detailing the level of brutality in the schools, there has emerged
an intense focus on violence among Israelis that has temporarily
pushed aside the historic focus on conflict with the Arabs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to deal with this exactly as we have dealt with
terrorism,'' said Zeev Friedman, director of health, welfare and
social services for the city of Tel Aviv, ``because this is nothing
less than an internal form of terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   While there are no firm data showing a rise in violence, what
has changed, many experts suspect, is Israel's sense of itself, its
attitude toward such behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Since the fear of war is lower than it has ever been, and
Israel's links to the West, especially the United States, are
closer than ever _ a result of cable television, computers,
commerce and increased travel _ Israelis are less willing to excuse
shortcomings in their society as byproducts of the need to survive.
</P>
<P>
   Others say the assassination of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin in
1995 was a watershed, when suddenly it seemed that life had become
cheap in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's issue of the dominant daily newspaper, Yediot Aharonot,
illustrated how widespread this view is. Although
Israeli-Palestinian relations are tense over land-for-security
arrangements, and the new government of Prime Minister Ehud Barak
seems to be getting ready to negotiate the return of the strategic
Golan Heights to Syria, neither issue made the front page.
</P>
<P>
   The main article concerned the latest attack of a feared figure
known as the Tel Aviv Rapist. A second story told of a paroled
convict who visited his girlfriend and threw her baby daughter out
the window. The dealings with the Arabs were relegated to inside
pages.
</P>
<P>
   Since the focus on internal violent behavior is so recent, there
are virtually no data to confirm the widely held view that violence
in Israel, a nation of 6 million, is on the increase or that the
increase is due partly to the arrival of so many immigrants from
the former Soviet Union in the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   Data for many forms of violence have been collected only for the
past five years and show mixed trends. Spousal and school violence,
two areas of particular focus in the press, have shown no increase
in that time. The number of homicides is down from 79 in the first
half of 1998 to 61 in the first half of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are less involved today with security problems,'' noted
Zemira Mevarech, chief scientist at the Education Ministry, who
recently called for a comprehensive program, including rewards for
teachers and staff, aimed at reducing school violence. ``As
concerns over security go down, the focus on quality of life goes
up.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. influence is significant. When two Colorado students went
on a shooting spree in their high school last April, killing 12
fellow students and a teacher, the story was big news for days
here. Many commentators suggested that such a massacre could happen
here since a recent study showed that 7 percent of high school
students carry weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the latest hero in the Israeli press is New York City
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, whose name is invoked frequently by those
who think that policing of minor and major crimes in Israel has
been lax.
</P>
<P>
   In July, an Israeli artist named Gil Mitchell was knifed to
death after asking two men not to scrape his car with theirs. That
prompted Haim Yavin, the country's long-serving news anchor on
state television, to offer a rare op-ed piece in Haaretz newspaper
and call on Israel's police to take a lesson from the New York
police.
</P>
<P>
   ``A metropolis of crime, drugs and dirt has become one of the
most flourishing cities in the world,'' Yavin wrote of New York.
``Mayor Giuliani's task has been to teach millions of New Yorkers
to respect the rule of law.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that Israelis should take a lesson. ``Today, Israel is
more than a little similar to the New York of 20 years ago. Instead
of the rule of law, we have the rule of the knife and the
revolver.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   The idea that Israel is following an American path or should
take a lesson from the United States is itself a marked contrast to
how Israel saw itself two or three decades ago. Then, when
Americans faced decaying cities, drug addiction and violent youth,
most Israelis happily noted that their country was different. U.S.
problems were seen as a result of American societal conditions,
including the lack of mutual concern and cohesion that
characterized Israel in its early decades.
</P>
<P>
   Today, American-style problems and American-style solutions are
seen as almost inevitable since this country has come to resemble
the United States more than ever. The economy, for example, once
one of the world's most egalitarian, is now characterized by a huge
gap between richest and poorest.
</P>
<P>
   The police ministry is trying to learn how police officers in
the United States deal with domestic violence. It is widely
suspected that since the Israeli police tended in the past to focus
on external, meaning Arab, threats, they had little training and
little interest in domestic crimes.
</P>
<P>
   A new program trains detectives in such work and there will soon
be a doubling of the 170 detectives assigned to such tasks.
</P>
<P>
   The Education Ministry is trying to design an American-style
curriculum that teaches pupils sensitivity toward one another and
reduces violent confrontations. Tel Aviv is seeking help from Los
Angeles on how to fight domestic abuse.
</P>
<P>
   There are also, however, more Israeli-style approaches being
contemplated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just like every Israeli has been trained over the years to
report a suspicious package in the street in case it is a terrorist
bomb, today Israelis need to learn to detect signs of domestic
violence around them so that lives can be saved,'' suggested
Friedman, the Tel Aviv director of social services.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Yossi Harel of Bar-Ilan University outside Tel Aviv,
spent 11 years at the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, where
he was in charge of the youth survey system and helped design
surveys for some 30 countries on youth health and violence.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent study, for 1998, shows Israel eighth out of 28
countries on the question of what percentage of youths have been
bullied at school. For Israel it was 50 percent. This was behind
the United States, in 18th place at 34 percent.
</P>
<P>
   When Harel published the results of the first such study in 1995
with similar results for Israel, he said, the main reaction was
dismissal. No one took it seriously. But when he published the 1998
results this year _ including the finding that more than half the
students in grades 6 through 10 were involved either as
perpetrators or victims of violence _ the ground was fertile and
his study became major news.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took a long time to build awareness that we really have a
problem on our hands in terms of the banality of violence as a part
of daily life for Israeli youth,'' Harel said. ``Kids here use
verbal and physical violence to cope. My interpretation is that as
a society and system we have failed to provide the youth of this
country with alternative resources for coping with frustration and
anger.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that violent attitudes are endemic throughout society _
on the roads, in Parliament, in public places, on television talk
shows _ and the youth are drinking it all in.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is also difficult in the home. Malka Soffer, head of
the crime victims section in Israel's national police, said that
until the early 1990s, spousal and child abuse here was treated by
police as an occasion to mediate between offender and victim rather
than act as law enforcement agents.
</P>
<P>
   Today, there are special instructions and domestic abuse is
considered a crime of great urgency, she said. ``Today, we think
that if a violent crime is committed within the family it is more
severe than if it is committed among strangers because of the risk
of repetition,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Feminists have been raising concerns over spousal abuse for
several years here. But many Israelis had trouble believing that
Jewish husbands were really guilty of such activity. Accepting that
such problems exist in Israel has been part of the country's
maturation, some say.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was this big myth that Jewish husbands wouldn't do this
sort of thing,'' said Ronit Lev-Ari, director of the department of
family violence prevention for Naamat, a women's group. ``But we
are like everyone else. It may be very sad for some but Israel is
normal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like elsewhere, most Israeli husbands who beat their wives
were themselves beaten as children and, like other societies, we
need to learn to stop them and to treat them.''

KOREA'S 2ND GENERATION OF CORPORATE ELITE CONFRONT SCORN AND DUTY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By SHERYL WuDUNN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea _ To many South Koreans, Chey Jae-won is just
a spoiled rich kid, the kind who plays with empires of corporations
the way others might play with empires of Lego.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinary people see members of the new generation of the
corporate elite here as simply spoiled spendthrifts, squandering
their cash on expensive cars and extravagant evenings. That image
does little to ease the transition now as Chey and the scions of
other corporate dynasties are taking over from their fathers in a
major generational transition of Korean industry.
</P>
<P>
   Chey, a dapper engineer with sleek hair and a pen with gold trim
in his pocket, is, like most of the new corporate leaders, devoted
to a tougher, more market-driven model of management. And sometimes
the first casualties of this approach have been Chey's old buddies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hardest thing is that it was like a family before,'' said
Chey, the son of the founder of the SK Group, one of South Korea's
biggest conglomerates, and now one of its new bosses. ``I got to
know their families, and they got to know mine. We drink together
and work together.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to break that tie,'' added Chey, 36. ``It's the most
difficult thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The second generation is moving into power partly because of the
Asian economic crisis, which created demands for new ways of
business management, and the new leaders are already beginning to
turn the economy in new directions. Saddled with the nasty task of
making reform work, they are trying to remold the empires that
their fathers built from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   Known as the second generation, Chey and other sons and
daughters of Korea's business leaders are mostly American-educated
and business-minded, with visions in their heads of balance sheets
rather than paternal companies.
</P>
<P>
   The passing of the baton has not been swift, for many of Korea's
giant conglomerates have been run since the beginning by their
founders, who formed these corporations mostly just before the
Korean War in the early 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   For some of the elders it is still a struggle to let go of the
reins. At Hyundai Group, the largest of the conglomerates, which
are known as chaebol, 83-year-old founder Chung Ju-yung still
wields influence, though he has paved the way for his son and
grandson. And an ailing Kim Woo-choong at Daewoo Group promised
recently to yield control after the group nearly collapsed when
creditors threatened to pull the plug.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the second generation _ and in some cases, the third _ is
often said to be the best hope for change in Korea, but the jury is
still out on how they are doing. Economic growth is returning and
dissipating some of the pressure for change at the chaebol, so
there is a good deal of skepticism about how much they will
accomplish.
</P>
<P>
   ``This second generation, they don't have the experience and the
know-how to design systems, so it will take time,'' said Jang
Song-hyon, who runs S.H. Jang &AMP; Associates, Inc., an independent
consulting firm. ``They inherited very large businesses without
having the past experience of going through very difficult times.''
</P>
<P>
   But there are indications that some of the scions may be earning
their stripes. For starters, they are moving beyond the
instinct-driven, seat-of-the-pants decision-making used by their
fathers and the cycle of lock-step promotion and lifetime
employment.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the dinner table, we challenged him, `It shouldn't be this
way!''' said Chey, describing discussions with his father before he
died last August. ``He sees the big picture. He sometimes didn't
see the small changes.''
</P>
<P>
   With a master's degree in materials science from Stanford
University, and an MBA from Harvard, Chey helps shape the group's
strategy and he can chat with any engineer about the nitty gritty
of the company's chemicals, telecommunications and finance
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   He and his older brother are in the middle of a battle with
foreign shareholders over management control, and he expects to be
as fierce as his opponents. But he is also tough on his own
employees in a way that would win praise in corporate America.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, the company had 35,000 employees, and all
Chey's friends told him he would ostracized if he cut employees.
Now, after encouraging employees to strike out on their own by
giving them batches of equipment to start their own companies, Chey
has reduced the work force to 21,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I meet with lots of the second generation and they know where
to go but they struggle so much,'' said Chey. ``They say: `This is
what my father or grandfather did and I have to chop it up and sell
it _ I don't want to do it!'''
</P>
<P>
   But in South Korea such moves only intensify the envy that some
people feel. Of course, the founders themselves, who grabbed the
limelight as South Korea's economy bloomed over the decades, were
also the target of much criticism, but they earned respect for the
companies they cultivated.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, members of the younger generation are often scorned
because they have not fashioned success on their own. Some people
fear that they are more likely to continue the mentality of
expansion that their fathers were famous for, when what Korean
companies need now is a dose of healthy slash-and-burn
restructuring. Moreover, unlike their fathers, they have known
little economic hardship, save for the brief collapse of the
economy after the financial crisis in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure they're trying to change because they've seen what
it's going to be like'' if they don't, said Park Sang-yong,
professor of finance at Yonsei University in Seoul. ``But it would
have been better if they had suffered more. This change in mental
attitude is not something that will take place very easily.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Park Yong-maan, 44, the fifth of seven children in a family that
runs a longtime chaebol, called Doosan Corp., is fighting that
image head on. An energetic man whose American MBA has helped him
embrace the world of market capitalism faster than some of his
peers, he is bracing for the challenges ahead by hiring several
American consulting companies to help him reshape the business.
</P>
<P>
   When Park talks, he likes to have pen and paper in front of him,
and he compulsively jots down notes and strategy formulations to
make his point. As he gets up to stretch, it finally comes out that
he is recovering from back surgery performed two weeks earlier.
</P>
<P>
   And who says he did not work hard?
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, on the floor of a dimly lighted side room by his office
is a clock, a sheet, and a thin mattress, where he takes a rest
when the back pain heats up and he can no longer endure sitting at
his computer. So he bristles at the taunts about him and his
cohorts.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how the public looks at us _ as spoiled kids,'' said
Park, as he put his hand firmly on the seat by the desk in his
corner windowed office. He said he had worked hard ``to get to this
chair, far more than others.''

DIVIDING THINGS FAIRLY IS NOT ALWAYS A PIECE OF CAKE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By SARAH BOXER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   You want to cut a cake fairly? Take a knife, count the people at
the party, cut the slices and hand them out. Even if the pieces are
a bit uneven, what person above the age of 10 would have the nerve
to complain that his slice wasn't as big as someone else's?
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the field of fair division. It is full of incipient
party poopers: mathematicians, economists, political scientists and
mediators who care deeply about cake-cutting, down to the frosting
and rosettes.
</P>
<P>
   The field extends from cake to heirs fighting over their
inheritance, ex-spouses haggling over property in a divorce,
children shirking chores, pirates splitting loot, warring parties
partitioning land and companies merging.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Win-Win Solution: Guaranteeing Fair Shares to
Everybody,'' Steven J. Brams and Alan D. Taylor recount one of the
earliest documented cases of the algorithm (or step-by-step method)
for splitting known as ``I cut, you choose.'' Lot and Abraham are
arguing over grazing land. Abraham cuts the land into north and
south with this proposal: ``Let us separate: If you go north, I
will go south; and if you go south, I will go north.'' Lot chooses.
</P>
<P>
   The problem of fair division is thousands of years old, but the
mathematical theory is still young, according to ``Cake-Cutting
Algorithms: Be Fair if You Can,'' a book by Jack Robertson and
William Webb that surveys the known methods of cake cutting. These
include moving-knife algorithms (somebody shouts ``Stop!'' when he
thinks a knife that's moving across a cake is hovering over his
fair share), dirty-work modifications (for dividing up things
nobody wants) and divide-and-conquer algorithms.
</P>
<P>
   The formal theory of fair division began in the 1940s, when
three Polish mathematicians _ Hugo Steinhaus, Stefan Banach and
Bronislaw Knaster _ came up with a brilliant question: What happens
when it's not two people fighting over a cake, but three? This
stumped the world for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``They realized that it got complicated quite quickly,'' said
Taylor, the Marie Louise Bailey Professor of Mathematics at Union
College. They found a way to cut the cake proportionally, so that
every person would feel that he or she got at least one-third of
the cake. But they couldn't insure that one of the cake-eaters
would not want to swap his or her piece of cake for someone else's.
</P>
<P>
   This was the problem: Say Tom, Dick and Ann set out to cut a
cake into thirds. Tom might cut a slice that he thinks is at least
one-third of the cake and then watch as the rest of the cake is
split so that Dick gets a bigger piece than his and Ann a smaller
one. Tom might feel that he got his proportional share but still
envy Dick. The slice would be, in the lingo of fair division,
``proportional'' but not ``envy-free.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not until 1960 that two mathematicians, John H. Conway
and John L. Selfridge, found a way to guarantee envy-freeness (and
proportionality) for three people. (All envy-free solutions are
proportional.) Their method also guaranteed crumbs.
</P>
<P>
   Tom cuts the cake into what he thinks are three equal slices.
Then Dick sizes up the situation. If he doesn't think the slices
are even, he trims the largest slice until he thinks it's same size
as the next largest slice. Then the slices are claimed in this
order: first Ann, then Dick (who must take the piece he trimmed if
Ann didn't take it), then Tom. The problem is what to do with the
trimmings. Should they be divided in the same manner?
</P>
<P>
   When do trimmings become worthless crumbs? A variant of the
trimming procedure was used after World War II, according to ``The
Win-Win Solution.'' When the Allies partitioned Germany into zones,
Berlin was viewed as too valuable a piece to hand over to the
Soviet Union even though it was in the Soviet zone. Thus Berlin
became the trimmings, leftovers to be further divided.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s, Taylor and Brams came up with an envy-free way to
divide cake among four people. If you can cut a cake for four
people in an envy-free way, Taylor says, you can do it for
millions. When Taylor was asked if he could explain it, he said,
``Whoa! Not easily.''
</P>
<P>
   Basically it involves cutting extra slices. As the number of
cake-eaters increases, the number of slices you have to cut
increases exponentially. For four cake-eaters, cut five slices; for
five eaters, nine slices; for six, 17 slices; for 22 eaters, more
than a million. The trimmings and additional slices are distributed
later in an even more complicated way.
</P>
<P>
   For all the muss, these algorithms don't always produce
satisfied customers. Say one person likes frosting and cake, but
another person finds frosting nauseating. If a cake is divided with
equal parts frosting and cake for all, the frosting-hater will see
that the person who likes both cake and frosting is happier. The
frosting-hater doesn't want the other person's slice; he wants that
person's happiness with his slice.
</P>
<P>
   There is more to a truly great cut than envy-freeness and
proportionality. There's the gloating quotient. If you really want
to be fair, you have to insure that no one feels happier with his
slice than anyone else. (This is called an ``equitable''
distribution.) If you want to dole out the maximum amount of
happiness, you should also make sure no other division would make
things better for one party without making it worse for another.
(This is called an ``efficient'' division.)
</P>
<P>
   Oddly enough, the more people disagree about what's tasty in a
cake, the easier it is to make everyone happy. If one person adores
frosting, but not cake and the other loves cake but not frosting,
you can make both happy by giving one frosting, the other the cake.
</P>
<P>
   The question is how to produce wonderful cuts where some tastes
overlap and others don't. The first step is to stop talking about
cake. Instead of looking at a single item, like a cake, look at
piles of things, like property in a divorce.

UNDATED: a divorce.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In ``The Win-Win Solution,'' Brams and Taylor describe their new
algorithm to help two parties _ countries, divorces, siblings,
companies _ divide in a way that's envy-free (and thus
proportional), equitable and efficient. It is called adjusted
winner, or AW, and the authors have patented it, just to avoid
getting into a little property dispute of their own. (As far as the
authors know, this is the first patent for a method of resolving
disputes.)
</P>
<P>
   This is how AW works. Two parties list all the items and issues
to be divided. Each one gets 100 points to spend on the things
listed, spending the most points on those things the player values
most. Each player wins (at least temporarily) the items that he has
placed more points on than his opponent. Then the adjustments
begin. Both players add up the number of points they have spent for
the things they have got. If one party has more, they start
transferring items back and forth (and sometimes dividing them or
cashing them in for money) until their point totals are identical.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally, it pays to be honest about what your valuations
are'' when using this algorithm, said Brams, a professor of
politics at New York University. Of course it also pays to keep
your valuations a secret from your opponent. Otherwise he could
spite you by, say, putting just one more point on something he
knows you want.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more different the preferences, the more both gain,''
Brams says. Applying the AW method to Donald and Ivana Trump's
divorce, Brams and Taylor calculated that both would have won
nearly 75 percent of what they wanted because their preferences
were so different. She wanted the Connecticut estate and the Trump
Plaza apartment. He wanted the Palm Beach mansion and the Trump
Tower triplex. If AW had been applied to the Camp David peace
talks, Egypt and Israel would have each gotten about 65 percent of
what they wanted.
</P>
<P>
   That sounds wonderful, but there is some dispute about whether
AW really promotes harmony.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Fisher, who wrote ``Getting to Yes: Negotiating Agreement
Without Giving In'' with William Ury, is troubled. ``A point
system,'' he said, ``takes the articles in conflict as fixed, and
that's not necessarily good for any relationship.'' In mediation,
he says, ``emotional needs are often more important than material
wants.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, in a diplomatic dispute, perhaps one country wants
an apology rather than land in a diplomatic dispute. In an estate
settlement, maybe one person wants the summer house only for July
and another person wants mother's dress only for her wedding.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor said that it doesn't matter what is being divided up _
apologies, sovereignty or wearing mother's dress for a day _ as
long as everything is put on the list.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher still has doubts. He said that a point system can help
heirs divide antiques but doesn't produce creative solutions for
complicated political conflicts. ``Apologizing and showing respect,
tolerance, understanding and openness to the ideas of others,'' he
said, ``are not units to which partisans can easily assign
mathematical points.''
</P>
<P>
   The adversarial and secretive nature of the method can work
against peace too. In negotiation, it's better to ``play with the
cards face up,'' to make all your wants known, he said. ``The
biggest concern is to eliminate the idea that your partner in
negotiation is your enemy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the world is not made better by dividing things,''
Fisher says. All the secretiveness and jockeying is okay if the
parties are going to ``live on different planets,'' he says. But
it's no way to produce harmony and end war. ``God bless them if
they can find a mathematical solution for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Cake, anyone?

<HEADLINE>
INDONESIAN AGENCY PROBING FINANCIAL CORRUPTION IS ITSELF UNDER
SCRUTINY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By WAYNE ARNOLD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SINGAPORE _ The Indonesian government is investigating
allegations of corruption at the powerful agency entrusted with
unwinding three decades of the same kind of corruption in the
nation's financial system.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to a scandal that highlights the paradoxes of a
government's efforts to disinfect itself, Finance Minister Bambang
Subianto said Friday that Indonesia's Supreme Audit Agency would
look into allegations that an official at the Indonesian Bank
Restructuring Agency helped arrange millions of dollars in payments
to a businessman with connections to the country's ruling elite.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's necessary for IBRA that we clarify the case,'' Bambang
told reporters at a seminar on investment in Indonesia, referring
to the bank restructuring agency's acronym. ``This effort is part
of the government trying to avoid the emergence of other problems
which, in turn, could hamper the bank restructuring process.''
</P>
<P>
   The bank restructuring agency is leading a $35 billion bailout
of Indonesia's banks. Last week, a prominent Indonesian legal
expert accused the agency's deputy chairman, Pande Lubis, of
arranging for Bank Bali _ which has since come under the management
of Standard Chartered PLC _ to pay 550 billion rupiah ($78.3
million) to three businessmen to help it secure the repayment of
904 billion rupiah ($129 million) in delinquent interbank loans
from banks already taken over by the bank restructuring agency.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the fees Bank Bali paid purportedly ended up at a local
finance company called Era Giat Prima. The head of that company,
Setya Novanto, is also vice treasurer of Golkar, the political
party of former President Suharto and the current president, B.J.
Habibie.
</P>
<P>
   Habibie faces a difficult re-election campaign in November
following Golkar's second-place finish in June's national
parliamentary elections. The latest scandal buttresses charges by
opposition politicians that Golkar is using government money to
help finance Habibie's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Pande has issued no statement concerning the charges and was
unavailable for comment Friday. though a bank restructuring agency
official said by telephone from Jakarta that Pande was still
working at the agency.
</P>
<P>
   Jakarta's financial community is watching the Bank Bali case
closely to see if the bank restructuring agency's reputation for
political independence has been compromised.
</P>
<P>
   The bank restructuring agency was created early last year at the
insistence of the International Monetary Fund, which has provided
more than $40 billion in aid to Indonesia to help it recover from
the Asia economic crisis that began two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   While Indonesia's central bank is nominally in charge of the
banking system, the bank restructuring agency has greater control.
It has taken over more than 50 failed banks, lashed together four
state-owned banks into the nation's biggest bank and is helping
raise the money needed to resuscitate nine other banks. Its
takeovers of other banks means the agency has inherited a portfolio
of assets equivalent to at least one-fifth of the entire Indonesian
economy.
</P>
<P>
   The Bank Bali imbroglio is just the latest obstacle the agency
has faced as it tries to rebuild the nation's financial system. The
agency aims to raise 17 trillion rupiah ($2.42 billion) by the
spring via asset sales to help the government offset 34 trillion
rupiah ($4.84 billion) in interest payments on bonds it has issued
to help recapitalize the nation's surviving banks. Doing so means
wresting control of assets from the nation's powerful political
elite, people with close connections to Habibie and Suharto.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to aggravating bureaucratic tangles, the agency's
chairman, Glenn Yusuf, has been criticized because he also heads an
investment bank advising the agency. Foreign investors have accused
the agency of stalling on asset sales to prevent them from falling
into foreign hands, while local property owners have accused the
agency of trying to sell the nation out.
</P>
<P>
   The agency moved quickly this week to contain the fallout from
the Bank Bali scandal, with Yusuf acknowledging to journalists that
the agency had discovered the payments when it nationalized Bank
Bali on July 23, and that part of the 550 billion rupiah had indeed
been paid to Era Giat Prima. The agency has vowed to conduct its
own investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Adding its voice to the chorus, the Indonesian Democratic Party
of Struggle, which won the most votes in June parliamentary
elections, announced that it would establish a team to conduct its
own investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The details of the purported deal remain sketchy, but so far
appear to involve Era Giat Prima's purchase of some of Bank Bali's
bad loans. According to press reports, Bank Bali agreed to sell Era
Giat Prima two of those loans, both from other banks that the bank
restructuring agency had shuttered. In theory, this meant that the
agency guaranteed their obligations and would eventually honor
them.

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 8)  
 (af)  
 By DAVID J. MORROW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Remember what last year was like for investors in drug stocks?
</P>
<P>
   People who bought Schering-Plough's shares in January 1998 saw
their shares surge 77.8 percent by year-end. Even one of the year's
worst-peforming drug stocks _ Johnson &AMP; Johnson _ soared 27
percent, enough to outperform luminaries like Coca-Cola and Exxon.
</P>
<P>
   But talk about going from riches to rags. Only one of the 10
major American pharmaceutical stocks, a resurgent Johnson &AMP;
Johnson, has delivered a positive return this year, despite a
steady increase in the industry's earnings. The S&AMP;P drug index has
plunged 19.3 percent this year, versus a gain of 5.8 percent for
the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index.
</P>
<P>
   Several factors appear to be causing the drug sector's ills. In
the last few months, investors have moved money out of
pharmaceuticals and into rising cyclical stocks, notably energy
companies. And analysts say some investors may be worried that the
economy may overheat or that President Clinton's threat to add drug
benefits to Medicare may lower profits, if it leads to price
controls.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fundamentals of the drug companies are still the same;
they are still as strong as ever,'' said Michael T. Manns, a vice
president at American Express Asset Management. But that isn't
enough, he said. ``You have to have a benign environment for growth
stocks _ stable or lower interest rates. The interest rate fears
are back in the marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   Though drug stocks have been drooping for much of the year, the
pain has become acute in recent weeks. In July, the S&AMP;P 500-stock
index fell 3.2 percent, but the S&AMP;P drug index plunged 7.7 percent,
despite the strong second-quarter earnings reported by most
pharmaceutical companies.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts don't see the downward spiral ending anytime soon,
saying drug stocks may decline until the overall market experiences
a correction. Historically, such an event lifts the sector, which
is regarded as relatively sturdy in a declining economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investors should look for drug stocks to come back when the
interest rates drop a bit,'' said Ken Corba, chief investment
officer of Pimco Equity Advisors, which owns shares of
Bristol-Myers Squibb and Schering-Plough.
</P>
<P>
   Other factors are already in the stocks' favor. Many
drug-company executives think that President Clinton's plan to make
drug benefits a standard part of Medicare will be derailed, as have
most of his other health care initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   More important, the drug companies have continued to be strong
financial performers. Earnings are expected to swell 15 percent
this year, on average, at the largest American drug companies,
thanks to huge revenue gains in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson &AMP; Johnson increased its pharmaceutical sales in the
United States by 37.3 percent in the second quarter, compared with
the same quarter of 1998. Its shares have risen 9.8 percent this
year _ in part because the company is more diversified than most of
its competitors.
</P>
<P>
   The bargain-hunting may begin soon. The average
price-to-earnings ratio for large drug stocks has dropped from 39
last November to 32.3, only slightly higher than the 30.8 of the
S&AMP;P 500. Even the industry's earnings champions have become more
affordable. The P/E ratio for Warner-Lambert, for example, has
dropped to 36.7, from 52.2 in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``The valuations of the drug stocks have definitely fallen in
line,'' said Sergio Traversa, an analyst with Mehta Partners, a
research company in New York. ``You usually see some depression in
drug stock prices during the summer and a pickup in the fall. But
this could be a good buying opportunity for some investors.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts have taken note of the stocks' promise. Eli Lilly's
stock, for example, has dropped 29.5 percent this year, closing on
Friday at $62.6875. But a forecast from Ryan, Beck, Southeast
Research says the stock should reach $85 during the next 18 months,
up 35.6 percent. Warner-Lambert, meanwhile, has tumbled 16.5
percent, to $62.8125; the forecast is for it to reach $83, up 32
percent.
</P>
<P>
   But when drug stocks start rising, investors may find a new set
of troubles. Analysts worry that in the next few years, the
industry will not match its recent bounty of new high-revenue drugs
_ products like the arthritis drugs Vioxx, from Merck, and
Celebrex, from Monsanto and Pfizer.
</P>
<P>
   The next blockbuster drug may not come to market until late next
year, when Bristol-Myers is expected to introduce Vanlev, for
hypertension. Several companies are working on remedies for flu
symptoms, but analysts doubt that they will become huge sellers
because the illness is episodic, not chronic. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another challenge is maintaining a blockbuster's boom sales. As
recently as four years ago, a drug would not reach peak sales for
several years. But with the advent of consumer advertising,
prescription drugs are climbing to those peaks much faster, which
could mean revenue gaps between product introductions.
</P>
<P>
   That problem, of course, also has a positive side.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately, the drug companies are not only marketing faster,
they are reaching a larger market than what they did in the past,''
Traversa said. ``We're seeing less me-too drugs, ones that were
like something that already existed, now than in the '80s. They're
coming out with much more innovation.''

DISCO HEIRS TURN TO DECO HOTELS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 8) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MIREYA NAVARRO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI BEACH, Fla. _ The Rubell family, whose most famous member
_ Steve Rubell, co-founder of Studio 54 _ proved that hotels could
become as fashionable as discotheques, still speak of their trade
as more art than business.
</P>
<P>
   Since selling his shares in Manhattan hotels like the Royalton,
the Paramount and Morgans after his death in 1989 and shipping
their money, and themselves, south, the Rubells have become leaders
in restoring Art Deco hotels here _ hotels as trendy as those back
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Now they are expanding into other types of hotels and making
plans to work their way back up north.
</P>
<P>
   When Mera Rubell, 55, Steve's sister-in-law, thinks of her
family's business today, she says it calls to mind the sculpture
``Family Romance,'' by the California artist Charles Ray. It
depicts four members of a mannequin family holding hands _ the
parents, a son and a daughter _ all nude, all the same size.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the notion that each family member has equal power,''
Mrs. Rubell said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Rubell's equal partners in Rubell Hotels are her husband of
35 years, Dr. Donald Rubell, Steve's older brother, who is 58, and
their two children, Jennifer, 29, and Jason, 30. Three of them
moved to Florida in the early 1990s while Rubell, the former chief
of gynecology at Cabrini Medical Center in Manhattan, commuted on
weekends until last year, when he moved here, too.
</P>
<P>
   The Rubells, who are major collectors of contemporary art,
opened two renovated Art Deco hotels here in 1995 and 1997 _ the
Greenview, with 45 rooms, and the Albion, with 100. In October,
they will open a bigger, more luxurious hotel in a 1950s building
now under renovation, the 170-room Beach House Bal Harbour on the
shore in Surfside, a few miles north of here.
</P>
<P>
   And the family plans to expand by 2001 into Washington, where
negotiations are under way for the purchase of a 200-room property
near the Capitol. They said they are scouting other locations,
including New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   The Rubells also own the 70,000-square-foot Sony Building office
complex on Lincoln Road here and the Rubell Family Collection, a
permanent exhibition of contemporary art in a Miami warehouse.
Where so many other business families have blown apart, sometimes
in failure, they have achieved success by sticking together.
</P>
<P>
   At Rubell Hotels, Jason Rubell, an art history graduate of Duke
University, handles finances. He and his mother, who handles
property acquisitions, are also often at construction sites of new
projects like the Beach House Bal Harbour _ he deals with
architects, she with contractors.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Rubell, a Harvard University graduate who studied fine
arts, determines the hotels' style. She designs everything from
room decor to matchbooks. ``She's vice president in charge of
vibrations,'' her father said.
</P>
<P>
   Rubell's main job is just as quirky: he is the long-term
thinker, the spotter of new projects.
</P>
<P>
   The Rubells say their family business has worked because the
parents have given up much of their authority, ``the power of our
age,'' as Mrs. Rubell puts it. The children have likewise contained
their own egos, their desires to chart their own paths, ``to prove
yourself and bring back what you've done,'' Jason Rubell said.
</P>
<P>
   The reward, they agreed, is absolute trust in one another's
motivations, and the ability to work as a unit. `'I don't want to
sound mushy, but love is a powerful ingredient,'' Mrs. Rubell said,
a cue for the rest of her family to poke fun at her during a recent
interview at the Albion. ``That went out in the '60s, Mera,''
Rubell said.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Rubell, Rubell's only brother, gained fame as co-owner of
Studio 54, the 1970s New York City disco. After serving a prison
sentence for tax evasion, Rubell switched to the hotel business in
New York City with his former Studio 54 partner Ian Schrager and
two associates.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rubells, who were close to Steve, sold the hotel
interests they inherited from him to Schrager. At the time, Mrs.
Rubell owned a firm that sold office and retail properties in New
York. Her children were in college, but they had apprenticed with
their uncle and Schrager in the hotel business _ Jennifer full time
as the Royalton's first concierge, Jason overseeing construction of
the Paramount as a summer job.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until Jason moved to Florida in 1991 to open an art
gallery in Palm Beach, and later one here, that the other family
members started trickling in. Mrs. Rubell followed in 1993, when
she bought a seven-story office building on Lincoln Road that was
renamed the Sony Building when Sony Music International moved in.
</P>
<P>
   The first hotel purchase evolved from the needs of Sony Building
tenants for an affordable hotel nearby. Today, the Greenview and
the Albion, which includes an office and retail wing, have become
fashion, media and entertainment industry hubs.
</P>
<P>
   The hotels have gained the Rubells considerable recognition.
``They're a good example of what many hoteliers here are doing,''
said David Whitaker, senior vice president of marketing for the
Greater Miami Convention and Visitors Bureau. ``They've created
these spectacular new hotels, honoring the past.''
</P>
<P>
   The Beach House will cater to families but also provide
idiosyncratic features like a 24-hour food store and an aquarium
with 200 sea horses. The hotel will add 250 employees to the 100
that currently work for the company.
</P>
<P>
   The Rubells are due in New York City, the hotels' largest
market, for a media reception on Wednesday to talk about the Beach
House, which is scheduled to open on Oct. 20.
</P>
<P>
   The Rubells and Schrager, whose high-style 238-room Delano
opened in 1995 only two blocks from the Albion, now compete in the
same market. The Rubells say they have no contact with Schrager; he
had no comment himself.
</P>
<P>
   The family boasts that they emphasize service, aiming for the
intimacy of bed-and-breakfasts while offering the amenities of
bigger hotels. ``He really understood service,'' Ms. Rubell said of
her uncle Steve. ``That's what I learned from him. He gave me a
desire to make people feel special.''
</P>
<P>
   But these Rubells aren't putting up the sort of velvet ropes
that kept legions out of Studio 54. Their hotels, while stylish,
are inspired by the family's idea of their own welcoming home.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we lived in that environment, what would our house look
like?'' Rubell said. ``That really sums it up.''

COMING SOON: THE TAX-CUT WAR OF WORDS  
 BLACK CAUCUS CHAMPIONS LOWERY  
 SOUTH CAROLINA TO HAVE ITS SAY ON JUVENILE JUSTICE  
 AID FOR TOBACCO FARMERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk)

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Try this summer blockbuster on for size. Tax Cuts:
Are They a Phantom Fiscal Menace or Help for Runaway Brides and
Grooms?
</P>
<P>
   Republicans and Democrats plan on taking their dueling tax-cut
themes on the road this month in a concerted congressional-recess
effort to persuade the public of the righteousness of their
respective causes.
</P>
<P>
   Tired of being outflanked by President Clinton in the public
relations war, Republicans are scheduling high-profile events to
share with Americans the good tidings of $792 billion in tax cuts
that ease the burden on married couples, eliminate estate taxes and
cut capital gains and overall rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to go across the country in August and we're going
to let the American people know, number one, it's their money, not
Washington's money, and they're going to get to keep more of it to
spend the way they see fit,'' said Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, a
chief tax-cut architect.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats plan to counter that effort with a campaign of their
own, emphasizing their view that the Republican plan is
economically risky, would lead to across-the-board spending cuts
and doesn't leave sufficient money to reform Social Security and
Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't sell a truly bad idea and that is what they are
trying to do,'' said House Democratic Leader Richard Gephardt of
Missouri, predicting the GOP push would fail.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats almost uniformly rejected the GOP-crafted tax package,
drawing a clear party distinction on the issue. Even those
Democrats who backed the Senate package first time around thought
the final proposal was ill advised.
</P>
<P>
   One of those moderate Democratic lawmakers, Sen. John Breaux of
Louisiana, attributed the stalemate to the unwillingness of either
party to give ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real losers are the people in the middle and that's where
I believe most Americans are today,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sowing Civil Rights
</P>
<P>
   Several Southern lawmakers are pushing for the appointment of a
respected civil rights leader to oversee the dispersal of a
multimillion-dollar discrimination settlement with black farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Lowery, the retired president of the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference, was recommended for the post of ``monitor''
by members of the Congressional Black Caucus, including chairman
James Clyburn of South Carolina, Earl Hilliard of Alabama and Eva
Clayton of North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rev. Lowery has a proven track record and would lend a
tremendous amount of credibility to this office,'' they wrote in a
letter to Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman.
</P>
<P>
   Last January, the federal government reached a settlement with
black farmers who charged that they were subjected to
discriminatory lending practices over the years and suffered losses
as a result. The monitor would help determine how much money
individual farmers would get to settle their claims.
</P>
<P>
   Palmetto Players
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina lawmakers will have a strong voice in the final
stage of crafting a major juvenile justice bill that's become a
flash point for both gun control and religious expression.
</P>
<P>
   Freshman Republican Jim DeMint, who led the effort in the House
to protect religious expression in schools, was named to the
House-Senate conference committee that will hammer out differences
between the House and Senate bills. Sen. Strom Thurmond, a
Republican, was also named to that committee.
</P>
<P>
   DeMint vowed to fight efforts to crack down on gun ownership as
a way of combating violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about finding a comprehensive and common-sense
approach to youth violence _ ways to improve school safety, restore
strong neighborhoods and reinforce our shared community values,''
DeMint said.
</P>
<P>
   Staff members are expected to meet during the August recess and
lawmakers will get down to business on the juvenile justice bill
once they return in September.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco Road
</P>
<P>
   Cigarette companies are not all that popular on Capitol Hill but
tobacco growers can still find powerful allies.
</P>
<P>
   As it fashioned an emergency $7 billion farm aid measure, the
Senate added $328 million for tobacco farmers at the last-minute
insistence of Sen. John Edwards, D-N.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``Agriculture is in crisis,'' said Edwards, whose state could
get almost half of the tobacco aid. ``It is almost impossible for
North Carolina farmers, including its tobacco farmers, to make ends
meet.''
</P>
<P>
   The measure also included some relief for growers of peanuts and
cotton among other Southern staples.

PEACEKEEPERS COME UNDER FIRE ACROSS KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ Russian soldiers at three checkpoints
were fired on overnight and four other checkpoints were attacked, a
spokesman for the international peacekeeping forces said here
Friday. Sixteen people were arrested, he added.
</P>
<P>
   While the spokesman, Maj. Jan Joosten, insisted that the overall
security situation in Kosovo was improving, senior international
officials said they were troubled by the rash of attacks on
peacekeepers that has followed the killing of 14 Serbs in Gracko on
Aug. 1.
</P>
<P>
   They noted continuing threats against Russian peacekeepers by
the Kosovo Liberation Army, which regards the Russians as allies of
the Serbs, and attacks with small arms on NATO forces who are
trying to protect enclaves of Serbs remaining in the province. This
week about 1,000 Kosovar Albanians marched to protest the presence
of the Russians.
</P>
<P>
   ``The KLA seems sometimes to forget who won the war for them,''
one international official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Joosten, describing the night's events, said the peacekeepers
were ``very concerned about the current attacks against the
soldiers, and people should be reminded that our soldiers have
robust rules of engagement and the right to defend themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Peacekeepers have come under fire about 30 times since they
moved into Kosovo two months ago as Serbian forces withdrew,
including the seven incidents overnight, but the overall rate of
attacks has declined, Joosten said.
</P>
<P>
   In its effort to involve ethnic Albanian political leaders in
the reconstruction of the province, U.N. officials said, a
``transitional council'' of ethnic Albanians and Serbs plans to
hold its second meeting in the week of Aug. 16. Albanian leader
Ibrahim Rugova and his Democratic League are to take part for the
first time, the officials added.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Bernard Kouchner, the U.N. civilian director here,
held a dinner for Rugova and the KLA political leader, Hashim
Thaci, the first time the two men had met here, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Rugova boycotted the first council meeting, in mid-July, over
Thaci's allocation of the Albanian seats. But a political ally of
Rugova's party was granted another seat, and Rugova _ pressed by
NATO leaders to return to Kosovo last week _ agreed to end the
boycott.
</P>
<P>
   Rugova, 54, a Sorbonne-educated pacifist who had won secret
elections among ethnic Albanians as their leader, has been
overshadowed by the rebel army and by Thaci, 29, who is perceived
to have the support of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   While supervised elections in Kosovo are easily a year or more
away _ political institutions must be developed first _ ethnic
Albanian leaders are already struggling for influence, with
Rugova's party trying to show that all Albanians may not be
supporters of Thaci and the KLA.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials also announced that the first international
police officers _ 200 of an eventual 3,100 _ would begin patrolling
streets in Pristina over the weekend, working with peacekeeping
troops. Another 274 officers are in Kosovo getting briefings, said
U.N. Police Commissioner Sven Frederiksen.
</P>
<P>
   The police are to set up small stations open 24 hours a day in
hot spots, he said, mostly areas of town where Serbs are being
attacked by ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are still too many cases of harassment of minorities, of
capital crimes, and the only way to improve the situation is to be
there, to have a 24-hour presence,'' he said. Eventually the
foreign officers are to work alongside local policemen-in-training.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of August, the first class of local residents to be
accepted into the Kosovo police are to start training at a former
Serbian police academy that is being renovated.
</P>
<P>
   Frederiksen said 26,050 applications for the 3,000-strong local
force had been distributed and 17,111 returned. At least 4,000
former Kosovar guerrilla fighters have applied, but only 500 Serbs,
he said with disappointment. His goal, he said, is a multi-ethnic
force where Albanians and Serbs would work together as
professionals in ethnically mixed areas.
</P>
<P>
   Among the worst instances of violence overnight were these,
Joosten said:
</P>
<P>
   _ Three Russian checkpoints in Koretin and Kosovska Kamenica
were attacked, with unidentified people driving a vehicle into one
and firing shots at two others. A Russian soldier was wounded.
</P>
<P>
   _ American troops protecting a Serb's house in Urosevac
exchanged fire with attackers in a white station wagon, and an
American Apache helicopter followed the vehicle to Pristina. A
badly wounded man was arrested at Pristina Hospital, where the car
was found, but he was not identified.
</P>
<P>
   _ A patrol in Pec, in western Kosovo, came under fire and one
suspect was arrested. Near Pec, Italian troops seized a cache of
arms, including 11 rifles, an anti-tank rocket, grenades and 3,400
rounds of ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   Shots were also fired above a checkpoint near Prizren, where an
ethnic Albanian was arrested after weapons were found in his car,
and near a checkpoint in the Djakovica area, where there was one
arrest.

COMEBACK KID, ON VIDEO: THE BLOCKBUSTER OFFERING  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 8) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Texas)   (af)  
 By JOANNE LEGOMSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some investors shaken by the sharp selloff of recently issued
Internet stocks may find comfort in the coming initial public
offering of shares in Blockbuster Inc.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the Blockbuster debut is a turnaround story featuring
a bricks-and-mortar company with actual _ rather than virtual _
earnings and a brand name that is synonymous with video rentals.
And some analysts say the offering should be attractive because of
its pricing.
</P>
<P>
   Blockbuster, the No. 1 video retailer, has worked its way back
to profitability, but it has not been able to shake off concerns
that the onslaught of emerging technologies that deliver video on
demand will deal a body blow to the rental business. But company
presentations to investors in the last few days seem to have turned
some heads.
</P>
<P>
   In the coming week, Blockbuster's parent, Viacom Inc., is
expected to offer a 17.7 percent stake in Blockbuster to the
public, the first of a two-part transaction in which Blockbuster
will become independent. The shares are expected to be priced at
$16 to $18 each, giving the company a stock market value of $2.8
billion to $3.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The offering is to be followed by a tax-free split-off of the
rest of Blockbuster to Viacom shareholders late this year or in
early 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Viacom is pricing the shares to sell,'' said Larry Petrella, a
media analyst with Lehman Brothers. He noted that at $17 a share,
the midpoint of the expected price range, Blockbuster would be
valued at six times estimated cash flow of $640 million in 2000,
while media giants like Time Warner and Viacom have multiples in
the mid- to high teens.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Zied, a retail industry specialist with the Maverick
Corp., a Dallas-based hedge fund manager, said Blockbuster's hybrid
status _ part retailer, part entertainment company _ ``makes direct
valuation comparisons problematic.'' But he said that at $17,
Blockbuster would sell at 15.4 times estimated 2000 cash earnings
of $1.10, compared with 27 times for Circuit City, the big
electronics retailer.
</P>
<P>
   Just two years ago, the video rental industry ``looked like it
hit a brick wall,'' said Derek Baine, an analyst with Paul Kagan
Associates, the entertainment industry consultants. After years of
phenomenal growth, rental revenues declined in 1995 and 1997 before
rebounding last year. Baine projects increases of about 8 percent
this year and next.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say the industry's wounds _ and Blockbusters' _ were
self-inflicted and had little to do with competing technology.
After Viacom acquired Blockbuster in 1994 for almost $5.7 billion,
the 6,500-store video chain struggled with unsuccessful forays into
music retailing and ill-conceived merchandising strategies that had
the stores selling everything from M &AMP; M's to T-shirts.
</P>
<P>
   Two chief executives and $759 million in write-offs later,
Blockbuster is enjoying a striking turnaround. In 1998,
Blockbuster's current chief, John F. Antioco, signed ``revenue
sharing'' agreements with the major Hollywood movie studios that in
effect pushed them into financial partnerships with the retailer.
</P>
<P>
   Now, instead of paying an average of $65 for new tapes,
Blockbuster pays just $4 apiece on average. In exchange, it turns
over 30 percent to 40 percent of the rental income to the studios.
</P>
<P>
   The impact of revenue sharing was apparent in the second
quarter. Revenues climbed 17 percent from a year earlier, to $1
billion, reflecting a 13 percent gain from stores open in both
periods. Cash flow increased 61 percent, to $105 million.
Blockbuster's share of the home-video rental market reached 31
percent, up from 27 percent a few months earlier.
</P>
<P>
   More important, industry analysts say, the studios have no
incentive to tamper with the current 30-to-90-day window that makes
new films available in video stores before they can be shown
through other nontheatrical channels like pay-per-view, basic cable
or network television.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say that with revenue sharing, home video now accounts
for 48 percent of domestic film revenues for major studios, more
than double the 22 percent from domestic box office sales. Video
rental income is especially crucial to the profitability of less
popular titles.

 &HT;    SPECIAL INTERESTS FIND FREE RIDE IN FARM EMERGENCY
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Farmers in the East, suffering from the worst
drought of the century, must wait until fall for federal
assistance. But the disaster has already eased the way for new aid
for tobacco, sugar and peanuts commodities that have hardly been
touched by the weather.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a feeding frenzy,'' said John Frydenlund, an agricultural
specialist at Citizens Against Government Waste, a private watchdog
group, of this week's $7.4 billion ``emergency'' farm aid plan,
which the Senate attached to the annual agricultural spending bill.
</P>
<P>
   Since ``emergency'' measures are exempted from congressional
budget limits, the amendment was quickly loaded up with programs
that are the darlings of special interests.
</P>
<P>
   Among them: $42 million in direct payments to peanut producers
to compensate them for a recent drop in prices and a rise in
production costs, $328 million in direct aid to tobacco farmers,
and $15 million for a fishery.
</P>
<P>
   And these are only the starting point before the lawmakers
return from their August vacation to add relief plans for the
devastated farms in the drought-stricken East.
</P>
<P>
   The provisions that are hitchhiking on the farm aid measure
brought a strong protest from congressional ``pork buster'' Sen.
John McCain, R-Ariz., who told his colleagues on Tuesday that
``these provisions have no place in a bill to provide emergency
assistance to America's farmers.''
</P>
<P>
   But McCain, a presidential contender for 2000, found little
support in the Senate when he attempted to end the price support
program for sugar. Nor could he win backing to force the industry
to pay a federal tax that McCain called a ``miniscule assessment''
of 25 cents per 100 pounds of sugar.
</P>
<P>
   The defeat of McCain's effort was hailed by the American Sugar
Alliance as ``another indication of the solid support the Congress
gives'' to sugar producers, who received the ``emergency'' relief
although they have not been affected by the drought.
</P>
<P>
   Even when the Congress forges a final drought relief program,
some experts predict that those who need the aid the most will
benefit only marginally.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the most part, the farm programs help the people who are
well off,'' said Kevin McNew, an agriculture economist at the
University of Maryland. He estimated that 70 percent of farm
payments go to farmers with over $1 million in net worth.
</P>
<P>
   A widespread concern among farmers is that large operators will
use the federal aid to bid up already climbing rents for farmland,
often pricing the smaller farmers out of the market.
</P>
<P>
   Big operators won a boost in the Senate bill, which doubles the
current $75,000 cap for federal crop payments to a farmer to
$150,000. On a large multi-farm operation, a couple could qualify
for up to $300,000 in federal payments.
</P>
<P>
   That maximum would represent about 4,000 acres in the Midwest,
estimated Richard Newpher, executive director of the American Farm
Bureau, whose group has long sought an increase in the caps.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think there ought to be payment limits,'' he said,
adding that his group favors the most ``economically viable''
farming.

 &HT;    A mother's prayer line reaches out to Ohio youths
 &HT;    By Kathy Whyde Jesse
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Christina Hurr knows that kids reach a certain
age when there's only so much you can do for them. She has three
kids at that age now: a 16-year-old son and 14-year-old twins.
</P>
<P>
   And, although she knows they are bound to do things she won't
agree with, there's one thing she can always do about it: ``I can
always pray.''
</P>
<P>
   Hurr has seen prayer at work in her own life and in the lives of
her parents, who she recalls used to kneel by their bedside and
pray every night.
</P>
<P>
   She also believes in the power of intercessory prayer _ prayer
for others.
</P>
<P>
   That's why she has started Pray 4 Teens Ministry, where parents,
friends or the teens themselves can call or e-mail to request
prayer support.
</P>
<P>
   A phone line in her home is dedicated to the ministry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Churches have prayer chains, but there is nothing marketed to
teens,'' says Hurr, 45, curriculum instruction coordinator for the
Montgomery County Board of Mental Retardation.
</P>
<P>
   Teens may be embarrassed to ask for prayer, and parents of teens
may also feel ashamed if their kids have gone astray. That's why
Pray 4 Teens is answered by machine in the dining room of Hurr's
Centerville home. Callers can leave their initials, or their middle
name. Hurr doesn't offer any form of counseling, and she doesn't
call anyone back.
</P>
<P>
   Since the phone line opened in April, Hurr has prayed for 10
people. Although she is the only one who prays now, she hopes the
ministry grows to include teens who will pray for other teens.
</P>
<P>
   Although she and her husband, Joe, are members of St. Henry's
Catholic Church, she wants the ministry to be nondenominational.
``God doesn't care what church we come from when he listens to our
prayers,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Hurr has prayed all of her life, but the act has become more
meaningful to her as she has grown older. ``Now, I pray all the
time, whether I'm in church or not. I pray in the shower. I pray in
the car. I don't necessarily pray out loud, but I do tune out
everything else.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prayer is a discipline, but it is also spirit-led.''

<P>
   The phone line has been a vehicle for discussion with her own
family, where prayers are said every night at the dinner table.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to tell my kids when there's been an answer to a
prayer,'' she says, to reinforce the belief that prayer works.
</P>
<P>
   Her younger sons aren't always sure they believe in prayer. But
when their mother asks them to help with their prayers, they say
they'll do so.
</P>
<P>
   Their friends know about the prayer line, and ``they think it's
pretty cool,'' John says. He and his twin, Matt, say kids their age
might ask for prayer support for problems such as ``I got in a
fight with my best friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Hurr wants her kids to understand that ``the prayer of a good
person has a powerful effect.'' She keeps a small jar of mustard
seed on her windowsill to remind her of the words of Matthew 17:20:
``...if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed, you will say to
this mountain, `Move hence to yonder place,' and it will move; and
nothing will be impossible to you.''

 &HT;    SAVINGS UNDER NEW TAX BILL VARY WILDLY
 &HT;    330&AMP;add. For release Sunday, Aug. 8.
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ What's in it for me? That's what many Americans
wonder whenever Congress passes a big tax bill.
</P>
<P>
   But the most accurate answer for the Republican bill just passed
by Congress in the face of a certain veto by President Clinton can
only be an unsatisfactory straddle: It all depends.
</P>
<P>
   Deloitte &AMP; Touche LLP calculated the changes the bill could make
in the tax burdens on 30 different households at income levels
between $20,000 and $1 million. All the bill's major changes will
be in effect from 2005 through 2008.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only rule of thumb I can think of is that married couples
who have $50,000 to $60,000 of taxable income are going to see the
biggest effect,'' said Clint Stretch, director of tax policy in the
accounting firm's Washington office. ``But the numbers vary widely,
even for households at the same income level.''
</P>
<P>
   Here are the tax burdens on various households with identical
incomes of $50,000 a year before and after the changes:
</P>
<P>
   _ A single man with $48,500 in ordinary income and $1,500 in
long-term capital gains would see his $6,263 tax bill drop to
$5,900.
</P>
<P>
   _ A married couple with the same income from the same sources
would see its $4,725 tax bill drop to $4,405.
</P>
<P>
   _ A family of four with the same income from the same sources
would see its $2,900 tax bill drop to $2,635.
</P>
<P>
   _ A family of four with the same income from the same sources
that also pays college tuition of $3,000 a year would see its
$1,900 tax bill drop to $1,635.
</P>
<P>
   _ A retired couple with $30,000 from Social Security, $16,000 in
ordinary income and $4,000 in capital gains would see its $640 tax
bill drop to $388.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that's all before you take advantage of any of the
increased credits that could lower your taxable income,'' Stretch
said. Credits for child care, long-term health care and education
are among those expanded by the bill.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The variations grow out of the interaction of the three major
changes the bill would make in the current income-tax system.
</P>
<P>
   It lowers tax rates. When the changes are fully in effect, rates
drop by 10 percent for capital gains, which are the profits of
selling stocks, bonds or other property for more than they cost,
and by anywhere from 2.5 percent to 6.25 percent for ordinary
income, which includes wages, salaries, dividends and interest
earned.
</P>
<P>
   It also changes married couples' tax brackets in a way that
means the 28 percent marginal tax rate for some couples drops in
half to 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, it contains new or bigger credits, deductions and other
loopholes that can lower the level of taxable income for any
taxpayer, including corporations.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, how much the new system could affect you depends on
how much you make, which sources it comes from, and how many
credits, deductions and other loopholes you can take advantage of.
</P>
<P>
   Deloitte &AMP; Touche found that many households aren't affected at
all, because they wouldn't pay any income taxes either before or
after the changes.
</P>
<P>
   Examples of such non-payers:
</P>
<P>
   _ A married couple with two school-age children scraping by on
$20,000 a year. Before or after the change, they would actually get
a $2,228 refund, thanks to a work-subsidy device called the earned
income tax credit.
</P>
<P>
   _ A retired couple with $40,000 in income is unlikely to owe any
income taxes under either the current or new system if
three-fourths of its income comes in tax-sheltered Social Security
payments. The remaining one-fourth is offset by standard deductions
and personal exemptions.
</P>
<P>
   But most people do pay federal income taxes. The study showed
that those at different income levels would enjoy widely different
savings from the bill:
</P>
<P>
   _ In dollars, the annual tax savings per household ranges from
$9,861 to $130. The high is for a couple with two children living
on $1 million a year and the low is for a single person earning
$20,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   _ In percentages, the annual tax savings per household range
from 3.26 percent to 70 percent. The lowest is for that millionaire
couple, whose $302,377 tax burden drops to $272,517. The highest is
for a four-person family living on $35,000 in wages that pays
$3,000 in college tuition costs, and sees its $520 income-tax bill
drop to $156.

 &HT;    Relaxed rules likely to instigate `horse trading' of TV
properties
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The federal government's relaxation of television
ownership rules may promote some ``horse trading'' of stations in
metro Atlanta, according to industry observers.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Communications Commission, after lengthy debate,
decided this week to let a media company own two stations in the
country's top 50 markets. Atlanta is among the top 20 markets for
television.
</P>
<P>
   The big four networks and television holding companies have good
incentive to own more than one station in the large markets, a
practice called duopoly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Media choices have exploded,'' Nick Trigony, chairman of Cox
Broadcasting, which owns WSB-TV in Atlanta, has said. ``Cable
channels are TV stations for all practical purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   Station owners in town either couldn't be reached for comment
Friday or declined to comment about the change in rules.
</P>
<P>
   But outside experts say the Atlanta market is fertile ground for
some stations selling out and others adding to their local
holdings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suspect we'll see some consolidation in Atlanta,'' said Paul
Raymond, a industry consultant and media professor at Kennesaw
State University.
</P>
<P>
   Leland Westerfield, a media analyst at PaineWebber, agreed. ``In
select markets, including Atlanta, you're going to see some smart
horse trading,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Westerfield said the relaxation in ownership rules would force
all owners, especially the weak ones, to decide now whether to get
bigger or sell out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone's going to have to rethink their strategy,'' said
Westerfield.
</P>
<P>
   Trigony supported relaxing local ownership rules to let
companies own two stations in any one market _ but only in the 20
largest metro areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Duopoly only works if you have six to eight TV signals in a
market,'' says Trigony.
</P>
<P>
   Trigony was out of town Friday and couldn't be reached for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   But Raymond said that he wouldn't be surprised if Cox
Broadcasting, which owns the market leader in Atlanta, decided to
buy another station here. He also expects another acquirer in the
market might be Fox Television, which owns WAGA-TV, Channel 5.
</P>
<P>
   Cox Broadcasting is a unit of Atlanta-based Cox Enterprises,
which also owns The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   One media mogul who has already announced his intention to sell
at least some stations nationwide is Lowell W. Paxson, who controls
the PaxTV Network of stations in the 20 biggest cities. His
holdings include WPXA, Channel 14, in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're going into the duopoly game, we're the prettiest girl
at the duop dance,'' Paxson told The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, according to Westerfield, Paxson holds some ``pretty
attractive properties.

 &HT;    Reseller of PCs denies pirating software
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The owner of Microseconds, one of the Atlanta area
companies accused by Microsoft this week of selling pirated
software, said if his company sold counterfeit software it did so
unwittingly.
</P>
<P>
   Steven J. Brandt, who owns the two-site, $2 million-a-year PC
reseller, is accused of selling a pirated copy of Microsoft's
Windows 95 and Office Professional 97 and agreeing to sell a PC
with software for which there was no license.
</P>
<P>
   Microseconds is among the oldest and largest of five Atlanta
area computer dealers that Microsoft sued in federal court Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The companies could face up to $100,000 in damages per license.
A product like Office Pro 97, which is a package of programs, has
eight licenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``My understanding is what we have done is not illegal,'' said
Brandt. ``If we sold a PC with an illegal or pirated copy of
software, we bought it in good faith. And I can show you where we
bought it; there would be invoices.''
</P>
<P>
   In its filing, Microsoft claims Microseconds agreed to sell an
undercover Microsoft representative a PC with a pirated copy of
Windows 95. Microsoft followed that up with a letter asking
Microseconds to stop selling software for which it does not have
licenses. In April and July, a private detective hired by Microsoft
bought what the company claimed were counterfeit copies of both
Windows 95 and Office Professional 97.
</P>
<P>
   Brandt remembers receiving the letter from Microsoft. But he
said he assumed it was a form letter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I read it, did not realize that it pertained to us directly
and never gave it a second thought,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Software programs come with license agreements as a way to
determine whether a copy is legal. A software company gets paid
once for each version of software it sells. With pirated software,
one legal copy of an operating system software program such as
Windows 95 could be installed illegally on several PCs.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft attorney Nick Psyhogeos said companies cannot legally
sell software for which it does not have a license. The company
estimates that one of five software programs being used in Georgia
is a pirated copy.
</P>
<P>
   Microseconds buys computers from consumers and companies selling
old equipment or from stores with excess inventory or ones going
out of business. The PCs it sells on consignment may come with or
without licenses for the software stored on the hard drive, Brandt
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the middleman,'' he said. ``We assume they have not
broken the law when they brought it to us. We assume they brought
in a legal copy.''

FIGHTING BACK: COLOMBIAN CITIZENS REFUSE TO PAY RANSOMS TO
KIDNAPPERS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (For release Sunday, Aug. 8) 
 
By JOHN OTIS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CALI, Colombia _ While their kidnappers roared down the highway
in a convoy of trucks, Norma Beron and her husband, Roy Saykay,
decided that this crime would not pay.
</P>
<P>
   The couple was among about 150 worshippers snatched by leftist
guerrillas May 30 during Mass at La Maria Catholic Church on the
outskirts of Cali. Huddled in the back of one of the trucks, Saykay
whispered to his wife that if she managed to escape, she must not
negotiate a ransom for his release.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me, `I would rather die than have you pay anything,'''
said Beron, who fled to freedom later that day along with dozens of
other hostages as Colombian army troops chased the rebels into the
mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Such resolve is catching on.
</P>
<P>
   In a defiant gesture aimed at rolling back Colombia's soaring
rate of kidnappings, a small but growing number of people are
refusing ransom payments.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, relatives of 39 of the 45 remaining captives from
the church kidnapping signed a public document rejecting
guerrillas' demands for cash. The families of other hostages as
well as business leaders, ranchers and other potential kidnapping
victims are considering similar declarations to discourage future
abductions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time to stop all of this. It's time to tell these
cretins: No more!'' said Mario Otoya, a photographer, whose brother
and sister-in-law were grabbed at La Maria church and are still in
rebel custody.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts believe that this citizen-led effort is the first of
its kind in the world. Although it's unclear whether the tactic
will work, people say that something drastic had to be done.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia has the highest number of kidnappings in the world.
Last year, there were 2,216 abductions pulled off by guerrillas,
paramilitaries, drug dealers and criminal gangs.
</P>
<P>
   During the first seven months of this year, 1,467 Colombians
were taken hostage _ a rate of nearly seven per day. Many were
caught at guerrilla roadblocks, a tactic called ``miracle fishing''
in which the rebels stop dozens of cars in the hopes of snagging
rich motorists.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem is that huge swaths of countryside are under
guerrilla control, making rescues more difficult. The justice
system is weak, and some convicted criminals continue to order
kidnappings from behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   ``The risk is small because there is a high level of impunity
and police reaction is slow,'' said Juan Francisco Mesa, a lawyer
for the Free Country Foundation, a support group in Bogota for
relatives of hostages.
</P>
<P>
   Some hostages escape or are freed by authorities, while a small
number are killed. But cash payments, averaging about $50,000, are
extracted for the freedom of nearly half of all captives, Mesa
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each time someone pays a ransom, it provides the money for
kidnappers to carry out their next abduction,'' the National Police
chief, Rosso Jose Serrano, told the Colombian magazine Cambio.
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, Colombia outlawed such transactions in 1993,
banned the purchase of kidnapping insurance _ which reimburses the
policy-holder for ransom payments _ and gave authorities the power
to freeze the bank accounts of relatives of hostages.
</P>
<P>
   Similar laws succeeded in Italy and Ireland and appeared to make
a difference in Colombia. The number of reported abductions dropped
30 percent in 1993. But some analysts believe that Colombians
simply stopped reporting the crime in order to negotiate ransoms
without government interference.
</P>
<P>
   Enforcement of the new laws was also lax. One of the few people
jailed was Rene Higuita, the star goalie for Colombia's national
soccer team, who was caught negotiating a ransom payment with
associates of the late drug lord Pablo Escobar.
</P>
<P>
   After 10 months, most of the anti-kidnapping provisions were
struck down by the nation's highest court, which ruled that life is
so precious that Colombians must be allowed to pursue the freedom
of hostages.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know people who have had relatives kidnapped for more than a
year. They feel totally alone in their pain. How can you tell them
to pay or not to pay?'' said Ximena Corzo, whose brother, a
Colombian congressman, was taken hostage in April when guerrillas
hijacked an Avianca domestic flight.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the voluntary no-ransom movement has wide support.
In a recent poll by the magazine Cambio, 95 percent of respondents
supported the idea.
</P>
<P>
   In Cali, leaders of the effort meet every day under a tent next
to the city's bull ring to talk to journalists, promote their
stance and raise each other's spirits.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is like therapy to a lot of us,'' said Otoya, the
photographer, who is taking care of his kidnapped brother's three
children. ``We are leaning on each other.''
</P>
<P>
   For some, the decision to sign the no-ransom pledge was easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not rich. In my case, I don't have the resources to pay
one peso,'' said Gina Camacho, whose husband, Daniel, was grabbed
at La Maria church.
</P>
<P>
   Others muse about whether the hostages would agree with their
position.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wonder if they are asking: `What the hell are they doing?'''
Otoya said. ``I hope they think that we are doing the right
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the sensational nature of the church assault
convinced the families that their protest might work.
</P>
<P>
   The raid was carried out by the National Liberation Army, or
ELN, a guerrilla group that wants to open peace talks with the
government. President Andres Pastrana, who was kidnapped by drug
dealers a decade ago, said he will not negotiate with the ELN until
the hostages are released ``without conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, by kidnapping worshippers during a Mass, the rebels
sparked protests around the world and received a rebuke from Pope
John Paul II. Last week, Monsignor Isaias Duarte, the archbishop of
Cali, excommunicated the rebels involved in the raid.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is so much international attention on this case that
surely nothing will happen to (the hostages). The guerrillas can't
commit the political error of killing them,'' Mesa said.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, relatives of 16 hostages taken during the Avianca
hijacking and 11 sport fishermen snatched by the ELN rebels in June
are debating whether or not to go public with a similar statement.
There are also plans to make a no-ransom document available at
public notaries.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the risks are substantial.
</P>
<P>
   The National Cattle Ranchers Federation approved a no-ransom
policy in 1990, and since then two of its board members have been
kidnapped and killed by guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem is that most kidnappings are driven by profit
rather than politics, minimizing the effect of local and
international political pressure.
</P>
<P>
   The vast majority of kidnappings are individual abductions;
family members lack the group support that often develops among
relatives dealing with group kidnappings.
</P>
<P>
   Even the solidarity of the Cali group could fall apart if the
ordeal drags on, said Mike Ackerman, managing director of the
Ackerman Group, a Miami-based security consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guerrillas tend to use time as a weapon. They control
territory, and they'll just keep the hostage until you decide that
you're going to change your mind,'' he said. ``Some fairly big fish
were taken in Cali. As time passes, it wouldn't surprise me if
money did change hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Camacho, wife of one of the church hostages and an advocate of
the no-ransom movement in Cali, disagrees. ``It has to be a
personal philosophy. If you have it in your head that you will not
pay, this whole business will come to an end.''

   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip _ Last February, Palestinian agents foiled
an attempted suicide bombing in Tel Aviv planned by Hamas, an
organization opposed to peace agreements with Israel, members of
the Palestinian security forces say.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, members of the Central Intelligence Agency, hovering
in the background, trekked the grimy streets of Gaza and
whitewashed towns of the West Bank to piece together what exactly
the Palestinians had done to prevent the attack.

<P>
   It's an unusual role for the CIA, one that has thrust the
organization into the uncomfortable position of judging whether
Palestinians, and by extension, Israelis, are keeping their peace
obligations. Israel 's new prime minister, Ehud Barak, hopes to
change that role.
</P>
<P>
   Since taking office July 6, Barak has said he would like to see
the United States revert to its traditional role as ``facilitator''
of peace negotiations, rather than continue as arbiter of
never-ending disputes over which side is failing to live up to its
part of signed agreements.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. role as arbiter may have been necessary after the Wye
Accords were signed last October, Barak maintains, when relations
between the Palestinians and Israel's out-going prime minister,
Benjamin Netanyahu, were mired in mistrust.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike his feisty predecessor, Barak says he is eager to
complete a comprehensive peace deal with Palestinians within 15
months. Since he intends to negotiate in good faith, he says the
United States' role as arbiter is no longer needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the U.S. should be a factor in negotiations,'' said
Zvi Stauber, one of Barak's top political advisers. ``But it should
not be a judge who gets involved in small details.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the Americans seem eager to take up Barak's suggestion,
take a step back, and let Israelis and Palestinians solve disputes
without outside intervention. The hope is that Barak's good
intentions will nurture good will and produce breakthroughs in
negotiations without much U.S. prodding.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians, however, say they are less keen on seeing the
CIA's unprecedented role diminish. Nor are they enthusiastic about
the prospects that the United States might remove itself as arbiter
of disputes.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Palestinians have asked the United States to step in to
help resolve their latest disagreement with Israel, this one over
the timing of the implementation of the Wye peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erakat on Friday renewed that
call for help, reminding that President Clinton had brokered the
agreement last October.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Palestinian National Authority has officially demanded
that the United States guarantee the honest and faithful
implementation of signed accords, particularly Wye,'' Erakat said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We told them they must intervene to guarantee implementation
of the accords because the United States is responsible for the
peace process,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has said fully carrying out the Wye agreement now would
isolate and endanger Jewish settlements. On Friday, Barak responded
to doubts about his resolution by reiterating his pledge to
implement Wye as originally designed if the Palestinians do not
agree to delaying the final withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said I will implement Wye as it was signed by Netanyahu,
provided the Palestinians do their part,'' he told Israel TV.
</P>
<P>
   Without hands-on CIA involvement, Palestinians say, no one would
be there to verify that they had in fact foiled attacks, such as
the one they prevented last February.
</P>
<P>
   Rashid Abu Shabak, deputy head of the Gaza-based Palestinian
Preventive Security, the organization charged with fighting
terrorism, cites several such instances and say that, more often
than not, the CIA agreed that Palestinians were doing their job _
praise Palestinians say helped them counter Israeli allegations to
the contrary.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Abu Shabak says, his men have confiscated dozens of
illegal weapons, arrested opposition leaders and made sure 11
militants wanted by Israel for terrorist activity were behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Americans had a positive opinion of this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the CIA were not available for comment. One U.S.
official said that the Palestinians had been diligent in their
efforts to prevent violence, but less so when it came to seizing
illegal weapons and fulfilling other security obligations.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Mohammed Dahlan, head of Preventive Security in Gaza,
said Palestinians welcomed intensive CIA involvement in training
Palestinian police and in overseeing their operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Americans are here to say whether we are fulfilling our
obligations or not,'' Dahlan said. ``Their role is to watch ... to
make sure we implement the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We benefit from it,'' he added. ``We don't agree that the
Americans should leave.''
</P>
<P>
   One windfall the Palestinians may be afraid of losing, say
observers here, is closer ties with the United States than they
have ever had before. While relations between the United States and
Israel strained during Netanyahu's term, ties grew between
Palestinians and Americans to unprecedented warm levels.
</P>
<P>
   When Barak entered office, he pledged to repair those frayed
ties by, among other things, removing the United States from an
awkward role that often pitted it against Israel and put it on the
Palestinians' side.
</P>
<P>
   It still remains unclear how, or indeed whether, the CIA's role
will change in any substantial way. But without a third party
playing judge, Palestinians say they fear Israel will be the only
one to determine whether Palestinian police units are doing their
utmost to stop violence.
</P>
<P>
   As long as Israeli-Palestinian relations are good and peace
negotiations stay on track, leaving Israel to determine Palestinian
compliance might not prove a hindrance to furthering peace.
</P>
<P>
   But renewed talks have already run into trouble over the timing
of the transfer of West Bank land to Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Removing the Americans, Palestinians say, gives Barak too much
wiggle room to maneuver out of obligations and then cite
Palestinian noncompliance as a pretext for halting further land
transfers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants to play with the facts without anyone else around,''
Dahlan said. ``We don't want security used as an excuse.''

<P>
   MAJDAL SHAMS, Golan Heights _ Lining up among the tents pitched
in the apple orchards of this mountain village, the Druse children
belted out their summer camp cheer as two Syrian flags fluttered
overhead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Syria! Syria! Syria!,'' they shouted, fists raised, as morning
fog lifted from Majdal Shams, at the foot of Mount Hermon on the
northern edge of the Israeli-held Golan Heights. ``Golan, Golan,
Golan! Withdrawal, withdrawal, withdrawal!''
</P>
<P>
   The cry was for an Israeli withdrawal from the Golan, a
strategic plateau captured from Syria in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war
and annexed by Israel in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Withdrawal _ al-jalaa in Arabic _ is in fact the name of the
pro-Syrian summer camp here where more than 300 youngsters spent 10
days of patriotic fervor, within sight of Syria and under
occasional surveillance by the Israeli authorities.
</P>
<P>
   As Israel and Syria gingerly feel their way toward a possible
renewal of peace talks broken off three years ago, Syrian
nationalist sentiment is running high among many of the 18,000
Druse who live in four villages in the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
   Members of an offshoot from Islam that numbers about 400,000 in
Syria, Lebanon, Israel and Jordan, the Druse in Golan are
contemplating the prospect of a return of their villages to Syrian
control. Syria is demanding an Israeli withdrawal as the price of
peace, and the Druse villages may well be the first areas handed
over if a treaty is signed.
</P>
<P>
   Although they have enjoyed relative prosperity under Israeli
rule while Syria's economy has struggled, few Druse will say they
prefer what is widely viewed here as a foreign occupation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economic situation comes and goes, but your homeland comes
first,'' said Zeid Aweidat, a grocer in Majdal Shams. ``Just
because you drive a Mercedes doesn't mean you abandon your poor
mother.''
</P>
<P>
   At Camp Withdrawal, now in its eighth season, Syrian patriotism
and Arab solidarity were flaunted openly, in defiance of the
Israelis. Two Syrian flags and a Palestinian banner flew in the
middle of the encampment, tents bore names of cities and ancient
sites in Syria and a surrounding fence was covered with posters
made by campers celebrating ``Arab Syrian Golan.''
</P>
<P>
   The camp T-shirt bore a map of the Arab world and the words:
``My homeland, no matter how long forgotten. Thousands have come to
occupy it, but they will melt away like the snow.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with sports, music, art and outings to a swimming pool,
the camp offered field trips to ruins of Golan villages that were
emptied when Israel captured the area in 1967. Dozens of villages
were destroyed in the aftermath of the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Campers were told about the history and geography of Syria and
regaled with tales of famous battles like Saladdin's 12th-century
campaigns against the Crusaders and the Battle of Maithalun in
1920, when Syrian nationalists fought French troops who marched on
Damascus.
</P>
<P>
   Ayman Abu Jabal, 33, a director of the camp, said it was set up
to counter the Israeli-controlled curriculum of schools on the
Golan Heights, where Druse children learn Hebrew as well as Arabic
and Middle Eastern history devoid of Arab nationalist content.
</P>
<P>
   ``Israel is trying to turn them into Israelis, and we reject
that,'' Abu Jabal said. ``We want to teach our children that we
have a homeland, a nation, a people that we're very proud of.''
</P>
<P>
   That nation is Syria, not Israel, and the people are Arab, not
Druse, said Fawzi Abu Jabal, 45, another camp director, who served
10 years in jail for spying for Syria.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are Syrian Arabs living under Israeli occupation,'' he
said. ``We're part of the Arab nation. There is no Druse people
with a separate history. That disinformation is spread by Israel,
to divide and rule.''
</P>
<P>
   The campers, who included a few Israeli Arabs and Palestinians
from East Jerusalem, clearly got the message.
</P>
<P>
   ``We learned to love our homeland, defend our nation and hate
Zionism,'' said Badia Sabra, a 13-year-old boy from the Druse
village of Masadeh.
</P>
<P>
   Khaled Abu Shahin, 14, from the neighboring village of Buqata,
said that after three summers at the camp, his perspective on
Israel had changed. Visiting the ruins of a village destroyed after
the 1967 war made him feel that ``Israel is unjust,'' he recalled
in the eloquent Hebrew he learned in school.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw it, I couldn't believe the Israelis could be so
harsh,'' Khaled said. ``I had thought they were good. Now I believe
that only our people are good for us. We want to return to Syria
and live with our true people, like our grandparents did.''
</P>
<P>
   OPTIONAL TRIM.
</P>
<P>
   The yearning for Syria is not only political. The Golan Druse
have relatives in Syria from whom they have been separated for
years by the mines and fences along the dividing line.
</P>
<P>
   Not far from the summer camp, across what is called here the
Valley of Tears, members of the divided Abu Salah clan, living on
both sides of the fence, used megaphones to console each other
after the death of a relative in Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in traditional black, with white headdresses, the Abu
Salahs from Majdal Shams took turns greeting relatives clustered on
the opposite hill in Syrian territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``How are you?'' said an old woman in a white kerchief,
listening for the reply wafting over the valley. ``Sister, we
console you from here. We hope we'll meet soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Nahi Abu Salah, grieving for her uncle, sang a lament and a plea
for the fences to come down. ``If only I could have been with you,
even at your funeral,'' she chanted into the megaphone as women
wept beside her. ``Let the missing return. Have mercy on us. Let a
mother see her long lost son.''

<P>
   Tupperware-style parties and door-to-door sales pitches are no
longer enough for Handtech.com, the ambitious little Austin, Texas,
company that has created a buzz in the computer industry by selling
systems in your living room.
</P>
<P>
   With a mix of easy credit and customer hand-holding _ hence its
name _ the three-year-old company envisions making a bundle not
only by selling computers to the 50 million American households
that don't have them, but also by getting its customers onto the
Internet, where they can buy more Hand products directly.
</P>
<P>
   And even as it seeks to move more operations on line, it will
use its Amway-style sales force to show existing customers how to
use what they have bought or might buy later, not just to make
initial computer sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal is to build a substantial channel to sell
computers,'' said Andrew Harris, the company's chief executive and
co-founder. ``This company can become as big as any company selling
computers today. This can become a multibillion-dollar corporation.
It's very similar to Dell in the mid-'80s.''
</P>
<P>
   That is big talk from this tiny company, which changed its name
last month to Handtech.com from Hand Technologies Inc. Hand sold
just $4.2 million of personal computers last year, less than a
quarter of what Dell sells in a single day, and analysts don't see
Hand making inroads anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   The business of selling computers has become a big-name,
big-money brawl with seemingly little opportunity for small
players. Even some of the giants are being battered by plunging
prices and rebates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet mania is peaking,'' said Eric Schmitt, an analyst
at the Internet research firm Forrester Research. ``The well of
first-time buyers is drying up.''
</P>
<P>
   And, he added, some 13.5 million of the 50 million households
without computers cannot afford them.
</P>
<P>
   But Hand has a deep-pockets ally that is considerably more
optimistic than Schmitt: the Fingerhut Companies, the
second-largest catalog retailer in the country, behind J.C. Penney.
Fingerhut holds a 28.1 percent stake in Hand and is giving it
access to the 31 million names in its own data base, focusing on
low- to middle-income families, and the 59 million names in that of
its parent, Federated Department Stores.
</P>
<P>
   Through Fingerhut's credit policy and payment plans, Hand can
finance high-interest computer purchases to low-income people and
people with bad credit histories.
</P>
<P>
   William J. Lansing, Fingerhut's chief executive, predicted that
Hand could be a billion-dollar company within two to three years.
But, he cautioned, ``I don't think we will be taking the wind out
of Dell's sails anytime soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris said Hand has shown 30 percent revenue growth each
quarter. But the company has yet to make a profit and does not
expect one until the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
   Harris and Martin Slagter, Hand's president, are British-born
marketing veterans who started the company in 1996, after testing
the door-to-door selling concept for computers in Britain.
Previously, Harris spent five years building the international
operations of the Dell Computer Corp. from a $70 million into a
$1.4 billion business.
</P>
<P>
   He left Dell in 1992 after losing a bid for a more senior
position, and Slagter, who was leading Dell's business in Europe,
followed him to Austin, which is also Dell's headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Based on Harris' track record and business plan, the company
attracted $6.75 million from private investors. Harris and Slagter,
who also invested $1.5 million of their own money, own about 29
percent of the company.
</P>
<P>
   On a company Web page intended to attract sales representatives,
Harris is shown next to the message: ``We took Dell to the top, and
we'll do the same with you.'' But getting Hand to the top won't be
so easy in an industry filled with price wars, discounts and even
free PCs.
</P>
<P>
   Micron Electronics Inc. and FreePC.com Inc. are offering free
machines to customers who sign up for online service, while rebates
are being offered to Internet customers by big names like America
Online's Compuserve division, Prodigy Communications and
Microsoft's MSN.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In this fiercely competitive atmosphere, CompUSA Inc., the
biggest computer retailer and the only one devoted mainly to sales
of personal computers, is closing as many as 14 of its 211
superstores, eliminating hundreds of jobs and adding more consumer
electronics items to its lineup. And the Good Guys, which operates
80 consumer electronics stores in California and four other states,
said this month that it was leaving the PC business altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Even the direct-selling giant, Dell, has been buffeted. ``It's
an ugly business now,'' Schmitt said. ``Dell said they'd never go
below $1,000, and they have,'' now selling computers for much less.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a game for people with deep pockets and an established
name,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   But Harris is undaunted. He is going after buyers the others
have ignored. ``We actually have someone in your home showing you
how to get on the Internet and how to buy from us,'' he said.
``We're actually energizing people to get on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``From that we can make money,'' he added, alluding to the
company's online storefront, which sells accessories, software,
upgrades and Web-based tutorials.
</P>
<P>
   Simple sales of basic computers to friends and neighbors,
sometimes at Tupperware-style get-togethers, have become less
important as the company takes in more revenue from Internet sales.
And the person-to-person contacts themselves have become more
focused _ aimed, for example, at a small-business owner or at local
business groups.
</P>
<P>
   The company's operations are heavily Web-based. Orders are
processed through its site, and the sales staff uses it to
calculate commissions and to communicate with teams and with the
company.
</P>
<P>
   Hand also values flexibility. Systems are built to order,
keeping inventories low and letting prices change with the market.
Sales representatives focus on the company's own line of PCs,
called Vivapro, but Hand also has partnership agreements to sell
computers from Emachines, Compaq and IBM Hand has tried to roll
with the market by offering a $400 discount on its own machines for
customers who sign up for three years of online service at $21.95 a
month.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, customers pay for the company's hand-holding.
Consider someone with $300 to spend on a new basic computer. He
could get a $699 Vivapro model _ with speed and capacity similar to
what is standard for most computers at the lower end of the market
_ and, after signing up for Hand's online service, a $400 rebate.
</P>
<P>
   The customer would get $500 of vouchers to use in online
shopping at other sites, but neither a printer nor a monitor.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, for $300 (after a $400 Compuserve rebate for
customers who sign up for three years' service and a $50 Lexmark
rebate), a leading computer store advertising last week offered a
Compaq Presario 5304 with greater speed and capacity _ and a
monitor and a printer thrown in.

   LAKE WARAMAUG STATE PARK, Conn. _ Shhh. Listen.
</P>
<P>
   At the campground here, there is no bzzz-bzzz-buzzing around the
ears of vacationers trying to sleep under the stars. No thwack,
thwacking, palm on thigh, of picnickers in the park. No
scratch-scratching of children's fingernails _ nor tsk, tsking of
reprimanding adults _ the next morning.
</P>
<P>
   That silence is the sound of a mosquito-free summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year I was playing connect the dots with the mosquito
bites on my legs,'' said 12-year-old A.J. De Marco of New Canaan as
she and her campground cronies captured and then released Leppy the
leopard frog. ``I'm usually covered, but now all I have is
scratches from climbing the mountain.''
</P>
<P>
   As one of the hottest and driest summers in history plagues
farmers throughout the Eastern seaboard and Midwest, consider this
the up side: Mosquitoes are as scarce as the little puddles and
pools their eggs need to hatch.
</P>
<P>
   Truth be told, the season is not quite mosquito-free. There have
been scattered swarms of the salt-water mosquitoes that breed in
coastal marshes whenever high tide comes. But the far more common
species that blanket inland areas each year are largely missing.
</P>
<P>
   In Connecticut, scientists found an average of 250 mosquitoes a
week in each of their 37 traps during July 1998; in July this year,
it was about 75. In Suffolk County, N.Y., the mosquito catch in
July was 6,152 _ compared with 27,161 the previous July.
</P>
<P>
   In Monmouth County, N.J., mosquito-watchers counted 1,711 in
traps in July, about one-fifth of the July average for the previous
six years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been, probably, the quietest summer we've had in years,''
said Martin Chomsky, superintendent of the Monmouth County Mosquito
Extermination Commission. ``I would say that this is a record year
in terms of the lack of freshwater mosquitoes.''
</P>
<P>
   Gardeners are going outside without bug nets. Summer people are
eating dinner on the deck. Mosquito researchers in Vero Beach,
Fla., had to travel to a different part of the state to track down
their subjects.
</P>
<P>
   And the Rite Aid and CVS pharmacy chains both say sales of
mosquito-related products, from Citronella candles to bug spray,
are off about 25 percent nationwide, and even more in the
drought-ridden areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very prepared with the itchy stuff, the calamine and
Caladryl, and we haven't had to use it,'' said Clara D'Angelo, the
nurse at Camp Waneeshi in Salt Point, N.Y., where 90 Girl Scouts
pitch tents each night. ``I'm well prepared for mosquitoes that
don't exist.''
</P>
<P>
   Scientists say the phenomenon is simple: ``If you understand
that mosquitoes need water,'' reasoned Dr. Wayne Crans, director of
Mosquito Research and Control at Rutgers University, ``no water,
you're not going to have mosquitoes.''
</P>
<P>
   But, as if anticipating the long-awaited rain that fell
Thursday, Crans cautioned that the pesky population can regenerate
itself as quickly as a flash flood. ``They're waiting,'' he said
ominously.
</P>
<P>
   After biting humans, female mosquitoes use the blood they suck
to produce hundreds of eggs. They lay these eggs in places where
small patches of water gather _ tree holes, tires, ditches, an
empty can, a pothole, a planter _ as the spots are drying out. When
the water returns, the larvae mature into full-blown mosquitoes.
The females go out and bite, and the cycle starts over.
</P>
<P>
   Weeks without rain has left puddles dusty, tires and cans empty.
The flood channel where A.J. De Marco and her friends were playing
is typically a steady stream, but on a recent day barely managed a
trickle.
</P>
<P>
   The eggs, however, are still there, unharmed by the heat and
drought. They can wait. And wait. For years. A dose of rain, or
even a splash from a hose, and, after about 10 days, they'll be off
and biting.
</P>
<P>
   How many mosquitoes depends entirely on how much rain: Think of
mosquitoes laying eggs in concentric circles around a puddle's
ever-shrinking edge as it dries out. If the puddle fills up again,
all those eggs will hatch; if less water lands, the outer rings of
eggs will remain dormant.
</P>
<P>
   Jan Washburn, a mosquito specialist at the University of
California at Berkeley, said, ``My advice? Enjoy it while you
can.''

<P>
   As dusk descends on campsite No. 35 at Lake Waramaug, the Grom
family is deep in mosquito-free enjoyment, gathering around the
flickering fire, marshmallows and sticks at the ready.
</P>
<P>
   The door to the screen porch in front of the mobile home is wide
open. A fly-swatter hangs unused on a pole, its orange plastic
weave unstained by death. Later, guests gather for an outdoor
screening of ``Forest Gump.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been here two weeks and I haven't used bug spray once,''
said Glen Grom, who has spent 26 of his 33 summers on this spot.
The Citronella candle on the picnic table, he added, ``is more for
light than anything. It's psychological.''
</P>
<P>
   Others hardly noticed the difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess since we haven't thought of it, there haven't been
any,'' said Janell Barnao, 20, of Dover Plains, who was lounging by
the lake with her family.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a while,'' said Ms. Barnao's father, Don, ``to
realize what's missing.''
</P>
<P>
   Though traditionally buggy sites like Lake Waramaug, the New
Jersey bayfronts and many parks and beaches on New York's Long
Island seem remarkably mosquito-free, certain spots have been hit
hard by the salt-water mosquitoes, whose multiplication does not
depend on rain. The lack of rain has, in some cases, given these
species more places to breed, as more marshy land dries out. When
the highest tides come at the new moon and full moon, these marshes
get wet, and about 10 days later, the swarms begin.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the baby returned from Shelter Island this weekend, she
was so covered in bites that I thought she might be having a
chicken pox outbreak,'' said Monica Monterroso of Sea Cliff, who
baby-sits for a one-year-old girl. ``Her mother and I took her to
the doctor and learned that another infant had been in that day
with the same problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Salt-water mosquitoes also can fly up to 15 miles to find
targets, so even some inland areas are getting hit.
</P>
<P>
   In areas where mosquitoes are missing, other insects have taken
their place in the complaint department. At Lake Waramaug, the
gnats are nasty and Rick Kundert, a fire fighter from Norwalk, was
flexing his tattooed forearm swatting black flies.
</P>
<P>
   In New Jersey, Chomsky said he has found unusual waves of
greenhead flies and midges, tiny insects that look like mosquitoes
but don't bite. Everywhere, it seems there are infestations of
ants, who love the steamy heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bugs have been awful,'' said Lisa Gatti, director of
Pal-O-mine, a horseback-riding program for the disabled at the
Willow Tree Farm in Huntington, where barn administrators recently
ordered a shipment of ecologically engineered nonbiting wasps to
eat the excess flies. ``You can't even ride the bugs are so bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Mosquitoes are not the sole food source for any other animal,
experts said, so there will be little impact on the larger
ecosystem from the population decline. While the reduced number of
mosquitoes also reduces the risk for the diseases they carry,
experts noted that the high season for Eastern equine encephalitis
_ a deadly virus that has appeared in the region in recent years _
comes in late August and September.
</P>
<P>
   Once enough rain comes, whenever it comes, mosquitoes will
quickly return to their former strength. Next summer should be
mosquitoes-as-usual, unless there is another drought.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every single spring we get a call and they say, `We've had a
mild winter and we've had a wet spring, the mosquitoes are going to
be terrible, right?' And we say we cannot really predict,'' laughed
Crans, one of the nation's leading experts in the field. ``If you
could give us long-range weather projections, we can tell you about
mosquitoes.''
</P>
<P>
   Mosquitoes, being scarce, were not available for interviews.

EMPLOYMENT REPORT DRIVES UP TREASURY YIELDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By ROBERT HURTADO    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Yields of U.S. government bonds surged Friday to
their highest level in 20 months after the Labor Department's July
employment report added to the mounting concern that the Federal
Reserve will raise interest rates later this month.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Reserve policy-makers raised the target rate for
overnight lending by a quarter-point, to 5 percent, on June 30.
</P>
<P>
   ``The strength depicted in the July employment report assures an
Aug. 24 Federal Reserve firming,'' said Marilyn Schaja, an
economist with Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette.
</P>
<P>
   The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond dropped 1 20/32 to a price
of 87 19/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction,
climbed to 6.17 percent, from 6.04 percent Thursday, the highest
since 6.20 percent on Nov. 20, 1997. For investors, the day's loss
amounted to about $16.25 for each $1,000 invested in bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last two weeks, three inflation signals have pushed
bond prices lower: Friday's wage data, Thursday's
bigger-than-expected increase in unit labor costs and last week's
jump in the government's employment cost index.
</P>
<P>
   The government reported Friday that the economy had added
310,000 jobs in July, while wages rose half of 1 percent and the
unemployment rate remained at 4.3 percent. All pointed to an
increased threat of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Ablin, president of Colonial Asset Management Inc. in
Jacksonville, Fla., said the strength of the bond market's decline
had done much to remove uncertainty about the timing of the next
interest rate increase.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bond market certainly has been betting the Fed will raise
rates, but the question up until now has been the timing of such a
move,'' Ablin said. ``Now market participants are pretty sure and
are positioning themselves for an August Fed move.''
</P>
<P>
   Also weighing on bonds is a heavy schedule of government and
corporate issues, starting with next week's $37 billion government
quarterly refunding.

CIA IN UNUSUAL ROLE IN ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN CONFLICT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: For release Sunday, Aug. 8. Please note that story was
accidentally sent with wrong keyword and release date.) 
 
By DEBORAH HORAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip _ Last February, Palestinian agents foiled
an attempted suicide bombing in Tel Aviv planned by Hamas, an
organization opposed to peace agreements with Israel, members of
the Palestinian security forces say.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, members of the Central Intelligence Agency, hovering
in the background, trekked the grimy streets of Gaza and
whitewashed towns of the West Bank to piece together what exactly
the Palestinians had done to prevent the attack.
</P>
<P>
   It's an unusual role for the CIA, one that has thrust the
organization into the uncomfortable position of judging whether
Palestinians, and by extension, Israelis, are keeping their peace
obligations. Israel 's new prime minister, Ehud Barak, hopes to
change that role.
</P>
<P>
   Since taking office July 6, Barak has said he would like to see
the United States revert to its traditional role as ``facilitator''
of peace negotiations, rather than continue as arbiter of
never-ending disputes over which side is failing to live up to its
part of signed agreements.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. role as arbiter may have been necessary after the Wye
Accords were signed last October, Barak maintains, when relations
between the Palestinians and Israel's out-going prime minister,
Benjamin Netanyahu, were mired in mistrust.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike his feisty predecessor, Barak says he is eager to
complete a comprehensive peace deal with Palestinians within 15
months. Since he intends to negotiate in good faith, he says the
United States' role as arbiter is no longer needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the U.S. should be a factor in negotiations,'' said
Zvi Stauber, one of Barak's top political advisers. ``But it should
not be a judge who gets involved in small details.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the Americans seem eager to take up Barak's suggestion,
take a step back, and let Israelis and Palestinians solve disputes
without outside intervention. The hope is that Barak's good
intentions will nurture good will and produce breakthroughs in
negotiations without much U.S. prodding.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians, however, say they are less keen on seeing the
CIA's unprecedented role diminish. Nor are they enthusiastic about
the prospects that the United States might remove itself as arbiter
of disputes.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Palestinians have asked the United States to step in to
help resolve their latest disagreement with Israel, this one over
the timing of the implementation of the Wye peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erakat on Friday renewed that
call for help, reminding that President Clinton had brokered the
agreement last October.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Palestinian National Authority has officially demanded
that the United States guarantee the honest and faithful
implementation of signed accords, particularly Wye,'' Erakat said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We told them they must intervene to guarantee implementation
of the accords because the United States is responsible for the
peace process,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has said fully carrying out the Wye agreement now would
isolate and endanger Jewish settlements. On Friday, Barak responded
to doubts about his resolution by reiterating his pledge to
implement Wye as originally designed if the Palestinians do not
agree to delaying the final withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said I will implement Wye as it was signed by Netanyahu,
provided the Palestinians do their part,'' he told Israel TV.
</P>
<P>
   Without hands-on CIA involvement, Palestinians say, no one would
be there to verify that they had in fact foiled attacks, such as
the one they prevented last February.
</P>
<P>
   Rashid Abu Shabak, deputy head of the Gaza-based Palestinian
Preventive Security, the organization charged with fighting
terrorism, cites several such instances and say that, more often
than not, the CIA agreed that Palestinians were doing their job _
praise Palestinians say helped them counter Israeli allegations to
the contrary.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Abu Shabak says, his men have confiscated dozens of
illegal weapons, arrested opposition leaders and made sure 11
militants wanted by Israel for terrorist activity were behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Americans had a positive opinion of this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the CIA were not available for comment. One U.S.
official said that the Palestinians had been diligent in their
efforts to prevent violence, but less so when it came to seizing
illegal weapons and fulfilling other security obligations.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Mohammed Dahlan, head of Preventive Security in Gaza,
said Palestinians welcomed intensive CIA involvement in training
Palestinian police and in overseeing their operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Americans are here to say whether we are fulfilling our
obligations or not,'' Dahlan said. ``Their role is to watch ... to
make sure we implement the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We benefit from it,'' he added. ``We don't agree that the
Americans should leave.''
</P>
<P>
   One windfall the Palestinians may be afraid of losing, say
observers here, is closer ties with the United States than they
have ever had before. While relations between the United States and
Israel strained during Netanyahu's term, ties grew between
Palestinians and Americans to unprecedented warm levels.
</P>
<P>
   When Barak entered office, he pledged to repair those frayed
ties by, among other things, removing the United States from an
awkward role that often pitted it against Israel and put it on the
Palestinians' side.
</P>
<P>
   It still remains unclear how, or indeed whether, the CIA's role
will change in any substantial way. But without a third party
playing judge, Palestinians say they fear Israel will be the only
one to determine whether Palestinian police units are doing their
utmost to stop violence.
</P>
<P>
   As long as Israeli-Palestinian relations are good and peace
negotiations stay on track, leaving Israel to determine Palestinian
compliance might not prove a hindrance to furthering peace.
</P>
<P>
   But renewed talks have already run into trouble over the timing
of the transfer of West Bank land to Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Removing the Americans, Palestinians say, gives Barak too much
wiggle room to maneuver out of obligations and then cite
Palestinian noncompliance as a pretext for halting further land
transfers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants to play with the facts without anyone else around,''
Dahlan said. ``We don't want security used as an excuse.''

 &HT;    MindSpring signs AOL messaging deal
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ MindSpring Enterprises and EarthLink Network, two of
the nation's largest Internet service providers, have signed deals
with America Online to distribute its AOL Instant Messenger
software to the 2.5 million combined users of the two services,
beginning in late October.
</P>
<P>
   All three companies say the agreements have nothing to do with
AOL's fierce battle with Microsoft, which introduced its own
instant messaging software, MSN Messenger, two weeks ago, only to
have AOL block access to its network for MSN users.
</P>
<P>
   Erika Jolly, MindSpring's vice president of consumer products,
says the AOL deal was in the works long before there was an MSN
Messenger.
</P>
<P>
   MindSpring will offer a co-branded version of AOL's Instant
Messenger to subscribers in the late fall. MindSpring already
offers its users Excite Pal messaging, which will continue to be
offered, although the AOL product will be the default service.
</P>
<P>
   MindSpring's deal is nonexclusive, meaning it can offer users
any or all instant messaging products including Microsoft's MSN
Messenger.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can certainly talk to Microsoft,'' Jolly says. ``But we
don't want to offer confusing product options for our customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Instant messaging allows users to ``talk'' to each other online
in real time. AOL pioneered the service.
</P>
<P>
   Jolly says adding AOL's Instant Messenger to its product
offerings is part of the company's ongoing strategy to make the
MindSpring home page a more compelling destination for current and
prospective users. The company has announced a variety of content
alliances over the past few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   AOL is the largest Internet access provider, with 17.6 million
members. The Virginia-based company is currently engaged in a
bitter war with Microsoft over instant messaging. AOL has blocked
access to MSN Messenger users, claiming that Microsoft is trying to
access AOL's proprietary network without its permission. AOL also
blocks access to instant messaging services from Yahoo! and
Prodigy.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the denials, some analysts think AOL seeks to corner the
instant messaging market by lining up big Internet service
providers like MindSpring and EarthLink.
</P>
<P>
   ``If AOL can go around and sign up all the second-level players
out there, there will be less and less of a market to pick off,''
PaineWebber analyst James Preissler told the Dow Jones News
Service.
</P>
<P>
   Preissler said MindSpring and EarthLink realized they weren't
large enough to make launching a competing instant messaging
service viable, so they teamed up with AOL.
</P>
<P>
   However, Jupiter Communications analyst Lucas Graves disagrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a mistake to see this as AOL lining up allies in its war
against Microsoft,'' he says. ``Their install base is so incredibly
large, with or without allies, they are the de facto standard. ``
</P>
<P>
   Mindspring shares closed at $28.81 1/4, up $2.81 1/4 on Friday;
AOL was up 81 1/4 cents to $84.75 and Earthlink rose $4.50 to
$41.56 1/4.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Boston Scientific Corp. announced a voluntary recall of one of
its medical products designed to clear clogged arteries, driving
its shares down 18 percent and causing it to reduce its projected
1999 earnings by 8 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   The company recalled its newest Rotablator systems after
discovering a defect in the products' brake system. The Rotablator
is designed to break up tough artery plaque deposits, and often is
used in preparation for angioplasty.
</P>
<P>
   Boston Scientific launched what it termed ``an intense
engineering investigation'' of the devices after the company
received six complaints of product malfunction _ one of which
involved a patient who died, though it is not known if the device
is related to the death.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials said they pulled the product ``within days''
of concluding that the brake on some of the Rotablators may not
adequately secure the guide wire as intended, making such units
unsafe for use.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of the product during the first half of the year amounted
to about $60 million. Assuming no sales of the product in the
second half of the year, the company lowered its expected annual
earnings to $1.01 a share from $1.09.
</P>
<P>
   The recall will not impact an earlier version of the product
that is being sold in Japan, company officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Berman, president of Scimed Life Systems Inc., the unit
of Boston Scientific responsible for the device, said it will be a
matter of months until the Rotalink advancer is back on the US
market.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're closing in on a fix to the problem,'' Berman said,
adding that the company is also considering resuming production of
the original model. ``We are working extraordinarily intensely to
get the technology fixed and back on the market as expeditiously as
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rotoblator accounts for about 90 percent of the market,
company officials said, with very few competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Boston Scientific has recalled three other products in the past
year. ``There are more of them than I'd like or more than there
should be,'' said Jim Tobin, Boston Scientific's chief executive
officer. ``The issues that are underlying the events that occcured
are essentially training issues,'' and Tobin said improvements are
already in progress.
</P>
<P>
   The company also restated its 1997 earnings after discovering
accounting problems in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone hoped that there would be no more problems in the
future,'' said Sandra J. Hollenhorst, an analyst with Prudential
Vector Health in Illinois, after Boston Scientific named Tobin CEO
on June 1. ``You can't really attribute this to Jim Tobin's reign
since he has just been in place for three months. But this is
exactly the kind of thing he's trying to rectify.''

   PRAGUE _ Prague is a city intoxicated on freedom, and that's not
all.
</P>
<P>
   It's not unusual to meet someone along the street smoking a
joint.
</P>
<P>
   One of the finest restaurants in Prague is just a block from an
open drug market.
</P>
<P>
   You may be sitting in a restaurant and, instead of a waiter,
it's a drug dealer who comes to your table to ask what he can bring
you.
</P>
<P>
   It takes some getting used to.
</P>
<P>
   But then, so does the weather girl on TV, who appears totally
nude and then begins to dress herself accordingly for the next
day's weather. On occasion, it's an equally naked weather boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This country has so much troubled history, and now so much
freedom,'' a Prague friend explained. ``The people are almost like
spoiled children. Everything's allowed.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's a selection of snapshot impressions made during a
three-day visit:
</P>
<P>
   _ You see police everywhere, but they're there primarily to make
sure things don't get out of hand. Otherwise, they leave you alone.
As for possession of narcotics, police are allowed a wide degree of
discretion in enforcing the law.
</P>
<P>
   _ Prostitution is prevalent.
</P>
<P>
   _ Walk into a store and the employees are sitting around and
talking among themselves. You may have to interrupt them in order
to be waited on, and then you're likely to be treated as if you're
an intruder. Such is the legacy of communism.
</P>
<P>
   _ Eating out is cheap, if you go outside the tourist center of
the city. Two can dine for as little as $20, including drinks.
</P>
<P>
   _ Prague has ``non-stop bars,'' open 24 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   _ You don't dare criticize Czech beer. As the ancestral home of
Budweiser, beer is one of the few things sacred in this ancient
city _ that and the ice hockey team.
</P>
<P>
   _ Most Americans didn't take much notice, but the Czech Republic
won the European championship in ice hockey this past year, and the
ensuing celebration in Prague was like unto New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   _ There's no sense of the American health craze here. You'll see
children as young as 12 smoking in public. Men drink lots of beer
and it shows. Women, however, are expected to keep their figure and
dress provocatively _ and drink only dark beer, which, it is
believed, increases their bust size.
</P>
<P>
   _ Mini-skirts and low-cut blouses are much in fashion. Sexist
remarks are considered compliments, especially from a boss. Women,
even if they have jobs outside the home, are expected to do all the
household chores and have a hot meal on the table for their
husbands at dinnertime.
</P>
<P>
   _ Visitors are warned to watch out for pickpockets. Worst places
in the city are the two train stations.
</P>
<P>
   _ Czechs hate everything Russian. An upscale Russian restaurant
finally gave up trying to maintain its storefront, such was the
graffiti. Under communism, Russian was a required language course.
Now, Czechs refuse to speak it, and won't even acknowledge they can
speak it.
</P>
<P>
   _ Czechs love everything American, especially our music and
fashion, but they consider us arrogant and, worse, ignorant of
Czech culture. Don't ever say, ``In America, that's not the way
things are done.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Example of Czech culture that Americans are ignorant of: At
Christmas, fish peddlers sell live carp on the street. The large
fish is brought home and kept in the bathtub for several days. On
Christmas Eve, as the women prepare the holiday feast, the
tradition is for the man of the house to whack off its head with a
butcher knife. It's a Czech thing _ you wouldn't understand.

CAPE ELIZABETH RUN FULLY SUBSCRIBED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA HUEBNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As thousands of recreational runners trickled in behind a
stellar field of elite athletes at last summer's inaugural Peoples
Beach to Beacon 10K, race founder Joan Benoit Samuelson was almost
giddy with relief. After months of planning from, literally, the
ground up, she could finally pronounce her pet project _ a road
race in her hometown of Cape Elizabeth, Maine _ a success.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an incredible day,'' said Samuelson, reminiscing
recently about the crystalline weather and thrilling
shoulder-to-shoulder finishes in both the men's and women's races.
``I think the spectators enjoyed it as much as the athletes.''
</P>
<P>
   If the numbers are any indication, a lot of those spectators
appear to have turned into runners. The field, limited to 4,000,
filled up more than two weeks before the race, which steps off
Saturday at 8 a.m. near Crescent Beach before winding its scenic
way, with occasional views of Casco Bay, to the finish line at the
Portland Head lighthouse.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's 3,000 entrants had already made it the state's
largest road race, a fitting tribute to the 42-year-old native
daughter who brought home a gold medal in 1984 from the first
Olympic marathon for women. ``The Maine runners are so excited to
have an event like this in their state,'' said Samuelson.
</P>
<P>
   For the second year, the event _ offering $50,000 in prize money
_ has drawn some of the world's top athletes. Perhaps the chief
attraction in the men's field is Khalid Khannouchi, a Moroccan who
lives in New York. He hopes to become an American citizen soon, and
owns the eighth-fastest marathon time in history (2 hours 7 minutes
10 seconds) thanks to his win in Chicago in 1997. Also expected are
defending champion Johannes Mabitle of South Africa, who won last
year in 28 minutes 18 seconds; world record-holder (27:20) Joseph
Kimani of Kenya; William Kiptum of Kenya, last year's runner-up in
28:19; and American Todd Williams, a two-time Olympian at 10,000
meters.
</P>
<P>
   Heading up the women's field will be Derartu Tulu, the 1992
Olympic gold medalist at 10,000 meters from Ethiopia, and Hellen
Kimaiyo-Kipkoskei of Kenya, a close third last year in 32:18 behind
countrywoman Catherine Ndereba (32:15) and American Libbie Hickman
(32:17). Gwyn Coogan of Boulder, Colo., is also expected.
</P>
<P>
   A pair of women familiar to Boston fans _ Russia's Olga Markova,
the Boston Marathon winner in 1992 and 1993, and Poland's Wanda
Panfil, the 1991 victor _ also will be making the trip to Maine.
Panfil, who recently turned 40, will be competing in a strong
masters division against Ruth Wysocki, Hopkinton native Jane
Welzel, and last year's masters winner, Kim Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Plascencia, who set the US masters record when he won the
division last year in 29:37, will duel with John Tuttle, who broke
the mark this spring with a 29:26 performance.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of who crosses the finish line first, Camp Sunshine
will come out a winner. The camp, a retreat on Sebago Lake in
Casco, Maine, for chronically-ill children and their families, is
this year's designated beneficiary of proceeds from the race,
expected to be more than $30,000. Last year, $25,000 was raised for
Big Brothers/Big Sisters of Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Samuelson will not run in her own event. Often a
winner in the masters division, Samuelson said she is too busy to
even think about competing, but doesn't really mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough not to run, but this is a sport that has given me
so much,'' she said. ``This is one chance to give back.''

   ECON-REPORT (Washington) _ The U.S. economy generated many more
new jobs in July than economists and Wall Street had expected, in a
report likely to fan worries of higher interest rates. The Labor
Department said that non-farm payrolls rose 310,000 in July,
leaving the unemployment rate unchanged at 4.3 percent. The report
also showed that wages rose 6 cents, or 0.5 percent _ the biggest
increase in average hourly earnings in seven months. Stock and
bonds fell sharply at the opening but recovered in early trading.

BOSTON SCIENTIFIC RECALLS ROTABLATOR SYSTEMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HEATHER KAMINS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Boston Scientific Corp. announced a voluntary recall of one of
its medical products designed to clear clogged arteries, driving
its shares down 18 percent and causing it to reduce its projected
1999 earnings by 8 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   The company recalled its newest Rotablator systems after
discovering a defect in the products' brake system. The Rotablator
is designed to break up tough artery plaque deposits, and often is
used in preparation for angioplasty.
</P>
<P>
   Boston Scientific launched what it termed ``an intense
engineering investigation'' of the devices after the company
received six complaints of product malfunction _ one of which
involved a patient who died, though it is not known if the device
is related to the death.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials said they pulled the product ``within days''
of concluding that the brake on some of the Rotablators may not
adequately secure the guide wire as intended, making such units
unsafe for use.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of the product during the first half of the year amounted
to about $60 million. Assuming no sales of the product in the
second half of the year, the company lowered its expected annual
earnings to $1.01 a share from $1.09.
</P>
<P>
   The recall will not impact an earlier version of the product
that is being sold in Japan, company officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Berman, president of Scimed Life Systems Inc., the unit
of Boston Scientific responsible for the device, said it will be a
matter of months until the Rotalink advancer is back on the US
market.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're closing in on a fix to the problem,'' Berman said,
adding that the company is also considering resuming production of
the original model. ``We are working extraordinarily intensely to
get the technology fixed and back on the market as expeditiously as
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rotoblator accounts for about 90 percent of the market,
company officials said, with very few competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Boston Scientific has recalled three other products in the past
year. ``There are more of them than I'd like or more than there
should be,'' said Jim Tobin, Boston Scientific's chief executive
officer. ``The issues that are underlying the events that occcured
are essentially training issues,'' and Tobin said improvements are
already in progress.
</P>
<P>
   The company also restated its 1997 earnings after discovering
accounting problems in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone hoped that there would be no more problems in the
future,'' said Sandra J. Hollenhorst, an analyst with Prudential
Vector Health in Illinois, after Boston Scientific named Tobin CEO
on June 1. ``You can't really attribute this to Jim Tobin's reign
since he has just been in place for three months. But this is
exactly the kind of thing he's trying to rectify.''

TEACHERS FROM MIDEAST CONNECT IN MASSACHUSETTS CLASSROOM 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By JACQUES STEINBERG    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHESTNUT HILL, Mass. _ The topic was stress management in the
classroom, but as the professor began his case study about a New
England school coping with the death of a child in a storm, his
students desperately wanted to read aloud from the pages of their
own lives.
</P>
<P>
   An English teacher from Morocco politely interrupted to tell
how, as a young boy, he had watched as his school superintendent
was shot to death by a guerrilla who had invaded their classroom.
</P>
<P>
   A high school math teacher from Israel described how his
students were unable to concentrate for weeks after two schoolmates
were blown up by a terrorist bomb.
</P>
<P>
   And another English teacher, an Arab from the Gaza Strip,
recalled how one of his students lay gravely wounded on his
classroom desk, having been shot in the stomach three times by
Israeli soldiers who believed he had pelted them with rocks. After
a two-hour standoff, the teacher said, he slung the boy over his
shoulder and carried him to a nearby hospital, as explosives went
off around him.
</P>
<P>
   For 45 minutes, one teacher after another shared similar
experiences, their various accents blending into one. When it was
over, the professor, Paul M. Kline, a specialist in adolescent
mental health at Boston College, sat motionless.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fear,'' he said, ``that anything I say will be inadequate.''
</P>
<P>
   The exchange was but one snippet of an improbable dialogue among
19 high school teachers _ including Israelis, Palestinians and
Lebanese _ from seven Middle Eastern nations and territories that
stretched over four weeks, ending Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In coming together for a first-time symposium at Boston College,
their ostensible purpose was to swap methods of instruction and
curriculum. But those who had brought them here had another motive:
to demonstrate that the common bonds between teachers transcend
even the bitterest rivalries between their governments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came here not knowing what would happen between me and the
Israelis,'' said Zahia Khashab Fakih, 27, who teaches English in
Lebanon. ``I was worried, thinking, `How can I deal with people
whose army is occupying our country?'''
</P>
<P>
   ``What I learned in my stay in Boston is that people, between
themselves, can make deep peace,'' she said. ``If the peace process
is given to teachers to deal with _ and maybe to students _ then
they might make a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   In hopes of nurturing that very ideal, the organizers of the
program here have a far grander scheme in mind than just an intense
summer of learning. For three years, they have been working toward
establishing a fully accredited University of the Middle East, with
satellite campuses in every major capital in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Led by an Arab, Hala Taweel, 34, a doctoral candidate at Harvard
who is the sister-in-law of Yasser Arafat, and a Jew, Dr. Ron
Rubin, 28, a lecturer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
who grew up in Israel and California, the organizers of the
University of the Middle East Project are trying to raise $100
million, with an eye on opening their first campus, in Morocco, in
2005.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Taweel and Rubin took a first step toward making their dream
real by inviting the high school teachers here this summer. The 19
accepted were among 220 who had applied, their tuition paid almost
entirely by a collection of foundations. The organizers hope that,
upon the university's founding, these will be the first teachers to
recommend it to their students.
</P>
<P>
   To give them a taste of what the university might offer, the
teachers were immersed in the latest concepts of American
education. They were taught to resolve classroom conflicts through
role playing, to minimize lectures in favor of cooperative student
work, and to integrate the school psychologist into their
classrooms _ a prospect that many of the teachers found alien, if
not frightening.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our culture, psychiatrists are associated with craziness,''
said Fatima Kotbi, 35, of Morocco.
</P>
<P>
   But in truth, they likely learned more from one another than
from a roster of professors assembled from Boston College, Harvard
and MIT.
</P>
<P>
   In late-night talks in the hallway of their dormitory, they
realized they shared the same frustrations, whether it was large
class sizes (as big as 60 in Egypt), rigid course requirements
(every English teacher in the Gaza Strip must teach Dickens' ``Hard
Times'' in the 12th grade) or low salaries (from as little as $300
a month in some Palestinian schools to $1,000 a month in Israel.)
</P>
<P>
   And all agreed that their students had been set back in their
learning by conflicts that have never seemed to abate for long.
</P>
<P>
   In relating what it was like to teach on the West Bank during
the period that Arabs refer to as the Intifada, the seven-year
uprising against Israeli occupation that ended in 1993, Frieda
Khayat, 32, said: ``We couldn't get the kids involved in the
teaching because they always thought school would be canceled for
the next day.''
</P>
<P>
   As she spoke from her desk in a lecture hall on Wednesday, four
Israelis, three of them Jewish, sat just a few feet away. None
raised their voices to argue the relative merits of the various
combatants.
</P>
<P>
   At lunch that day, four teachers _ an Israeli flanked by a
Palestinian on one side and a Lebanese on the other, all sitting
opposite a Jordanian _ briefly debated whether Jerusalem rightly
belonged to the Jews, the Muslims or the Christians.
</P>
<P>
   The conversation never got heated or personal. And the four
agreed that ultimately, they would prefer to set aside their
convictions and to compromise rather than jeopardize the
friendships they had formed over the last month.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli teacher, Judith Zilberman, who is Jewish, said she
had found herself empathizing with the diner to her left, Hani El
Akkad, a Muslim from the Gaza Strip, who spoke of being punched in
the stomach by an Israeli soldier when he refused to translate
something from Arabic into Hebrew. El Akkad, 39, said he had told
the soldier he spoke no Hebrew.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to put myself in Hani's shoes and the Israeli soldier's
shoes,'' said Ms. Zilberman, a teacher for two decades, who was
reticent about revealing her age. ``It doesn't matter. They
shouldn't have hit him.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the table, Mona Barghout, 32, a Jordanian whose family
had been forced to flee Israel at its founding in 1948, told Ms.
Zilberman how hard it would have been, just a month ago, to imagine
herself having lunch with an Israeli.
</P>

REGIONAL ALLIANCE COULD BOOST MOSCOW MAYOR'S POLITICAL HOPES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Meet the new bosses. Same as the old bosses?
</P>
<P>
   Proclaiming themselves the alternative to Kremlin cronyism, some
of Russia's most powerful regional leaders joined forces this week
to create an alliance that could drastically reshape the country's
political landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say the new alliance could dominate December's
parliamentary elections, and put its leader, Moscow's ambitious
Mayor Yury Luzhkov, in position to win the real prize _ next year's
presidential vote.
</P>
<P>
   But would a Russia ruled by Luzhkov's alliance, Fatherland/All
Russia, look all that different from Boris N. Yeltsin's Russia?
</P>
<P>
   Although Luzhkov and his allies are presenting themselves as the
guardians of Russian democracy, their own commitment to democratic
principles looks dubious at best. Their election bid looks more
like an effort to preserve their privileges than to reform the
corrupt system Yeltsin has put in place.
</P>
<P>
   Luzhkov has barely concealed his presidential ambitions. But
Yeltsin's inner circle _ darkly referred to by the Russian media as
``The Family'' _ openly distrusts Luzhkov. To keep Luzhkov from
winning power, Yeltsin's allies have resorted to a smear campaign
waged by the newspapers and television stations the Kremlin
controls and suspicious-looking tax audits on the media it doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   How low will the Kremlin go? Friday night, state-controlled ORT
television's nightly news featured a commentator who warned that
the rise to power by Luzhkov's multi-ethnic alliance would amount
to a ``Tatar conquest'' of Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the week, Luzhkov promised to put an end to such
heavy-handed tactics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our wish is to serve our citizens, to solve the country's real
economic problems,'' Luzhkov told a news conference. ``Our wish is
to care for and develop the values of a democratic society, to
develop the economy on free-market principles.''
</P>
<P>
   But in reality, Russia's 89 regions and semiautonomous republics
are run by the very same type of shady clan politics that Luzhkov
accuses Yeltsin's Kremlin of fostering, just on a smaller scale.
</P>
<P>
   In Russia, regional leaders rule their provinces like feudal
lords, using local mafias and corrupt law-enforcement bodies to
govern virtually unchallenged. They suppress dissent, censor the
press, and reap the profits of their own privatization schemes _
until now, with the silent assent of the Kremlin, which has relied
on the regional leaders for support in Yeltsin's struggles with his
Communist opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Take Mintimer Shaimiyev, president of Tatarstan _ an oil-rich
republic of 5.5 million people located 400 miles east of Moscow _
who joined Luzhkov to announce the alliance Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   When Shaimiyev needed to get reelected in 1996, he ran
unopposed, even though Russian electoral law forbids uncontested
votes. That same year, Shaimiyev issued a decree making it illegal
to insult him, with fines ranging from $800 for individuals to
$6,000 for news organizations. Last year, he shut down the
republic's only opposition newspaper, Altyn Urda.
</P>
<P>
   He has used his considerable clout in Moscow to win lucrative
exceptions to federal tax and export laws _ money that disappears
in the republic's murky, unreformed accounting system. The Kremlin
never complained. Until this week, Yeltsin's aides were hoping
Shaimiyev would join an electoral alliance that would support the
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shaimiyev is a typical regional despot,'' said Yury Korgunyuk,
a political analyst at the Moscow-based INDEM research center. ``It
is impossible to do anything in Tatarstan without him. There is no
free press and no real independent institutions. To oppose him is
suicide.''
</P>
<P>
   Opposing the administration of St. Petersburg governor Vladimir
Yakovlev, who was there with Shaimiyev and Luzhkov on Wednesday, is
not necessarily suicide. But it can get you killed.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's second city, known for its winding canals, baroque
architecture, and cultural sites, has since Yakovlev's 1996
election become known for something else: gangland-style
assassinations.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past several years attorneys, bankers, entrepreneurs,
journalists, and government officials have been murdered in what
can only be described as an epidemic of contract killings.
Sometimes the victims are outspoken opponents of the governor, like
liberal legislator Galina Starovoitova, who was gunned down in her
apartment stairwell last November.
</P>
<P>
   Yakovlev himself has not been implicated in any assassinations.
But local media, and the city's former police chief, allege links
to various crime figures, including the Tambov mafia that controls
the city's fuel market and ``Kostya the Grave,'' the notorious head
of St. Petersburg's vicious burial services mafia (yes, they have
one of those.)
</P>
<P>
   In February, federal prosecutors arrested Yury Shutov, a city
council member and close Yakovlev ally, and charged him with
murder, conspiracy to commit murder, and racketeering.
Specifically, Shutov was charged with leading a 12-member
assassination squad that had carried out a series of high-profile
killings in St. Petersburg _ including those of a leading banker,
businessman, and attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Shutov was elected in St. Petersburg's municipal legislative
elections last December, which have been called the dirtiest in
Russia's post-Soviet history, with rampant use of dirty tricks and
even physical attacks against Yakovlev's opponents being the norm.
</P>
<P>
   Post-Soviet election politics, for Russia's regional barons,
often boils down to intimidation. In 1996, president Murtaza
Rakhimov of Bashkortostan _ Tatarstan's neighbor and another
prominent member of the new alliance _ promised to cut off heat and
electricity to regions that did not deliver a sufficient number of
votes for a candidate for reelection named Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   Now it is Luzhkov who will benefit.
</P>
<P>
   ``This alliance gives Luzhkov a colossal political machine in
the regions,'' said Sergei Markov of the Center for Political
Studies. ``It also creates the impression that the political elite
has abandoned Yeltsin and embraced Luzhkov.''
</P>
<P>
   That is bad news for Yeltsin's Kremlin. Luzhkov has vowed to
reverse some of the cozy privatization deals that allowed people
close to Yeltsin to make fortunes and build huge industrial and
media empires, and prosecute those responsible. Sources say prime
minister Sergei Stepashin may take the fall for allowing Luzhkov to
form his new alliance. The sources say Stepashin may be soon
replaced by someone tougher _ like security chief Vladimir Putin.
</P>
<P>
   But Luzhkov's ascendance may be even worse news for the voters
in the provinces, who look to have even less chance of affecting
the upcoming elections than previous ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more the local elites are consolidated,'' political
analyst Boris Kagarlitsky wrote in The Moscow Times this week,
``the less pluralism depends on the will of the citizen.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NAIROBI, Kenya _ Until Aug. 7, 1998, one year ago Saturday,
Douglas Sidialo was a car salesman who drove around Nairobi for his
job. He tells a dark little joke about why that line of work is
closed off to him now: ``If I drove cars,'' he said, ``I would
knock people over.''
</P>
<P>
   He was blinded completely by glass and debris that exploded
through his windshield that day when terrorists bombed the U.S.
Embassy here. More than 200 people were killed and 5,000 wounded
here and in a simultaneous attack on the U.S. Embassy in Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   His story is one of the more inspirational. He started a group
of survivors _ called, with a vein of irony, Visual Seventh August
_ to provide counseling and job training and to watch over how aid
money was spent. He wears a smile and sunglasses, both oversized,
and works hard to set an example for other victims without his
resilience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't reverse the blast,'' Sidialo, 29, said. ``I have to
accept what happened and move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet he still has no job. The other day he went to the local Red
Cross, along with perhaps 100 other victims of the blast, to pick
up free food _ a few bags of corn meal and cooking oil _ to help
him survive.
</P>
<P>
   The bomb may have been aimed at Americans, as many people here
bitterly remind each other. But there is no question that Kenyans
have suffered the most and, a year later, are still coming to terms
with such devastation. It has been hard even for the optimistic
ones, like Sidialo, and simply grim for others.
</P>
<P>
   And so the nation's recovery from the bomb blast has come with
its own set of victories and setbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Many Kenyans, split by ethnic, religious and class differences,
say the blast gave them a greater sense of unity, just as they
pulled together a year ago hauling the wounded from the rubble or
donating blood en masse. A government fund to compensate victims
apparently did not fall prey to the nation's legendary corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Some outsiders who have helped Kenya recover from the blast _
the United States has donated $42.3 million _ say they have noticed
subtle differences in Kenyan society, some out of bomb-related
necessity.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I started, mental health was seen as a service only
provided to people who were blatantly psychotic,'' said Dr. Lorin
Minless, a Boston psychiatrist who is a consultant for counseling
services for some 2,000 bomb survivors and their families. ``The
idea of getting help outside of the family didn't exist. The bomb
blast helped sensitize people.''
</P>
<P>
   But on some level the unity was short-lived. People have not
even agreed how to commemorate the bombing's anniversary, marked in
a weekend of rallies, concerts and other events: there are four
separate memorial services on Saturday, each claiming to be the
official one.
</P>
<P>
   And the money handed out by the government that was supposed to
make life easier for the victims has backfired in some cases, the
compensation squandered or stolen.
</P>
<P>
   Doreen Auma's husband was a shoe salesman killed in the blast.
As she took the body to western Kenya for burial, she said, her
husband's family decided not to recognize the marriage and emptied
their house of everything _ furniture, dishes, even the stove.
</P>
<P>
   Of the roughly $9,200 the government paid for her husband's
death, his family took $6,500. Now she is nearly broke.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have spent everything,'' Ms. Auma, 25, she said as she too
collected the free Red Cross food to feed their two children, ages
6 and 7.
</P>
<P>
   There is also still much anger in Kenya over the blast. Some of
it remains directed at the United States, criticized in the early
days for seeming to care more about the 12 Americans killed than
the more than 200 Kenyans. Now, with unemployment sky-high and per
capita income dropping, many people say the United States should do
more.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the Americans gave to the victims was not enough,'' said
Julius Mashalia Isalambo, 37, a grocer in downtown Nairobi. ``It's
like we are fighting their war.''
</P>
<P>
   Isalambo is not a victim of the blast and, interestingly, most
of the victims themselves say they do not blame the United States
(even though some 2,500 of them have joined in huge class-action
lawsuits against the U.S. government).
</P>
<P>
   Francis Gitu Maina, 33, clenched his fists on a recent evening
when he was asked if he was angry at anyone over the blast.
</P>
<P>
   ``So much,'' he said. But he said he blamed ``the ones who came
to bomb,'' suspected to be Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile, who
has denied any role in the bombing, and his suspected associates,
eight of whom have been arrested. ``If they did not bomb, I would
not be in this trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   His trouble is worse than most: Maina was on the No. 126 bus,
stalled in traffic in front of the embassy, when the explosion went
off. He spent four days in a coma, then four months in the
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   He lost his right eye and cannot see well in his left. He can
barely walk because his right leg was broken so badly. When his
wife saw he could not provide anymore, he said, she left him with
their two children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was the king of ...'' he stared to say, then stopped. ``I'm
the husband. And now I got that trouble. That is why she went.''
</P>
<P>
   He said his life is now divided between the doctor and sitting
alone in his little room with walls and roof made of tin in the
town of Kiserian, about an hour to the southwest of Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
   A former clothes hawker, he has no clear vision of the future,
except that he would like to buy a little plot of land, build a few
apartments and start selling clothes again. But he does not have
the money.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation is very bad,'' he said. ``When I think about my
life before, I don't feel good.''

AN ARMY'S RECRUITS, REACHING OUT TO THE COMPUTERLESS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 8) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif., Texas, Wash., Pa.)   (Eds., please see related article BIZ-HAND-COMPUTERS)

 By SHOLNN FREEMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Handtech.com has enlisted 7,100 computer buffs who pay it $145
each to become so-called technology consultants _ representatives
who sell the company's computers, mostly part-time, to friends,
neighbors and tiny businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The company has a multilevel marketing structure: The
representatives earn commissions of about 10 percent on the
products they sell and half the $145 fee paid by new sales
representatives they recruit, as well as commissions of 2 percent
to 5 percent from their recruits' sales.
</P>
<P>
   This sort of marketing has been used successfully for years by
companies like Amway and Mary Kay to sell low-ticket,
repeat-purchase items like cleaning products and cosmetics. Its
success is unproven, however, for bigger-ticket items like
computers.
</P>
<P>
   Multilevel structures, of course, have to worry about
oversaturation. ``At some point, all the potential customers will
be sales representatives and there will be no more customers,''
said David C. Schmittlein, a marketing professor at the Wharton
School of the University of Pennsylvania. ``Then the next person
won't be able to make a go of it.''
</P>
<P>
   As it is, Hand's representatives sold, on average, fewer than
three computers each last year. Yet the notion behind the business
has been irresistible to many would-be entrepreneurs: Sell
computers to people you know with Hand's support, recruit your own
workers, maybe even get some stock options if and when the company
goes public.
</P>
<P>
   A salesman in Santa Clarita, Calif., Todd P. Smith, a producer
of the movie ``Lost and Found,'' starring David Spade, has built a
team of 1,000 Hand sales representatives dubbed Team One. In the
process, Smith has become a Hand icon.
</P>
<P>
   After hearing Smith and top Hand officials speak at the
company's annual conference in Dallas a year ago, Keith Campbell,
who lives in Seattle, resolved to quit his job at the Federal
Emergency Management Agency. In that job, he sometimes paged
through computer magazines while waiting for the next big disaster,
he said, and he decided to build his own computer business based
around Hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't have walked away from a $50,000-a-year job with 30
days' paid vacation if I didn't think this was going to go,'' he
said. ``Most people would say I'm crazy, but I don't think so. Ten
years ago if somebody said I was going to buy a Dell, people would
have said, `A what?' Now everybody knows. We're going to sell a lot
of computers.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell quit the disaster agency in June to try selling for
Hand full-time. His goal is to sell one computer a week and add two
technology consultants a month. The first year will be hard, he
figures, but he hopes to eventually have a big-enough team to sell
enough computers to replace his old income.
</P>
<P>
   He started building his 11-member team after last year's
conference, he said, understanding that he would not get rich
quick. ``With Hand, you get out of it what you put into it,'' he
said.

 &HT;    Bill would allow more tech exports
 &HT;    By Jerry Mahoney
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Sen. Phil Gramm came to Austin on Friday to
unveil legislation that would significantly increase the number of
products that U.S. companies could sell to countries such as China
or Libya while sharply increasing penalties for breaching national
security.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a gathering of technology officials at Motorola
Inc.'s new campus in Northwest Austin, the Republican senator from
Texas said his Export Administration Act of 1999 would slash the
number of items the government reviews for export to unfriendly
countries from 10,000 to 1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm, a free-market advocate and defense-spending hawk, said
his bill would apply a fundamental test to high-tech exports. If
hardware or software is easily available _ for instance, at
retailers such as Radio Shack _ or can be bought over the Internet,
the government cannot prevent U.S. companies from exporting it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You may like to prevent any potential enemies from getting it,
but the point is it's too late,'' Gramm said.
</P>
<P>
   But even as simple as the formula sounds, Gramm said passage of
the bill he is sponsoring with two GOP senators and one Democrat
faces a difficult journey in Congress. The issue of export sales is
fraught with emotion and ideological debate because of concerns
that U.S. companies eager to make a buck are selling sensitive
technology that a potential enemy can turn against the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Those concerns were inflamed by the Cox report, released in May.
The study, by a bipartisan House group, concluded China stole the
technology for making nuclear bombs from the United States during
the Clinton and Bush administrations.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm's bill would not address such spying. But it would stiffen
the fines assessed companies that sell technology the United States
is trying to protect.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm also cited pending investigations of Loral Corp. and
Hughes Electronics, the huge defense contractors that the Cox
report said sold China sensitive missile technology.
</P>
<P>
   Under current law, such violations bring a penalty of $10,000,
which Gramm called ``throwaway for corporate America.''
</P>
<P>
   His bill would assess companies fines of $10 million or 10 times
the value of the technology sold. Individuals would face fines of
up to $1 million or 10 years in prison or both.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would simplify matters for the electronics industry and
Texas PC companies such as Dell Computer Corp. and Compaq Computer
Corp. They have complained that export restrictions proposed by the
Clinton administration could prevent selling desktop computers in
China, a huge and still-emerging marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   The Computer Coalition for Responsible Export, which includes
Dell, has been following Gramm's bill, said a Dell spokeswoman. A
spokesman for the coalition was unavailable for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm's bill would renew the Export Administration Act of 1979,
which expired in 1994. Efforts to renew it before now have failed
because Congress and the Clinton administration have disagreed on
provisions. Gramm said the administration helped write provisions
of his bill.
</P>
<P>
   Co-sponsors include Sens. Paul Sarbanes, D-Md., and Michael
Enzi, R-Wyo.

WHICH CARPETBAGGER CAN CAST THE FIRST STONE?

 (For release Sunday, August 08, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   You've got to hand it to Tina Brown, the Trixie Dixie of
magazine publishing.
</P>
<P>
   In a century whose first half front-staged magazine editors such
as H.L. Mencken, the second half closes with the coronation of the
arch-English mistress of buzz, whose mix of slightly naughty,
slightly haughty celebrity gossip wafted her from the New Yorker to
the buzzily titled Talk magazine.
</P>
<P>
   It was to one of Tina's Ikettes that the first lady unburdened
herself of some typically measured and coolly considered opinions
on the origin of the First Randiness. Child abuse, shrugged Hillary
to Talk; issues that still need to be worked on. Talk's exclusive
unrolled. Word then got out, artfully timed to build A-List
attendance at Brown's coming-out magazine party.
</P>
<P>
   In the Pavlovian fashion one now expects, the Clinton-bashers
leapt to keyboard and microphone. Veteran harrumpher George Will
was so upset that his Adam's Apple failed to clear the elastic
string on his bow tie. The New York Times's Maureen Dowd was
similarly scathing. One sure way to get dished, it appears, is to
unburden your soul to a competing scrivener.
</P>
<P>
   This buttinsky Arkansan lady is locked in a supposedly shredded
relationship with the Lil' Abner clone who rules the Free World.
And she has the gall to run for US Senate from New York, of all
places? That drives the journalistic establishment to new lows of
invective. Just who the hell does she think she is, this Senator
Clinton. Hiss-hiss-hiss. The first marriage is talk show fodder.
</P>
<P>
   Now, I concede that Hillary is not everyone's cup of tea. Or
sympathy. I think she could find better things to do over the six
years following the next six months without hanging out in the
Senate cloakroom, watching Strom Thurmond, Jesse Helms and Trent
Lott clear their throats. But that's her decision.
</P>
<P>
   Thrusting herself on the kindness of strangers in New York _
Hah! _ is a brave move, if foolish by my lights. But it's her life.
With New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani playing the troll under the
bridge, she'll need her Billy Goats Gruff accent to cross the
Hudson. New York imposes a tong war on its politicians. But then,
if Hillary were a cupcake, she wouldn't be here today. I would pay
money to see Hillary vs. Rudy in debate. My money's on the woman in
the powder-blue power suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carpetbagger!'' is the epithet hurled most often at Mrs.
Clinton. Most of the hurling comes from tabloid newspapers owned by
gents from other countries. Rupert Murdoch (N.Y. Post) is
Australian by birth, Mortimer Zuckerman (Daily News) Canadian.
Every fourth person who lives in New York City was born outside the
United States. But carpetbagger is the issue, as fiercely
territorial Noo Yawkers who were born far from the Bronx assert
their Noo Yawkiness by trashing Our Lady of Whitewater.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, moving as a child or even an adult to another state
should be no bar to holding office. And it is not just New Yorkers,
whose state of mind is more provincial than most, who want a
homeboy or homegirl holding up their end in D.C. But I think Mrs.
Clinton is equal to the task of explaining why her experience might
benefit all from Staten Island to Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   So, how many of our 100 US senators were born somewhere else
before lightning struck and they wound up in ``the world's most
exclusive club,'' as nobody actually refers to it anymore?
One-third of our solons, as it turns out: 22 elected as
Republicans, and 11 Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to Globe librarian Betty Grillo, who plumbed the fine
print of Congressional Quarterly's ``Politics in America 1998: The
105th Congress,'' I herewith present the honor roll. You'll notice
that many of the Sun Belt senators, Western and Southern, were
outlanders who migrated to new homes. They also tended to be
four-square for impeachment; we'll leave that to the grad student
theses to explain.
</P>
<P>
   Senators born outside the states they represent: Alaska's Ted
Stevens (Indianapolis); Frank Murkowski (Seattle); Arizona's John
McCain (Panama Canal Zone) and John Kyl (Oakland, Neb.);
California's Barbara Boxer (Brooklyn); Colorado's Ben Nighthorse
Campbell (Auburn, Ca.); Delaware's William Roth (Great Falls,
Mont.) and Joe Biden (Scranton, Pa.); Florida's Connie Mack
(Philadelphia); Georgia's Paul Coverdell (Des Moines).
</P>
<P>
   Idaho's Dirk Kempthorne (San Diego) and Helen Chenoweth
(Topeka); Indiana's Dan Coats (Jackson, Mich.); Kentucky's Mitch
McConnell and Louisiana's Mary Landrieu, (both born in Arlington,
Va.); Massachusetts' John Kerry (Denver); Minnesota's Paul
Wellstone (Washington, D.C.); Missouri's John Ashcroft (Chicago);
Montana's Conrad Burns (Gallatin, Mo.); Nevada's Richard Bryan
(Washington D.C.); New Hampshire's Bob Smith (Trenton, N.J.); New
Mexico's Jeff Bingaman (El Paso).
</P>
<P>
   The man Hillary wants to replace, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, hails
from Tulsa, Okla. Then there's Oregon's Ron Wyden (Wichita);
Pennsylvania's Arlen Specter (also of Wichita _ what's with
Wichita?) and Rick Santorum (Winchester, Va.); Tennessee's Fred
Thompson (Sheffield, Ala.); Texas's Phil Gramm (Fort Benning, Ga.);
Utah's Orrin Hatch (Pittsburgh); Virginia's John Warner (Washington
D.C.); Washington state's Slade Gorton (Chicago); West Virginia's
Robert Byrd (North Wilkesboro, N.C.); and Wyoming's Michael Enzi
(Bremerton, Wash.). Gasp!
</P>
<P>
   Twice as many Republicans as Democrats were born outside the
states they represent. Five were born inside the hated Beltway that
they all run against. But hectoring Hillary is a parlor game, no
matter where you hail from. If being from New York, or for that
matter being born in the United States, were requirements for being
a cab driver there, Manhattan would be denuded of taxis.

 &HT;    Jobs, wages grow beyond projections
 &HT;    By Tammy Joyner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ American companies created more jobs than expected in
July and boosted average hourly wages by 6 cents, the biggest
increase in six months, the Labor Department reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The unemployment rate stayed near a 30-year low at 4.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Employers added 310,000 workers to their payrolls last month,
exceeding analysts' expectations by more than 100,000 jobs. It was
fueled in part by the first employment gains in manufacturing in
nearly a year.
</P>
<P>
   Average hourly wages grew 0.5 percent to $13.29 in July, from
June. Wages, however, are up 3.8 percent from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Humphreys, director of Economic Forecasting at the
University of Georgia's Terry College of Business, was not
surprised.
</P>
<P>
   ``The labor markets are very tight. The unemployment rates are
at historically low levels, thus putting upward pressure on
wages,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Construction firms and service companies were among those adding
jobs. Restaurants and bars increased employment twice as much as in
June.
</P>
<P>
   All retail employment grew twice as fast in the first half of
this year as in the first half of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   While figures for July are not yet available for individual
states, Georgia expects to see a temporary dip in the number of
jobs when its data are released next Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The state's numbers are likely to be off by about 17,000 to
18,000 jobs because of seasonal reductions in employment in the
state's school systems, said Sam Hall, a spokesman for the Georgia
Department of Labor.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the projection, Georgia remains a leader in the creation
of new jobs as more people, especially those who are prime working
age, move here.
</P>
<P>
   As of June, there were about 3.87 million jobs in the state _
about 30,000 more than in May and 120,000 more than in June 1998.
</P>
<P>
   For the first half of this year, the number of jobs grew 3.3
percent from a year ago. By comparison, 2.1 percent more jobs were
added nationally.
</P>
<P>
   Metro Atlanta added 33,000 jobs during the first half of the
year, a gain of 3.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``So Georgia outperformed the nation,'' said Humphreys.
</P>
<P>
   Hall added, ``Our job creation continues to grow at a good,
solid, steady rate but not as rapidly as we experienced in the
mid-'90s, when we really saw a boom in job creation.''
</P>
<P>
   The quality of jobs in Georgia and Atlanta will continue to
attract more people, said Mark Vitner, vice president and economist
at First Union Corp. in Charlotte, N.C. The strongest job creation
was in computer and data processing services, which saw a 19.6
percent increase in the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The quality of jobs being added in Atlanta is among the best
in the country,'' Vitner said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the jobs are in the higher-paying fields, such as
technology. By comparison, fewer people in Georgia are seeking jobs
in lower-paying fields, such as retail services. Vitner noted that
stores at the new Mall of Georgia have had trouble finding workers.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Humphreys said, employers ``are having to pay more
to either bid workers away from competitors or bring workers to
Georgia from other states.''

 &HT;    DeLay: Childhood events help him relate to HispanicsBy Jena
Heath
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congressman Tom DeLay told Hispanic business and
political leaders Wednesday that childhood years spent in Venezuela
and waiting while his mother was detained at a Cuban airport have
helped him understand the experience of Hispanic people in America.
</P>
<P>
   The Sugar Land Republican and powerful House majority whip spoke
to a packed dining room at a National Hispanic Assembly breakfast
on Capitol Hill. His talk before the assembly, an arm of the
Republican National Committee, marked another chapter in the
stepped-up Republican effort to woo largely Democratic Hispanic
voters. That effort has drawn increased attention with Gov. George
W. Bush's bid for the Republican presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay, who lived in Venezuela because his father worked there as
an oil drilling contractor, told the group that he witnessed three
revolutions in the South American country between the ages of 6 and
14. And he described watching ``these really smelly, ugly
soldiers'' lining an airport tarmac in Cuba as Americans were
emptied from a plane. He said his mother was briefly detained.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fight for freedom in Cuba is sort of personal for me,''
DeLay said.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, DeLay lauded Republican congressional
initiatives, bashed President Clinton and exhorted audience members
to encourage Hispanic voters to sign on to the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   There are 7.1 million registered Hispanic voters nationwide, and
registration in Texas is expected to reach 2.1 million by next
year's general election, said Lydia Camarillo, executive director
of the Southwest Voter Registration and Education Project in San
Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic Party still has a firm hold on the minority vote,
including Hispanics, a reality that U.S. Rep. Henry Bonilla, a San
Antonio Republican, is trying to change. Bonilla also spoke
Wednesday, urging the audience to ``take a conservative message to
these neighborhoods'' and to support the American Dream political
action committee, which he heads.
</P>
<P>
   The PAC, formed in 1998 and based in Virginia, raised about
$200,000 in the last election cycle to support Hispanic Republican
candidates around the country, including Texas Railroad
Commissioner Tony Garza's successful race against Democrat Joe
Henderson. DeLay said Hispanic voters hold what he described as
Republican values, ``very pro-family, very pro-God, very
hard-working.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats would likely describe their values the same way,
Camarillo said. She offered a gentle warning to DeLay and other
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's going to be important is their platform, their
position, their stand,'' Camarillo said of Republican candidates.
``Latinos can accept the Republican agenda if it stays moderate and
doesn't attack or use wedging issues.''

GRAND CANYON (Grand Canyon, Ariz.) - Kaibab National Forest makes
its decision about the controversial Canyon Forest Village project
at the gateway to the Grand Canyon. Developers, who have the
backing of environmental groups, want to exchange for 400 acres of
land just outside the park entry-fee station to build hotels,
housing, etc. The other alternative is to keep the community of
Tusayan basically the way it is now and lease about 100 acres of
Forest Service land contiguous to the town to put in vital
services. Cities of Flagstaff and Williams have been very opposed
to Canyon Forest Village because they believe all the tourists will
stay up near the Canyon rather than in their cities. By MARK

   That's the question facing Arizona Republicans, along with those

planning for the political sparring matches cranks into gear. Party
officials blame the low interest on candidates who won't commit to
the debates and on an increasingly front-loaded primary calendar
that could cause the debates to pile up on one another. Officials
with the Arizona Republican Party, who want to host a debate on the
weekend prior to the state's Feb. 22 primary, are worried that it
might be overshadowed by a debate in Michigan, which recently moved
its primary up to fall on the same day as the Arizona election. By

 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Employers hired new workers at a surprisingly
robust pace last month and had to pay substantially more to find
them, the government reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
   While good news in most respects, the report underscored the
mounting pressures in the labor market and substantially increased
the likelihood that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates
at its next meeting, on Aug. 24, as insurance against an
inflationary spiral in wages and prices.
</P>
<P>
   The unemployment rate in July remained steady at 4.3 percent,
the Labor Department said. Meanwhile, employers added an estimated
310,000 non-farm jobs in the month, 50 percent more than analysts
had anticipated, suggesting that economic growth rebounded early in
the summer after tailing off during the spring.
</P>
<P>
   Average hourly earnings in July rose by one-half of one percent,
to $13.29 from $13.23, continuing a gradual acceleration of wage
growth in recent months. Earnings in July grew 3.8 percent over the
previous year, up from a 3.5 percent annual pace in May and a 3.7
percent annual rate in June.
</P>
<P>
   ``Labor is getting more expensive per hour, and we're still
using a lot of it,'' said Donald Ratajczak, the director of the
Economic Forecasting Center at Georgia State University.
</P>
<P>
   On Wall Street, which is far more attuned to the dangers of
resurgent inflation and higher interest rates than to the benefits
of full employment and rising wages, stock and bond prices fell.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 79.79 points to close
at 10,714.03. The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond
plummeted, sending its yield, which moves inversely with the price,
to 6.18 percent late in the day from 6.04 percent.
</P>
<P>
   With the economy eight-and-a-half years into an expansion that
has kicked promptly back into high gear every time it has shown
signs of flagging, the Labor Department report showed that job
growth, adjusted to take account of normal seasonal variations, was
strong in almost all industries.
</P>
<P>
   Of special note was a jump of 31,000 in manufacturing
employment, the first increase in that sector since General Motors
workers returned from a strike last August, and the first not
related to the strike since March 1998. Manufacturers had been hit
especially hard last year by the fallout from the global financial
crisis that began in mid-1997.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, said last month
that the central bank was watching especially intently for any
signs that the combination of low unemployment and strong job
growth was generating wage increases that could ignite inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Some economists said that Friday's data provided more than
enough ammunition for the Federal Reserve to raise its benchmark
federal funds target rate by another quarter point later this
month, to 5.25 percent. The central bank last raised the rate by a
quarter point in June, citing the potential for wage growth in a
tight labor market to outstrip the strong gains in productivity
generated by huge investments in computers and other technology.
</P>
<P>
   The economists said that Friday's numbers reinforced a trend
seen in various economic reports in the last few weeks, including
signs of a dropoff in the growth of productivity, or hourly output
per worker, and a rise in the wage component of the employment cost
index.
</P>
<P>
   ``The data confirm the reacceleration in the economy that I've
been looking for in the summer,'' said Richard Berner, an economist
at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. He estimated that growth is now
running at a 4 percent annual rate, up from 2.3 percent in the
second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the same time they also suggest we're seeing the impact of
tight labor markets on wage setting,'' he said. ``The gentle
acceleration we're seeing in average hourly earnings confirms the
trend we're seeing in the employment cost index and means the Fed
will almost certainly tighten policy on Aug. 24.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on trading in the futures markets, investors are all but
certain that the Fed will raise rates this month. Futures contracts
on federal funds for September yielded 5.23 percent Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Other analysts said the case for a rate increase this month was
not air tight, although they conceded that if the Federal Reserve
did not move this month it would probably do so at its subsequent
meeting in October.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed cut interest rates three times in quarter-point
increments last fall when economies and financial markets around
the world showed signs of seizing up. Many analysts now expect the
central bank to take back the remaining two of those cuts and
perhaps tighten policy a bit more over the next six months or so if
the economy remains strong.
</P>
<P>
   That prospect is already generating political pressure on
Greenspan not to squeeze the economy too hard in an effort to
eliminate inflationary pressures that so far have been more
theoretical than real. Despite rising wages, general price
increases so far have been well-contained, and some sectors of the
economy, including agriculture and manufacturing, complain that
monetary policy is too tight.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Forbes, the Republican presidential candidate, began
running radio advertising this week in Iowa, ground zero in the
dismal farm sector, criticizing Greenspan for pushing rates too
high at a time when crop prices are depressed. The National
Association of Manufacturers released a pointed analysis Friday
concluding that even an acceleration in labor cost growth to four
percent would result in only a small pickup in inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Greenspan has made clear that he views an ever-tighter
labor market as a clear threat to generate inflation and endanger
the stability of the long expansion, which, if it continues, will
surpass at the end of this year the record set in the 1960s. And
while the unemployment rate has hovered at 4.2 percent to 4.3
percent since March, the pace of job creation has picked up in
recent months.
</P>
<P>
   The 310,000 new jobs created in July ``followed a 273,000 gain
in June and was well above the average monthly increase of 208,000
for the first half of 1999,'' said Katharine Abraham, the Labor
Department's commissioner of labor statistics. ``Manufacturing and
construction employment increased over the month, and several
service-producing industries posted sizable gains.''
</P>
<P>
   The rate of job growth over the last year is still relatively
moderate at 2.3 percent, said David Orr, chief economist at First
Union Bank. But he said that even at that rate the pool of
available workers is being steadily depleted because the labor
force has been growing at only 1.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In congressional testimony last month, Greenspan said that ``if
the pool of job seekers shrinks sufficiently, upward pressures on
wage costs are inevitable,'' and that such wage increases ``have
invariably presaged rising inflation.''

BANQUE NATIONALE MERGER BID SEEMS ONLY PARTLY SUCCESSFUL 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl)

<P>
   ROME _ Banque Nationale de Paris all but acknowledged Friday
that it was likely to snare only half the prize in its five-month
old struggle for control of two French banking rivals, Societe
Generale and Paribas.
</P>
<P>
   With Banque Nationale's tender offer set to expire at midnight
Friday, Banque Nationale chairman Michel Pebereau, the architect of
the bank's $37 billion hostile bid for its rivals, said he was
certain of obtaining ``indisputable power of control'' over Societe
Generale, the larger of the two target banks.
</P>
<P>
   Pebereau said Banque Nationale had firm commitments through
investors to get more than 50 percent of Paribas shares. But his
statement, in an interview with the French financial daily Les
Echos, fell short of affirming that Banque Nationale would receive
enough voting stock in Societe Generale to assert clear control.
</P>
<P>
   The official results of the tender, the largest ever in France,
will be announced Aug. 17, but bankers said that a fair idea of the
result should be known toward the end of next week, perhaps by
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Pebereau has asked investors to tender their shares in Societe
Generale and Paribas to Banque Nationale to enable him to create
one of the world's largest banks. Control of Paribas appeared all
but certain, but a hard core of Societe Generale shareholders,
including several major French investors, support the opposition of
Societe Generale chairman Daniel Bouton to the three-way link.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators are said to favor the idea of a three-way merger to
form a strong French banking group. But the government is unlikely
to intervene to mandate such an outcome.

A DRYNESS GRIPS THE EAST; DOMINO EFFECT FEARED

 By BOB HOHLER

<P>
   JEFFERSON, Md. _ The dusty face of a natural disaster,
three-year-old Cody Smith scraped manure in his family's dairy barn
as a heat-stricken cow lay on a bed of hay and struggled to
breathe.
</P>
<P>
   The boy's father, O.C. Smith, called in the rest of the herd,
his voice booming across dry fields of withered corn and brown
pastures with no grass left to graze.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, the boy's grandfather, O. Clayton Smith, padded across
the parched earth to an underground spring that has helped five
generations of Smiths keep their farm from the auction block. The
grandfather kicked the steel top off the spring, and with eyes as
blue as the sky, he peered into an empty hole.
</P>
<P>
   No spring water. No rain. Only dust beneath a searing sun and
clouds of uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   In this once-lush valley in the lap of the Blue Ridge Mountains,
the Smiths are like thousands of farmers along the Eastern seaboard
who are hostages of the Drought of 1999, the worst ever to ravage
some states and the most devastating for other areas since the
Depression.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to hold on,'' said O. Clayton Smith, who is 65.
``But I've never seen anything this bad in my lifetime, and the
stressful part is, I don't know how much worse it's going to get.''
</P>
<P>
   With the crisis escalating, President Clinton Friday warned of a
potentially disastrous domino effect if farms, businesses and
communities continue to sink deeper into economic distress. Citing
federal research, Clinton said the drought is the worst ever for
farmers in Maryland, Delaware, New Jersey and Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
   For Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York and West Virginia, the
rainfall from April to July was the second lowest since the
government started collecting data in 1894, according to federal
officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Throughout much of this country, we have seen the worst
drought since the Dust Bowl days,'' Clinton said, referring to the
Depression-era drought of 1929. ``Such a natural calamity can have
devastating consequences, not only for farmers, but for small
businesses and communities that depend upon a thriving agricultural
sector, and for the electric power systems so vital to our
nation.''
</P>
<P>
   As states throughout the East faced worsening drought conditions
and, in some cases, imposed unprecedented emergency restrictions on
water use, Clinton ordered his Cabinet to form a task force to
coordinate the federal response to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the mid-Altantic region, including Frederick County,
Md., where the Smith farm sprawls through the Middletown Valley,
already has been declared a federal disaster area.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must do more,'' Clinton said. ``It is our duty as a
national community.''
</P>
<P>
   The Smiths and thousands of other farmers are trying to hold on
until Congress provides emergency relief. Without rapid federal
aid, said O. Clayton Smith, he and many other farmers may join the
ranks of colleagues who have been forced to take drastic measures,
such as auctioning off livestock and land.
</P>
<P>
   Most farmers are also coping with the burden of plummeting
commodity prices. For Smith, that meant selling his wheat crop last
month -- the only good crop he expects to harvest this year -- for
$2.23 a bushel, down from the $4 a bushel he received two years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``This drought couldn't have come at a worse time for farmers,''
said Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman, ``because they already are
receiving the lowest prices for their commodities in 20 or 30
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid the clamor for help, Congress shut down Friday for its
August recess and delayed action until September on an emergency
aid package. The Senate last week passed a $7.4 billion relief
measure that would provide direct payments to farmers as
compensation for low commodity prices. But the Senate bill does not
address the drought.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a fix,'' Smith said. ``If we don't get some disaster
money here real quick, we're going to have to start unloading
cows.''
</P>
<P>
   Business is booming at the area's largest auction yard, in
Winchester, Va., where desperate farmers are selling their
livestock at bargain prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're getting hit with the double whammy of the drought and
the rock-bottom commodity prices, and they're saying it's just
impossible to stay in business,'' said Don Vandrey, a spokesman for
the Maryland Department of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   As a consequence, Vandrey said, ``Our fresh farm land is at
greater risk of being sold off and turned into suburban sprawl.''
</P>
<P>
   In parts of Maryland, as much as 80 percent of farm crops have
been lost to the drought, with corn and soybeans the hardest hit.
The meager harvests have produced too little hay and feed to
sustain livestock, and many farmers, like the Smiths, already have
been forced to exhaust their winter supplies to keep their herds
healthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the pastures dried up, we have to feed the cows like we
would if they were walking around in the snow and couldn't get
anything to eat,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   The Smiths already have spent more than $50,000 to replace the
winter hay and feed they have exhausted. They blame the heat and
drought for the recent death of a milking cow worth $2,500. And the
milk production from their remaining 100 cows has dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the barn, where Smith's corn normally grows 10 feet
tall, the shriveled stalks are knee-high. The field where the
timothy should be six-inches tall is fallow. And the freshly mowed
alfalfa sits in paltry rows on a gentle slope, just a fifth of last
year's yield.
</P>
<P>
   If the Smiths hadn't begun pumping their well water for farm
use, their herd would have no water at all. All three springs on
the farm are dry. So are the creeks and the other waterways.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, state officials said a week of drenching thunderstorms
wouldn't replenish the region, though no substantial rainfall is
expected anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Yet O. Clayton Smith rises every day at 3:15 a.m. for the first
milking, as he done since he can remember. His farm has weathered
many calamities through the years, and though he has never
confronted a crisis like this drought, he clings to a strand of
hope.
</P>
<P>
   As a recent visitor walked away from the farm, Smith shouted
across the crusted earth: ``I hope you get rich one day and I get
some rain.''

UT ADDS STEEL SECURITY TO TOWER OBSERVATION DECK AS REOPENING
NEARS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Steven Kraal is cq) 
 
By JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ With a cagelike security enclosure almost welded
into place, University of Texas officials said Friday they will
reopen the tower observation deck to the public Sept. 16, almost 25
years after it was closed to visitors.
</P>
<P>
   From nearby streets, the new stainless steel lattice work that
envelops the 28th-floor deck can barely be discerned. Officials
said they strived to make the barrier conform with the tower's
architectural style and are convinced the sturdy lattice will
answer security concerns.
</P>
<P>
   The deck, which circles the tower just below its gold-leaf clock
faces, was declared off limits to visitors in 1975 because of a
rash of student suicide leaps and the lingering memory of sniper
Charles Whitman's assault in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   The 307-foot-tall tower, which was completed in 1937, used to be
one of Central Texas' biggest tourist attractions, affording views
of the surrounding UT campus; the nearby state Capitol and downtown
Austin; and Hill Country and farmland in the distance.
</P>
<P>
   But the view wasn't all that was lost when the tower deck was
closed. UT officials have described the tower as ``the most
important symbol of academic aspiration and achievement in Texas.''
In recent years, students argued that security issues could be
addressed, prompting a re-evaluation of the closure decision.
</P>
<P>
   Last October, UT officials began exploring the possibilities.
They budgeted about $600,000 _ most of which will be used to make
the deck elevator-accessible for the handicapped and others. Access
has only been available by walking up three flights of stairs from
the 27th floor, where elevators currently stop.
</P>
<P>
   Officials hoped to reopen the deck in time for the spring
commencement, but preparations took longer than expected. But now
that the work is almost complete, officials said the wait will have
been worth it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get a vision of Austin that you cannot get from any other
place,'' said UT assistant vice president Steven Kraal, who is
overseeing the renovation.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond providing a unique sight-seeing venue, the project is
helping revitalize the university's spirit, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The university believes it's important that we make this
facility accessible to the public. It's just too valuable not to be
open,'' Kraal said.
</P>
<P>
   For too long, he said, the tower has cast a negative image among
students and the general public.
</P>
<P>
   ``It won't stop being a negative place until it becomes a
positive place. If people have the opportunity to have half an hour
or 45 minutes up here looking over the city, then I think that's
going to be very positive,'' Kraal said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a gorgeous view,'' he emphasized to reporters during a
preview tour.
</P>
<P>
   When the deck reopens, escorted tours will be coordinated by the
Texas Union, which will charge $3 for visitors. For now, plans call
for tours _ in groups of about 20 or 25 people _ to be conducted
only on weekday evenings and all day on weekends. Tentative hours
are 6 p.m. to dark on weekdays and midmorning to dark on weekends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judging from the interest, we expect every tour to be full
every time,'' Kraal said, adding that ``no one will be left
unattended up here for any length of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Visitors might be more captivated by the view than by the steel
enclosure, which provides an almost unobstructed view of the city.
Architect Lars Stanley of Austin said he designed the metal
structure ``to fit in with the constraints that they had,''
including the historic building's design and its lack of large
elevators to deliver construction materials to the deck.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of small subtleties'' to the finished product,
Stanley said. For instance, fancy curled ends of the stainless
steel rods mimic the scrolled stoneworks that are part of the
clocks' decorative flourishes.
</P>
<P>
   Another constraint was the design ``had to last a long time.
This building is going to be here forever,'' Stanley said.
</P>
<P>
   A final concern for designers was attaching the steel bars to
the building without permanently damaging it. The limestone face of
the tower's highest reaches are still marked by the bullets fired
at Whitman during his rampage. On Aug. 1, 1966, Whitman faced no
security screening whatsoever when he carried a locker of guns and
bullets to the deck and fired at people on the campus and streets
below. He killed 16 people and injured 31 others before being slain
by police.
</P>
<P>
   The tower remained open several years before regents sealed the
deck in the wake of nine suicide leaps.
</P>
<P>
   Because security remains a concern, Stanley said he researched
other lofty perches, including the Plexiglas-enclosed deck atop the
Empire State Building in New York City. Though secure, that design
was ruled out in favor of a more open airy concept.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't want it to feel oppressive,'' Stanley said.
</P>
<P>
   The stainless steel turned out to be the least noticeable
material for the enclosure. Bars painted to blend with the
limestone tower surprisingly were more obvious than the glistening
steel rods, Kraal said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This stainless just kind of disappears,'' he said. ``If you're
on the ground looking up, it's very hard to see this. And it has
the added advantage of it's very low maintenance,'' Kraal said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lighter it is, the less visible it is from the ground.
That was a primary concern. We didn't want to impair the impression
that the tower makes on the campus.'' &QL;

 By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As promised, the world's record companies will introduce a new
recorded music format in the fall that is intended to replace the
compact disk. But with it will come something the industry never
mentioned: a marketing battle that could easily confuse and
irritate consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, the leading record companies and consumer
electronics manufacturers announced that they had agreed on the
broad standards for a next-generation audio disk called DVD audio.
It would offer higher-fidelity recordings with surround sound,
which uses as many as six speakers. And the new format was
intended, over time, to replace the compact disk, which has been
the standard since the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The companies promised that the first DVD audio players and
disks would go on sale in 1999. And sure enough, they are scheduled
to appear in stores in October or November. As it turns out,
though, consumers will not have to choose only between CDs and a
single new format. There will actually be two new ones: DVD audio
and something called Super Audio CD. And that is causing some
record retailers, among others, to despair.
</P>
<P>
   The DVD ``is the most exciting thing to happen to audio in a
long time,'' said Stan Goman, chief operating officer of Tower
Records, the West Sacramento, Calif., company with 227 locations
worldwide. He and others in the record and consumer electronics
industries see the transition as one of the most important and
potentially profitable events in a generation.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this is crazy,'' he added. ``If it becomes a format war,
it will ruin the whole thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Super Audio CD is being offered by Royal Philips Electronics
and Sony, the two companies that created the compact disk and still
split royalties from every player sold. They say their format
provides higher-quality sound than DVD audio _ and does so in what
they call an extension of the CD format, which means they will
continue to control royalties that have totaled hundreds of
millions of dollars over 16 years.
</P>
<P>
   The proponents of DVD audio hope that it will eventually replace
the CD and prompt consumers to update their collections, just as
they did when CDs supplanted records. If that happens, Sony and
Philips will be just 2 companies among 10 that control the patents
and royalties for the new disks and players.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters more confusing, the basic Super CD is actually a
DVD (which originally stood for digital video disk), though Sony
and Philips do not highlight that fact. CDs and DVDs are both
shiny, silver disks, indistinguishable in appearance. But a DVD can
hold seven times as much data.
</P>
<P>
   In public statements, supporters of both formats say they do not
think that a format war is about to begin, even though, for now at
least, Super Audio CDs will not play in DVD audio machines and DVD
audio disks will not play in Super Audio CD players.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of DVD audio _ Matsushita, Pioneer, Toshiba, Time
Warner's Warner Music unit and the Seagram Co.'s Universal Music
Group, among others _ like to say the competition is so lopsidedly
in their favor that they are not concerned.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the five largest record companies _ even Sony Music,
acknowledging the power of the format _ say they intend to sell DVD
audio disks. But only Sony has announced plans to produce Super
Audio CDs as well, though several smaller, specialty labels also
expect to make them. The major music retailers, meanwhile, say they
plan to stock DVD audio disks, and not the Sony-Philips
alternative.
</P>
<P>
   Cost is another big difference: Sony's first Super Audio CD
player will carry a list price of $5,000, five times as much as the
least expensive of the first DVD audio players. And the initial
Sony product will offer only stereo, not multichannel surround
sound. Philips intends to offer Super Audio CD products sometime
next year.
</P>
<P>
   Sony disavows talk of a nasty clash. It says its product is
aimed not at the mass market but rather at a specialized audience
of hard-core audiophiles _ at least at first. ``I don't really
think this is a format war,'' said Michael Fidler, a senior vice
president at Sony.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Reynolds, a senior Philips executive, does not deny the
friction but is similarly sanguine. ``We hate the fact there is a
format war,'' he said. ``But quite frankly we see the two systems
positioned differently.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, speaking privately, others in the industry see a showdown
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   The seeming advantages of the DVD audio format may be only
temporary, and ``the combined power of Sony and Philips is a
juggernaut,'' another Philips executive said. ``If they decide
they're serious, you can't stop them. I'm sitting here praying this
doesn't turn into another VHS-Beta sort of thing.''
</P>
<P>
   It needn't. The world of consumer electronics has changed in
important ways since the infamous format war of the early 1980s
that pitted Sony's Betamax videotape format against VHS, created by
the JVC Corp. Back then, no machine could play both Beta and VHS
tapes. Today, it is a simple matter to make universal players that
can handle DVD audio disks and Super Audio CDs, as well as CDs and
DVD video disks.
</P>
<P>
   So far, though, no manufacturer has announced a plan to make
such a player, in part because of bitterness over earlier
altercations in developing a new format.
</P>
<P>
   When the standards accord was announced in June 1997, the
consumer electronics and recording industries were awash in
optimism. After all, it appeared that they were united behind a
common goal: the creation of a music disk that would re-ignite the
enthusiasm of consumers in a way not seen since the introduction of
the CD in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Here was a solution, at last, to the problem of flagging
recorded-music sales. They had been rising steadily, peaking in
1996 at a value of $12.5 billion, based on suggested list prices,
then dipping 2.4 percent the next year, according to the Recording
Industry Association of America. (By year-end 1998, the value had
jumped to $13.7 billion, though unit sales had not fully
rebounded.)
</P>
<P>
   To choose the best production format, the association and
related organizations announced that competitive listening tests
would be held by the end of 1997. Industry experts known as
``golden ears'' would listen to different companies' offerings and
serve as judges.
</P>
<P>
   Ten days after the announcement, Sony and Philips said they were
working on their own next-generation music disk. Other industry
leaders, knowing of their work, had urged the two companies to make
no public statement, fearing that doing so would undermine the
nascent standards-setting process, but to no avail.
</P>
<P>
   The Sony-Philips statement made no mention of DVD, suggesting
that their goal was to carry the CD format forward, and the two
companies were ambiguous about whether they would submit their
proposal to the listening tests. But few people in the industry
thought they would.
</P>
<P>
   As industry executives said at the time, the other leading
electronics companies were not about to give Sony and Philips
financial and technical control over the next-generation music
format as well as the CD. And Sony executives, in particular, were
considered unlikely to let their product be judged by those they
would consider jealous competitors.
</P>
<P>
   So through the fall of 1997, both camps staged demonstrations
for reporters and industry leaders. In September, David Kawakami,
director of new business development for Sony, announced that Sony
and Philips had already conducted their own golden-ear tests and
that the project was entering its final design stage.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated by that and by internal disagreements on testing
methods, the DVD camp canceled the listening tests. The 10
companies that make up the DVD Forum, which controls the format,
began developing specific technical standards on their own, in
consultation with other affected industries _ disk manufacturers,
for example. Sony and Philips were among the 10 forum members, but,
understandably, they were not given a major role in this work.
</P>
<P>
   In February of this year, the DVD Forum issued what it called
the ``final Version 1.0'' of the specifications for DVD audio,
freeing manufacturers to begin designing players.
</P>
<P>
   The companies decided not to set a single technical standard but
instead to allow record companies to choose from a suite of
standards that offered a range of recording qualities and content
options. With today's technology, companies can easily produce
players that can recognize the standard chosen for each disk and
play it accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   In the following weeks, Panasonic and Pioneer, among others,
announced their intention to begin selling DVD audio players in the
fall.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in early March, Sony and Philips announced that they had
published Version 1.0 specifications for Super Audio CD players,
and the battle was officially under way.
</P>
<P>
   Each format has its own attributes and liabilities. DVD audio
players are intended to be combined with DVD video players. The
combination units will also play CDs, as DVD video players do now.
But older DVD video players will not play the new audio disks, and
neither will CD players.
</P>
<P>
   The new DVD players will reproduce multichannel music, for
people with multichannel audio systems. Until now, these have
appeared mainly in home-theater systems, which are in almost 20
percent of American homes, according to the Consumer Electronics
Manufacturers Association.
</P>
<P>
   The players will also convert the six channels down to two for
the majority of households, which have only stereo systems.
</P>
<P>
   In either case, the music should sound richer and warmer, more
realistic. That is being accomplished primarily by increasing the
digital sampling rate _ the number of electronic moments of music
that are recorded each second. The sampling rate for CDs is 44,100
times a second. With DVD audio, it can be as high as 192,000.
</P>
<P>
   The first DVD audio players are expected to cost $1,000 to
$2,500, and the first disks to cost $20 to $25. Some will offer
video clips and other features as well as music.
</P>
<P>
   Sony and Philips had said all along that Super Audio CD players
would be able to support multichannel formats. But at a news
conference in May, when the companies displayed the first product,
it offered stereo only.
</P>
<P>
   The reason, it seemed, was that the $5,000 Sony player had been
designed for use in Japan, where it went on sale in late May. The
market for multichannel audio in Japan is not big enough to make it
worthwhile; most homes there are too small to accommodate all those
speakers.
</P>
<P>
   But as Mike Woods, president of Telarc International, one of the
smaller labels supporting Super Audio CD, noted at the news
conference, Sony and Philips needed to get their product into the
American market quickly, at least in a tie with the industry
format.
</P>
<P>
   The Super Audio CD uses a different digital recording format,
which increases the resolution of music by ``more closely following
the original wave form of the music,'' Fidler said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Reviewers have praised the much-improved sound quality of both
new disks. ``But it's our opinion that people can definitely hear
the difference in sound'' between the two, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Super Audio CDs are also expected to cost as much as $25 at
first, and the companies have said they will offer one thing that
DVD audio does not: Not only can CDs be played in Super Audio CD
players, but Super Audio CDs can be played in regular old CD
players, though without all the improved sound that the new format
offers.
</P>
<P>
   That compatibility can be accomplished by producing two-layer
disks. One layer holds the new, higher-quality version of the music
and the other a CD-quality version. But these so-called hybrid
disks are more difficult and expensive to make, which is why those
in the DVD audio camp say they have chosen not to offer them for
now.
</P>
<P>
   When both new formats jump out of the gate this fall, DVD audio
will have a decided advantage. DVD video players, first sold in
1997, are already in more than two million American homes, and
sales are growing exponentially, making their introduction among
the most successful in consumer electronics history.
</P>
<P>
   Promoters hope that people who are already interested in buying
a DVD player can be persuaded to pay a little more for the ability
to play DVD audio disks, too.
</P>
<P>
   Music retailers are excited about DVD audio and plan to stock
the new disks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We support it wholeheartedly,'' said Goman of Tower Records.
``It gives us another format we can sell _ and it's not
downloadable.'' That, of course, is a reference to the business
that record stores have lost to the Internet, where many people now
download the music they want. But Goman said his company had no
plans to stock Super Audio CDs.
</P>
<P>
   Neither does the biggest music retailer, Musicland Stores, owner
of Sam Goody and other chains, with a total of 1,350 stores.
``We're very positive about DVD audio, because we have seen DVD
take off so quickly,'' said Gil Wachsman, Musicland's vice
chairman. ``And at the moment we are preparing for that, making the
assumption that it will be the choice of consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he added, ``if consumers show a preference for the Sony
offering, we will make room for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds, the Philips executive, acknowledged that the
proponents of Super Audio CDs ``haven't done much yet with the U.S.
retail chains, quite frankly.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sony-Philips format is not receiving complete support even
from the two companies. Both seem to be hedging their bets.
</P>
<P>
   While Sony says it has no plans to sell DVD players that can
play DVD audio disks, its Sony Music unit will produce DVD audio
disks as well as Super Audio CDs.
</P>
<P>
   Philips sold its record company, Polygram, to the Universal
Music Group late last year, making Universal the nation's largest
record company, with 25 percent of the United States market.
Lawrence Kenswil, president of the electronic commerce and advanced
technology division of Universal Music, said the company had no
plans to support the Sony-Philips format.
</P>
<P>
   Philips has no immediate plans to sell Super Audio CD players
under its own name, but will market them through its Marantz
subsidiary beginning next spring. And it has announced its
willingness to build DVD audio capabilities into its DVD players.
</P>
<P>
   John McCready, executive vice president of Marantz, said that in
order to succeed, Super Audio CD must receive favorable reviews in
the high-end audio magazines.
</P>
<P>
   That will lead audiophiles to start asking for it, he added,
putting pressure on equipment manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no reason a DVD audio player cannot be made to deal
with this format, too,'' he said. ``That, I think, is the long-term
strategy.''

MRS. CLINTON DENOUNCES GOP TAX CUT PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By JONATHAN P. HICKS  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCHESTER, N.Y. _ Offering a sharp condemnation of the tax-cut
package passed by Congress this week, Hillary Rodham Clinton
finished her fourth so-called listening tour of New York state here
Friday, and refused to immerse herself directly in a discussion
about the politics of next year's race for U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a school here, Mrs. Clinton hosted a discussion on
education issues with a group of about 50 invited guests and an
entourage of reporters. She said that the Republican tax cut plan
that Congress passed this week was ``irresponsible'' and that it
would reduce education spending in New York state by $1.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's meeting took place shortly before Gov. George
Pataki held a news conference at which he expressed support for a
Senate bid by New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and suggested
that another Republican, Rep. Rick Lazio, not run for the Senate
seat.
</P>
<P>
   In response to Pataki's remarks, Howard Wolfson, the spokesman
for Mrs. Clinton's exploratory committee, said: ``What the
Republicans do or don't do is up to them. Mrs. Clinton is going to
continue focusing on issues and listening to New Yorkers.''
</P>
<P>
   Minutes earlier, however, Mrs. Clinton brushed aside a
reporter's questions about how she would draw distinctions between
herself and Giuliani, who is also considering running for the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not in a campaign yet,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ``There will
be plenty of time to talk about that. I want to talk about the
issues that people care about,'' she continued, ``and what we can
do to improve education and how to get more jobs and how to provide
health care.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether the personal life of Texas Gov. George W.
Bush, a Republican candidate for president, had received less
scrutiny than that of President and Mrs. Clinton, the first lady
said she did not want to speculate on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   But she quickly added that ``I don't think it serves our nation
or our political process well for people to have every shred of
their privacy taken away from them. I don't think that's good.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton continued, saying: ``I'm speaking as someone whose
been through it so I have some experience in that regard. I don't
think that puts one more job in upstate New York; I don't think
that educates one more child.''
</P>
<P>
   Rochester was the third stop on Mrs. Clinton's listening tour
this week. In addition to Friday's forum, Mrs. Clinton attended a
$500-a-person fund-raising reception in Rochester for Rep. Louise
Slaughter. Two days earlier, she convened a discussion group on
local economic issues at a factory in Jamestown, followed by
another one _ focused on youth violence in schools _ in Buffalo on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   After spending the weekend in Washington, Mrs. Clinton is to
travel to the New York City area for two days, beginning with
another discussion in Brooklyn.

PINCH-HITTING PILOT PROVES WORTH TO BLUE ANGELS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JUDD SLIVKA  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ In the anonymous world of the Blue Angels pilots, they
call him No. 2, the right wing, who flies 36 inches off his boss's
wingtip at speeds where a tiny mistake could spell disaster.
</P>
<P>
   As the Angels' F/A-18 Hornet fighter jets scream across Lake
Washington this weekend, few spectators will know that No. 2 is a
pinch hitter, a former Blue Angel pilot called back two months ago
to help his old squadron mates out during their busiest time of
year. He replaces a pilot who was reassigned after he violated a
unit rule about relationships within the squadron, according to the
Navy.
</P>
<P>
   Enter the new guy, Lt. Cmdr. Mike Dunleavy, 6 feet tall with an
inch or so of closely cropped black hair and white teeth, which he
brushes right before beginning a performance, a long-held
superstition of his.
</P>
<P>
   Although he has a face, a name, a call sign, a personality, what
it boils to is that he is No. 2, so long as he flies with the
Angels.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took me six flights before I was able to fly in public,''
Dunleavy said.``I was lucky enough to meet up with the team in
Montana, and we flew twice a day for three days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to bang the rust off.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the way the Navy wants it: The Blue Angels fliers are
interchangeable, part of a precision team that is known for its
awesome aerials and its public relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a little bit of growing pain,'' says No. 5, Lt.
Doug Verrisimo. ``But now we are back to where we were.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the six-day-a-week flying schedule for the past month
has contributed to their performance since Dunleavy's return.
</P>
<P>
   The fliers train together, travel together, fly together. In
their winter training, they learn each other's every move,
practicing maneuvers so they know every nuance of their performance
on any given day.
</P>
<P>
   As a pinch hitter, Dunleavy is an all-star, able to fly any
position in the squadron. After two years with the Angels, he was
rotated out in a routine move seven months ago and reassigned to a
fighter-attack squadron, ``The Blue Blasters.'' He was getting
ready to head to sea. Then he got the call, and now he is No. 2,
flying as close to the faultless show as he and the rest of the
team can get.
</P>
<P>
   Their moves, after all, are supposed to be automatic.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels' show is 45 minutes of tight turns, steep climbs and
frightening dives that require days of practice and concentration,
including meetings where every movement, every radio call is
rehearsed until each pilot has them memorized. That means few
distractions. It's flying and public relations, and all this stuff
about the removal of the last No. 2, well, the Angels say, let's
just watch the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's two months behind us; now we just want to move forward,''
Dunleavy says.
</P>
<P>
   Even by Navy standards, unity in the Blue Angels is rigid _
after landing, the pilots exit their planes at the same time, walk
down the line of planes picking up each pilot before doing a
right-wheel turn, and only then do they break ranks and shake
hands, and even that looks pretty regulation.
</P>
<P>
   So maybe they are interchangeable, for as the men themselves
will say, they are all ``just pilots'' beneath the yellow flight
helmets and blue jumpsuits _ so it really doesn't matter, does it?

 &HT;    Hubbell relieved Whitewater case resolved
 &HT;    By Bill Rankin
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ They investigated just about every detail of his
professional career. They charged him with federal crimes that
landed him in prison, bringing shame on his family and the Clinton
administration. They even asked him questions about Hillary Rodham
Clinton's sex life.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking before the American Bar Association's annual meeting
here Friday, Webster Hubbell stopped short of criticizing
independent counsel Kenneth Starr over the Whitewater
investigation. But Hubbell, the former Clinton confidante and
high-ranking U.S. Justice Department official, described Starr's
investigators as ``individuals looking for a crime'' rather than
knowing a crime had occurred and then investigating it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not have any candor left if I didn't say I think part
of the approach was political,'' Hubbell said.
</P>
<P>
   Hubbell, 51, served an 18-month prison sentence after pleading
guilty in 1994 to federal charges that he stole more than $400,000
from the Rose Law Firm in Little Rock, Ark. This June, he pleaded
guilty to misleading federal regulators about legal work he
performed at the law firm, and to a misdemeanor charge of failing
to pay taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent plea resulted in no prison time or fine, and
ended a nearly six-year independent counsel investigation of him
and his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just beginning to sink in that it's over,'' Hubbell said
in a brief interview. ``It was all very painful, very difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Hubbell's talk at the ABA convention marked his first extended
remarks since the resolution of his case.
</P>
<P>
   Hubbell said that after he pleaded guilty and agreed to
cooperate with Starr's investigation, the Independent Counsel's
Office apparently did not want to hear his assertions that he knew
of no wrongdoing by President Clinton or his wife, Hillary.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it became my understanding ... they were going to have me
say something about wrongdoing on behalf of the president or first
lady,'' he said. ``Unless I did so I was not cooperating.''
</P>
<P>
   Hubbell said that the Independent Counsel's Office also made it
clear to him that, ``We're going to continue to apply the pressure
on you, your family, on your friends, until you break and tell us
something.''
</P>
<P>
   During one meeting, Hubbell has said, investigators asked him
for details on the first lady's sex life and whether she had an
affair with the late White House counsel Vince Foster, who
committed suicide.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was shocked,'' Hubbell said, adding that he was sure there
had been no affair. ``I thought that had no bearing or relationship
to the investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   He still found some humor in his travails, saying, ``I may be
the only person who's flown on both Air Force One and `Con Air',''
referring to the planes that take federal prisoners from one
facility to another.
</P>
<P>
   Hubbell recalled being taken from his federal prison camp in
Cumberland, Md., to testify before the grand jury in Arkansas, a
trip that required him and seven other prisoners on the plane to
stay over night in a metro Atlanta jail in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   After Hubbell expressed concern about his safety, federal
marshals allowed him to spend the night alone in the jail's
suicide-watch cell, the walls of which smelled of pepper spray. The
next morning, Hubbell recalled, as he was being chained together
with the seven other inmates, one prisoner, pointing to Hubbell's
cell and indicating how he had received special treatment, looked
at Hubbell and said, ``You must be one bad dude.''
</P>
<P>
   While Hubbell cracked a smile telling this story, it was clear
his re-emergence into the public spotlight did not come easily.
During his talk, his hands trembled and on one occasion he needed
to hold his water glass with both hands in order to take a sip.
</P>
<P>
   Hubbell surrendered his law license in 1995 and expressed no
high hope of getting it back. After counseling federal prisoners
for three years, Hubbell said he is now looking for work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the first time in the last three years that I can
actually look for work and know that whoever hires me won't be
subpoenaed,'' he said.

<P>
   It was bad enough that home prices were jumping. Lately,
however, mortgage rates have been soaring as well, breaking 8
percent last week for the first time in more than two years.
</P>
<P>
   Now, frustrated homeowners and buyers have an option that offers
solace. Hoping to keep customers who might otherwise refinance with
another company, a few lenders are offering mortgages whose rates
can go only down, not up, giving borrowers an eventual second
chance at the low rates they missed.
</P>
<P>
   Some lenders promise to automatically lower the rates on
existing mortgages _ repeatedly, if necessary _ when prevailing
rates fall. Others have surprised borrowers by cutting rates on
existing mortgages made without any such promises.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Rawlins was dubious when James C. Riley, the chief executive
of City Line Mortgage, his lender, called one day last summer and
asked whether he would like to cut his payment by hundreds of
dollars a month. It could be done with no fuss in a few days, he
was told.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `yeah, right,''' recalled Rawlins, a sergeant in the
San Diego County Sheriff's office. ```What's this going to cost
me?''' But unlike many offers that sound too good to be true, this
one brought the taker no regrets. The Rawlinses now pay about
$1,550 a month, or a rate of less than 7.5 percent, instead of
$1,800, or nearly 9 percent, on the $192,000 mortgage on their
Rancho Bernardo, Calif., house.
</P>
<P>
   They were also spared the usual refinancing paperwork. And the
only cost _ appraisal and credit check being unnecessary _ was a
few hundred dollars for title insurance and a recording fee.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we had to do was go down to the escrow company and sign
the papers,'' Rawlins said.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of people, of course, have refinanced homes as interest
rates plunged from high double digits in the early 1980s to less
than 7 percent as recently as last April. Some have benefited from
automatic, cost-free reductions provided by adjustable-rate
mortgages. But many people with adjustable mortgages are now
finding their rates going up.
</P>
<P>
   For City Line's borrowers, when rates fall by as little as half
a percentage point, Riley will send e-mail or otherwise notify them
that a lower rate can be theirs, so long as the mortgage payments
have been on time for a year and the borrower remains employed.
</P>
<P>
   City Line, a smallish, eight-year old family-owned mortgage
banker in San Diego, is not being charitable. About a year ago,
Riley decided that there was a better living to be made by
servicing mortgages over many years than by pocketing a quick few
hundred dollars for originating loans and then watching customers
refinance them elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``We service our own loans. If rates drop, why would I want you
to go to Countrywide'' for refinancing, Riley asked, referring to
one of the nation's biggest mortgage operations. ``Why wouldn't I
want to keep you myself?''
</P>
<P>
   Like most lenders, City Line sells its loans to large
institutions. But it continues to service the loans, generating $25
to $40 a month for collecting each monthly payment, writing checks
from the escrow account for taxes and insurance and keeping the
related records.
</P>
<P>
   Riley said he had been overwhelmed with inquiries from the trade
and from area consumers about what he calls his automatic
rate-reduction loan _ especially since Kenneth R. Harney, a
syndicated housing columnist, said such offers ``may be the
mortgage of the 21st century.'' But its spread has been relatively
slow.
</P>
<P>
   One reason is that rates have been mostly on the rise this year,
withering refinancing incentives for all but the most dilatory
high-rate borrowers. Many of those obtaining the loans now,
therefore, are home buyers rather than refinancers.
</P>
<P>
   Close ties to customers could prove crucial in assuring them of
City Line's commitment to automatic downward adjustments, which is
included in both a brochure and loan documents but whose
enforceability appears to be legally untested.
</P>
<P>
   Service Savers in Fairfax, Va., a division of National City
Mortgage, has quietly given these loans to a few thousand customers
since 1993. The company is now promoting the mortgages, while
saying that its commitment to cut rates cannot be legally binding
because the loans would then be harder to resell.
</P>
<P>
   Although Service Savers' rates tend to be a bit higher than
those of other lenders, the company says that its lower closing
costs and the prospect of rate cuts more than compensate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why pay $4,000 to get a lower rate when you can wait and get
that rate for free'' when the market improves, asked Joe Kelly, the
Service Savers division manager.
</P>
<P>
   In Arizona, Ahwatukee Mortgage and Investments Inc., a mortgage
broker in the booming Phoenix area, has fastened onto Riley's
program and steers customers to City Line.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no safer investment than people's homes,'' said
Michael Thomas, Ahwatukee's president.
</P>
<P>
   But it will take time for automatically reducing loans to be
embraced by the industry's giants, Thomas predicted, saying that
they are less intent on keeping their customers and the servicing
income for the long run.

   NEW YORK _ Ever since John Wallace was unhappily shipped north
of the border in 1997, he vowed to return to New York. Less than
two years later _ and with more than a little help from the Knicks
_ the franchise's former first-round draft choice made good on his
word.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Wallace signed a mid-level exception contract with
the Knicks, a three-year deal believed to be worth $6.62 million.
The Knicks essentially acquired another low-post scorer to bring
off the bench, getting a cut-rate deal on a former Madison Square
Garden employee who never wanted to leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be back in New York,'' Wallace said Friday during a
conference call. ``This is where I wanted to be, in my mind, my
heart and soul. The whole time I was watching the finals, I wanted
them to win it. But I also wished I was there at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace, 25, was traded to Toronto two seasons ago in a
three-team deal for Chris Dudley, who was then with Portland.
Wallace was the first of three first-round draft picks by the
Knicks in 1996. He was taken 18th over all.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace delighted Garden fans his rookie season, often scoring
in bunches during limited playing time. He averaged 4.8 points in
less than 12 minutes a game.
</P>
<P>
   He started 36 games his first season in Toronto, averaging 14
points and 28 minutes a game. But he averaged only 8.6 points, 3.6
rebounds and 16.9 minutes in 48 games last season for the Raptors.
The emergence of Tracy McGrady and the Rookie of the Year Vince
Carter hurt Wallace's chances to star. He eventually fell out of
favor with coach Butch Carter over playing time and Raptors
management over a desired contract extension.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond depth, the need for Wallace has more to do with the
Knicks' injuries and lack of a low-post scorer other than Patrick
Ewing or Larry Johnson. When Ewing was hurt and Johnson was their
only threat in the paint, the Knicks were hamstrung offensively.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace can be a defensive liability, but his offense often
forces opponents to double-team him. He can be used at both the
small forward and power forward positions, which may lead to
reduced minutes for other players. ``I'm going to come in and work,
and whatever time I earn, I'll get,'' Wallace said. ``I'm not
locked into anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy welcomed Wallace's return by saying:
``Obviously, we've had a lot of injuries the last year, and
there'll be a quality player who won't be in the rotation. The
thing I like about John is, he will find his opportunities. He
doesn't mind competing for minutes; that's one of the reasons I
respect him so much.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the Knicks used their annual mid-level exception on
Wallace, the agreement means they are no longer interested in
Charles Oakley, with whom the Knicks met with in July about
possibly rejoining the club.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had four guys that we had targeted,'' Van Gundy said. ``We
would have been happy with any of the four. John was the most
interested in us. From the Aug. 1 date, we were trying to do
something. Most of the other guys we were considering were up in
their mid- to late 30s.''
</P>
<P>
   Interim general manager Ed Tapscott said that during its
free-agent deliberations, the team has been scouring the league
more for ability than just trying to fill positions. With 11
players under contract, the Knicks still have the $1 million
exception left to acquire another player. As most of the league's
salary-cap room is gobbled up by big-name free agents the next few
weeks, the club hopes to latch onto another bargain.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, one of their first-round draft picks is back in the
fold.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we traded John, for us it was a necessary evil,'' Van
Gundy said. ``In no way did we want to trade him.'' &QL;

CELEBRATING IN A BIG WAY _ CRUISING TO MEXICO ON SUPERLINER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JEFF LARSEN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For your first cruise you might think a smaller ship would be
better _ less intimidating, more intimate.
</P>
<P>
   Well, my wife, Trish, and I decided bigger might be better. So
to cruise to the Mexican Riviera to celebrate both our wedding
anniversary and her college graduation, we picked Carnival Cruise
Line's newest and biggest ship, the MS Elation.
</P>
<P>
   The giant ship, based in Los Angeles, first set sail last year
and is the seventh in a series of eight 70,000-ton superliners that
Carnival ordered. It can serve more than 2,000 passengers per trip
and has a crew of more than 900. Big is an understatement.
</P>
<P>
   After landing in Los Angeles, we were taken by bus to the ship's
moorage at San Pedro, where we quickly checked in at the terminal
and boarded the ship. Carnival agents assured us our bags would
arrive at our room just before or right after the ship was under
way.
</P>
<P>
   It was a little disconcerting when the ship set sail and one bag
hadn't arrived at our room. I fretted that a huge ship like that
wouldn't be easy to turn around to retrieve our bag, but it
eventually arrived as promised.
</P>
<P>
   We spent the first two days of the weeklong cruise sailing to
Puerta Vallarta. The day after that we sailed back up the coast for
a day in Mazatlan and then on to a five-hour visit to Cabo San
Lucas, a popular resort area on the tip of Baja California.
</P>
<P>
   Our upper-deck ocean-view room wasn't as small as we thought it
would be ... sparsely appointed, but comfortable. When we wandered
up on deck, we also discovered that the ship wasn't crowded with
tanned retirees spending their children's inheritance, as many
prospective cruise customers envision.
</P>
<P>
   The Elation is what Carnival Cruise Lines likes to call a ``Fun
Ship.'' That label obviously means fun for kids as well as
grown-ups.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the usual adult amenities such as bars, clubs, a casino,
workout areas, a jogging track, several Jacuzzis, restaurants and
entertainment centers, the company designed a 2,500-square-foot
``Children's World'' play area into the ship and has actively
solicited the growing family cruise trade.
</P>
<P>
   Once out of port, the first order of business was the mandatory
emergency life-raft drill, where passengers donned their life vests
and _ like a migrating herd _ stepped lively to the ship's muster
stations. Someone made cattle sounds during the drill, but
otherwise all passengers seemed to take it seriously.
(Surprisingly, later in the week the movie ``Titanic'' was shown.)
</P>
<P>
   Then the eating began. The food, no matter which dining area we
chose, was generally good. Pizza, served 24 hours a day, came in
handy between the regular meals.
</P>
<P>
   Trish particularly liked the soft ice cream and frozen yogurt
machines. I thought the juice maker was the most inventive machine
I've seen in a while. Just toss two unpeeled oranges down a funnel
and hold the glass under the spout and out came juice. Hey,
Carnival said it was a ``Fun Ship.''
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual sociological compatibility maneuver, Carnival
tries to match guests with like interests for the sit-down dinners
in two dining rooms, both with two seating times _ early and late.
</P>
<P>
   There are three sit-down dinner issues to consider:
</P>
<P>
   One: You're not required by laws of the open seas or Carnival to
eat the sit-down dinner every night. You can eat free pizza every
night if you like.
</P>
<P>
   Two: If you decide to attend the sit-down dinner every night,
you can change your seating assignment if you are unfortunate
enough to be seated with Homer Simpson and his family.
</P>
<P>
   And three: Even if you think you have already paid for it, the
sit-down dinner isn't exactly free. (I'll get to that later.)
</P>
<P>
   We lucked out and were seated with four very pleasant couples.
Two of them also were celebrating anniversaries. Be aware ... two
of the seven sit-down dinner nights require formal attire (dark
suit and tie for the men is OK).
</P>
<P>
   Elation passengers are encouraged to set their own onboard
activity schedules, and there is a long list of activities that
tries to cover most of the interests of the age groups represented
on the cruise.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the activities such as line-dance instruction and
aerobics are free. The list includes everything from bingo to
talent shows, singles parties, karaoke, disco dance lessons (ouch!)
and even a twist contest.
</P>
<P>
   We talked about hitting one of the singles parties to see if we
still
</P>
<P>
   had it after being married for 32 years, but decided to take a
nap in-
</P>
<P>
   stead.
</P>
<P>
   Mazatlan and Cabo San Lucas were a treat. Puerta Vallarta ...
ho-hum. And like the onboard activity list, we could choose from a
variety of different adventures such as snorkeling, golf and
sightseeing. Or we could just wing it on our own once we left the
ship.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the passengers we talked to agreed the five-hour stop at
Cabo San Lucas on the return leg of the cruise was too short.
</P>
<P>
   Now, why isn't the sit-down dinner free? You paid for it when
you paid for the cruise, right? Well Carnival Cruise Lines suggests
you tip practically anyone even remotely connected to your meal ...
and handsomely.
</P>
<P>
   The cruise line suggests you tip the table waiter, bus boy,
maitre'd and head waiter ... not just your waiter. For the table
waiter they suggest $3.50 per day per person, $2 per person per day
for the bus boy, and the sky's the limit for the maitre'd and the
head waiter. And cash only please.
</P>
<P>
   I was surprised we weren't asked to line up to pay the captain
as we left the ship.
</P>
<P>
   And when you get back to your room after handing out all that
cash at the final sit-down dinner, Carnival wants you to tip your
cabin steward as well _ in our case, someone we never even met _
$24.50 per person for the week.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, we slept well during our final night on board. We
were partly tanned, rested and ready to fly home. I was just glad
to we didn't have to tip the airline pilot, co-pilot and all the
flight attendants. I was out of cash.

SUNTHORN KONGSOMPONG, THAI GENERAL WHO LED 1991 COUP, DIES AT 68 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: France)  By ERIC PACE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gen. Sunthorn Kongsompong, who led a bloodless military coup in
1991 that overthrew Thailand's democratically elected government
and set the stage for a year of military rule, died on Monday in a
hospital in Bangkok. He was 68.
</P>
<P>
   He had been under treatment for several weeks for lung cancer,
hospital staff members said, according to The Associated Press. He
was a heavy smoker.
</P>
<P>
   The Bangkok Post reported in May that after ``Black May, 1992,''
when dozens of demonstrators for democracy were killed or wounded
in a military crackdown, leading to the end of his government,
Sunthorn had ``divided his time between Thailand and France, where
he ran a restaurant.'' He avoided the limelight in his later years.
</P>
<P>
   In the coup, Sunthorn, who was supreme commander of the armed
forces, and other high-ranking officers ousted the prime minister,
Gen. Chatichai Choonhavan, after public concern about inflation,
corruption and other issues had set the stage for their action.
</P>
<P>
   Chatichai, who was seen as more of a political figure than a
military man, had become prime minister in 1988, after a long
succession of military rulers had ended when Gen. Prem Tinsulanonda
stepped down and allowed elections. Chatichai was the first elected
leader to be in charge of the government since 1976.
</P>
<P>
   After the coup, the Chatichai government was replaced by a junta
known as the National Peacekeeping Council. The council was headed
by Sunthorn, who was its chairman. But Gen. Suchinda Kraprayoon,
the commander of the army, emerged as the most powerful figure of
that era.
</P>
<P>
   The military government was widely seen as corrupt. In 1992,
when Suchinda became prime minister, members of Thailand's middle
class rose up against the junta with demonstrations that led to a
military crackdown. Troops shot at pro-democracy demonstrators in
Bangkok, killing dozens and wounding others.
</P>
<P>
   That crisis led King Bhumibol Adulyadej to intervene to bring
about a settlement. Suchinda resigned and was succeeded as prime
minister by a civilian, Anand Panyarachun.
</P>
<P>
   Since the new civilian government was put in place, there has
been a succession of elected governments.
</P>
<P>
   Sunthorn is survived by his second wife and two children from a
previous marriage.

 &HT;    Barton `shark's eyes' haunts last person to meet him
 &HT;    By Francis X. Gilpin
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Ann Greenley hasn't slept well since last week, when
she became the last person that Mark O. Barton spoke to before the
mass murder suspect took his own life at a convenience store north
of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   It was Greenley's automobile that Cobb County police say Barton
attempted to hijack at the Town Center Mall in Kennesaw, a few
hours after his Buckhead shooting rampage.
</P>
<P>
   ``His eyes were cold,'' Greenley, 25, said. ``Every time I think
about it, it reminds me of shark's eyes. I think that's what let me
know how much danger I was in.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview published in the Friday edition of the Marietta
Daily Journal, Greenley said she has been overwhelmed with
interview requests from news media. But she avoided most because
she felt the public should focus on Barton's 12 victims.
</P>
<P>
   Although her moments with Barton were harrowing, Greenley said:
``The people I pray for daily are the ones who got shot and the
ones who died.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenley was leaving the mall about 7:30 p.m. when Barton
approached and spoke to her as she reached into her purse for car
keys.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `Don't scream or I'll shoot you,''' Greenley said.
Barton had his hand in a shoulder bag as he addressed her.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than get in her car with Barton, Greenley decided to try
to make a run back into the mall.
</P>
<P>
   As she sprinted, Greenley said she braced for a bullet in the
back that never came. She said she didn't turn around until she
reached the sidewalk. Barton was walking off, still staring at her,
and still concealing his hand in the bag.
</P>
<P>
   Greenley asked a mall store employee to call police. Meanwhile,
at least two other people in the Town Center parking lot also
spotted Barton's green mini-van. A Cobb County police officer
tailed him along Interstate 75 to the Ga. 92 exit, where Barton got
off and headed west. He pulled into a BP station, and was blocked
in by the Cobb police officer and an Acworth officer. He shot
himself once in the head.
</P>
<P>
   ``The what-ifs are what are most frightening,'' said Greenley,
who is studying criminology at Kennesaw State University and was
considering a career as a victim's advocate even before that night
at the mall.
</P>
<P>
   Her fiance, Curtis Brown, said he is grateful Greenley escaped.
They will wed in October. ``She's a hero, in my mind,'' said Brown.
``I couldn't have done it.

   WASHINGTON WATCH VOTE CHART Questions regarding this
transmission should be directed to 202-628-3100, ext. 224.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 6 -- The following chart shows how senators and
representatives voted on key bills and amendments within the last
week. A ``Y'' means the member voted for the measure; an ``N''
means the member voted against the measure; a ``?'' means the
member did not vote; and a ``P'' means the member voted
``present.''
</P>
<P>
   SENATE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: TAX1
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, July 30, the Senate passed, 57-43, a $792 billion
plan to provide broad-based tax relief and, among other things, end
the so-called marriage tax. Supporters said Americans deserve a
significant tax cut. Opponents said the bill was fiscally
irresponsible and would endanger the country's economic prosperity.
The final version of the bill was then passed Thursday by both the
House and the Senate. A ``yes'' vote favors the tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: FARM1
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Thursday rejected, 47-51, a proposal that would
release $10.8 million in emergency aid for American farmers.
Supporters said farmers all over the country are suffering from bad
weather and plummetting commodity prices. Opponents said this is
only a temporary crisis in the farm industry and they should not
risk long-term farm policy by releasing so much money. A ``yes''
vote favors the measure.
</P>
<P>
   3) BILL NUMBER: FARM2
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Wednesday passed, 89-8, a $7.4 million emergency
aid package for American farmers. Supporters said the agriculture
industry needs help during this severe drought. Opponents said
Congress should wait to see how this year's harvest turns out
before giving so much money to farmers. A ``yes'' vote favors the
aid package.
</P>
<P>
   4) BILL NUMBER: HOLBROOKE
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Thursday approved, 81-16, Richard Holbrooke's
nomination to become the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations,
filling a seat that has been vacant since last September.
Supporters said Holbrooke was highly qualified for the job.
Opponents blamed him for the Balkans policy, which they felt put
too many demands on the U.S. military. A ``yes'' vote favors
Holbrooke's nomination.
</P>
<P>
   5) BILL NUMBER: ARTS
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Thursday failed to pass an amendment that would
have eliminated federal funding for the National Endowment of the
Arts . Voting 80-16, the Senate tabled, or set aside, the amendment
to the Interior spending bill. Supporters of tabling the measure
said the arts was an important element of education. Opponents, led
by Sen. Robert Smith, I-N.H., said it was wasteful and
unconstitutional for the federal government to fund the arts. A
``yes'' vote supports tabling the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   6) BILL NUMBER: TAX2
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Thursday approved, 50-49, the final version of a
10-year, $792 billion tax cut. The bill would trim income tax rates
by one percent, gradually repeal the estate tax until it is
officially eliminated in 2009 and provide relief from the so-called
marriage tax. Supporters said it was a fair, responsible and
balanced bill that would give Americans much-needed tax relief.
Opponents, including some senators who voted in favor of the
original Senate bill, said it was politically motivated and
fiscally irresponsible. President Clinton said he will veto the
bill. A ``yes'' vote favors the tax cut.

   HOUSE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: FOREIGN
</P>
<P>
   The House on Tuesday passed, 385-35, a $12.6 billion foreign aid
bill that provides economic aid, military assistance, funding for
international agencies and money for export assistance. The bill
also denied funding for foreign organizations that perform
abortions and cuts funding for the Peace Corps and the Army's
School of the Americas. Supporters said the bill helps the United
States promote freedom around the world, although many said they
wished the bill directed more money toward that goal. Opponents,
including President Clinton, said the bill cuts funding for too
many important programs. A ``yes'' vote favors the bill.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: VIETNAM
</P>
<P>
   The House on Tuesday rejected, 130-297, an effort to overturn
President Clinton's recommendation to renew normal trade relations
with Vietnam for another year. Supporters of denying Vietnam's
trade status said the Vietnamese government should be held
accountable for the rampant corruption and mismanagement within
their communist rule. Opponents said the measure was an important
step toward normalizing trade with Vietnam, which is a boon for
both American business and the Vietnamese people. A ``yes'' vote
favors denying Vietnam's trade status.
</P>
<P>
   3) BILL NUMBER: HOUSE-TAX
</P>
<P>
   The House on Thursday passed, 221-206, the final version of a
10-year, $792 billion tax cut. The bill would trim income tax rates
by one percent, gradually repeal the estate tax until it is
officially eliminated in 2009 and provide relief from the so-called
marriage tax. Supporters said it was a fair, responsible and
balanced bill. Opponents said the bill was politically motivated
and fiscally irresponsible. President Clinton said he will veto the
bill. A ``yes'' vote favors the tax cut.

TRIDENT SUBS MAY GET NEW MISSION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ED OFFLEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABOARD THE USS FLORIDA _ Cmdr. Greg Billy stepped around a gang
of sailors working on a piece of machinery and climbed up the
narrow steel ladder to the open hatch of the Florida, a Trident
missile submarine based at Bangor on Hood Canal near Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``These ships are national treasures,'' said Billy, who has
commanded one of two rotating Florida crews since August 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The eight Trident missile submarines at Bangor are designed for
a single mission _ to wage global nuclear war if the United States
is attacked, or by their very presence to deter such a conflict.
</P>
<P>
   But the Florida and three other submarines at Bangor may soon by
trading in their nuclear-warhead missiles and taking on a new
mission.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of being retired from lurking deep in the Pacific for
the contingency of nuclear war, the oldest four Bangor submarines
could be converted into cruise-missile ships that would be sent to
crisis areas such as the Persian Gulf, Korea or the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than carrying 24 Trident missiles with six nuclear
warheads each, the subs would be armed with up to 154
conventionally armed Tomahawk cruise missiles, under plans being
considered by the Pentagon and Congress. They also would serve as
the ``mother ship'' for up to 66 SEAL commandos using minisubs
carried by the larger vessel for surveillance missions and raids.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of the Navy Richard Danzig said the cruise missile
submarine proposal is ``an extremely attractive idea'' to Pentagon
planners since the converted Tridents would double the number of
cruise missiles available to a Navy carrier battle group.
</P>
<P>
   The cruise-missile conversion would save the four Trident
submarines from premature retirement, a Bangor official said. The
Pentagon several years ago announced plans to scrap the four
submarines beginning in 2003 as a result of lessening Cold War
tensions and new arms control treaties shrinking the size of the
U.S. and former Soviet strategic nuclear arsenals.
</P>
<P>
   A Navy report to Congress said it found ``no technical
limitations'' that would prevent the conversions from being
accomplished between 2003-05. Both the House and Senate this month
approved $13 million to continue studying the concept before a
formal Pentagon proposal next year.
</P>
<P>
   Billy and other Navy officials say the four Trident submarines
involved could serve for another 20 years after the proposed
conversion to the cruise missile role.
</P>
<P>
   The concept is even more attractive because the four submarines
are ``built and paid for'' and would fill in for surface warships
otherwise required to patrol in crisis areas, said George Behan, a
senior aide to Rep. Norm Dicks, D-Wash.
</P>
<P>
   The new cruise-missile configuration has been touted in defense
think tanks and the halls of Congress for several years after a
mid-1990s Pentagon decision to shrink the Trident submarine fleet
from 18 to 14 submarines to conform with arms-reduction treaties.
While the original plan called for retiring the Florida and sister
ships USS Ohio, USS Michigan and USS Georgia in 2003 and 2004,
experts have argued that the Navy should retain the submarines for
non-nuclear missions.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy estimates it can convert the four submarines for $1.57
billion.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest obstacle to the project involves existing and
planned nuclear arms control treaties between the United States and
the states of the former Soviet Union, the Navy says. Under current
treaty language, the 24 Trident missile launching tubes on the four
submarines would still count against the agreed maximum total of
nuclear warheads allowed on either side, even if the submarines are
being used for non-nuclear missions.
</P>
<P>
   The report notes that the other two options include converting
the subs under the Start Treaty requirements by removing their
existing missile tubes and support gear, which would add at least
$1.6 billion to the total cost, or reopening negotiations with the
Russians over the technical counting language in the nuclear
treaties to allow the conversions using the existing missile tubes
without penalizing the U.S. for the ``phantom warheads.''
</P>
<P>
   If recommended by the Pentagon and approved by Congress next
year, the first two sub conversions would begin in 2003 with the
Ohio _ followed by the Florida 15 months later. The Michigan and
Georgia conversions would begin in 2004.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Billy is in command as the Florida is in the midst of a
five-week ``refit'' period for repairs after the sub's 50th patrol
in the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the standard (repair) package,'' Billy said as he
stepped onto the missile deck and watched as a large dock crane
lifted a large metal container from a forward hatchway and
deposited it on the pier next to a growing stack of material being
removed from the submarine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're reloading stores, we're bringing in parts. We'll be
painting a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Billy said he and his officers are aware of the proposed cruise
missile conversion, but their focus remains on preparing the
Florida for its next nuclear patrol scheduled to begin in late
August. ``We're just starting our refit,'' the captain said. ``And
the clock is ticking.''

WITHOUT ENTHUSIASM, PATAKI ENDORSES GIULIANI FOR SENATE 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also NY-MRSCLINTON) 
(mk) 
 By CLIFFORD LEVY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Seeking to avoid a civil war that could poison the
Republicans' chances next year, Gov. George Pataki on Friday put
aside his antipathy toward New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani,
endorsed him for U.S. Senate and urged the other major contender to
abandon the race.
</P>
<P>
   The governor, who had faced pressure from the national party to
end what had appeared to be a furtive campaign to undermine the
mayor, said Giuliani was the best candidate to take on the probable
Democratic nominee, the first lady, Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki said he had asked Rep. Rick Lazio, a Long Island
Republican who had been planning to enter the primary with the
governor's tacit backing, to run only if Giuliani did not.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio had said in recent months that he would drop out if Pataki
wanted him to, but Lazio's associates said Friday night that he
would not do so immediately. It was clear, though, that without the
support of Pataki, the party leader in New York, Lazio would find
that his prospects would quickly wither.
</P>
<P>
   While Pataki had never formally endorsed Lazio, Pataki's
longstanding reluctance to support Giuliani, and his praise for
Lazio, had signaled his preference. On Friday, though, Pataki said
it was time for Lazio to retreat to the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ``To win, we have to unite behind one strong candidate,'' Pataki
said at a news conference at his Manhattan office. ``I believe Rudy
Giuliani has earned the right to be that candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has not formally declared that he is a candidate, but
he has acted like one, harvesting more than $3 million in donations
and familiarizing himself with regions of the state unaccustomed to
visits from New York City mayors. With a Republican primary now
less likely, Giuliani can train his sights on Mrs. Clinton, in a
campaign that is expected to be one of the most expensive,
contentious and well-publicized in the nation's history.
</P>
<P>
   While Pataki commended Giuliani on Friday, the tone of the
announcement suggested that the endorsement was less than
enthusiastic. The governor called the news conference with almost
no notice and did not appear with the mayor, as is customary at
such events. In contrast, when Pataki threw his support in May to
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas in the Republican presidential
primary, Pataki aides tried to orchestrate a lengthy build-up to
the announcement, and Bush spoke by satellite at the news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after Pataki made the announcement, Giuliani issued a short
statement thanking him, but did not speak to reporters. ``I very
much appreciate Gov. George Pataki's strong words of support,''
Giuliani said.
</P>
<P>
   The endorsement opens a new chapter in a relationship that has
rarely been warm. It was perhaps irrevocably scarred in 1994, when
the mayor supported the incumbent Democrat, Gov. Mario Cuomo, over
Pataki, then an obscure state senator. While they still tend to
utter niceties in public about one another, both men and their
aides are continually suspicious that the other side is engaging in
some strategy to embarrass or hurt them.
</P>
<P>
   And Pataki and his associates obviously realize that if Giuliani
becomes senator, he will gain stature and might even be able to
challenge the governor for the leadership of the party in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki and his advisers said he had decided to issue the
endorsement Friday because the Legislature had just concluded its
annual session, allowing him to concentrate on politics. Pataki
also wanted to head off Lazio before leaving for a vacation in
Ireland and France on Monday. Lazio had planned to announce his
candidacy on Aug. 16th.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's mentor, former Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, who has also
feuded with the mayor, met with Giuliani this week, and their
discussions may have also helped bring about detente. On Friday
afternoon, D'Amato issued a short statement backing Giuliani in the
race, though its tenor left the impression that he too was giving a
grudging endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more important than the maneuvering in New York were the
repercussions of the internecine strife on the national scene.
National party officials are eager to seize the Senate seat, which
is now held by a Democrat, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who is
retiring. But they had expressed growing concern that after a
debilitating Republican primary, Mrs. Clinton would coast to
victory.

   There a Jail Term, Here a Wrist Slap &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Which is the right punishment, 10 years or 10 days?
</P>
<P>
   Glenn O'Hare, a former stockbroker at A.R. Baron, a defunct New
York brokerage firm, was one of 13 Baron brokers and executives
convicted of securities fraud in 1997 in cases brought by Robert M.
Morgenthau, the Manhattan district attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said that O'Hare, who was a broker at Baron for four
and a half years, was part of a criminal enterprise that cost more
than 5,000 investors $75 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Bear Stearns Securities Corp., while neither admitting nor
denying the allegations, agreed last week to pay $38.5 million to
settle the Securities and Exchange Commission charges that the firm
had contributed to the Baron fraud.
</P>
<P>
   As for O'Hare, Judge Edward McLaughlin sentenced him in March
1998 to three and one-third to 10 years in state prison. McLaughlin
said: ``These were not some trivial violations of some obscure,
pecuniary, overly conservative rule that some bureaucrat created.
The conduct here, to use an Old World expression, was in fact
sinful.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, last month, the National Association of Securities Dealers
disclosed its own disciplinary actions: it fined O'Hare $5,000 and
suspended him for 10 business days.
</P>
<P>
   The NASD said the vast difference in punishments was a result of
its lacking subpoena power and having to rely on customers who
offered their testimony to regulators. Furthermore, the review
period of the case was one year, not the four years of the firm's
operations that the district attorney scrutinized.
</P>
<P>
   Barry R. Goldsmith, enforcement director at NASD Regulation,
said: ``While these are certainly much less severe sanctions, we
can only bring cases on the evidence we have during the period.''
</P>
<P>
   Good thing there are prosecutors like Morgenthau around. Without
his office's efforts, O'Hare might be making cold calls to this
day. &QL;

   A New Way to Get the Goods &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Two on-line financial services, Edgar Online and its competitor,
Free Edgar, battled it out _ until they announced merger plans in
July _ to provide investors with access to data on publicly traded
companies. Now another company, 10K Wizard, has entered the fray
and offers an even easier way to search the scores of Securities
and Exchange Commission documents and filings.
</P>
<P>
   Its service (www.10Kwizard.com) appears to provide something the
others cannot: free searching with keywords, including executives'
names, across every SEC document ever filed on line. Filings are
detailed, making it easy to find information on any of 68,000
public companies.
</P>
<P>
   The site was developed by Martin Zacarias, a recent graduate of
the Harvard Business School, and Kee Kimbrell, a former game
designer, who were frustrated by the existing online services.
Bypassing venture capitalists for now, they raised $600,000 from
friends and associates and founded the company.
</P>
<P>
   Zacarias intends to keep offering 10K Wizard's services free
(like those of Free Edgar), supporting the site by advertising and
licensing deals rather than offering the premium, for-pay services
that Edgar is known for. &QL;

   An Index of Their Own &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When seemingly every television commercial refers to a dot-com
address, it's hard to imagine a Rip Van Winkle who is unaware that
technology and telecommunications stocks are hot. But how hot?
</P>
<P>
   To answer that question _ and a host of others prompted by
changes in the world economy in the last 10 or 15 years _ a new
industry classification system has been drawn up the Financial
Times/Standard &AMP; Poor's-Actuaries world index.
</P>
<P>
   Indexes that track sectors are important to mutual fund
portfolio managers and some individual investors. ``There has been
a recent trend, especially in Europe, toward more `sector-based'
fund management,'' said a statement from Goldman, Sachs, which
helps compile the indexes.
</P>
<P>
   Telecommunications, for example, used to be included in the
category ``utilities,'' but times have changed since the phone
company was known as Ma Bell. So now, telecommunications companies
have been moved to a sector of their own.
</P>
<P>
   Another addition is the Information Technology Economic Group,
making up 14 percent of the global index, and it, too, has
performed strongly.
</P>
<P>
   In a third change, health care, which has outperformed the old
health and personal care index, and pharmaceuticals, which have
lagged behind, are now in separate sectors.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, the indexes classify stocks into 10 economic groups,
39 sectors and 101 subsectors to provide detailed global sector
analyses.

POSSIBLE HINCKLEY RELEASE DEBATED

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Within hours of life-saving surgery to remove the
bullet lodged in his lung, President Ronald Reagan scribbled this
note to one of his nurses: ``What happened to the guy with the
gun?''
</P>
<P>
   What happened is that John W. Hinckley Jr., found not guilty by
reason of insanity for his 1981 attempt to assassinate the
president, has gotten well, his psychiatrists say.
</P>
<P>
   Hinckley's psychotic illnesses are in remission, according to
his doctors at St. Elizabeths Hospital here, where Hinckley was
committed a year after shooting Reagan, James Brady, his press
secretary, a Secret Service agent, and a policeman outside the
Washington Hilton Hotel. Doctors believe the depressed, delusional
young man who said he wanted to impress actress Jodie Foster is now
a 44-year-old adult healthy enough to embark on supervised outings.
</P>
<P>
   Hinckley has not taken pyschotropic medications since 1992. He
lives on a low-security ward and holds a part-time clerical job at
the hospital. His supportive parents live nearby, and his fiancee
Leslie deVeau, herself a former St. Elizabeths patient, revealed in
a recent New Yorker interview that the once-violent Hinckley now
writes love songs and tenderly calls her ``the sunshine of my
life.''
</P>
<P>
   But others less connected to Hinckley are skeptical about the
doctors' diagnosis and note that Hinckley has a long history of
deceiving the staff at St. Elizabeths. And they are alarmed that a
man who almost killed the president and paralyzed his press
secretary now is deemed not dangerous and might someday walk free
in the very city where he caused such mayhem.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a no-brainer. This is a man who tried to kill the
president!'' said Joseph diGenova, a former US attorney who
strenuously objects to a recent federal appeals court ruling that
gives Hinckley's doctors, not a judge, the authority to release him
for supervised visits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't trust anyone who is directing a therapeutic regime to
make a sound public-policy decision,'' diGenova said. ``Hinckley's
going out into the community should not be up to a group of doctors
who desire to see him cured and want to prove it to the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Families of his victims refused to comment about Hinckley for
this story. But on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America'' earlier this
year, Maureen Reagan said she was ``irate'' at the idea Hinckley
would leave St. Elizabeths, and she blamed the decision on liberal
judges who did not like her father.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Levine, Hinckley's lawyer, says the case is about
rehabilitation, not retribution. ``This man is not a prisoner, he's
a patient,'' said Levine, who suggests the visits are a ``precursor
to larger liberties'' for Hinckley. ``He is entitled to treatment.
The next step is this very modest reintroduction into the
community.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinically, that's right. Psychiatrists universally agree that
people recovering from mental illness need to ease back into
society. As part of their therapy, patients at St. Elizabeths, the
nation's largest public psychiatric hospital, routinely leave the
grounds for staff-supervised social outings, shopping trips, and
holiday visits.
</P>
<P>
   Often, these outings lead to greater freedom and eventually
release from the institution. In nearby Maryland, for instance, the
average hospital stay for a mentally ill patient who commits murder
is seven years.
</P>
<P>
   But in this notorious patient's case, clinical decisions have
been weighed against negative public opinion and concerns for
Hinckley's own safety outside the hospital. Hinckley's extremely
restricted life _ he has been allowed to leave the hospital only
once in 17 years, for a 12-hour visit with his parents in December,
1986 _ and the strenuous opposition to his quest for freedom by the
US attorney's office here, and the Secret Service, have more to do
with his terrible act than with the severity of his schizophrenia
or the risk he will become violent again.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Neil Blumberg, a Baltimore forensic psychiatrist, said the
majority of people who commit violent acts but are found not guilty
by reason of insanity do get better with drugs and treatment, are
eventually discharged from maximum-security hospitals, and live
independently as law-abiding citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Blumberg said Leslie deVeau, who he has evaluated extensively,
is a ``poster child'' for rehabilitation from mental illness. In
1982, deVeau took a shotgun and murdered her 10-year-old daughter
in her bed. Ruled insane and committed to St. Elizabeths, DeVeau
made such extraordinary progress that in 1985 she was awarded
permanent outpatient status and five years later a judge declared
her legally sane. She says her friendship with Hinckley, which was
born and grew in the hospital, was therapeutic for both of them.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in arguing for supervised, off-site visits in 1997,
Hinckley's doctors reported positive, ``profound changes'' in their
patient. He was showing no symptoms of depression or schizophrenia,
they said, and the narcissistic personality disorder that drove his
pathological need to get attention had not disappeared but was much
reduced.
</P>
<P>
   In about one-third of all cases, schizophrenia can be ``cured.''
But, without medication and ongoing therapy, patients remain
vulnerable to the illness recurring, said Dr. Harold J. Bursztajn,
co-director of Harvard Medical School's Program in Psychiatry and
the Law at the Massachusetts Mental Health Center. ``To send
someone out without those things is like asking them to navigate
and fly a plane without instruments,'' Bursztajn said.
</P>
<P>
   Hinckley's lawyer has accused the US attorney of
``fearmongering'' in describing his client as disturbed, dangerous,
and unpredictable. In fact, one major risk factor for violence
among people who are mentally ill is a history of violence. Because
of Hinckley's record, it would be ``unfair to the people in this
commmunity and unfair to Jodie Foster, to release him unless he is
on medication,'' said Dr. E. Fuller Torrey, a research psychiatrist
and an authority on schizophrenia.
</P>
<P>
   Torrey, who has been involved in the Hinckley case, says
Hinckley suffers from a ``fixed delusional system'' that over time
has made it quite difficult for St. Elizabeths psychiatrists to
evaluate him accurately. In the late 1980s, they petitioned the
court to allow him day trips, only to discover that Hinckley had
corresponded with murderer Ted Bundy, referred to Charles Manson as
a ``cool dude,'' and still collected photos and drawings of Foster.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Blumberg, who has never examined Hinckley but has had
conversations about his condition with deVeau, said it is very
unlikely that after 17 years of uninterrupted observation and
treatment, St. Elizabeths professional staff is going to
misdiagnose their patient.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because this is such a high-profile case, no one wants to have
egg on his face by saying Hinckley is ready to go, and then have a
disaster happen,'' Dr. Blumberg said.
</P>
<P>
   The US Justice Department last month let the deadline pass for
taking the Hinckley case to the Supreme Court, in essence giving up
the fight to bar supervised visits. However, for Hinckley's safety
and privacy, the hospital refuses to say whether or when its
patient has left the grounds. It will, however, inform the Secret
Service of Hinckley's outings.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be a very controlled and progressive and carefully
analyzed thing,'' said Walter Smith, special deputy for the
District of Columbia's corporation counsel, which represents St.
Elizabeths in court. ``I don't contemplate you will be running into
John Hinckley at the grocery store one day and at the bowling alley
the next day.''
</P>
<P>
   Representative James Traficant, Jr., an Ohio Democrat, thinks
that is only a matter of time. ``What is next, Mr. Speaker?''
Traficant said in a recent speech on the House floor. ``White House
tours? Disney World?
</P>
<P>
   ``Beam me up,'' Traficant added. ``Hinckley should go to jail.
We should throw away the keys.''

 &HT;    Shooting suspect was `tired of hearing rumors,' lawyer says
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIANA, Ala. _ Alan Eugene Miller, charged with killing
three people at two separate businesses in Shelby County on
Thursday morning, told one victim he didn't like what he was saying
about him before shooting him repeatedly, a prosecutor said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   During Miller's initial court appearance, District Attorney
Robert E. Owens Jr. told Circuit Court Judge J. Michael Joiner that
after Miller shot two people to death at Ferguson Enterprises, the
heating and air conditioning business in Pelham where he worked,
the 34-year-old trucker drove five miles to Alabaster to confront a
former co-worker at Post Airgas where he used to work.
</P>
<P>
   There, according to Owens, he told Terry Jarvis, 39, ``I'm tired
of hearing rumors about me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Thereupon he raised his gun and struck the victim with
numerous shots,'' Owens told the judge, but allowed two witnesses
to flee unharmed.
</P>
<P>
   Miller's mother told reporters that her son had been laid off
from Post Airgas earlier this year because of ``economic
downsizing.''
</P>
<P>
   Joiner granted Owens' request that Miller be denied bail. Miller
is charged with one count of capital murder resulting from multiple
murders. Authorities are analyzing a handgun recovered from
Miller's car.
</P>
<P>
   During several interviews outside court, Owens refused to
speculate on what Miller might have thought people were saying
about him or what else might have prompted the three shootings that
came one week after Mark O. Barton shot to death nine people at two
day-trading stock firms in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the motivation is going to be exactly the same for all
of the victims,'' Owens said in interviews. ``What that motivation
is, we still need to find out.''
</P>
<P>
   For the 10:30 a.m. hearing, authorities drove Miller less than a
mile from the county jail to the courthouse in an unmarked, dark
blue Chevy. The car rocked as Miller _ listed by police as
5-foot-11, 350 pounds _ exited the right-rear passenger door. He
didn't answer as reporters asked if he wanted to make a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Miller wore a prison uniform the color of a navel orange. He had
matching flip-flops. The resident of Billingsley entered the
courtroom shackled in shiny, silver chains secured by a padlock and
handcuffs.
</P>
<P>
   In the courtroom, Miller spoke only once. Joiner asked the
suspect if he understood an affidavit he was to sign that stated he
had insufficient funds to hire his own attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, sir,'' Miller said. He signed left-handed.
</P>
<P>
   Owens told the judge that at least two people Miller encountered
at the businesses pleaded with the suspected gunman to be spared.
Owens said after Lee Holbrooks, 32, and Christopher Yancy, 28, were
killed at Ferguson Enterprises, another person walked through the
front door and saw Miller.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't shoot me. I haven't done anything,'' said the witness,
who then ran, Owens said in court. The prosecutor didn't identify
the witness.
</P>
<P>
   At Post Airgas, where officials say the shootings ended, another
witness encountered Miller and asked not be killed. The suspect,
Owens said in court, told the witness where to seek safety. Miller
is scheduled for a preliminary hearing Sept. 1. After Friday's
proceedings, Mickey Johnson, one of Miller's two court-appointed
attorneys, said he had interviewed Miller's family Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no psychological basis for this, but he seemed
confused to me,'' Johnson said.

REPUBLICANS TO PITCH $792 BILLION TAX PLAN TO AMERICANS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republican lawmakers headed home Friday to peddle
their $792 billion tax-cut package to the American people,
beginning a political sales campaign that's sure to get nasty as
the Labor Day start to the 2000 election cycle approaches.
</P>
<P>
   Expressing confidence that their appeal will resonate with
voters, Republican leaders plan to use their tax-cut pitch during
Congress' monthlong summer recess to more clearly define their
values in the face of Democratic criticism. Democrats say the tax
reduction measure is too big and ``reckless'' because it relies on
uncertain budget surplus forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a dramatic difference between Republicans and
Democrats in this capital city, and this is the dividing line,''
House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer, R-Texas,
declared, setting the stage for a veto showdown with Clinton when
Congress resumes work Sept. 7.
</P>
<P>
   But President Clinton, expressing a confidence of his own that
the public will reject the plan, said Friday that it ``will not
become law'' as long as he is president.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who plans to help Democrats mount their own public
relations campaign against the GOP plan, said he favors giving as
much surplus money back to taxpayers as possible. But he stressed
that tax breaks should be given only after shoring up Social
Security, strengthening Medicare, and investing more in education
and defense programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can have a tax cut, but it is wrong to put the cart before
the horse,'' Clinton said, likening the Republican plan to paying
for a vacation ``before we pay the home mortgage and send the kids
to college.''
</P>
<P>
   The $792 billion measure narrowly approved Thursday by the
Republican-controlled House and Senate would amount to the biggest
reduction in income taxes in 18 years. Republicans insist that it
can be done if surplus projections of nearly $2 trillion in Social
Security taxes and about $1 trillion from other withholding taxes
hold and government spending is held in check.
</P>
<P>
   But they too are having a hard time resisting the urge to spend
more money.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans in the House and Senate acknowledge that their 2000
spending plans could be $21 billion to $30 billion over the
spending caps set in the 1997 budget negotiations with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, The New York Times reported that Republican leaders
have a plan to spend all of the $14 billion in anticipated
non-Social Security surpluses next year in hopes of maneuvering
Clinton into raiding the Social Security Trust Fund if he wants
more for his favored programs.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican strategy could set up another confrontation with
Clinton similar to the one in 1995 that led to two partial
government shutdowns if he vetoes any of next year's spending bills
and demands more funding.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will negotiate with the president, after he vetoes the
bills, on his knees,'' House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, said
in the Times article.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay, a hard-line advocate of reduced government spending, said
if the negotiations yield an agreement to lift the spending caps,
then that would be OK with Republicans as long as the public
believes ``it's the president who's busting the caps, not us.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton seized on what he called DeLay's ``secret strategy'' as
evidence that Republicans are willing to play politics with Social
Security just to push their political agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can think of nothing more cynical and irresponsible,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Times article caused a bit of an uproar on Capitol Hill, and
DeLay issued a statement saying his remarks had been ``clearly
misinterpreted.'' He insisted Republicans would keep spending next
year ``under the (1997) agreement levels'' and ``will never spend a
single cent of the surplus funds in the Social Security system.``
</P>
<P>
   But he added that ``the choice'' is Clinton's. ``If he wants to
spend more on his big government programs, he will have to raid
Social Security to pay for them.''
</P>
<P>
   The dust-up over DeLay's comments was just a sample of what's to
come as Republicans and Democrats wage their public relations war
during the next 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have scheduled 618 ``town hall meetings'' on the
issue and a dozen or so ``tax cut rallies'' to help boost their
cause. They also have planned dozens of radio and talk show
appearances by Republican leaders, and some members, including
House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, plan to go on-line on
the Internet to ``chat'' about what's in the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Armey told reporters the lobbying effort is designed to make tax
cuts ``the topic of dinner conversation'' all over the country.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans are trying to encourage a television and radio
advertising campaign funded by outside groups with a stake in the
bill.
</P>
<P>
   House Republican Conference Chairman J.C. Watts of Oklahoma said
the monthlong Republican effort would be divided into four themes,
beginning with explanations of how the package would help seniors
and ensure continued economic growth. The last two weeks of the
campaign, he said, would focus on the benefits that women and
families can expect to receive, including credits for education and
child care, tax rate reductions, and the elimination of the
so-called ``marriage penalty.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it's very important over the next 30 days that we
drive this message ... and let people know what's in this tax
package,'' Watts told reporters Friday. ``We've go some selling to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Watts and other GOP leaders have handed out assignments to many
of their colleagues who will travel the country speaking about
provisions that they helped write into the bill. Sen. Kay Bailey
Hutchison, R-Texas, for example, will take the lead in pushing the
benefits that would come from doubling the standard deduction for a
married couple filing jointly.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Friday, she said elimination of the
marriage penalty is ``our highest priority.'' She called the
current law, which makes married couples pay more than they would
by filing separately, ``a terrible inequity.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican pollster Ed Goeas said Republicans can expect to win
over a lot of Americans, even those who now side with Clinton's
approach to handling the projected surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   Recent polls suggest that most Americans believe the surplus
should be used to boost Social Security and Medicare, and invest in
new education programs.
</P>
<P>
   But Goeas said the good news for Republicans is that polling
also indicates that ``in their gut (Americans) think they should
get a tax cut and they think they deserve it.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Republicans will have to be careful not to allow their
plan to be painted as a boon for the affluent and big corporations
at the expense of the lower-income earner, an argument that the
Democrats plan to make in their counter offensive.
</P>
<P>
   That argument already has gotten a boost from a few moderate
Republicans, including Sen. John McCain of Arizona, who says the
bill would reward special interests immediately with tax breaks but
would delay most reductions for average Americans.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, a candidate for the Republican presidential nomination,
trashed the bill during a floor speech last week because he said it
complicates the tax system and would sunset in 2009 because
Republicans really are concerned that anticipated surpluses may not
materialize.
</P>
<P>
   And even Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the leading contender for
the Republican presidential nomination, favors an approach that his
aides say would be tilted more toward giving lower-income Americans
a larger share of the breaks.
</P>
<P>
   Goeas stressed that while Republicans may differ among
themselves about how to cut taxes, it's important that they fight
for their philosophy of returning ``a balanced budget dividend'' to
taxpayers, regardless of their income level, in order to keep their
conservative base happy.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans plan to send their tax bill to Clinton to sign
or veto when they return after Labor Day. Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott, R-Miss., said told reporters as he left town Friday
that he still believes that ``miracles can happen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's in the hands of the American people what happens
with this bill,'' he said. ``It will be up to the people during the
month of August to...express themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If they will do that,'' he added, ``the president will sign
this bill.''

CARROLL'S NEW TOUGH-GUY APPROACH COULD EARN EATON PRO BOWL BERTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SMITHFIELD, R.I. _ Chad Eaton is one of the funniest people on
the New England Patriots. At the same time, he is one of the most
serious. He has taken a no-nonsense approach in raising his playing
status from practice squad to starter, and this season he could
take his game to the next level: the Pro Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   He knows he needs to be pushed if he's going to raise the bar,
so he likes what's happening at training camp, where head coach
Pete Carroll has taken the reins away from the veteran players and
assumed the role of leader himself.
</P>
<P>
   This training camp has been tougher than what Eaton had been
accustomed to. Tougher than under Bill Parcells, and definitely
tougher than under Carroll the previous two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Eaton may be a little biased, because he's always been a Carroll
booster even though it was the Parcells regime that brought him to
New England.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as we were given some leeway, we took things for
granted,'' said Eaton. ``Pete had to toughen up. I love it. Instead
of the 1s going up against the 2s, the 1s get a better look against
the 1s. You don't have that confidence of beating up on the 2s now.
You have to do what you have to do against the 1s. We've had seven
straight days of double days. he's beating on us.''
</P>
<P>
   Eaton has been lined up against No. 1 pick Damien Woody every
day except the first day of camp, when Carroll wanted to let the
center out of Boston College break in gradually, At Saturday's
intrasquad scrimmage at Foxboro Stadium, one of the battles that
Carroll will be focusing on will be Woody vs. Eaton. It'll be a
huge test for the rookie, because Eaton has become one of the best
nose tackles in the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beat him up. Beat him up. That's all they say to me,'' said
Eaton about the instructions he's been receiving from the coaching
staff concerning his one-on-ones against Woody.
</P>
<P>
   ``That kid has made vast strides. Sometimes I get into my stance
and I say, `What am I gonna do next? He stopped that move, and he
stopped this one; now what? I only have three.' He's definitely one
of the most improved guys in the last seven days. Everyone says we
don't have Dave Wohlabaugh, but I'm telling you, people aren't
going to be saying that because this guy is going to be a good
player for the next 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Eaton thinks it's been the approach of the coaching staff that
has brought Woody along so quickly. Carroll is taking that
1s-vs.-1s approach around the practice field, also lining up
cornerback Ty Law against receiver Terry Glenn.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll's tough new approach has filtered down to his
assistants. Offensive line coach Dante Scarnecchia has been all
over his charges; Friday, for example, the smoke was coming out of
his ears when Damon Denson showed improper technique on a play.
Scarnecchia has also been all over Woody. And Carroll clearly
approves, knowing that his new line coach needs to light a fire
under an underachieving unit that will have to improve its run
blocking to spring loose a Robert Edwards-less backfield.
</P>
<P>
   Will the tough new approach work? That remains to be seen. Eaton
buys into the New Carroll, and he says all the players he's talked
to about it agree. When Carroll cut one player for being late for
his physical and another for being too overweight, said Eaton, that
sent a clear message to the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're puppets,'' said Eaton of the players. ``If there's water
over there and he says you can't drink it, we're not going to drink
it or you'll be out of here. Some guys will, and those guys won't
be here. He can make the change. This is the best I've seen Bruce
Armstrong look under anyone. A lot of guys like the physical, new,
long practices because we need that to knock some sense into us.
We're a talented team, and we need to be on the edge at all
times.''
</P>
<P>
   Eaton doesn't think the change in Carroll is forced. He thinks
it's a natural process for a coach who hasn't quite gotten it done
in a kinder, gentler way. ``You know why he changed,'' said Eaton.
``Everybody's job is on the line, from head to toe _ the players,
front office, personnel staff. He had to change it. I think it is
natural. He's been around such good teams he knows what it takes to
win. He came to this team, and he thought since they went to a
Super Bowl they must know what they're doing. Apparently we didn't.
So now we have to pull back and take control of these guys because
they don't know how to get it done on their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy has had a lot of bad luck. When you lose (Willie)
McGinest, Glenn, (Ben) Coates, and (Drew) Bledsoe, I don't think
anyone is gonna feel real good about themselves. Taking this team
to the playoffs even after that terrifying loss to New York and
then Jacksonville proved that you can only listen to team leaders
for so long, but you have to get the leadership from the head
coach. He's the kind of guy who can come back and modify things,
and the guys will listen to him. I think guys have listened to
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll has tried to stay away from the topic of his change in
approach. Asked about how he's changed, he said, ``I don't know
what it is. Like I told you before, I think as you grow with your
team, and the situations arise where you're not happy with the
results, you'd better adapt and you'd better adjust, and if that's
what it is, then that's what this is. We're coaching very hard.
We're trying to demand, at all times, everything these guys have to
give to this team. I'm just coaching everything I have to coach,
and I'm having a blast.''

   &UR; UFdrop,5,160 &LR;  I  &UR; rr &LR;  t changes the way you think of those
paragons of New England society, the Yan- kees, to learn that
Vermont scientists had an active program to breed them.
</P>
<P>
   But there it is, in the archives at the Public Records Office in
Burlington: the long-abandoned paperwork of the Vermont Eugen-
 &UR; -------------------- &LR;  ics Survey, tracing in businesslike diagrams
the ``degenerate'' blood- lines that social scientists in the 1920s
and '30s hoped to eliminate and the ``old pioneer stock'' they
hoped to replenish.
</P>
<P>
   A dozen times, as she paged through the old records, Nancy
Gallagher thought about abandon- ing her project.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, no historian had ever written a book about
Vermont Eugenics Survey's 12-  &UR; -------------------- &LR;  year study of
``good'' and ``bad'' families, which was widely circu- lated among
policymakers and cul- minated in a law providing for the
sterilization of several hundred poor, rural Vermonters, Abenaki
Indians, and other people deemed unfit to reproduce.
</P>
<P>
   The story of state-level eugen- ics was largely untold. Some-
where, between Gregor Mendel's revolu- tionary work in genetics and
the Nazis' bizarre distortion of it,  &UR; -------------------- &LR;  there
was a void in the teaching of history.
</P>
<P>
   But on the other hand, she knew there are people in the state
who would read their own family histories in her book.
</P>
<P>
   Gallagher wasn't a bomb- throwing revisionist historian, she was
a 50-year-old former biology teacher who expected her doctoral
thesis to ``sit on a shelf,'' and she had stumbled into a subject
both  &UR; &AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP;&AMP; &LR;  
 &UR; (NU)(NU)(NU)(NU)(NU)(NU)(NU)(NU)(NU)(NU)(NU)(NU)(NU)(NU)(NU)(NU)(NU
)(NU)(NU)(NU) &LR;  unexplored and painful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every step of the way,'' said Gallagher, ``I wondered if I
should even be writing it.''
</P>
<P>
   When her book, ``Breeding Better Vermonters: The Eugenics
Project in the Green Mountain State,'' is published by the Univer-
sity Press of New England later this year, the wondering will be
over. Gallagher and the rest of the state will be left with the
emotion- al fallout of a historical episode that no one, not even
its victims, particularly wants to discuss. The Eugenics Project
was an obscure independent effort whose only real effect was the
sterilization law, but its archives reveal a mindset so abhorrent
that the historian who first discovered the papers walked away from
the subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a real dark streak in me, and it's very dark
material. You can try and not be affected by it, but there's a lot
of hate in it,'' said Kevin Dann, a his- torian in Woodstock who
came upon the crates of eugenics sur- veys almost accidentally in
the mid-1980s and published the first article about it in 1986.
``The tales of redemption and human kind-H ness and serendipity and
grace are not there.''
</P>
<P>
   Vermont's social scientists were hardly alone in embracing
eugenics, the science of human breeding that branched off from
social Darwinism. All over the United States during the first two
decades of this century, progres- sives were on fire to prevent,
and not just manage, the misery of the poor. New science seemed to
sup- ply an answer: domestic abuse and alco- holism, long blamed on
bad social conditions, were thought to be caused by recessive genes
and in- breeding. By reducing the number of babies born to sick or
unwed parents, and by attracting desir- able settlers, social
scientists thought they could a build a healthier society.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Vermont was the 31st state to pass a law allowing for
sterilization of the handicapped or ``feebleminded.'' The number of
sterilizations that took place in Vermont was a tiny fraction of
the 60,000 that took place in states be- fore the laws were rolled
back in the 1960s and '70s, according to Diane Paul, a UMass-Boston
po- litical scientist and author of the book ``Controlling Human
Hered- ity: 1865 to the Present.''
</P>
<P>
   But in some ways, Gallagher argues, Vermonters were uniquely
ready to accept eugenic solutions. The state's population was dwin-
dling and the draft board was re- jecting an increasing number of
young men _ trends that dealt a blow to the closely-held Yankee
Protestant ideal. In 1930, 71 percent of the state's 350,000 peo-
ple were native Vermonters. This kind of population can be changed
more readily, encouraging eugeni- cists to ``improve the quality of
its native stock,'' as one put it. The global craze for bettering
society through selective breeding could be applied to local aims.
</P>
<P>
   It was in this atmosphere that the University of Vermont zoology
professor Henry Perkins threw himself into the project of tracing
what Gallagher calls ``pedigrees of degeneracy'' in a series of
Ver- mont families.
</P>
<P>
   Field workers selected particu- lar ``notorious'' families and
issued reports with titles like ``The Re- sults of the Matrimonial
Adven- tures of Four Degenerate Off- spring of the Fourth
Generation of the Doolittle Family.''
</P>
<P>
   The reports drew on inter- views with neighbors and local of-
ficials, and were sometimes sup-H plemented with estimates of the
families' cost to taxpayers, term-H ing one extended family
``Expen- sive Luxuries.'' One researcher re- ported that ``the
state of Vermont would have been better off had Richard, Simon,
John and Joseph of Generation III not been allowed to produce
children.''
</P>
<P>
   The work paid off for Perkins in 1931, when a sterilization bill
fi- nally passed, and between then and the early 1960s, the state
would fund and arrange steriliza- tions, often on young men and
women living in institutions for the ``feebleminded'' or handi-
capped, frequently as a condition of release.
</P>
<P>
   Although there is plenty of anecdotal evidence about steriliza-
tion policy, particularly among the Abenaki, there is no documenta-
tion of how widespread the phe- nomenon was, or how the option was
presented to its subjects. The only published summary of state
sterilization, from the 1940s, puts the number at 212, although
many suspect the real number is higher, Dann said.
</P>
<P>
   The eugenics movement radi- cally changed direction in the
1930s, as people recoiled from the Nazis' ``race hygeine.'' When
Per-H kins's student Elin Anderson pub- lished a 1937 study of
Burlington called ``We Americans,'' her work showed less nostalgia
for the ``old pioneer stock'' and assigned posi- tive value to
racial diversity. By 1940, Perkins himself realized that his early
ideas were unacceptable, and omitted from his abstracts any mention
of the years spent fol- lowing Vermont's ``degenerates.''
</P>
<P>
   And that whole project would have faded into obscurity except
for a pair of accidents: Perkins's proud record keeping and Dann's
chance discovery of 40 crates of surveys in the laundry room of a
state mental hospital in the mid- 1980s. He quickly realized that
the history was still painfully fresh.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can still go into high schools in Vermont and mention the
families that were studied and they'll say, `They're still the
trou- blemakers,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Abenaki _ who, his- torians have established, made up
a large contingent of the families Perkins studied _ the
sterilization law is hardly history at all. Rush-H low, the
31-year-old Abenaki act- ing chief, said that female rela- tives of
her father's generation were sterilized without their con- sent,
and that stories of the Per- kins research were not taught in
school but were ``passed down through the elders of the commu-
nity.''
</P>
<P>
   To her, Rushlow said, Perkins has always seemed ``just like Hit-
ler.''
</P>
<P>
   The recent spike of scholarly interest has drawn mixed re-
sponses, she said _ on the one hand, printing the history of Per-H
kins's project could ``finally let the public know what happened.''
But the historians' interest has also churned up painful episodes
that had been ``kind of buried.'' She told of a 53-year-old man who
real- ized five years ago, after reading a revisionist account of
the closing of the Brandon Home for the Fee- bleminded, that he had
probably been sterilized when he was 7.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Gallagher, who taught biology in Vermont schools for
years, is haunted by another pos- sibility: That at some point,
unk-H nowingly, she may have popular- ized scientific inquiry with
equally horrifying applications. Right now she's worried about the
human genome project. After reading through boxes of Perkins's
pedi- grees, she'll never be as trustful of science, or of herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It humbles you,'' she said. ``To their dying day they probably
thought they were doing the right thing.''

 &HT;    With outside help, beat goes on for heart patient
 &HT;    By Lillian Lee Kim
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The two halves of what amounts to Kenneth Collins's
temporary new heart rest atop his abdomen, making a steady
click-click, click-click as they perform the work his actual heart
no longer can do.
</P>
<P>
   A balloon in his Emory University Hospital room declares: ``When
God closes a door He opens a window.'' In Collins's case, the
window is a biventricular assist device, essentially two external
heart pumps, that for the last 11 days has kept the 57-year-old
Lawrenceville (Ga.) resident alive until he can receive a heart
transplant.
</P>
<P>
   Collins is the thought to be first person in Georgian to be
supported by a dual heart pump system since its 1995 approval by
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Emory only recently acquired
a Thoratec Ventricular Assist Device (VAD) through a $60,000 grant
provided by the Carlos and Marguerite Mason Trust, a private
Georgia foundation that supports organ transplantation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my heart,'' Collins says, putting his hand on the
machinery pulsating beneath his hospital gown. When he lifts the
gown, vistors can see blood pulsing in and out of each fist-sized
device. Crimson, the color of oxygen-rich blood, circulates through
the pump on his left side; dark brown, oxygen-depleted blood fills
the pump chamber on his right.
</P>
<P>
   Even though mechanical devices to assist the failed pumping
chambers of the heart have been around for nearly two decades, it
is still relatively rare for patients to receive two such devices
while awaiting transplant. Most can get by with a single device
that takes over the job of the heart's left ventricle, the main
pumping chamber that pushes oxygen-rich blood to the rest of the
body.
</P>
<P>
   Collins' heart was so heavily damaged, doctors determined, that
he needed a second device to support the heart's right ventricle,
which pushes blood returning from the body to the lungs so that it
can absorb oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   Inch-thick tubes carrying compressed air snake out from beneath
his gown and lead to a humming console that powers the pumps doing
the heart's work. The big machine is vaguely reminiscent of a hotel
ice machine, covered in dials and digital displays. The dials
twitch slightly with every mechanical heartbeat.
</P>
<P>
   A purple rubber octopus, bought by Collins's physical therapist
at a truck stop, dangles from the console's handle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just something to make me smile,'' Collins says. ``We're
talking about adding a Big Gulp cup, maybe a rear view mirror.''
</P>
<P>
   That he can not only smile but talk, laugh, eat and walk is
remarkable. Two weeks ago, Collins suffered a massive heart attack
and went without treatment for at least 36 hours. The resulting
damage from lack of oxygen to the heart muscle was so devastating
it left him with a barely functioning heart.
</P>
<P>
   For a day and a half he refused to believe he was having a heart
attack. He had never had heart trouble and his symptoms didn't fit
the classic description of chest pains; he thought he merely had
indigestion.
</P>
<P>
   His discomfort was severe enough to wake him in the middle of
the night, though, and failed to abate with Tums and aspirin. By
morning he still felt pressure in his back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should have gone at that time to the emergency room,''
Collins says. Instead, he tried to dismiss the sensation and washed
his wife Alice's car.
</P>
<P>
   Later that day at a party, he had to lie down. Other guests,
noticing how pale and drawn he looked, urged him to go to the
hospital, but Collins refused.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was pounding on his chest, saying `I can take care of this.
Besides, I got to go to work in the morning,''' Alice recalls.
</P>
<P>
   Collins did show up for work the following morning at Savin
Corporation's Norcross (Ga.) warehouse, where he prepares equipment
for delivery. But it wasn't long before he checked into Gwinnett
Medical Center in Lawrenceville.
</P>
<P>
   There, doctors affirmed what everyone but Collins had suspected.
Furthermore, they discovered his heart was operating at only 15
percent of normal function. The only option was a heart transplant.
A suitable donor heart wasn't available and without one he would
almost surely die.
</P>
<P>
   Just 10 days previously, doctors at Emory University had
completed training in Pittsburgh in the use of the Thoratec VAD.
Heart pump technology isn't new, but Emory purchased a Thoratec
only a few months ago, said Dr. J. David Vega, director of Emory's
heart lung transplant program.
</P>
<P>
   A tube inserted into the patient's atrium, or upper heart
chamber, draws blood into a sac constructed from a special
polyurethane material and encased in the external pump chamber. A
sensor detects when the sac is full of blood, and the blood is
pumped back through the patient's ventricle.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, a VAD can support a patient indefinitely; the record
is 515 days for a patient at a German hospital who eventually
received a transplant.
</P>
<P>
   Collins was so ill he didn't realize he had been transferred to
Emory until he awoke two days later.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw a dying man going into surgery,'' Alice says. ``When we
saw him afterward, we were all just standing there with our mouths
open and saying, `He looks so good! He looks so good!' ''
</P>
<P>
   Collins has since recovered sufficiently to move from intensive
care to a regular hospital room. He exercises daily, alternating
weight training with treadmill walks, all the while still tethered
to the console that powers the devices. Doctors hope he will be
able to build up his strength for the transplant they hope to
perform soon. Because Collins has virtually no heart function, he
has been moved up to the top of the heart transplant waiting list.
</P>
<P>
   The dual VAD means he'll actually be in better condition than
many transplant candidates. In 1997, 131 heart transplants were
performed in Georgia, according to the United Network for Organ
Sharing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patients that are supported by the devices do better with
transplants, because oftentimes you're able to rehabilitate the
patients before surgery,'' Vega says. ``With the devices, his heart
function is `normal.'''

open and saying, `He looks so good! He looks so good!' ''

   Collins has since recovered sufficiently to move from intensive
care to a regular hospital room. He exercises daily, alternating
weight training with treadmill walks, all the while still tethered
to the console that powers the devices. Doctors hope he will be
able to build up his strength for the transplant they hope to
perform soon. Because Collins has virtually no heart function, he
has been moved up to the top of the heart transplant waiting list.
</P>
<P>
   The dual VAD means he'll actually be in better condition than
many transplant candidates. In 1997, 131 heart transplants were
performed in Georgia, according to the United Network for Organ
Sharing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patients that are supported by the devices do better with
transplants, because oftentimes you're able to rehabilitate the
patients before surgery,'' Vega says. ``With the devices, his heart
function is `normal.'''

   WASHINGTON WATCH VOTE CHART Questions regarding this
transmission should be directed to 202-628-3100, ext. 224.
WASHINGTON, Aug. 6 -- The following chart shows how senators and
representatives voted on key bills and amendments within the last
week. A ``Y'' means the member voted for the measure; an ``N''
means the member voted against the measure; a ``?'' means the
member did not vote; and a ``P'' means the member voted
``present.''
</P>
<P>
   SENATE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: TAX1
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, July 30, the Senate passed, 57-43, a $792 billion
plan to provide broad-based tax relief and, among other things, end
the so-called marriage tax. Supporters said Americans deserve a
significant tax cut. Opponents said the bill was fiscally
irresponsible and would endanger the country's economic prosperity.
The final version of the bill was then passed Thursday by both the
House and the Senate. A ``yes'' vote favors the tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: FARM1
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Thursday rejected, 47-51, a proposal that would
release $10.8 million in emergency aid for American farmers.
Supporters said farmers all over the country are suffering from bad
weather and plummetting commodity prices. Opponents said this is
only a temporary crisis in the farm industry and they should not
risk long-term farm policy by releasing so much money. A ``yes''
vote favors the measure.
</P>
<P>
   3) BILL NUMBER: FARM2
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Wednesday passed, 89-8, a $7.4 million emergency
aid package for American farmers. Supporters said the agriculture
industry needs help during this severe drought. Opponents said
Congress should wait to see how this year's harvest turns out
before giving so much money to farmers. A ``yes'' vote favors the
aid package.
</P>
<P>
   4) BILL NUMBER: HOLBROOKE
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Thursday approved, 81-16, Richard Holbrooke's
nomination to become the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations,
filling a seat that has been vacant since last September.
Supporters said Holbrooke was highly qualified for the job.
Opponents blamed him for the Balkans policy, which they felt put
too many demands on the U.S. military. A ``yes'' vote favors
Holbrooke's nomination.
</P>
<P>
   5) BILL NUMBER: ARTS
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Thursday failed to pass an amendment that would
have eliminated federal funding for the National Endowment of the
Arts . Voting 80-16, the Senate tabled, or set aside, the amendment
to the Interior spending bill. Supporters of tabling the measure
said the arts was an important element of education. Opponents, led
by Sen. Robert Smith, I-N.H., said it was wasteful and
unconstitutional for the federal government to fund the arts. A
``yes'' vote supports tabling the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   6) BILL NUMBER: TAX2
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Thursday approved, 50-49, the final version of a
10-year, $792 billion tax cut. The bill would trim income tax rates
by one percent, gradually repeal the estate tax until it is
officially eliminated in 2009 and provide relief from the so-called
marriage tax. Supporters said it was a fair, responsible and
balanced bill that would give Americans much-needed tax relief.
Opponents, including some senators who voted in favor of the
original Senate bill, said it was politically motivated and
fiscally irresponsible. President Clinton said he will veto the
bill. A ``yes'' vote favors the tax cut.

<P>
   HOUSE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: FOREIGN
</P>
<P>
   The House on Tuesday passed, 385-35, a $12.6 billion foreign aid
bill that provides economic aid, military assistance, funding for
international agencies and money for export assistance. The bill
also denied funding for foreign organizations that perform
abortions and cuts funding for the Peace Corps and the Army's
School of the Americas. Supporters said the bill helps the United
States promote freedom around the world, although many said they
wished the bill directed more money toward that goal. Opponents,
including President Clinton, said the bill cuts funding for too
many important programs. A ``yes'' vote favors the bill.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: VIETNAM
</P>
<P>
   The House on Tuesday rejected, 130-297, an effort to overturn
President Clinton's recommendation to renew normal trade relations
with Vietnam for another year. Supporters of denying Vietnam's
trade status said the Vietnamese government should be held
accountable for the rampant corruption and mismanagement within
their communist rule. Opponents said the measure was an important
step toward normalizing trade with Vietnam, which is a boon for
both American business and the Vietnamese people. A ``yes'' vote
favors denying Vietnam's trade status.
</P>
<P>
   3) BILL NUMBER: HOUSE-TAX
</P>
<P>
   The House on Thursday passed, 221-206, the final version of a
10-year, $792 billion tax cut. The bill would trim income tax rates
by one percent, gradually repeal the estate tax until it is
officially eliminated in 2009 and provide relief from the so-called
marriage tax. Supporters said it was a fair, responsible and
balanced bill. Opponents said the bill was politically motivated
and fiscally irresponsible. President Clinton said he will veto the
bill. A ``yes'' vote favors the tax cut.

HANDWRITING MAY BE ON THE WALL FOR SIGNATURES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ John Hancock should have seen the writing on the
wall.
</P>
<P>
   In 1776, three weeks after Hancock drew his famous signature on
the Declaration of Independence, another signer fired off a
question: Why did delegates have to travel hundreds of miles to
scribble down their names?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we ought to have the privilege, when necessarily
absent, of voting and signing by proxy,'' complained Elbridge
Gerry, a Massachusetts delegate.
</P>
<P>
   It has taken more than two centuries. But this week, as a
congressional panel approved ``digital signatures'' _ acknowleging
that computer symbols have been nudging out inked names for years _
Gerry appeared finally to be winning the argument.
</P>
<P>
   And the so-called ``John Hancock,'' a worldwide symbol of
commitment and in some cases a treasured art form, appeared to be
going the way of the horse-drawn buggy.
</P>
<P>
   The signals are everywhere. Drivers charge for gasoline without
signing a receipt. Cashiers rarely compare signatures to the backs
of buyers' credit cards. Consumers live their lives online, buying
products and getting mortgages with nary a flourish of the pen.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with help from a bill drawn up in the House of
Representatives this week, businesses will most likely be able to
conduct all their transactions online within the next several
years. Many already do. But the legislation, which was sponsored by
Representative Anna Eshoo, a Democrat from Silicon Valley, would
mean that a series of encrypted numbers soon could replace the
personalized curlicue, having been given full legal status under
federal law.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which has widespread support in the business
community, was cleared without dissent by the House Commerce
Committee and is expected to pass the full House. Similar
legislation is pending in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   If the measure becomes law, everything from wills to bank loans
to book purchases from online booksellers could be ``signed''
online and considered legally solid in court.
</P>
<P>
   ``Handshakes and written signatures have bound people for a long
time,'' said Representative W.J. ``Billy'' Tauzin, chairman of the
House Telecommunications subcommittee and a Louisiana Republican.
``But you can't shake hands on the Internet. So what is the form of
agreement that is not only recognizable but also enforceable? The
digital handshake seems to be the way in which people can be bound
by an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suspect,'' Tauzin added with a laugh, ``if John Hancock were
around today and we were doing the Declaration of Independence on
the Internet, he'd use the whole Web site to sign it.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the name, digital signatures are, for the most part,
only marginally related to the physical act of signing one's name.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, there are times when a digital signature requires a
written signature. An example occurred when members of Congress
signed Y2K legislation in July and sent it to the President
Clinton. The lawmakers used ``pen ops,'' equipment similar to the
rubbery pads now used in some stores for credit card transactions.
The machines recieve a person's signature through a special pen,
then translate it into an encrypted digital code. That code is then
forwarded by computer to the recipient.
</P>
<P>
   What will be far more common, however, is just a simple
mathematical algorithm. Using a combination of the number zero and
the number one, a personalized code _ or signature _ is created. It
can be any number of digits and functions ``just like an electronic
seal,'' according to Barbara Boczek, director of marketing for
CyberTrust, a GTE company based in Needham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   It is not completely clear how this will work in practice for
the consumer, but the possible ways of sending a digital signature
include punching in numbers on a keyboard or having the data preset
in an account's software.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whereas in the physical world a signature looks a certain way
and might be creative, in the electronic world, it's just a bunch
of 1s and 0s,'' Boczek said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could potentially give out tens of millions of digital
signatures,'' said Ed Dixon, a spokesman for MasterCard
International. ``But face-to-face, physical transactions will still
be a part of credit card transactions. I do think your actual
signature will be important.''
</P>
<P>
   But already, it is not the signature that carries weight in
court in credit card disputes. It is the digital evidence _ the
time of the transaction, for example, and whether it was approved _
several industry experts said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the computer has led to the decline of
handwriting of all sorts, and signatures were bound to follow, said
Heidi Harrelson, president of the American Handwriting Analysis
Foundation. Already, she said, ``as computers are used more and
more, we see handwriting and signatures less and less, and that's a
bit of a controversy'' among the foundation's members.
</P>
<P>
   Of greater concern, particularly to forensic handwriting
analysts and consumer watchdog groups, is security. Handwriting is
specific to the individual, not subject to attack from computer
hackers. It cannot be spirited away to a national data base to
track people's movements, as some analysts fear could happen with a
digital signature. Forensic handwriting analyst Linda L. Collins
said that, with an exclusively digital system, ``you are opening
the door for even more fraud to take place.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our signature is our stamp of approval, and if somebody else
uses it, there are ways to prove it,'' Collins said. ``It has
always authenticated everything. And even other than the fact that
it opens the door to fraud, it's a loss because it once represented
us and authenticated us. It's just another way of saying who we
are.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the business world is planning to take digital
signatures a step further. Instead of just attaching them to
documents, companies are hoping the entire nature of commerce will
be revolutionized by a system now used primarily by the Pentagon: a
two-tiered system of encrypted signatures, or ``keys.''
</P>
<P>
   The system would allow two parties _ whether they know each
other or not _ to be assured that each is who it claims to be. It
also would prevent unwanted entities from being able to decode
documents sent over the Internet, industry analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are going to be huge advantages to the consumer,'' said
Lamar Smith, senior vice president for government relations at Visa
USA. ``I think the general feeling is that there is a huge
potential for stimulating growth through electronic commerce
channels. And what Congress and the (Clinton) administration are
trying to do is remove the barriers to letting that flower bloom.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With passage of a $792-billion tax cut secured,
Congress left for its August recess early Friday and set the stage
for a high-stakes autumn confrontation with President Clinton over
the nation's fiscal priorities in the new era of federal surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   The battle over how to divide the expected $3-trillion windfall
among tax cuts, federal programs and debt reduction through the
next decade is the most far reaching of many ideologically charged
policy disputes expected to come to a head in the fall. Others
include debates over gun control, regulation of managed care and an
overhaul of the campaign finance laws.
</P>
<P>
   On one of those issues, managed health care, House Speaker
Dennis Hastert on Friday tried to divide a group of Republican
dissidents by pledging to bring to the House floor a bill that will
include some expansion of the right to sue. His decision marked the
first time Republican leaders have put forward such a provision,
and it created a rival bill to one agreed to Thursday by Republican
rebels and House Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, with the razor-thin margin in the House
heightening the partisan competition, the two parties in Congress
have put less focus on legislating than on sharpening their
differences for the 2000 campaign. And Republicans believe their
tax cut will help define their identity next year.
</P>
<P>
   It is far from clear whether the president and Congress will be
able to reach some grand compromise on tax cuts, spending, Medicare
and perhaps health care legislation after Clinton makes good on his
promise to veto the Republican tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   In August both parties expect to wage a battle for public
opinion. Republicans said they would hold town meetings across the
nation to showcase different aspects of their tax cut, which would
be largest since 1981, and contains elements designed to appeal to
an array of constituency groups from social conservatives to women
to business.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats planned their own appearances to highlight their call
for some of the surplus to be used to overhaul the Medicare system,
the federal health insurance program for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton sounded the Democratic rallying cry Friday, by once
again vowing to veto the Republicans' tax cut.``I am disappointed,
though not surprised, that the majority party in Congress has
chosen to pass its massive tax cut, one that plainly would damage
our economic future,'' Clinton said at the White House before
leaving for Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to ensure the American people, because this tax cut
will not save and strengthen Medicare, because it will not add a
day to the Social Security trust fund, because it will not pay down
the debt and pay if off for the first time in 150 years, this tax
cut will not become law,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans, who see the tax cut as the crown jewel of their
legislative program, predicted that their bill would resonate with
the American people and that public opinion would force Clinton to
embrace it.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott said that if Clinton vetoes
the bill, ``it will be the strongest indication so far that he is
entering the phase of being a lame duck, because it will say to the
Congress, the American people, `I don't care what you say or do,
I'm going to veto this and I'm not going to work with you.'''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has proposed a far smaller tax cut of $250 billion, and
prefers to use some of the surplus to expand Medicare and increase
spending on such domestic programs.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the escalating rhetoric, some Republicans believe that
Clinton, with less than 18 months remaining in his presidency, will
want to burnish his record. That yearning, they say, will lead him
to strike a grand bargain with Congress, where Republicans will get
large tax cuts in exchange for the new Medicare prescription drug
program that he has proposed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got one more year,'' said Rep. Joe Scarborough, R-Fla.,
``He's run his last campaign. He would like to have a good tax cut
and some good reforms. I don't know how to say it without sounding
cliche. He's playing for history.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats counter that Clinton considers the healthy economy his
proudest accomplishment and that he will not strike a compromise
that does not begin to pay down the debt. ``They are misreading
what is motivating the president,'' said House Minority Leader Dick
Gephardt of the Republicans. ``What motivates him is that he has
achieved a very good economy and he has made some real strides on
crime and education. And he doesn't want to make a deal that would
compromise or jeopardize those accomplishments.''
</P>
<P>
   There is another factor this year that provides an incentive for
stalemate. During the days of deficits, an inability to act meant
the deficits grew. But this year if the parties cannot agree on a
tax cut, the surpluses automatically go toward paying down the
nation's $5.6 billion accumulated debt. So both sides say it might
not be so bad if they reach no agreement and take their competing
visions into the election.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a sense that we've done something if we've done
nothing,'' said Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond fiscal issues, the fate of other high profile legislation
is also unclear. Many of the topics on the fall agenda _ campaign
finance overhaul, managed care regulation and gun control _ are
favorite issues of the Democrats. Republicans view these
confrontations as ones they cannot win, but will try to dispense
with them with minimal damage.
</P>
<P>
   So they will hope to do as little as possible while Democrats
will be leery of accepting weak compromises.
</P>
<P>
   A signal of the intensity of the struggle came Friday when
Hastert and other Republican leaders agreed just before 2 a.m. to
allow a managed care proposal, which is being assembled by Reps.
Tom Coburn, R-Okla., and John Shadegg, R-Ariz., to move forward in
the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Their decision was prompted by Thursday's announcement by
dissident Republicans that they had reached agreement with House
Democrats on comprehensive legislation. They predicted they would
rally a majority of the House around their bill.
</P>
<P>
   Coburn, a family physician, and Shadegg were still drafting
their rival measure, which was expected to be similar to the the
bipartisan plan. But Coburn has said that he wants to keep the
right to sue provisions more limited than in the bipartisan
measure. He would require patients to prove they were injured
before they could sue.
</P>
<P>
   The existence of the second bill created an even fiercer fight
for perhaps 20 to 30 Republicans who could decide what kind of
managed care bill passes the House. But Democrats were expected to
oppose this version because it would contain a variety of tax
credits meant to help the uninsured get coverage. That would likely
include tax free medical savings accounts, which Democrats oppose,
saying such accounts would draw the healthiest and wealthiest out
of the insurance pool.

FRAUD SUSPECT HOPED EXPANDING HIS EMPIRE WOULD PROTECT HIM FROM
AUTHORITIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOSEPH KAHN and KATHERINE E. FINKELSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   For nearly seven years, say the authorities, Martin Frankel
quietly ran one of the biggest insurance scams in history, milking
the assets of Southern insurance companies he controlled to pay for
a self-indulgent life style in a Greenwich, Conn., mansion,
complete with a virtual harem of female assistants, corporate jets
and private chefs.
</P>
<P>
   Then, early last year, the reclusive financier went on a global
quest to turn his hundreds of millions into tens of billions. In an
outpouring of ambition, Frankel drew scores of new people into his
dealings, including some legendary characters in the world of
financial fraud, to help him expand his empire.
</P>
<P>
   He boasted to acquaintances that he was exploiting huge, new
business opportunities but confided to intimates that the bold
plans had a more essential purpose: keeping him out of jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I become big, they won't touch me,'' Oksana Boudanaval, a
20-year-old Russian woman who lived with Frankel in Greenwich,
recalls Frankel telling her as they relaxed in his office one
evening last summer. ``If you have 10 computers and take 5, anyone
can notice,'' she remembers him saying. ``If you have 100 and take
10, no one can tell.''
</P>
<P>
   It is now clear that Frankel's helter-skelter attempt to expand
his empire into a pyramid of interlocking companies and charities
had the opposite effect, kindling regulators' suspicions and
accelerating his demise.
</P>
<P>
   In the three months since he fled overseas with as much as $350
million in insurance company money, the outlines of Frankel's story
_ a financial fraud that lasted for almost a decade, hastily forged
ties to the Vatican, a rush to convert illicit profits into
precious gems to finance life on the lam _ have come into focus.
But as investigators and Federal prosecutors question witnesses and
obtain records, they find themselves examining the roles of a much
larger cast of characters than initially known _ most of whom
appeared on the scene in the final, chaotic months.
</P>
<P>
   For example, associates say that in the last year of his scheme,
Frankel came to rely on Thomas Quinn, a long-time stock-fraud
veteran whose criminal record dates to Frankel's childhood.
</P>
<P>
   Federal investigators are also examining how Antonio Greco, a
self-styled detective who has trod the line between law enforcement
and the criminal underworld, may have played a role in Frankel's
dealings in recent months. Long before having become involved with
Frankel, Greco had served time in several countries including
Spain, where he was charged with having ties to international drug
smugglers.
</P>
<P>
   As he struggled to stave off discovery, Frankel sought allies in
Italy, chased insurance assets as far away as Nicaragua and
England, and spent lavishly to woo so many consultants,
deal-makers, bankers, lawyers, accountants, and public-relations
experts that some people who have studied his operation think he
may have had an elaborate plan to confuse people.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, however, this obsession with growth did him more
harm than good. His painstakingly negotiated link to the Vatican
worried state insurance regulators instead of appeasing them. The
offshore shell companies he set up made his money look dirty, not
clean. And, in his final weeks in the United States, Frankel
complained to Ms. Boudanaval and another of his lovers that some of
his newly recruited business partners had turned against him.
</P>
<P>
   Though Frankel did almost everything on a scale that dwarfs
other insurance frauds, a final binge before being busted is not
unusual. ``It usually happens when they begin to feel a little bit
of pressure _ they start getting grandiose ideas about expanding to
recoup the money they owe,'' said Stuart Allen, a former criminal
investigator for the Securities and Exchange Commission who now
works as a private detective. ``But the bigger it gets, the more
certain it is the bubble will burst.''
</P>
<P>
   To some investigators, the surprising thing is that Frankel's
ventures remained intact for so long. A failed fund manager from
Toledo, Ohio, Frankel was banned for life from stock trading by the
SEC after elderly investors complained that he absconded with their
money. Even as the SEC was concluding that case, he began, in late
1991, to amass a string of small, failing concerns in the South
that specialized in providing burial insurance to people of little
means.
</P>
<P>
   At first, he ran his companies on a shoestring. He had one man,
John Hackney, in charge of the companies' operations, based in
Franklin, Tenn. Frankel claimed to be investing the assets of those
companies. Investigators now suspect he was siphoning off millions
to support an increasingly lavish life in Greenwich.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance regulators in the states where he did business never
fully caught on. But in early 1998, Tennessee officials began
asking some pointed questions about his investing style and
procedures.
</P>
<P>
   That's when he decided to get big. Frankel emerged from
seclusion and began working with people he thought could help him
grow quickly. The most important contact Frankel made was Thomas
Corbally, a 78-year-old business consultant who often recruited
clients for Kroll &AMP; Co., a leading private investigation agency,
and has a network of friends on both sides of the law.
</P>
<P>
   The two met around Memorial Day 1998 and became fast friends.
Soon after, Corbally began boasting to potential business partners
of his ties to a ``multi-, multibillionaire'' whose trading prowess
was the envy of Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   While living off Frankel's largesse _ his American Express card
bills were paid by Frankel _ Corbally made introductions that
broadened Frankel's universe to include prominent figures in law
and religion, including senior officials at the Vatican.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Associates of Frankel assert that Corbally also put him in touch
with several people whose names have surfaced in previous financial
scandals.
</P>
<P>
   Among them was Quinn, one of the securities industry's
best-known swindlers. Quinn, a disbarred lawyer who rented a home
two blocks from Frankel in the back country of Greenwich until his
lease expired in June, has multiple convictions in securities and
money-laundering cases dating to the 1960s. He has served prison
time in the United States and Europe. He is considered one of the
world's leading experts in running ``boiler rooms,'' or operations
that peddle worthless stocks to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Another was Larry Martin, who friends say is a private
entrepreneur. Martin, who owns a home in Pound Ridge, N.Y., is
registered with the government as a patent lawyer. He has invested
in several well-known real estate projects, according to several
friends who said his business dealings were above board.
</P>
<P>
   Martin has at least indirect links to securities deals that have
come under scrutiny. In the mid-1990s, Martin served as an
intermediary when Osicom Technologies of California purchased a
controlling stake in Builders Warehouse, a failed home-products
retailer in Arkansas, said two people involved in that deal and a
federal investigator.
</P>
<P>
   That transaction was among several that prompted investigations
by the SEC and involved class-action lawsuits by shareholders of
Builders Warehouse who claimed that they were defrauded. Martin has
not been accused of wrongdoing in any of those transactions.
</P>
<P>
   A third recruit was Greco. He is best known for his role in
circulating false and derogatory information about international
banker Edmond Safra in the early 1990s. A former federal
investigator said Greco has extensive underworld contacts in both
Europe and Latin America, where Frankel's operation was seeking to
expand.
</P>
<P>
   Greco and Quinn could not be reached for comment. Martin and his
lawyer declined to return repeated phone calls seeking comment. In
an interview in June, Corbally acknowledged providing help to
Frankel but said he had been duped.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Corbally, who is now living in a London hotel, nor his
lawyer returned recent phone calls seeking comment on whether he
had a role in introducing Frankel to anyone involved previously in
questionable dealings.
</P>
<P>
   By the fall of 1998, Quinn, Martin and Corbally had set up a new
company called American Life Acquisition, of which Martin served as
general manager and Messrs. Quinn and Corbally appeared to act as
advisers.
</P>
<P>
   That company's precise ties to Frankel remain unclear. As they
prospected for business, the company's executives referred from
time to time to their relationship to a trading guru who could coax
sky-high returns from ordinary securities, an apparent reference to
Frankel.
</P>
<P>
   Martin recruited two investment bankers, three retired insurance
industry executives, a marketing expert and a chief administrator
to help run the company. Whether dining together at Harry
Cipriani's in midtown Manhattan or flying on Frankel's corporate
jet for business appointments (and sometimes to visit family),
Martin, Quinn and Corbally had all the trappings of an elite
deal-making team.
</P>
<P>
   They made pitches to as many as a dozen insurance companies in
Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Illinois and Virginia. But, as
far as anyone involved knows, they never completed any deals. The
stumbling block: American Life claimed to have at least $150
million to buy insurance companies, but insisted that it could
never reveal where it came from.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had the impression he was bouncing from state to state,
trying to find out if anyone would allow him to buy insurance
companies under a confidentiality scheme,'' said Craig Gardner,
deputy commission of insurance in Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   Gardner had a meeting with Martin in November 1998, in which the
two discussed the purchase of United Life &AMP; Annuity Insurance Co.,
a Louisiana-based insurer with $1.4 billion in assets _ a purchase
that would have been larger by far than any Frankel had made.
</P>
<P>
   When Martin told him that he was raising $150 million from
anonymous European investors that would be channeled through a
holding company in the British Virgin Islands, a place prized for
its banking secrecy laws, Gardner said he stopped paying attention.
``I had better things to do,'' he said. ``You just aren't going to
get a deal done under those terms.''
</P>
<P>
   Possibly in search of more pliant authorities, the team made at
least two trips to Managua, Nicaragua. There, according to several
participants, they negotiated with government officials for the
purchase of INISER, the Institute of Insurance and Reinsurance, a
state-owned insurance company the government was considering
selling off. There's no evidence a deal was concluded. Nicaraguan
officials could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   After striking out in the Americas, Corbally introduced Frankel
to British businessmen who claimed they could help Frankel buy
European insurers. After a get-acquainted session in Greenwich,
Frankel gave them some money to get started, two people familiar
with his dealings said. But he grew increasingly frustrated at his
inability to find people who would deliver more insurance companies
to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had all these people scrambling around without a sense of
direction,'' said a consultant who worked for American Life for six
months. ``It was so desperate.''
</P>
<P>
   Pressures only increased earlier this year. Tennessee officials
demanded that the insurance companies Frankel ran put their assets
in a local bank, a ruling that required Frankel to cough up $60
million of the money he managed.
</P>
<P>
   Mississippi regulators at the same time were worried about all
the offshore funding that Corbally, Martin and Quinn were nominally
arranging; talk of ties to the Vatican and to British Virgin
Islands trusts only increased the intensity of their questions. (It
was demands from Mississippi regulators, at the end of April, that
finally prompted Frankel to flee).
</P>
<P>
   Complicating matters, Martin announced in March that he would no
longer have anything to do with Frankel. He told those he had
recruited to American Life that he had his own doubts about the
sources of money the group claimed it had.
</P>
<P>
   At the Greenwich mansion, Frankel began speaking darkly of
``betrayal'' and ``blackmail'' to Ms. Boudanaval and others who
lived with him. Frankel, who has feared for his own security for at
least a decade and ordered cyberlocks and other high-tech security
systems for his home, tended to blame others for his misfortunes,
people who know him said. In his mind, the slights piled up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Business that was supposed to be done wasn't done,'' said Ms.
Boudanaval, speaking of Martin. ``Larry kept telling Marty, `Yeah,
no problem.' But it wasn't done. Marty said he would like to break
his bones.''
</P>
<P>
   Frankel was also angry at Fausto Fausti, a retired Italian
aviation official-turned-business consultant. Fausti, who was
introduced to Frankel by Corbally, had helped Frankel make contact
with Catholic charities in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   But visiting the Frankel home earlier this year, Fausti brought
along a delegation of Italian businessmen who said they wanted to
start a new microchip manufacturing company. They asked Frankel for
$20 million He rejected them and later complained that the request
amounted to blackmail.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of April, it was clear Frankel planned to give up the
fight and flee. Corbally was around the house constantly,
consulting privately with Frankel, people in the home at the time
said.
</P>
<P>
   Documents were being shredded. Frankel had ordered $10 million
in diamonds to take with him and an early shipment _ described by
one person as amounting to $3 million and another as totaling $2
million _ was scattered around his bedroom. Frankel handed out
3-karat diamonds to some staff members. Sitting on his bed, he
openly debated which of his staff he would take with him to Italy.
</P>
<P>
   On May 5, he boarded a private jet for an airport outside Rome.
Three months later, authorities are still trying to find him.

NASA INVESTIGATING AIR QUALITY PROBLEMS ABOARD INTERNATIONAL SPACE
STATION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Tenn., Texas, Russia, Canada) (dw) 
 By WARREN E. LEARY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On the last mission to the new International Space
Station, several astronauts suffered nausea, headaches and other
symptoms that have NASA scrambling for solutions to a suspected
air-quality problem before another crew visits the growing outpost.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the crew of the shuttle Discovery did not report the
difficulties until debriefings two weeks after their landing, a
delay that NASA authorities acknowledge has hampered the search for
possible solutions and caused a review of crew procedures.
</P>
<P>
   The seven-person crew returned from the 10-day supply mission on
June 6.
</P>
<P>
   NASA officials say they believe unexpected buildups of carbon
dioxide, fumes from chemicals used in some components and
restricted air circulation may have been the sources of the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Culbertson, NASA's space station operations manager at the
Johnson Space Center in Houston, said the problems were not serious
but the agency was taking steps to see that they did not recur on
future missions.
</P>
<P>
   NASA did not disclose the health concerns when it became aware
of them, but appointed what it calls a ``tiger team'' of agency
experts to assess the problem quickly and make recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   The agency would not release a preliminary report by the team,
citing the crew's medical privacy. However, NASA Watch, a private
Internet site that follows space issues, posted a copy of a summary
report by the group.
</P>
<P>
   Without naming the specific crew members involved, the report
said ``several'' of them experienced symptoms including headaches,
burning and itching eyes, facial flush, nausea and one incidence of
vomiting while working in the station. Symptoms improved when crew
members retreated to the shuttle or used personal ventilator fans
while working aboard the station.
</P>
<P>
   Astronauts, as planned, took air samples as they entered the
station and before closing hatches to leave after six days.
However, mission managers said, if they had been aware of potential
air-quality problems, they would have asked for additional samples.
</P>
<P>
   ``The crew did all the right things and there were no serious
effects,'' Culbertson said. ``Everybody got rid of the symptoms
they had very quickly and there were no major problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Culbertson acknowledged that lack of timely reporting of
problems by the crew made it more difficult to diagnose and fix
them. But he said it was the prerogative of each commander and crew
to report problems to mission control as they occurred, depending
upon how they judged the severity of the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The crew felt they understood the problem and handled it
appropriately,'' Culbertson said. ``Every commander is different.
Some are more talkative with the ground than others and we are used
to that. This isn't an issue.''
</P>
<P>
   However, he said, NASA managers reviewed agency procedures after
the flight and have told crews to take more air samples and inform
ground control if such problems surface again on flights.
</P>
<P>
   Discovery's mission was led by Cmdr. Kent V. Rominger of the
Navy, and Lt. Col. Rick D. Husband of the Air Force was the pilot.
The other members of the international crew were NASA astronauts
Daniel T. Barry, Tamara E. Jernigan and Ellen Ochoa; Julie Payette
of Canada, and Col. Valery I. Tokarev of the Russian Air Force.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Robertson, director of Vanderbilt University's Center
for Space Physiology and Medicine, said that air quality in
spacecraft is important and something that can easily be addressed.
``This doesn't look like something that will be a long-term
problem,'' he said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson said timely reporting of health problems in space ``is
very desirable and very important'' and that astronauts sometimes
have to be reminded of this.
</P>
<P>
   ``Astronauts need to keep mission control fully informed of
health events and I think they are doing that pretty well now,'' he
said, ``This was not the case 20 or 30 years ago when some people
tried to suppress problems because they had a test-pilot mentality
and didn't want to disclose something that might be considered a
weakness.''
</P>
<P>
   The International Space Station, which eventually is to grow
into a $60 billion complex covering an area the size of a football
field, now consists of two of an expected score of modules and
major components.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian-made Zarya work module is attached to the American
Unity connecting hub, forming a unit 77 feet tall and weighing
70,000 pounds. The Discovery flight delivered more than 4,300
pounds of equipment and water for future crews, and allowed
astronauts to repair equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The third component is the Russian Zvezda service module, which
is to provide living quarters and laboratory space during the early
stages of station construction. This module is to be launched in
November, followed by a U.S. shuttle mission in December to perform
more station outfitting.
</P>
<P>
   Zvezda contains filters and other air circulation and cleaning
equipment that should eliminate unwanted buildups of carbon dioxide
and fumes in the station, NASA officials said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The NASA experts investigating the Discovery incident said most
symptoms were reported by crew members working in the Zarya unit
when two or more worked closely for long periods and wall panels to
components were open, possibly blocking the circulation of fresh
air from the shuttle.
</P>
<P>
   Under conditions of weightlessness when there is no normal air
convection to help carry away gases, experts said, carbon dioxide
breathed out by the astronauts and fumes from solvents and other
construction materials could have built up to unhealthy levels.
</P>
<P>
   For the next shuttle mission to the station, NASA's assessment
team suggested, the crew should carry personal air monitors and do
more sampling. In addition, it said, NASA should re-evaluate the
station's air circulation system design, consider the possibility
of sending up temporary duct work with the shuttle to force more
fresh air through the station, look into installing an extra carbon
dioxide scrubber or filter in the complex and look at the potential
of flushing old air out of station modules as they are activated.
</P>
<P>
   The team noted that there was a potential longer-term impact to
the air-quality question. When the first permanent crew of three
astronauts arrives in a Russian Soyuz space capsule next year, it
said, there will be no American shuttle attached to act as a safe
haven in case something goes wrong with the air supply.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Wall Street scandals come and go. But the lurid
details in the order that the Bear Stearns Securities Corp. signed
on Thursday to settle Securities and Exchange Commission charges
have staying power.
</P>
<P>
   According to regulators, the fraud that the Bear Stearns unit
helped perpetrate as it processed securities trades for A.R. Baron,
a brokerage in New York that bilked investors of $75 million, is a
tale of personal and corporate greed relentlessly pursued at the
expense of unsuspecting investors.
</P>
<P>
   The firm will pay $38.5 million to settle the charges without
admitting or denying the allegations..
</P>
<P>
   Regulators said the firm ignored hard evidence that Baron
repeatedly defrauded investors: forged trade confirmation slips, a
letter from two Baron brokers admitting unauthorized trades, a
blizzard of customer complaints. Instead, the SEC charged, Richard
Harriton, president of the unit, kept the fraud going by using
funds and securities belonging to Baron's customers to pay for
trades in their accounts that he knew to be unauthorized.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC brought securities fraud charges on Thursday against
Harriton, who resigned from the firm but is fighting the charges.
He is being investigated by the Manhattan district attorney.
</P>
<P>
   As prosecutors and regulators investigated the role of Bear
Stearns in the Baron fraud, many clearing firms feared that one
outcome would be new rules.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC tweaked clearing rules earlier this year. But Richard H.
Walker, the agency's director of enforcement, made clear that the
Bear Stearns case was not about the need for higher clearing
standards, but about a firm that did nothing to stop a fraud and
plenty to perpetuate it.
</P>
<P>
   The case raises many questions about how Bear Stearns is run.
One really nags.
</P>
<P>
   Why was Harriton, the man who brought Baron in as a clearing
customer even as the firm sank deeper into financial and regulatory
distress, defended by Bear Stearns management until the day he was
sued?
</P>
<P>
   Most public firms would have moved quickly to examine the
operations of a department under scrutiny by regulators, if only to
try to maintain shareholders' trust. Judging by the SEC's order, a
glance at the operation would have raised numerous flags.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it is no surprise that Bear Stearns shares have
underperformed the returns of the American Stock Exchange
Broker/Dealer Index recently.
</P>
<P>
   Harriton was not only kept on at the firm, but paid very well
and named to its powerful compensation committee. James E. Cayne,
the president of the firm, said he was sorry to see Harriton go.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lessons from the Top,'' a forthcoming book about corporate
leadership by Thomas J. Neff and James M. Citrin, includes an
interview with Alan C. Greenberg, the Bear Stearns chairman. In the
book, Greenberg says his proudest accomplishment is that Bear
Stearns has never been hit with an ethical scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why, he is quoted as saying: ``Mark Twain said, `Fish
stink from the head,' right? It's people up top who set an example
of how a business should be run.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed.

INVESTING WITH RAND L. ALEXANDER: HARTFORD STOCK FUND 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mass.)   (ART ADV: Graphic of Hartford stock fund is being sent to NYT
graphic clients. Non-subscribers can make individual purchase by
calling (888) 603-1036 or (888) 346-9867.)  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 8)  
 (af)  
 By CAROLE GOULD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many money managers focus on their stocks and ignore the
economy, but Rand L. Alexander is a big-picture guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look at macroeconomic data to see what sectors and
industries in the U.S. will grow fastest over the next 12 to 18
months, given our economic outlook,'' said Alexander, manager of
the $1.02 billion Hartford Stock fund and a partner in the
Wellington Management Co., a money manager in Boston that is also
subadviser for other funds, like Vanguard Wellington and Vanguard
Windsor.
</P>
<P>
   What does he see in the data? ``We think the economic backdrop
looks pretty doggone good,'' he said from his office overlooking
Boston Harbor. He expects the gross domestic product to grow more
than 4 percent this year, with inflation staying comfortably below
2 percent and operating profits for companies in the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index rising 10 percent to 12 percent. As a result,
Hartford Stock owns more cyclical stocks than it did nine months
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander's top-down approach has paid off. The fund returned
28.4 percent, annualized, for the three years ended Aug. 5,
according to Morningstar Inc., the Chicago financial publisher.
That compares with 23.1 percent for its peer group of large blend
funds and 27.7 percent for the S&AMP;P 500.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander, 48, works with Wellington's 31 analysts to find
quality stocks in their favored sectors among the 300 to 400
American companies with market capitalizations exceeding $6
billion. Those sectors currently include energy, cyclical
technology businesses (like semiconductor companies) and basic
materials (like forest products and chemicals).
</P>
<P>
   He looks for companies with strong brands; the fund's biggest
holdings include household names like General Electric, Exxon and
Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   He also looks for high return on equity, but frowns on leveraged
balance sheets. The return on equity for the S&AMP;P 500 averages 20
percent, he said, while many of the fund's companies exceed 30
percent or 40 percent. ``Our companies typically have better
financials and stronger balance sheets than the market,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And he often chooses companies that should fit certain themes
for the next three to five years. That, he says, helps stop the
fund from ``getting whipsawed, by fashions in the equity market or
if we're wrong on the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   The themes are these:
</P>
<P>
   _ (italics)Global growth.(end italics) The ability to expand
overseas is important, he said, for big companies like McDonald's
and Wal-Mart Stores, two of his biggest holdings.
</P>
<P>
   _ (italics)Balding baby boomers.(end italics) He says the aging
boomers have bigger needs for financial services and health care,
so the fund invests in companies like Franklin Resources, the
mutual fund concern, and the drug makers Warner-Lambert and
American Home Products.
</P>
<P>
   _ (italics)Networking the nation.(end italics) This category,
recognizing the proliferation of technology in everyday life, leads
the fund to buy companies like Intel and SBC Communications.
</P>
<P>
   _ (italics)Survival of the fittest.(end italics) The newest
category, it accounts for companies formed through big mergers,
like Citigroup or MCI Worldcom. ``We want to own the surviving
entity, which will benefit from the synergies of being bigger,'' he
said. ``It's easier to manage big companies now than it was five
years ago, because of improvements in technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexander uses a variety of valuation measures, depending on the
industry, to choose the 75 to 85 stocks in the fund. For technology
companies, for example, he uses earnings growth rates; for oil
stocks, the ratio of price to cash flow.
</P>
<P>
   Each week, he screens his list of big stocks for those with
price moves of 5 percent to 10 percent _ a clue to dig a little
deeper. Over all, though, the fund tends to hold on to its stocks.
Its turnover rate is just 37 percent, less than half the average
for stock funds tracked by Morningstar.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander added to his five-year-old position in the State
Street Corp., the Boston money manager and one of the leading
global custodians for the mutual fund industry, when its stock
price fell to the mid-$70s in early July, from the mid-$80s.
</P>
<P>
   Besides fitting into his ``balding baby boomer'' theme, he said,
State Street should benefit from the growing demand for equities
worldwide. He estimates annual earnings growth of 15 percent over
the next three years and expects the share price to reach $100 by
the end of 2000. State Street closed on Friday at $67.25.
</P>
<P>
   In May, he bought shares of Micron Technologies, the
semiconductor maker, at prices from the mid- to high $30s. The
price had fallen from about $80 in February because of excess
industry capacity, Alexander said. But Wellington analysts saw
Micron as the lowest-cost producer with the best balance sheet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a cyclical play on semiconductor prices,'' he said. He
expects the company to become profitable by year-end and to be
earning $5 to $10 a share annually within three years. It closed on
Friday at $65.875; his 12- to 18-month price target is $80 to $100.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander recently added to his position in Alcoa, the aluminum
producer, which he started buying last fall at $36. ``We think it's
the best-managed aluminum company in the world,'' he said.
``They've done all the right things to rein in costs, and as
aluminum prices rise, all that will fall to the bottom line.''
</P>
<P>
   He expects earnings to jump to $3.75 a share in 2000. The stock
closed on Friday at $62.625; his 18-month price target is $80.

ALL EYES ON JARRETT AS NASCAR PREPARES FOR BRICKYARD RACE 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By TARIK EL-BASHIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Dale Jarrett is speeding down the front
straightaway of the Nascar Winston Cup season. He holds a 254-point
lead over Mark Martin and a 283-point lead over Bobby Labonte
entering Saturday's Brickyard 400, and only a major collapse _ or a
serious run of bad luck _ over the final 15 races of the season
could keep Jarrett from winning his first Winston Cup championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know if we do our job right, we're in pretty good
position,'' said Jarrett, driver of the Ford Quality Care Taurus.
``When you're the second-place guy, like we've been a lot in the
past, you always have to count on someone having a problem. Now,
we're in a reverse role. We are in control.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Gordon, the defending Winston Cup champion, said, ``I don't
see anyone touching Jarrett as long as he keeps doing what he's
doing.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jarrett's team is not looking too far ahead. It has plenty
of challenges, starting with Saturday's race at the Indianapolis
Motor Speedway. Jarrett, whose Taurus was fastest among the Fords
during testing here last month, qualified fourth Friday behind
Gordon, a two-time Brickyard champion, Martin and David Green.
Jarrett figures to spend much of the early stages of the race
trying to get around them.
</P>
<P>
   The purse for this year's Brickyard 400 is $6.1 million,
Nascar's second highest after the Daytona 500's $7.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett, who won the Brickyard 400 in 1996, always has a strong
car here, but it may not be the strongest this year. That
designation belongs to Gordon, who won the inaugural race in 1994
and won again last year. Gordon, who trails Jarrett by an almost
insurmountable 492 points in the Winston Cup standing, is trying to
win his fifth race of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a good starting spot in the same race car we had
here last year,'' said Jarrett, who has three victories, four
second-place finishes and two thirds this season. ``We seem to have
a pretty good package, and it seems to be a really good car. I
think we have a good chance to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will just be a matter of us doing our job all day long,
staying out of trouble and getting ourselves in a position in the
later stages of the race to win. And obviously, pit strategy will
come into play.''
</P>
<P>
   It was pit strategy that took Jarrett out of the race last year.
He ran out of gas while leading near the halfway point, the victim
of a terrible miscalculation in fuel mileage that cost him an
apparent victory and a prize exceeding $1.6 million. It was tough
to swallow at the time, but Jarrett laughed about it Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``After what happened last year, I thought we had that problem
figured out,'' he said. ``But we ran out of gas earlier this year
at Las Vegas. So obviously, we don't have it down pat just yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Todd Parrott, Jarrett's crew chief, said: ``It took a couple of
days to get over that, for me especially. But it wasn't
life-threatening. We learned not to count on that calculator for
all the answers.''

SHULAMIT KATZNELSON, 80; TEACHER OF ARABS AND JEWS 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By WILLIAM H. HONAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shulamit Katznelson, who was awarded the 1986 Israel Prize for
Life Achievement, her country's highest honor, for bringing Arabs
and Jews together through learning each other's languages, died
Friday at her home in the coastal town of Netanya, north of Tel
Aviv. She was 80.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a heart attack, her family said.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly half a century, Ms. Katznelson taught Hebrew to Arabs
and Arabic to Jews at Ulpan Akiva, an independent residential
language school she founded in Netanya in 1951. Arabs and Jews
often room together at the school to help break down psychological
barriers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are perhaps naive in trying to approach the problems of the
region in this way,'' she said recently. ``But we believe that the
firm foundations necessary to build and consolidate peace can only
come about through person-to-person contacts and the ability of
each side to speak the other's language.''
</P>
<P>
   She added that many of the Jews and Arabs who attended the
intensive six-week live-in course in a former hotel complex became
friends and remained in touch with one another.
</P>
<P>
   The school philosophy includes Ms. Katznelson's conviction that
language cannot be separated from culture. Of the five hours of
lessons each day in Hebrew, one hour is spent learning about
Judaism and Jewish history. Likewise, the course in Arabic includes
the study of Islam and Arab history as well as visits to Arab
villages.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Katznelson was born in Geneva in 1919, and her family
immigrated to Palestine two years later. Her mother, Bat-Sheva,
became a legislator in Israel's parliament. Her brother, Shmuel
Tamir, served as justice minister, and an uncle, Zalman Shazar, was
Israel's third president.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Katznelson attended high school and a teacher's college in
Jerusalem, then attended a master's program at the University of
Michigan at Ann Arbor.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, the program at Ulpan Akiva taught not only
Jewish immigrants, but also Israel's Arab citizens and visitors
from around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 100,000 people from 148 countries have studied at the
school in the last five decades, among them ambassadors, Israeli
army officers and Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
Ulpan Akiva set up two branch offices in the Gaza Strip towns of
Gaza City and Khan Yunis.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Katznelson retired two years ago, and was succeeded at the
school by Ephraim Lapid, a former Israeli brigadier general.

RECORDS DETAIL VERMONT STERILIZATION PROJECT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ELLEN BARRY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It changes the way you think of those paragons of New England
society, the Yankees, to learn that Vermont scientists had an
active program to breed them.
</P>
<P>
   But there it is, in the archives at the Public Records Office in
Burlington: the long-abandoned paperwork of the Vermont Eugenics
Survey, tracing in businesslike diagrams the ``degenerate''
bloodlines that social scientists in the 1920s and '30s hoped to
eliminate and the ``old pioneer stock'' they hoped to replenish.
</P>
<P>
   A dozen times, as she paged through the old records, Nancy
Gallagher thought about abandoning her project.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, no historian had ever written a book about
Vermont Eugenics Survey's 12-year study of ``good'' and ``bad''
families, which was widely circulated among policymakers and
culminated in a law providing for the sterilization of several
hundred poor, rural Vermonters, Abenaki Indians, and other people
deemed unfit to reproduce.
</P>
<P>
   The story of state-level eugenics was largely untold. Somewhere,
between Gregor Mendel's revolutionary work in genetics and the
Nazis' bizarre distortion of it, there was a void in the teaching
of history.
</P>
<P>
   But on the other hand, she knew there are people in the state
who would read their own family histories in her book.
</P>
<P>
   Gallagher wasn't a bomb-throwing revisionist historian, she was
a 50-year-old former biology teacher who expected her doctoral
thesis to ``sit on a shelf,'' and she had stumbled into a subject
both unexplored and painful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every step of the way,'' said Gallagher, ``I wondered if I
should even be writing it.''
</P>
<P>
   When her book, ``Breeding Better Vermonters: The Eugenics
Project in the Green Mountain State,'' is published by the
University Press of New England later this year, the wondering will
be over. Gallagher and the rest of the state will be left with the
emotional fallout of a historical episode that no one, not even its
victims, particularly wants to discuss. The Eugenics Project was an
obscure independent effort whose only real effect was the
sterilization law, but its archives reveal a mindset so abhorrent
that the historian who first discovered the papers walked away from
the subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a real dark streak in me, and it's very dark
material. You can try and not be affected by it, but there's a lot
of hate in it,'' said Kevin Dann, a historian in Woodstock who came
upon the crates of eugenics surveys almost accidentally in the
mid-1980s and published the first article about it in 1986. ``The
tales of redemption and human kindness and serendipity and grace
are not there.''
</P>
<P>
   Vermont's social scientists were hardly alone in embracing
eugenics, the science of human breeding that branched off from
social Darwinism. All over the United States during the first two
decades of this century, progressives were on fire to prevent, and
not just manage, the misery of the poor. New science seemed to
supply an answer: domestic abuse and alcoholism, long blamed on bad
social conditions, were thought to be caused by recessive genes and
inbreeding. By reducing the number of babies born to sick or unwed
parents, and by attracting desirable settlers, social scientists
thought they could a build a healthier society.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Vermont was the 31st state to pass a law allowing for
sterilization of the handicapped or ``feebleminded.'' The number of
sterilizations that took place in Vermont was a tiny fraction of
the 60,000 that took place in states before the laws were rolled
back in the 1960s and '70s, according to Diane Paul, a UMass-Boston
political scientist and author of the book ``Controlling Human
Heredity: 1865 to the Present.''
</P>
<P>
   But in some ways, Gallagher argues, Vermonters were uniquely
ready to accept eugenic solutions. The state's population was
dwindling and the draft board was rejecting an increasing number of
young men _ trends that dealt a blow to the closely-held Yankee
Protestant ideal. In 1930, 71 percent of the state's 350,000 people
were native Vermonters. This kind of population can be changed more
readily, encouraging eugenicists to ``improve the quality of its
native stock,'' as one put it. The global craze for bettering
society through selective breeding could be applied to local aims.
</P>
<P>
   It was in this atmosphere that the University of Vermont zoology
professor Henry Perkins threw himself into the project of tracing
what Gallagher calls ``pedigrees of degeneracy'' in a series of
Vermont families.
</P>
<P>
   Field workers selected particular ``notorious'' families and
issued reports with titles like ``The Results of the Matrimonial
Adventures of Four Degenerate Offspring of the Fourth Generation of
the Doolittle Family.''
</P>
<P>
   The reports drew on interviews with neighbors and local
officials, and were sometimes supplemented with estimates of the
families' cost to taxpayers, terming one extended family
``Expensive Luxuries.'' One researcher reported that ``the state of
Vermont would have been better off had Richard, Simon, John and
Joseph of Generation III not been allowed to produce children.''
</P>
<P>
   The work paid off for Perkins in 1931, when a sterilization bill
finally passed, and between then and the early 1960s, the state
would fund and arrange sterilizations, often on young men and women
living in institutions for the ``feebleminded'' or handicapped,
frequently as a condition of release.
</P>
<P>
   Although there is plenty of anecdotal evidence about
sterilization policy, particularly among the Abenaki, there is no
documentation of how widespread the phenomenon was, or how the
option was presented to its subjects. The only published summary of
state sterilization, from the 1940s, puts the number at 212,
although many suspect the real number is higher, Dann said.
</P>
<P>
   The eugenics movement radically changed direction in the 1930s,
as people recoiled from the Nazis' ``race hygeine.'' When Perkins's
student Elin Anderson published a 1937 study of Burlington called
``We Americans,'' her work showed less nostalgia for the ``old
pioneer stock'' and assigned positive value to racial diversity. By
1940, Perkins himself realized that his early ideas were
unacceptable, and omitted from his abstracts any mention of the
years spent following Vermont's ``degenerates.''
</P>
<P>
   And that whole project would have faded into obscurity except
for a pair of accidents: Perkins's proud record keeping and Dann's
chance discovery of 40 crates of surveys in the laundry room of a
state mental hospital in the mid-1980s. He quickly realized that
the history was still painfully fresh.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can still go into high schools in Vermont and mention the
families that were studied and they'll say, `They're still the
troublemakers,' '' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Abenaki _ who, historians have established, made up a
large contingent of the families Perkins studied _ the
sterilization law is hardly history at all. Rushlow, the
31-year-old Abenaki acting chief, said that female relatives of her
father's generation were sterilized without their consent, and that
stories of the Perkins research were not taught in school but were
``passed down through the elders of the community.''
</P>
<P>
   To her, Rushlow said, Perkins has always seemed ``just like
Hitler.''
</P>
<P>
   The recent spike of scholarly interest has drawn mixed
responses, she said _ on the one hand, printing the history of
Perkins's project could ``finally let the public know what
happened.'' But the historians' interest has also churned up
painful episodes that had been ``kind of buried.'' She told of a
53-year-old man who realized five years ago, after reading a
revisionist account of the closing of the Brandon Home for the
Feebleminded, that he had probably been sterilized when he was 7.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Gallagher, who taught biology in Vermont schools for
years, is haunted by another possibility: That at some point,
unknowingly, she may have popularized scientific inquiry with
equally horrifying applications. Right now she's worried about the
human genome project. After reading through boxes of Perkins's
pedigrees, she'll never be as trustful of science, or of herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It humbles you,'' she said. ``To their dying day they probably
thought they were doing the right thing.''

 By LAWRIE MIFFLIN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Rick Kaplan became president of CNN/USA in late
1997, he wanted to make a splash with three prime-time programs he
was creating in concert with ``Time,'' ``Fortune'' and
``Entertainment Weekly,'' magazine siblings in the Time Warner
corporate family.
</P>
<P>
   Essential to the shows' success would be their anchors, and
Kaplan, formerly an ABC News executive, wanted to woo Willow Bay
from ABC to be a co-anchor for ``CNN &AMP; Entertainment Weekly.''
</P>
<P>
   Over lunch, he made his pitch. Then Ms. Bay surprised him. She
would be glad to do the entertainment program, she said, but what
she really wanted was to be a co-anchor of was ``Fortune.''
</P>
<P>
   ``By the way,'' she asked, only partly teasing, ``why wouldn't
you have thought of me for the `Fortune' show?''
</P>
<P>
   She wound up getting both jobs, and now, after a little more
than a year with them, Ms. Bay has been promoted to CNN's top
business-news spot. On July 19, she and Stuart Varney became
co-anchors of the network's most lucrative show, its 6:30 p.m.
business newscast, ``Moneyline News Hour,'' taking over from Lou
Dobbs, who resigned abruptly in June.
</P>
<P>
   To Wall Street, Varney, a longtime financial journalist, was a
predictable replacement. Ms. Bay was not. Though she has a master's
degree in business administration from New York University, until
her ``Fortune'' anchoring and reporting work, she had primarily
handled softer news.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the fact that she is a former model led many in the
business world to wonder if CNN had gone soft, and would be taking
``Moneyline'' in a more entertainment-oriented direction.
</P>
<P>
   That is not the case, according to virtually all of Ms. Bay's
colleagues, from Kaplan on down, who note that it is at best silly
and at worst sexist to assume that an attractive woman is incapable
of solid business reporting.
</P>
<P>
   But at first, even Kaplan was surprised at Ms. Bay's resolve to
move into this realm.
</P>
<P>
   Had he looked at her resume, that business degree from NYU might
have stood out. And he had worked with her on some ABC News special
reports. But most of his familiarity with her came from watching
her work as the anchor of ABC's ``Good Morning America Sunday,'' a
show skewed toward entertainment rather than heavy-duty news, and
as the co-host of a Saturday-morning basketball show for children
on NBC called ``NBA Inside Stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing there suggested a potential business journalist.
</P>
<P>
   Recalling that lunch, Kaplan said: ``I think she wanted to make
sure I knew how serious she was. After doing the NBA show and all,
she wanted to be involved in something substantive, and she wasn't
sure the `E.W.' show would turn out that way.''
</P>
<P>
   None of the three shows performed well in the Nielsen ratings.
Still, Ms. Bay, in Kaplan's estimation, demonstrated that she had
the skill and substance to handle ``Moneyline.''
</P>
<P>
   But at CNN, some people briefly grumbled about a newcomer
usurping a job that could have gone to one of CNN's more
experienced correspondents.
</P>
<P>
   And at CNBC, the business-news cable network based in Ft. Lee,
N.J., rivals sniped that Ms. Bay, who is 35, had gotten the job
because she is young, glamorous and has high-profile connections in
the media business world. Her husband, Robert A. Iger, is the
chairman of Walt Disney Co.'s ABC Group.
</P>
<P>
   Executives of CNBC, which is owned by General Electric Co.'s NBC
subsidiary, immediately laid out a plan to take advantage of the
personnel switch at ``Moneyline.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon after Dobbs announced his departure _ he left CNN to take
charge of an Internet site devoted to outer space _ CNBC expanded
its roundup show, ``Business Center,'' to an hour, starting the
same time as ``Moneyline.'' ``Business Center'' also changed its
anchors, shifting CNBC's best-known daytime anchors, Sue Herera and
Ron Insana, to replace Maria Bartiromo, who moved to an afternoon
program of her own.
</P>
<P>
   Back at CNN, by naming two anchors for ``Moneyline,'' Kaplan
diffused the burden of replacing Dobbs, who began the program in
1984 when CNN began and, to some, personified business and market
news on television.
</P>
<P>
   Since Ms. Bay and Varney were on the show together for only two
weeks before Ms. Bay went on vacation, no meaningful ratings
comparisons can be made yet. Preliminary figures suggest that
``Moneyline'' has not suffered significantly from the loss of
Dobbs.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR;  &LR; (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bay, whose given name is Kristine but was nicknamed Willow
by her mother, is finally in the kind of job she has long desired.
After getting her MBA in 1991, she wanted to become a business
reporter, she said, but was steered away by her agent, who said
business journalism was too narrow a field.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he urged her to capitalize on her experience as a
model, a career she had begun at the age of 15. For five years in
her early 20s, Ms. Bay was ``the face'' of Estee Lauder cosmetics
advertising worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some ways it was a great, glamorous pedigree,'' Ms. Bay
said of her modeling career. ``In other ways it has been an
impediment,'' encouraging some people to dismiss her as just a
pretty face.
</P>
<P>
   Not that being attractive has ever hurt on television. And with
more people interested in business news, networks are hiring
on-camera talent with a popular, even a glamorous appeal. Several
attractive women _ and more than a few handsome, well-coiffed men,
for that matter _ cover financial news for CNBC and other
television news organizations. Indeed, tabloid newspapers have
nicknamed Ms. Bartiromo at CNBC ``the money honey,'' and sometimes
portray Ms. Bay as a new entrant in the category.
</P>
<P>
   Still, business correspondents must have more than just looks,
broadcast executives say. ``A television audience has traditionally
had a better acceptance of attractive people, in terms of accepting
them into your home,'' said a CNBC executive producer, who spoke on
condition of anonymity. ``But the audience has to believe your
anchors know what they're talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   Networks are not so much seeking more attractive people as
business-news correspondents and anchors, Kaplan said, as they are
simply getting a wider variety of applicants. ``Business-news
reporting has become big time,'' he said. ``Those jobs are more
sought-after than they were in the past, because they have more
visibility.''
</P>
<P>
   And even if the glamour factor rises, he said, the most
important assets remain knowledge and credibility.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bay acknowledges that she has work to do to build up her
credibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not have a wealth of experience in daily financial news
reporting,'' she said in an interview at the midtown Manhattan
headquarters of CNN and CNNfn, its sister
all-financial-news-all-the-time network. ``But I do come to this
job with a background in business reporting.''
</P>
<P>
   From her reporting of longer pieces on the ``CNN &AMP; Fortune''
magazine show, Ms. Bay said, she brings a desire to put business
developments in context, and curiosity about ``the personalities of
the players involved and how that shapes strategy, how that shapes
execution, how that shapes morale and direction at companies.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, in an interview for ``Moneyline'' last week with
Harvey Weinstein, the co-chairman of Miramax Films, and Cathleen
Black, president of Hearst Magazines, about their joint venture,
``Talk'' magazine, she put Weinstein on the spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not known for spending lavishly, and you're also not
known for being a patient man,'' Ms. Bay said to him. ``How
comfortable are you about spending 30, 40 or 50 million dollars to
launch this product?''
</P>
<P>
   Since earlier in the interview, Weinstein and Ms. Black had
declined to give the start-up figures for ``Talk,'' he looked a bit
taken aback. Ms. Bay had gotten the estimate, she later said, from
other magazine industry sources.
</P>
<P>
   She probably could have gotten a pretty good estimate from her
husband, since Miramax, while not under Iger, is a unit of Disney.
``I could have asked him, but I don't do research at home,'' Ms.
Bay said firmly.
</P>
<P>
   She and Iger, who have been married since 1995 and have an
eight-month-old son, Max, do not have ``a formal policy'' about
what they will and won't discuss to avoid potential conflicts of
interest, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are just both very respectful of not putting each other in
a precarious position,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Perceptions of conflicts of interest also worry her. If
Weinstein reported to Iger, for example, she said she would not
have interviewed him. ``If I feel conflicted or there's a
perception of conflict, I recuse myself, as anyone would,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, the first thing people who have worked with Ms.
Bay invariably mentioned was how hard she works _ almost as if they
find that surprising.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's not ambitious in the `star' sense,'' said a former
colleague at ABC. ``She's 100 percent devoted to making herself
better. She's absolutely intense about wanting to be prepared, to
learn all she can.''
</P>
<P>
   Mimi Gerbst, who heads the assignment desk at ABC News, said
that Ms. Bay had ``always done whatever she was asked to do and
more, and always in the most willing and most cooperative way.''
</P>
<P>
   She first applied herself to learning a new field from scratch
when David Stern, the NBA commissioner, and his TV staff hired her
as a co-host of ``NBA Inside Stuff,'' along with Ahmad Rashad.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are similarities, especially in learning the special
jargon,'' Ms. Bay said.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan sees another analogy to sports. ``Business viewers are
like sports fans in that they come with a whole lot of knowledge,''
he said. ``If I'm an anchor, you have to take my word about what's
in the SALT treaty, but not about who ought to start at center for
the Bulls.''
</P>
<P>
   CNN hopes the new anchors can appeal to average investors in

high-powered audience that lets ``Moneyline'' earn the highest

   ``You always worry about on-air chemistry,'' Kaplan said. ``But
I think it will work because she is what we call a generous anchor,
meaning she's willing to make someone else look good.

   ``Look, by the age of 20 she'd had more fame than most people

FLEISHER LEADS BY 1, AND TIES COURSE RECORD 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By STEVE POPPER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERICHO, N.Y. _ On the 17th tee at the Meadow Brook Club on
Friday, a spectator shouted to Bruce Fleisher: he had a chance to
capture the course record in the Lightpath Long Island Classic. The
news went in one ear and out the other, Fleisher said, the sort
that matters more to players who are accustomed to a place in the
record book.
</P>
<P>
   Fleisher has four victories and ranks second on the money list
in his first full season on the Senior PGA Tour, after a career on
the PGA Tour that never approached such heights. A bogey on the
18th hole Friday left him with an opening-round 64, tying the
course record set two years ago by Jose Maria Canizares and giving
him a one-stroke lead over Mark Hayes. That was fine with Fleisher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone mentioned course record,'' Fleisher said. ``But you're
not thinking course record. I don't think it means anything. I
found out the number in the tent and it wouldn't have made a
difference. I would have liked to play the 18th hole again,
though.''
</P>
<P>
   That is all you will get out of Fleisher in terms of regrets. He
won the United States Amateur at age 19, earning a spot in the 1969
Masters with Arnold Palmer. He shot a 69 that day, four strokes
better than Palmer, setting a high bar of expectation that he never
met on the PGA Tour. He had one victory in 26 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know I've got a very good explanation for that,'' Fleisher
said. ``I really believe there are very few that are chosen, no
matter what we do. There can only be one Jack Nicklaus, one Arnold
Palmer, one Tom Watson. I don't look at my career as a failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many ways, maybe I never reached my potential. The way I
look at it is, I've lived my life the way I want to live it.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``In retrospect, maybe I didn't work hard enough.
There's a lot of sacrifice you have to make. I don't envy any of
them. I look at Tiger Woods today. He has no life. He may in 15-20
years when he walks away.''
</P>
<P>
   Fleisher's success on the Senior Tour has been startling. After
amassing lifetime earnings on the PGA Tour of $1,695,111, he has
already picked up $1,488,400 this season, second to Hale Irwin, and
there is a $180,000 check awaiting the winner of this tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to give Hale a run,'' Fleisher said. ``He may run
away with it still, but it's been a fun year so far.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The race for the money lead has been enough _ along with too
many phone calls disturbing his rest _ to turn what Fleisher
planned as a two- to three-week vacation into just one week. He
watched last week's Novell Utah Showdown from his home in Florida,
but decided to jump back into action this week. It looked like a
good decision Friday, when he carded birdies on six consecutive
holes on the front nine.
</P>
<P>
   Then he birdied the par-5 17th to put himself in position to set
the course record. But on the 167-yard 18th, he opted for an 8-iron
and left his tee shot short, hitting in front of the green and
rolling back approximately 30 yards. He chipped 12 feet past the
hole, and his par putt hung just off the lip, leaving him in a tie
for the record.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes, a Monday qualifier, finished with a 65, just one stroke
back.
</P>
<P>
   ``My caddie, Dennis Turning, I lean on him and he made a
mistake,'' Fleisher said, a small smile accompanying the criticism.
``Even though I hit it, I blame him.''

TWO CHARGED IN BALLET STATUTORY RAPE CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ELLEMENT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- As parents and students gathered for the final
performance of the prestigious Boston Ballet summer school,
authorities disclosed that two young men who were students in the
program face statutory rape charges for allegedly having sex with
two 14-year-old female students.
</P>
<P>
   The sex, believed to have been consensual, allegedly occurred
earlier this week at the Emerson College dormitory where the
program students, some of the finest young ballet dancers in the
world, are housed during the six-week program, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The male students were identified by Suffolk District Attorney
Ralph C. Martin 2d's office as 21-year-old Alberto Colon and
18-year-old Nathan McGinnis, both from North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Both men were students when they allegedly had sex with the
underage girls, James Borghesani, a spokesman for Martin said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   A Boston Ballet spokesman, John Michael Kennedy, said Colon and
McGinnis had been expelled from the program. But Kennedy refused to
say when that expulsion was ordered.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are both former students. Expelled,'' Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   He refused to discuss the status of the two girls, nor would he
respond to questions about the school's internal response to the
allegations of sexual misconduct by students. Instead, Kennedy
reiterated the ballet's statement of Thursday that said they are
cooperating with ``appropriate authorities'' in the criminal
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Boston Ballet acknowledges the seriousness of the
allegations involving students in the Summer Dance Program,''
Kennedy said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
   Parents gathering for Friday's recital expressed concern that
they were not told by Ballet officials that a criminal
investigation aimed at students was under &UR;  &LR; way. But they said they
were confident that their children were well-supervised during the
program.
</P>
<P>
   The parents said they understood that males and females in the
program lived on separate dorm floors but could mingle in a common
room to watch television.
</P>
<P>
   Borghesani said Colon has been charged with one count of
statutory rape and one count of indecent assault and battery.
McGinnis was charged with two counts of statutory rape.
</P>
<P>
   Both men were arraigned in Boston Municipal Court on Thursday
where Judge Sally A. Kelly set bail at $2,500 cash. That was later
reduced to personal recognizance by a Superior Court judge and both
men were released.
</P>
<P>
   The incident allegedly occurred inside a room at the Emerson
College dormitory in downtown Boston where the ballet houses the
students who are selected to attend the program each summer.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the men nor their attorneys could be reached for
comment. Borghesani said he was unaware of the arrests when asked
about the investigation by the Globe on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The two men and the girls were questioned by investigators this
week after police learned about the allegations of sexual
misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   Friday marked the end of the six-week intensive program for 332
students, ranging in age from 13 years to 22 years old, as students
performed in a recital at the ballet's Clarendon Street facility.
</P>
<P>
   Several parents interviewed Friday afternoon _ hours before
authorities disclosed the arrests _ said they had not been notified
by the ballet that a criminal investigation had begun earlier this
week and was targeting some of the students.
</P>
<P>
   One parent, a mother whose son has been participating in the
Summer Dance program for the last two years, said significant
developments such as a criminal investigation should be brought to
the attention of parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to know if something is going on, definitely,'' the
mother, who declined to be identified, said.
</P>
<P>
   But the mother and other parents interviewed said they had faith
in the Ballet's ability to properly supervise their children. ``I
think they are pretty good,'' the mother said.

 &HT;    Details don't solve riddle that was Mark Barton's life
 &HT;    By Craig Schneider, Alan Judd and Lyda Longa
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ (SET ITAL)``I'm sure the details don't matter. There
is no excuse, no good reason. I am sure no one would understand. If
they could, I wouldn't want them to.''(END ITAL)
</P>
<P>
   By the time Mark Orrin Barton sat down at his computer and wrote
a chillingly elegant confession, the demons that had haunted him
since childhood had consumed him.
</P>
<P>
   As a loner in high school, Barton imagined himself a criminal
mastermind when he broke into a drugstore.
</P>
<P>
   As a business executive, he undermined his success by retreating
behind a wall of paranoia, sabotaging a colleague's work and
belittling his wife to co-workers after she had a miscarriage.
</P>
<P>
   As a supposedly loving father, he shot his daughter's kitten and
then, feigning concern, led her on a useless search for the missing
pet, which he had already buried.
</P>
<P>
   The details of Barton's slaughter, the largest mass murder in
Georgia history, have become painfully familiar. What remains,
then, is the effort to answer the unanswerable: Why would this
44-year-old man _ why would anyone _ commit such atrocities,
against the woman who loved him, against the children who cherished
him, against casual acquaintances whose only mistake was to be in
the way of his barrage of bullets? A tall, socially awkward
teen-ager at Sumter High School in South Carolina, he dabbled in
drugs in the early 1970s. A whiz at chemistry who didn't care much
for school, Barton tried to use chemicals to extract a hallucinogen
from morning glory seeds, said Milton Grisham, a schoolmate now
living in Roswell.
</P>
<P>
   ``He ingested a great deal of it. Then he really overdosed. He
had hallucinations and had to go to the emergency room,'' said
Grisham, a psychologist who has worked with rapists and killers.
``It did something very bad to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Barton cut off all his hair and became religious.
</P>
<P>
   Bible in hand, he showed up at Grisham's house, where they had
sometimes played chess. He said he'd found the answers to the
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't make any sense,'' said Grisham. ``I kind of lost
touch with him, he became so strange. The drugs blew him away.''
</P>
<P>
   Barton was born in Sumter in 1955, but his father, who worked
for the U.S. Air Force, moved the family to Germany for several
years. They returned to Sumter when Mark was 11, and he later
entered Sumter High. It was a tough time for young people in
Sumter, a city of 25,000 where the main employers were Shaw Air
Force Base and a Campbell's Soup plant. Air Force brats who had
traveled their whole lives shared parks with Southern blacks and
whites who had hardly made it out of town.
</P>
<P>
   In 1971, forced integration merged the city's black and white
high schools. When students sat with friends in the cafeteria, they
split along the color line. Windows were smashed; school fights
broke out.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of tension in the hallways,'' recalled Alan
Feldstott, a member of a group called ``Teens Against
Discrimination,'' perhaps the only integrated club on campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone didn't fit into a group and find an identity,''
they could just slide through unnoticed, said retired English
teacher J. Grady Locklear. ``Mark is one of those.''
</P>
<P>
   Barton didn't play sports, didn't have a steady girlfriend,
didn't care much about anything beyond chemistry and math. The kid
with glasses, who drove a gold Plymouth Duster, appeared in his
junior yearbook picture in what seemed to be the same striped shirt
he had worn for his sophomore picture. As a senior, he was among a
handful of Sumter High's National Merit Scholar semi-finalists, but
he didn't appear in a group photo. In fact, he disappeared from the
yearbook altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was angry about not fitting in,'' said Grisham. ``He
figured, `I'm an outcast. Why should I participate?'''
</P>
<P>
   Back in his red brick home on Wren Street, a tree-lined suburban
road in the nicer part of town, there was also turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't like his father,'' said Grisham. ``His dad was very
stern and strict.''
</P>
<P>
   His mother, Gladys, served more than 20 years as the church
secretary for St. James Lutheran Church. Mother and son remained
close when he moved away soon after high school. His father,
Truman, died in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   At 14, Barton was busted for breaking into a drugstore. At 20,
he did it again and got off with counseling, no jail time.
</P>
<P>
   ``He fancied himself a mastermind criminal,'' Grisham said. ``He
was always a schemer.''
</P>
<P>
   TROUBLE IN TEXAS
</P>
<P>
   Armed with a chemistry degree from the University of South
Carolina, Barton moved through a string of jobs in the chemical
industry, building his confidence as he built his resume.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, his career path led him to Texarkana, a distinctly
unlovely city cut from the flat, piney woods of East Texas. He had
a good job that paid well, and he earned a promotion. He bought a
brand new house and joined a church. He and his wife had their
first child, a chubby blonde they named Matthew.
</P>
<P>
   Under the veneer of normalcy, Barton's troubles were fermenting.
</P>
<P>
   At TLC Manufacturing Inc., where he started as a chemist in 1984
and became president two years later, Barton continually retreated
into his office, locking the door behind him, recalled LeeAnn
Burke, his secretary for four years.
</P>
<P>
   ``He thought people were out to get him,'' said Burke, who
remembers her old boss as ``paranoid.''
</P>
<P>
   Barton, she said, would surreptitiously tape telephone
conversations with other employees. He so disliked one salesman,
she said, that he would alter orders the salesman placed in the
company computer system to delay deliveries to his clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a quick temper,'' Burke said. ``When somebody got on
his bad side, you stayed there.''
</P>
<P>
   Barton's home life seemed just as volatile.
</P>
<P>
   When his wife, Debra, suffered a miscarriage, he belittled her
pain at work. When he talked about her with co-workers, he referred
to her by a demeaning nickname: ``Stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was real controlling,'' said Burke, who screened Barton's
telephone calls. ``She couldn't do anything without his permission.
She couldn't leave the house without telling him first where she
was going to go, and what she was going to do, and when she was
going to be back.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bartons rarely socialized, former neighbors said, spending
evenings alone in their brick ranch house on a dead-end street.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, the year after their son was born, the Bartons joined
First Baptist Church of Texarkana, a sprawling facility with a
theaterlike sanctuary on the outskirts of town. But in a church
with 3,000 members, they barely left a mark. The pastor, the Rev.
D. Terry Land, could remember nothing about Barton or his wife,
even after finding the couple's picture in an old church directory.
Mark, holding baby Matthew, was smiling. Debra was not.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his public smiles, his life was anything but happy.
</P>
<P>
   Complaining about Barton's management abilities, TLC's board of
directors fired him Sept. 13, 1990. According to a Texarkana police
report, he walked out the door ``visibly angry and upset.''
</P>
<P>
   He would soon return.
</P>
<P>
   The following week, in an elaborate late-night caper, Barton
broke into the building through a loading dock door, police said.
Once inside, he moved a refrigerator in the break room, allowing
him to reach a window that he knew was never locked. He crawled
through the window to reach the executive offices.
</P>
<P>
   Barton downloaded financial data and the formulas to TLC's
products from two computers and erased the machines' hard drives.
On his way out, he grabbed two 3-inch-thick file folders that
contained similar information.
</P>
<P>
   Police and company officials immediately suspected Barton. When
he was questioned by police, he denied the crime but inadvertently
implicated himself. He told officers that anyone could have entered
through the loading dock door, even though they hadn't told him how
the crime was executed. Then, when his wife came into the room,
Barton told her, ``They think I stole the formulas.'' But the
officers hadn't told him the formulas had been taken.
</P>
<P>
   Barton was charged with felony burglary. But he was released a
few hours later, after the company declined to prosecute. Barton
had struck a deal with the company, according to police records,
but executives declined to comment this week.
</P>
<P>
   After he got out of jail, Barton returned home, put his wife and
child in his car and drove to Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   A CLOUD OF SUSPICION
</P>
<P>
   With no house, no job and no prospects, Barton still landed on
his feet in his Georgia exile.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, he had a sales job with a chemical company, later, a
better job at another firm. The next year, the Bartons had a
daughter, Mychelle, and they bought a five-bedroom house in
Douglasville with plenty of space for their two children and two
cats.
</P>
<P>
   Barton gave the appearance of a happy father, devoted husband,
successful businessman. On Saturdays, he cooked bacon and pancakes
or waffles for his children. They would watch cartoons on
television and, if Debra wasn't home, Barton said later, ``run
through the house and beat each other with pillows and just get
totally out of hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Again, though, the facade crumbled. Not long after Mychelle's
birth, he testified in 1995, every time he traveled on business,
Debra suspected he was having affairs. She was right.
</P>
<P>
   In early 1993, Barton began dating newlywed Leigh Ann Lang, 21,
a receptionist at the Macon chemical company where he was a
salesman. That June, a friend of Leigh Ann's said, Barton told her
and another woman that he had never loved anyone like he loved
Leigh Ann. By October, he said, he would be ``free.''
</P>
<P>
   Leigh Ann left her husband just before Labor Day _ the same
weekend Debra Barton, 36, and her mother, Eloise Spivey, took a
trip to the Spivey family's cabin in Alabama, where they were
killed.
</P>
<P>
   From the time their bodies were found, Barton was the prime
suspect. His demeanor _ cool, dispassionate _ only made authorities
more determined to pursue him.
</P>
<P>
   When an Alabama investigator drove him to the crime scene,
``there was nothing about him grieving over the loss of his wife,''
said Michael Hauptman, a former Barton attorney.
</P>
<P>
   And when investigators asked him whether he was having an affair
when his wife was killed, according to court documents, he lied _
twice.
</P>
<P>
   He eventually admitted to the affair, but that wasn't enough for
authorities to charge him with the killings.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, he spent the rest of his life under a cloud of
suspicion. State social workers investigated an allegation that
Barton had molested his daughter, but sought no criminal charges.
Debra's family continually insisted in news interviews and to
police that he had killed his wife and mother-in-law. And Alabama
authorities remained on the case.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the killings, Alabama crime investigator Danny
Smith visited Leigh Ann, warning her that Barton said he would
always need a ``young, sexy wife.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When you cease to fill those needs,'' Smith recalled warning
her, ``you know he's going to kill you.''
</P>
<P>
   MADNESS AND MURDER
</P>
<P>
   It was late October 1998 when Leigh Ann Barton got a call at her
Atlanta office, where she was a customer service trainer. A
despondent Mark Barton was on the line. He told his wife he had
nothing more to live for and that he was going to kill himself,
said Henry County homicide Detective Rene Swanson, the lead
investigator in the Barton family murders.
</P>
<P>
   But when Leigh Ann arrived at the family's house, things had
changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never mind,'' Barton told his wife. ``I've already killed the
cat.''
</P>
<P>
   Worse, investigators said, is the charade that followed, when he
spent two days helping his 8-year-old daughter, Mychelle, look for
the missing pet.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what convinced Leigh Ann to finally leave him,'' said
Swanson, who interviewed Leigh Ann's close friend, Rhonda Lassiter,
and family members.
</P>
<P>
   By last November, Leigh Ann was alone at Bristol Green
Apartments in Stockbridge. She leased a two-bedroom apartment,
modestly furnishing it with a dining room table, a love seat and a
slew of pictures of her with Barton's children. At Christmas,
Barton told her he had lost all his money in day trading. ``I need
help,'' he said, according to Leigh Ann's sister.
</P>
<P>
   In one three-day binge, he'd lost $153,000, according to a
trading report from Momentum Securities in Atlanta, where his
shooting rampage began. His losses ultimately totaled $450,000.
</P>
<P>
   By July 4, 1999, he had convinced her that he and the children
had no place else to go. They soon joined her in the apartment.
</P>
<P>
   But the night of July 27, Barton slammed a claw hammer into his
wife's head as she slept and hid her body in a hallway closet.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, Barton took his kids to get haircuts. That
night, using the same hammer, he struck Matthew and Mychelle as
they slept in their beds, then immersed each child in the bathtub
to make sure he and she were dead.
</P>
<P>
   (SET ITAL)``I killed Leigh Ann because she was one of the main
reasons for my demise,'' Barton said in the letter he left in the
apartment. ``I killed the children to exchange them for five
minutes of pain for a lifetime of pain.''(END ITAL)
</P>
<P>
   Barton placed the children in their beds, a stuffed animal
beside Mychelle, a computer game beside Matthew.
</P>
<P>
   (SET ITAL)``I don't plan to live very much longer. Just long
enough to kill as many of the people that greedily sought my
destruction.''(END ITAL)
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Tony Biello was the first officer to reach the bloody scene
at Momentum Securities. ``There were bodies everywhere,'' Biello
said.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses told police of Barton's unflinching demeanor as he
slowly walked through two trading offices, blasting away his
victims at close range. It was in stark contrast from Barton's
customarily bright and social character. Loretta Jolly, one of the
women at the complex's cafeteria, said they had nicknamed him ``Big
Money,'' since he was always bragging about his stock profits as he
ordered cheeseburgers and chili.
</P>
<P>
   Traders at All-Tech and Momentum called him ``the Rocket'' for
his boisterous personality, and the firms often placed him in the
middle of other traders because of his infectious enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   But when he finally crashed, Barton had murdered 12 people and
wounded 13 others. Fleeing from police in his green minivan, he was
cornered at a BP gas station in Acworth, and he shot himself in the
head.
</P>
<P>
   Police searching the family's Stockbridge apartment saw that
Barton had tried to scrub the blood in the bathroom and bedroom
carpets with soap and water. Detectives also found a kitten,
meowing in hunger. ``Tigger'' is now with Leigh Ann's parents in
Macon.
</P>
<P>
   The apartment refrigerator was stocked with food, especially
children's snacks: Star Wars Fruit Chews, Juicy Juice, Hi-C. A
child's Boy Scout uniform was on a bed. There were permission slips
for a Boy Scout field trip that Barton had organized to the USS
Yorktown in South Carolina for late August.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything they had was for the children,'' said detective
Swanson. ``You walked in there, and if it hadn't been for the fact
it was a murder scene, it just seemed like the most normal place in
the world.''
</P>
<P>
   THE BARTON EPILOGUE
</P>
<P>
   (SET ITAL)Words cannot tell the agony. Why did I?''(END ITAL)
</P>
<P>
   In the red brick house where Barton grew up, the only survivor
of his twisted life has retreated from the world.
</P>
<P>
   Barton's 76-year-old mother, Gladys, watches the television news
reports about the killings, but does not speak publicly about the
killings. When a reporter left a letter outside her house asking
for an interview, she responded with an immaculately type-written
note.

WOMAN WINS $23.36 MILLION IN FEN-PHEN LAWSUIT 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ In the first verdict from among thousands of cases
pending across the country against makers of the diet pills
popularly known as fen-phen, an east Texas jury Friday awarded
$23.36 million to a woman who said she suffered heart damage after
taking the drugs to lose weight.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Debbie Stone Lovett, 36, a manicurist from Grand
Saline, Tex., had accused Madison, N.J.-based pharmaceutical giant
American Home Products Corp. and its subsidiary Wyeth-Ayerst
Laboratories of failing to warn their customers and doctors that
the diet pills caused heart valve damage.
</P>
<P>
   The judgment is the latest setback for American Home Products,
which settled a similar case in Houston in June for a reported $6
million and faces a massive class-action lawsuit over the diet
pills that began jury selection this week in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiffs' lawyers said Friday's verdict in Van Zandt County,
about 50 miles southeast of Dallas, is particularly significant
because American Home Products, which had settled several cases out
of court, decided that the facts in the Lovett case favored the
company. ``This is a case that American Home Products chose,'' said
Kip Petroff, a lead lawyer for Ms. Lovett who is also trying more
than 100 similar cases across the nation. ``They were very arrogant
and very confident they were going to win this one.''
</P>
<P>
   Several Wall Street analysts expressed surprise at the verdict
and predicted it would encourage more lawsuits against the company,
particularly since American Home Products appeared to have solid
evidence that Ms. Lovett's heart condition existed before her use
of the diet drugs. She used the drugs on and off for six months
beginning in October 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Schick, a lawyer for American Home Products, said it would
appeal the ruling. ``We feel the evidence presented in this case
demonstrated that the company acted responsibly and lawfully in
marketing and monitoring the safety of the diet drug Pondimin,''
Schick said in a statement released by the company.
</P>
<P>
   In September 1997, American Home Products removed the two diet
pills, fenfluramine and dexfenfluramine, which were marketed as
Pondimin and Redux, off the shelves at the request of the Food and
Drug Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Two months later, federal health officials advised the estimated
1.2 million to 4.7 million people in the United States who used the
drugs to seek medical checkups after studies linked them to heart
valve damage.
</P>
<P>
   Petroff said American Home Products had commissioned studies
that encouraged consumers to take Pondimin and Redux in combination
with phentermine, the other half of fen-phen, to achieve long-term
weight loss.
</P>
<P>
   Phentermine, which is distributed but not manufactured by
American Home Products, has never been associated with the same
health problems when taken alone and remains on the market. Though
the FDA had approved all three drugs for use alone as weight-loss
drugs, many doctors followed the advice of the company and
prescribed them in an unapproved fen-phen combination.
</P>
<P>
   In the Texas case, the jury of eight men and four women awarded
Ms. Lovett $3.3 million in compensatory damages and $20 million in
punitive damages. Her lawyers argued that Ms. Lovett developed
leaky heart valves after taking Pondimin in combination with
phentermine for weight loss. But Ms. Lovett's own cardiologist
testified that her heart problems predated her use of fen-phen.
Petroff, however, said that even if she had been sick before taking
the drugs, the company's failure to alert physicians and consumers
to the risks of the pills placed his client in further danger.
</P>
<P>
   ``They clearly made a statement that they were mad at
somebody,'' said Patrick J. Spruiell, another lawyer for Ms.
Lovett, speaking of the jury. ``It appeared to me they wanted to
get AHP's attention. They obviously did that with this verdict.''
</P>
<P>
   The tide of litigation against the company will apparently keep
growing. Petroff said he will begin another lawsuit two weeks from
now in Ft. Worth, Tex., while the class-action lawsuit brought by
three New Jersey women began this week. Tommy Fibich, a Houston
lawyer involved in 160 cases, estimated that the number of lawsuits
against the company has grown from 3,100 to more than 10,000 in
recent weeks.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Texas verdict exacerbates an already trying summer for
American Home Products, the world's seventh-largest drug maker.
Last month, federal officials pulled the company's Rotavirus
vaccine from the market because of health concerns.
</P>
<P>
   In June, the company announced that its second quarter earnings
would not meet analysts' expectations, a disastrous performance in
an environment of robust drug sales. Last year, the company was the
subject of two failed megamergers, first with SmithKline Beecham
and later with Monsanto.
</P>
<P>
   In trading Friday on the New York Stock Exchange, American Home
Products' stock plunged 11.9 percent, or $6.0625 a share, to
$44.875.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers and analysts disagreed about the significance of the
ruling. Fibich described the Lovett case as relatively weak,
particularly since Ms. Lovett had not suffered as greatly as other
users of fen-phen. ``If that case can be won, that tells me almost
any case can be won,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Neil Sweig, a pharmaceutical analyst with Ryan, Beck,
Southeast Research in New York, said analysts have begun to warn
investors not to overreact to American Home Products' problems.
When the problems with fen-phen surfaced in 1997, analysts
predicted that the company faced liabilities of as much as $5
billion.

 &HT;    Probe links Atlanta bid to IOC scholarship offers
 &HT;    By Melissa Turner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Congressional investigators have uncovered evidence
that Atlanta Olympic officials offered college scholarships to
family members of IOC delegates in the city's bid for the 1996
Summer Games.
</P>
<P>
   A senior staff official involved with a congressional
investigation and who has reviewed the Atlanta Olympic records
cited memorandums and correspondence between bid team leaders and
some IOC members regarding scholarships for their relatives.
</P>
<P>
   However, there was solid evidence that only one student actually
attended at least one semester of college, the official said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said in their report (to the House Commerce Committee)
that no scholarships were received by IOC members,'' said the
official. ``But they certainly offered them. And there were
certainly lots of letters and memos indicating this person or that
person said they'd take a scholarship. They were certainly using
that as a means to build their friendships.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta Olympic chief Billy Payne has pledged repeatedly that
his team did not offer scholarships as Salt Lake City officials did
in their successful bid for the 2002 Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
   Revelations of exorbitant gifts, scholarships and cash payments
from the Salt Lake bid group launched a global Olympic bribery
scandal that has forced the resignations or expulsions of 10 IOC
members. Congress, in an effort to apply federal bribery laws to
the IOC, is investigating the Salt Lake and Atlanta bids.
</P>
<P>
   The congressional committee is allowing former U.S. Attorney
General Griffin Bell, a top attorney with the King &AMP; Spalding law
firm, to amend a report compiled by the Atlanta bid group after
investigators found evidence of gifts valued at more than $1,000
and favors that were not included in the report.
</P>
<P>
   The senior staff official also cited Friday at least one job
offer to an IOC member for a relative.
</P>
<P>
   Payne declined to comment Friday about the new developments.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are compiling a supplemental report and while we are doing
that we will withhold comments until after it has been presented to
and reviewed by the commerce committee,'' said Lee Echols,
spokesman for the Georgia Amateur Athletics Foundation, Payne's
organization that was created to bid for the Games.

</P>

   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For a former Long Island social worker, James F. McCann sure
knows a lot about marketing. But McCann, whose company,
rechristened 1-800-Flowers.com, went public last week, might need
some homework in the history of initial offerings.
</P>
<P>
   Over 20 years, McCann, his brother, sister, nieces, nephews,
children and scores of others have built 1-800-Flowers into a very
successful private business, claiming over 60 percent of the
nation's flower delivery market.
</P>
<P>
   After courting the company for more than a year, Goldman, Sachs
sold six million shares of the company at $21 each on Tuesday,
raising $126 million. But the shares closed that first day below
the offered price and ended the week at $17.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market could have been kinder,'' McCann said on Friday.
``I would rather have had a nice little pop and built from there.''
</P>
<P>
   But the rush from even the gushiest initial public offerings
seldom lasts. Most of the new issues through August last year, for
example, are now trading below their offering prices. ``No
fooling?'' McCann asked. Still, he isn't expecting any sympathy
bouquets. &QL;

   The analysts who serve as investors' eyes and ears in monitoring
some of the world's biggest companies are changing jobs, with
higher paychecks a usual result.
</P>
<P>
   A longtime Lehman Brothers analyst, Joseph S. Phillippi, moved
to the company's investment banking side, so Merrill Lynch's
Nicholas Lobaccaro grabbed his place. John A. Casesa, who was at
Schroder &AMP; Co., took Lobaccaro's spot at Merrill. ``When one
leaves, it causes musical chairs,'' Lobaccaro said.
</P>
<P>
   The music is still playing. Maryann N. Keller, the longtime
thorn in General Motors' side at ING Bering, joined the dot-com
world by becoming president of Priceline.com's auto unit. Credit
Suisse First Boston has lost the auto analyst Nicholas J. Colas to
SAC Capital Management, which he joined as a portfolio manager.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts covering such a cyclical industry as autos said
their colleagues were simply being altruistic; by spending their
raises, they will do their part to keep the economy humming.
``Everybody adds to their salary by making these changes,'' said
David B. Healy, an analyst at Burnham Securities. ``They probably
have in mind adding to gross national product.''

   What better way to attract beautiful people to a store than by
showing other beautiful people in its ads? But how to get them to
pose? Valerie Lichman, a New York publicist, figured it out for
Lalique, the French crystal company, which is opening a boutique on
Madison Avenue: you help their favorite charity.
</P>
<P>
   So volunteers for Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center will
appear in the Lalique ad campaign, and, in return, Lalique will
make a substantial but unspecified contribution to Memorial
Sloan-Kettering. Last week, the volunteers were photographed
wearing jewelry from Lalique's new collections for ads that will
run this fall in W and Town &AMP; Country.
</P>
<P>
   One ad shows Alexandra Lind, a young fashion designer, and
Jennifer Creel, who says she has her hands full with two preschool
children. They head the associates committee of the Society of
Memorial Sloan-Kettering.
</P>
<P>
   A second ad shows Joanne de Guardiola, a prominent interior
designer and Society board member, and her stepdaughter Jeanne de
Guardiola, head of the Indian and Southeast Asian department at
Sotheby's and a member of the associates committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will the ads have meaning for people who don't do the charity
circuit?'' Ms. Lichman mused. ``Perhaps not, but Lalique doesn't
mind. The new Madison Avenue boutique ad is aimed at those who know
_ or at least know of _ these ladies and look upon them as arbiters
of style.''

   A postscript on the Talk magazine debut party last week: Lavish
as it was, it relied heavily on what could be called television
game show financing, giving plugs and getting goods. ``Thank you
Donna Karan for making this dress and then I had to pull myself
into it,'' said Tina Brown in a speech, referring to her velvet and
silk devore crystal-accented dress from Ms. Karan, a friend of Ms.
Brown's and a prominent Talk advertiser.

REPORT BLAMES INDIVIDUAL IN KILLING OF MISSIONARY AND SONS IN
INDIA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Australia)  (bl) 
 By BARRY BEARAK    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ The killing of an Australian missionary and
his two young sons by a frenzied mob in January was instigated by
an individual and not by any Hindu right-wing group associated with
the governing Bharatiya Janata Party, according to a summary of a
judicial inquiry issued Friday by the Indian government.
</P>
<P>
   The missionary, Graham Staines, 58, and his sons, Philip, 10,
and Timothy, 6, were attacked Jan. 22 as they slept in their jeep
in a remote village in the state of Orissa. According to witnesses,
the vehicle was then set ablaze with the three victims trapped
inside as 50 to 100 people chanted slogans.
</P>
<P>
   Staines, the local director of the Evangelical Missionary
Society, ran a hospital for leprosy patients. His death came during
a string of attacks against Christians and their churches in India.
</P>
<P>
   Police blamed members of the Bajrang Dal, a youth group that is
part of the same family of Hindu nationalist organizations as the
Bharatiya Janata Party, which was then head of India's coalition
government. That coalition has since lost its majority in
Parliament, and the Bharatiya Janata now heads a caretaker
government, with elections due in September.
</P>
<P>
   The 250-page report, written by Judge D.P. Wadhwa, was submitted
six weeks ago. On Thursday, the Home Ministry made a single copy
available to members of Parliament. Only government-written
summaries were given to the press.
</P>
<P>
   According to the summary, a ``fanatic'' Hindu chauvinist and
repeated lawbreaker, Dara Singh, initiated the killings. He egged
on youths in the village of Manoharpur, provoking ``their ire,
saying that Christian missionaries were destroying the Hindu
religion.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He prepared them and then led the attack,'' the summary said.
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen men have been charged with murder, arson and criminal
conspiracy in the deaths, but Singh is hiding in forests under the
protection of villagers, according to police.
</P>
<P>
   Singh's influence in the area grew, the report said, after he
stopped several Muslims from trading in cows. He then voiced his
disapproval of local missionaries. At the time, friction in the
community was already keen. Christians were being accused of wooing
the local Santhal tribesmen to their faith.
</P>
<P>
   Staines lived in the town of Baripada, where ``he was a popular
figure,'' the summary said. It added that he was involved in
``spreading the Gospel,'' but that he himself ``was not involved in
conversions.''
</P>
<P>
   There are about 23 million Christians in India, but they make up
only 2.3 percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
   The Staines case created a furor here and abroad. The government
was accused of not doing enough to prevent anti-Christian violence.
That Singh was said to have links to a group affiliated with the
Bharatiya Janata Party made the criticisms all the more potent.
</P>
<P>
   If the government's summary accurately reflects the report by
Wadhwa, who serves on the Indian Supreme Court, it would seem to
exonerate the Bharatiya Janata Party.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier press accounts of the report, said to be based on leaks,
maintained that Singh was an activist in the Bajrang Dal and that
even if he was not acting under orders, he was still acting in its
behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Parties opposing the Bharatiya Janata Party have already begun
calling the report a whitewash.

<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ He may be the best punter the New York Jets
have had since Curley Johnson more than 30 years ago, but Tom Tupa
is wondering whether the new rules to avoid doctoring the footballs
will affect his average as well as the overall kicking game.
</P>
<P>
   It did not bother him Friday as the Jets devoted the morning to
special teams.
</P>
<P>
   But before practice, their first shipment of sealed footballs
was opened by a National Football League officiating crew, just as
it will be in the regular season for all teams for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   A dozen balls, each marked with a ``K'' by the manufacturer,
will be the only ones permitted for use by the place-kickers and
punters. Twenty-four other balls will be used on the other downs.
</P>
<P>
   Only officials can manipulate the ball the kickers will use, and
the officials will have a specially made brush to make each ball
smooth.
</P>
<P>
   Kickers tampering with footballs had become so pervasive that
the league's competition committee ruled last year that the
practice would have to stop. No more balls going into washing
machines, being smashed by weights, or being inflated to 16 pounds
before being deflated to the required 13 pounds in order to smooth
out the seams and make them more aerodynamic.
</P>
<P>
   Before Friday's practice, Bill Lovett of Maryland, a field
judge, demonstrated what would be done to the balls. He scraped the
film and dust off the new ball, and that was it. Then they were
placed in a special kickers bag. No players could get their hands
on a ball before its use.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to rub them on the turf and wet them to get the new
stuff off,'' said Tupa, who joined the Jets after producing a
44.5-yard average with New England. That number has been bettered
only twice in a season in the history of the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ends of the ball are hard when they come out of the box,''
he said. ``We used to push the ends down hard into the turf. That
softens it up and allows you to get more compression.''
</P>
<P>
   One league official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity,
said some players had put balls in microwave ovens to tenderize
them. And Steve Belichick, a former Navy special teams coach and
the father of the Jets' assistant head coach, Bill Belichick,
recalled one college punter who used the same ball all season.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the end of the year you couldn't see the grain on the
ball,'' Belichick said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the changes, Tupa suggested, ``There will be a
lot lower averages, especially outdoors and on cold-weather
teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps. But Tupa and place-kicker John Hall could prove even
more effective than their rivals. Both have extremely strong legs.
As linebacker Chad Cascadden said, ``They could put a block of
cement on the tee, and John would kick it into the end zone.''
</P>
<P>
   In theory, with shorter kickoffs and fewer punts going into the
end zones, there will be more balls returned. It calls for faster
special-team coverages. The Jets have been working especially on
this area under coach Mike Sweatman, especially after the team
finished last in the punting game last season, allowing 10.3 yards
a return. (The Jets averaged 7.3 yards a return themselves.)
</P>
<P>
   Sweatman will have to throw out the advice he got from Matt
Bahr, who was the heady and reliable place-kicker for Coach Bill
Parcells on the Giants and Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I once asked him for the recipe of what he did to the ball,''
Sweatman said.
</P>
<P>
   And that was?
</P>
<P>
   Sweatman smiled but did not respond. Perhaps one day, after all,
the kickers may be allowed to have their way again. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   EXTRA POINTS
</P>
<P>
   Did he really mean it, or was Bill Parcells simply needling his
offense the day before the first major scrimmage of camp? He
described the huddle as the ``superstar-central area.'' This is the
group, he said, ``who think they can dial up a superstar whenever
they want. I'm not pushing any panic buttons, we've got more than a
month, but at the same time we've been here a week and the light
has to go on.''
</P>
<P>
   At various times the first week Parcells asked quarterback Vinny
Testaverde if his arm was all right, complained about the line and
complained about the receivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to talk to the offense Thursday afternoon,'' Parcells
said. ``It's just the effort. We're not getting the production out
of some of the players who should be producing well.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, he conceded his biggest worry on offense is not about
first-stringers but the second- and third-team players. Parcells
concluded, ``I'm not being critical,'' then a few sentences later
added, ``If you want to say I'm complaining, you can say that
because I am.''

S.H. WOODSON, NEW JERSEY ASSEMBLY CHIEF AND PASTOR, DIES AT 83  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   The Rev. S. Howard Woodson Jr., who in 1974 became the first
black speaker of a state legislature, died on Wednesday at a
hospital in Trenton. He was 83.
</P>
<P>
   Woodson, a Democrat, lived in Trenton and led the Shiloh Baptist
Church there for 53 years. He was elected to the Trenton City
Council in 1962 and to the New Jersey Legislature in 1964, serving
six two-year terms.
</P>
<P>
   He served as New Jersey's speaker in 1974 and 1975, becoming the
first black to hold the top post in the lower house of any state
legislature. He was also the minority leader of the Assembly in
1968 and 1969.
</P>
<P>
   Woodson resigned from the Assembly in 1976, when Gov. Brendan T.
Byrne appointed him president of the state's Civil Service
Commission, which gave him responsibility for many state
affirmative action and equal employment programs. He held the
position until 1982.
</P>
<P>
   A strong supporter of Byrne's introduction of a state income
tax, Woodson acknowledged in 1978 that he did not file state or
federal income tax returns in 1976 and 1977. He said the failure
resulted from an oversight by his second wife, Lola, who had been
ill.
</P>
<P>
   While the matter was being investigated, Byrne ordered Woodson
to take an unpaid leave of absence from his civil service job. The
leave ended after it was learned that he did not owe any taxes and
was due a refund.
</P>
<P>
   S. Howard Woodson was born in Philadelphia on May 8, 1916. He
received a bachelor's degree from Cheyney University in Cheyney,
Pa., and a master's degree in divinity from Morehouse College in
Atlanta. He was ordained in 1944 and moved to Trenton in 1946. He
retired from his church position in March, becoming pastor
emeritus.
</P>
<P>
   Woodson also served as president of the State Conference of the
NAACP.
</P>
<P>
   His first wife, Audrey, died in 1969. He is survived by his
second wife, Lola: a son, S. Howard III of Alexandria, Va.; a
daughter, Jean Mitchell of Newtown, Pa.; a stepdaughter, Paulette
George of Hamilton Township, N.J.; and eight grandchildren.

TALENT SURGES TO THE TOP AT PLEASANT VALLEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM MCCABE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUTTON, Mass. _ For a week, the talk centered around the big
names who were supposed to be here, but weren't.
</P>
<P>
   After two rounds of the areaWEB.com Challenge at Pleasant
Valley, the talk is of the big names who are here. You can find
them atop the leaderboard.
</P>
<P>
   The program for this LPGA Tour stop still features Karrie Webb,
the game's best player whose withdrawal touched off a bit of
controversy, but there are a flock of players who are quickly
making that debate history. Lorie Kane, No. 3 on the money list, is
one. Sherri Steinhauer, No. 8, is another.
</P>
<P>
   They each posted 4-under-par 32s on the front, finished 67 and
68, respectively, and share the 36-hole lead at 8-under 136.
</P>
<P>
   But while the breeze picked up to cool things off, there was
little breathing room for the leaders. That's because Rachel
Hetherington posted a 66 to tie Mardi Lunn (71) at 137, and Dottie
Pepper (71_138) headlines a group that includes Michele Redman
(68), Jan Stephenson (70), and Laurie Rinker-Graham (68) at 6
under.
</P>
<P>
   Steinhauer began her round with a birdie 2, then rolled in three
more in an outward 32. But she didn't pull away. ``My putter cooled
off a little bit,'' she said. ``I was having trouble with the speed
a bit.'' The reigning British Women's Open champ was seen heading
to the practice green late in the afternoon, most likely because
she knows the women battling her have a knack for winning.
</P>
<P>
   Hetherington has won twice this year, and Pepper's 15th career
victory came earlier this season at the Nabisco Dinah Shore. And
while it's been a while, Stephenson (1987) and Rinker-Graham (1986)
turned back the clock to when they last danced away with a winner's
check.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is a player who has never won _ Kane _ who most stands
out.
</P>
<P>
   Her presence at the top is starting to be a given, as each week
she makes a run at it (four straight top-10 finishes), but with
each tournament she is faced with the question: When will you win?
</P>
<P>
   She seemed poised a few weeks ago, but lost in a playoff to
Steinhauer at the JAL Big Apple Classic. Perhaps they can talk
about that Saturday when they walk 18 over Ted Mingolla's plush
playground.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always enjoy playing with her,'' said Steinhauer. ``I look
forward to it. She's a kind, fun person.''
</P>
<P>
   Lunn is very much a part of the good times, though she was five
strokes higher than her opening 66. ``I'm happy,'' she said. One
off the lead ``is a good place to be with 36 holes left.''
</P>
<P>
   A fellow Australian of Lunn, Hetherington, needed a backside
blitz to get in such a mood. She had started the day at 1 under and
though she made two birdies on the front, Hetherington made her
noise coming home. She birdied the par-4 10th, par-5 11th, par-4
15th, and par-5 18th.
</P>
<P>
   And she did it all with her husband, Dean Teske, on the bag.
``He only caddies with me a few weeks out of the year,'' said
Hetherington. ``It's difficult sometimes because he wants to help
me, but sometimes it's a bit more information than I want to
hear.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many of her colleagues, Hetherington had also heard a lot
of information about the problems this tournament was up against
last week. Marquee names had been promoted, then withdrawn. The
27-year-old Hetherington had planned a schedule that included five
straight weeks of play, then a week off before the Women's British
Open. ``But I thought I would stretch it to six weeks because I
knew they had a short field for this event,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Good for her _ and good for tournament organizers, who had to
smile as the best names in the event moved to the top. Even the
newest star in the LPGA galaxy, Kelli Kuehne (72_141), is lurking
at five back, where she shares space with one of the grandest stars
in the galaxy, Pat Bradley (70_141). And a big name trying to
regain prominence _ Michelle McGann (73_142) _ isn't far away,
either.
</P>
<P>
   Those who are far away, however, will be told of what they
missed at Pleasant Valley when Kane meets up with them next week.
``Of the players who are not here _ Se Ri (Pak), I'm sure (Nancy)
Lopez would be here if she were healthy, and Karrie and Kelly
(Robbins) _ they're all such great strikers of the ball, they could
probably bring this course to its knees.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps. But that's a future consideration. For now, those in
attendance are handling things quite nicely.

NFL MAY BYPASS LOS ANGELES FOR HOUSTON 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Los Angeles' bid for the National Football League's 32nd
franchise is approaching its demise and Houston's chances are
looking better every day.
</P>
<P>
   The league said Thursday that it would no longer focus
exclusively on the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum as the site for a
team, following the state of California's refusal to subsidize the
$150 million cost of new parking garages.
</P>
<P>
   But even if the league examines other locations _ in Inglewood
or Carson _ it could not settle on either by Sept. 15, the deadline
set last March for a final financing plan in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, Bob McNair, who has a stadium financing plan in
place in Houston, would probably be awarded the franchise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we're just working on the things we can control and
looking forward to the Sept. 15 deadline,'' said Steve Patterson,
vice president of McNair's sports holdings. ``The message we've
gotten from the league is that they won't extend the deadline.''
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles plan unraveled earlier this week when the league
refused to sign a deal proposed by California Gov. Gray Davis'
negotiator that the team playing in a renovated Coliseum pay off
$150 million in state-issued bonds with annual rent of $5 million,
a 10 percent ticket tax and all parking revenues.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL wants a pure public subsidy and would never approve a
lease with a rent higher than any other team. The trend in new
stadiums is for teams to pay as little as possible.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Davis' negotiator, Bill Chadwick, resigned. Davis
said in a statement, ``The NFL has to appreciate that there are a
number of higher priorities for the use of public funds in
California than attracting an NFL team.''
</P>
<P>
   NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue wrote to Davis, saying that the
league had no option but to pursue other sites. &QL;

LUTHERANS AGAIN PONDERING FUTURE WITH EPISCOPALIANS 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By GUSTAV NIEBUHR    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   As anniversary dates go, a notable one in the ecumenical
movement among Christian churches comes up on Aug. 18.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago that day, the nation's largest Lutheran
denomination approved an agreement for close cooperation with three
other Protestant denominations. But on the same day, the Lutherans
rejected a similar pact with the Episcopal Church, a move that
surprised many.
</P>
<P>
   Both decisions are worth recalling now, because within two
weeks, leaders of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America will
meet in Denver and, once again, debate whether their 5.2
million-member denomination should enter into an agreement of
``full communion'' with Episcopalians.
</P>
<P>
   The document outlining the proposed agreement is titled ``Called
to Common Mission.'' If it is approved by the denomination's top
policy-making body, the Churchwide Assembly, ``we would be moving
in a very courageous direction,'' said the Rev. Daniel Martensen,
director of the church's Department of Ecumenical Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Such a decision, Martensen said, would have a global impact in
encouraging closer ties among many churches within the Lutheran and
Anglican traditions, which comprise 135 million Christians. (The
2.4 million-member Episcopal Church is part of the Worldwide
Anglican Communion of churches.)
</P>
<P>
   The assembly is scheduled to vote on the matter on Aug. 19.
</P>
<P>
   Although less than a merger, an agreement to enter into full
communion binds churches closely. They agree to recognize one
another's sacraments and clergy members and to collaborate in
missionary work and social service projects. One effect, cited by
supporters of the current proposal, is to allow churches to
exchange clergy members, which would mean, for example, that a
small Episcopal church that could not afford a full-time priest
could share the services of a pastor from a nearby, better-off
Lutheran church.
</P>
<P>
   But whether to forge such ties with the Episcopal Church is
controversial for many Lutherans.
</P>
<P>
   The 1997 Churchwide Assembly, meeting in Philadelphia, approved
a full communion agreement with three churches in Protestantism's
Reformed tradition _ the Presbyterian Church (USA), the United
Church of Christ and the Reformed Church in America _ by a 4-to-1
margin.
</P>
<P>
   Yet that morning, the proposed Concordat of Agreement with the
Episcopalians fell short of the two-thirds majority it needed. The
vote was close.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal failed over concern among Lutherans that
Episcopalians vest too much authority in their bishops, who are
elected for life and considered part of the ``historic
episcopate,'' an unbroken chain of spiritual leadership reaching
back to Christianity's earliest days. Lutheran bishops are elected
for six-year terms and return, when that service is over, to being
pastors.
</P>
<P>
   After the proposal was defeated, a committee was created to
revise aspects of the full communion plan. Nonetheless, opposition
remains very much alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what riles us most is the required inclusion of the
historic episcopate,'' said the Rev. Kent S. (Tony) Stoutenburg,
spokesman for an Internet site created by opponents of the full
communion proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Stoutenburg, who serves churches in Chinook and Naselle, Wash.,
said ecumenical cooperation could function well without such formal
ties as a full communion agreement. He cited instances in his area
in which clergy members across a broad spectrum of faiths had
worked together to provide meals for the needy.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, ecumenism is not about institutions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Full communion has been far less controversial among
Episcopalians, who voted for it by a 9-to-1 margin two years ago.
The church's leaders are supportive of the revised proposal that
the Lutherans will consider, although for it to go into effect,
Episcopalians would have to vote on it again when their
policy-making body meets next year, an event also scheduled for
Denver.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of our relationship with the Lutherans, it's
extremely important,'' said the Rev. David W. Perry, deputy for
ecumenical and interfaith relations of the Episcopal Church. He
called it ``a major opportunity'' for the ecumenical movement, and
added, ``People are watching to see if it's going to be possible.''

FORMATION OF RIVALS' ALLIANCE EXPOSES YELTSIN'S DECLINE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CELESTINE BOHLEN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ In his eight years as Russia's first popularly elected
president, Boris Yeltsin has shown that he can stomach vicious
criticism, manage a virulent Communist opposition and emerge
bloodied but whole from a disastrous civil war.
</P>
<P>
   But what he has never accepted is to have his views discounted,
which is what occurred this week, when two powerful wings of the
political establishment banded together to form an electoral
alliance, against the wishes of the presidential administration in
the Kremlin and despite its best efforts to block the move.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's failure to bring the newly minted center-left party to
heel not only exposed his weakening position as his term enters its
final year, but it has also left the Kremlin empty-handed, without
a party or even a viable candidate, as Russia begins its march into
the post-Yeltsin era.
</P>
<P>
   It is still too early to gauge the strength of the alliance
between the ambitious mayor of Moscow, Yuri Luzhkov, a potential
presidential contender, and a handful of regional barons, now
united for Parliamentary elections in December.
</P>
<P>
   The success of the coalition, an awkward amalgam known
provisionally as ``Fatherland _ All Russia,'' largely depends on
its ability to attract former Prime Minister Yevgeni Primakov back
to politics, ultimately as a consensus presidential candidate, and
on whether Luzhkov abandons his Kremlin ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   While the political elite awaited word from the enigmatic
Primakov, one clear fact emerged: The Kremlin is rapidly losing its
influence over the flow of events.
</P>
<P>
   ``With each passing day, power is slipping from the Kremlin,''
said Vladimir Ryzhkov, a rising star in Our Home Is Russia, a party
created in 1995 under the aegis of the Kremlin and which is openly
weighing an offer to join the Fatherland coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts even compared the situation to the events of 1990
and 1991, when President Mikhail Gorbachev saw his influence being
trampled underfoot as the political establishment rushed to throw
its weight onto a bandwagon for Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   The collapse of the Soviet Union brought that shift to a
historic conclusion, leaving Yeltsin the undisputed leader of a
newly sovereign Russia. This time, the landscape is undergoing
another upheaval, with regional governors, many of whom lord over
parts of this vast country like small-time czars, cast in the role
of kingmakers.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of influence may be the usual fate for lame-duck
presidents elsewhere. But in Russia, where no leader has ever
relinquished power in an orderly constitutional transition,
Yeltsin's ability to handle such a humiliation is being sorely
tested.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers feverishly reviewed the Kremlin's options, among them
a continuation of low-intensity warfare against Luzhkov, an
erstwhile ally of Yeltsin and now an open foe, through the use of
the media, scarce budget resources or `kompromat,' the infamous
Russian word for leaking damaging information.
</P>
<P>
   Some predicted that the Kremlin might cast about for a
scapegoat, with the prime candidates being either Aleksandr
Voloshin, Yeltsin's abrasive chief of staff, who has for weeks led
an ugly war against pro-Luzhkov newspapers and television stations,
or even Prime Minister Sergei Stepashin, who after four months on
the job has proved to be a weak political player, and an
increasingly implausible standard-bearer for Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   Other options might be more radical, like an attempt to delay or
call off the Parliamentary elections. Sergei Zverev, a former
Kremlin aide freshly dismissed from his position in another round
of palace intrigue, openly raised that possibility at a news
conference this week, warning that if Yeltsin declared an all-out
war against the new alliance, that could lead to ``disastrous
consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts tend to rule out any unconstitutional moves by
Yeltsin, who, they point out, is acutely mindful of his historical
legacy. ``He is capable of such things, but they are unlikely,''
Sergei Markov, director of the Institute of Political Studies,
said. ``Yeltsin wants to go into history textbooks as the one who
established democratic institutions in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Kremlin will try to be active but this activity will be
defensive. Yeltsin is no longer leading the country. He is leading
the Kremlin against the country.''
</P>
<P>
   A final alternative would leave Yeltsin to find ways to
accommodate, or maybe infiltrate, the emerging alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Such an alliance leaves open the question of how easily Luzhkov
would abandon his presidential ambitions in favor of Primakov. But
judging from Luzhkov's open-ended offer to the former prime
minister, that is an issue that the mayor is willing to leave
unresolved for now.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Primakov has remained ambiguously silent, except
to welcome the alliance and, in a strong hint of his future role,
to stress that it should not be seen as an ``anti-president'
coalition.
</P>
<P>
   The source of Primakov's popularity, reflected in polls that
show him as Russia's most trusted politician, lies as much in his
cautious soothing manner as in his political views, which remain
something of a mystery. In his eight months as prime minister,
Primakov, a former diplomat and wily survivor of the Soviet regime,
delivered on a promise of political stability, won in large part
through the appeasement of Yeltsin's Communist opposition in the
Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   By discharging Primakov in May and subsequently squashing a
Communist-led impeachment drive, Yeltsin succeeded in weakening his
Communist opponents, depriving them of badly need links to the
central government.
</P>
<P>
   These victories were a reminder of Yeltsin's mastery of Russian
politics and of the power that continues to cling to his office.
But, Markov said, they have proved Pyrrhic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like the Roman general Pyrrhus,'' he said, ``they won battle
after battle. But in the end, they have no army.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   According to newspaper reports, Yeltsin made a series of
attempts to wield his personal influence. He met this week
privately with Mintimir Shaimiyev, a leader of the All Russia group
and all-powerful governor of the oil-rich Tatarstan region, trying
unsuccessfully to dissuade him from an alliance with Luzhkov.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin also met former Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, head
of the Our Home Is Russia Party, reportedly to try to persuade him
to head an alternative bloc that would include Right Cause and
other right-wing parties made up of liberal reformers. According to
one newspaper report, Chernomyrdin, whom Yeltsin ousted as prime
minister last year, declined, although by late Friday his party did
open consultations with Right Cause, as well as Fatherland _ All
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Stepashin, in an interview Friday in Izvestia, insisted that the
government had to stay neutral to assure free and fair
Parliamentary elections. Already, he said, ``the fight for power
has heated up so much that it may turn the political arena into a
heap of ashes.''
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are high, Stepashin added. Intervention by the
government ``would mean not only the collapse of the government or
some party or other,'' he said. ``It would be the collapse of
Russia's efforts to become a modern, prosperous country. The
biggest banana republic in the world, and one without bananas at
that _ that is not an enviable fate.''

BURNED BY GOLD? CONSIDER A HEDGER

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 8)  
 (af)  
 By RICHARD A. APPEL Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anglogold Ltd. produces about 10 percent of the world's gold,
but the yellow metal may not be its most valuable asset.
</P>
<P>
   While gold prices continue to slide, Anglogold, the giant South
African miner, has posted respectable earnings by hedging, or
agreeing ahead of time to sell production at set prices that are
higher than current ones.
</P>
<P>
   Jewelry makers and other gold consumers take the other side of
these contracts to insure a future flow of gold at reasonable
prices _ even if that means passing up cheaper metal today in the
spot market.
</P>
<P>
   In the first half of the year, forward contracts enabled
Anglogold to sell its gold at $312 an ounce, 11 percent higher than
average market prices. Another big hedger, Barrick Gold, has sold
three years of future production at $385 an ounce _ enough to
generate hundreds of millions of dollars of added earnings for the
Canadian miner if prices stay close to the current $256.
</P>
<P>
   Hedging has become the most important factor in the relative
success of gold companies in recent years. Those that have hedged
extensively, like Barrick and Anglogold, have seen their stock
prices hold fairly steady. But those that have not, including
Newmont Mining and Homestake Mining, have suffered, as falling spot
prices _ pushed lower, in part, by other companies' hedging _ have
hurt earnings.
</P>
<P>
   In all, about 3,000 tons, or slightly more than what is
excavated worldwide in a year, is sold forward through contracts,
put options or other derivatives, analysts say. They predict that
an additional few hundred tons could be sold forward this year.
</P>
<P>
   The practice has become so widespread that it makes proposed
gold sales by central banks look like peanuts. The market-roiling
proposal by the International Monetary Fund to sell gold supplies
to finance debt relief for Third World nations involved about 300
tons; that plan now appears dead.
</P>
<P>
   The summer's other shocker _ the Bank of England's plan to
auction more than half its bullion _ involves 415 metric tons over
several years.
</P>
<P>
   Partially because of hedging, Barrick, the second-biggest North
American producer, now has a stock market value of nearly $7.6
billion. Newmont and Homestake _ Nos. 1 and 4, respectively _ mine
almost two times as much gold but their total market capitalization
is two-thirds that of Barrick.
</P>
<P>
   There is a lesson here: Investors who bet on a gold rebound
should know exactly what type of producer they are investing in.
</P>
<P>
   Want to roll the dice? An unhedged producer will get the biggest
pop from a rally. When gold surged 10 percent late last fall,
Newmont shares doubled in value in five weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Not so bullish? Hedged producers may fare better. Since the Bank
of England's announcement in early May, which has helped push gold
prices down 13 percent, Newmont's stock has lost almost 27 percent
of its value, far more than Barrick's.
</P>
<P>
   Gold pessimists note that the huge stocks of official reserves _
estimated at 33,000 metric tons _ mean that the spot-market price
will always be subject to rumors of central bank selling. While the
actual sale of gold by Britain is too small to hurt market
liquidity, more serious ``was the signal sent out by the sale,
which was very damaging to the market,'' said Hester le Roux, an
analyst at Gold Fields Mineral Services, a gold industry researcher
in London.
</P>
<P>
   But gold bugs believe that the metal has become seriously
oversold. The Asian economic recovery has spurred demand there,
while the supply of scrap gold that flooded the market last year is
expected to fall by several hundred tons this year.
</P>
<P>
   They also note that Anglogold announced last week that it would
not enter into new forward contracts, citing expectations that
prices have likely bottomed.
</P>
<P>
   Investors of that persuasion may find some gold company stocks
more appealing than bullion anyway. A few years ago, the stocks
traded at several times the earnings multiple of the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500-stock index, but now even a few analysts' favorites
trade at discounts to the index.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Wiskemann, portfolio manager at the Franklin Gold fund,
said gold prices could move higher because of inflation, a crisis,
or other ``events we cannot foresee.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People will become panicky,'' he said, ``and they will want to
own the yellow metal again.''

WOMAN WINS $23.36 MILLION IN FEN-PHEN LAWSUIT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (REPEATING to add byline)  (yn) 
 By JIM YARDLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ In the first verdict from among thousands of cases
pending across the country against makers of the diet pills
popularly known as fen-phen, an east Texas jury Friday awarded
$23.36 million to a woman who said she suffered heart damage after
taking the drugs to lose weight.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Debbie Stone Lovett, 36, a manicurist from Grand
Saline, Tex., had accused Madison, N.J.-based pharmaceutical giant
American Home Products Corp. and its subsidiary Wyeth-Ayerst
Laboratories of failing to warn their customers and doctors that
the diet pills caused heart valve damage.
</P>
<P>
   The judgment is the latest setback for American Home Products,
which settled a similar case in Houston in June for a reported $6
million and faces a massive class-action lawsuit over the diet
pills that began jury selection this week in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiffs' lawyers said Friday's verdict in Van Zandt County,
about 50 miles southeast of Dallas, is particularly significant
because American Home Products, which had settled several cases out
of court, decided that the facts in the Lovett case favored the
company. ``This is a case that American Home Products chose,'' said
Kip Petroff, a lead lawyer for Ms. Lovett who is also trying more
than 100 similar cases across the nation. ``They were very arrogant
and very confident they were going to win this one.''
</P>
<P>
   Several Wall Street analysts expressed surprise at the verdict
and predicted it would encourage more lawsuits against the company,
particularly since American Home Products appeared to have solid
evidence that Ms. Lovett's heart condition existed before her use
of the diet drugs. She used the drugs on and off for six months
beginning in October 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Schick, a lawyer for American Home Products, said it would
appeal the ruling. ``We feel the evidence presented in this case
demonstrated that the company acted responsibly and lawfully in
marketing and monitoring the safety of the diet drug Pondimin,''
Schick said in a statement released by the company.
</P>
<P>
   In September 1997, American Home Products removed the two diet
pills, fenfluramine and dexfenfluramine, which were marketed as
Pondimin and Redux, off the shelves at the request of the Food and
Drug Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Two months later, federal health officials advised the estimated
1.2 million to 4.7 million people in the United States who used the
drugs to seek medical checkups after studies linked them to heart
valve damage.
</P>
<P>
   Petroff said American Home Products had commissioned studies
that encouraged consumers to take Pondimin and Redux in combination
with phentermine, the other half of fen-phen, to achieve long-term
weight loss.
</P>
<P>
   Phentermine, which is distributed but not manufactured by
American Home Products, has never been associated with the same
health problems when taken alone and remains on the market. Though
the FDA had approved all three drugs for use alone as weight-loss
drugs, many doctors followed the advice of the company and
prescribed them in an unapproved fen-phen combination.
</P>
<P>
   In the Texas case, the jury of eight men and four women awarded
Ms. Lovett $3.3 million in compensatory damages and $20 million in
punitive damages. Her lawyers argued that Ms. Lovett developed
leaky heart valves after taking Pondimin in combination with
phentermine for weight loss. But Ms. Lovett's own cardiologist
testified that her heart problems predated her use of fen-phen.
Petroff, however, said that even if she had been sick before taking
the drugs, the company's failure to alert physicians and consumers
to the risks of the pills placed his client in further danger.
</P>
<P>
   ``They clearly made a statement that they were mad at
somebody,'' said Patrick J. Spruiell, another lawyer for Ms.
Lovett, speaking of the jury. ``It appeared to me they wanted to
get AHP's attention. They obviously did that with this verdict.''
</P>
<P>
   The tide of litigation against the company will apparently keep
growing. Petroff said he will begin another lawsuit two weeks from
now in Ft. Worth, Tex., while the class-action lawsuit brought by
three New Jersey women began this week. Tommy Fibich, a Houston
lawyer involved in 160 cases, estimated that the number of lawsuits
against the company has grown from 3,100 to more than 10,000 in
recent weeks.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Texas verdict exacerbates an already trying summer for
American Home Products, the world's seventh-largest drug maker.
Last month, federal officials pulled the company's Rotavirus
vaccine from the market because of health concerns.
</P>
<P>
   In June, the company announced that its second quarter earnings
would not meet analysts' expectations, a disastrous performance in
an environment of robust drug sales. Last year, the company was the
subject of two failed megamergers, first with SmithKline Beecham
and later with Monsanto.
</P>
<P>
   In trading Friday on the New York Stock Exchange, American Home
Products' stock plunged 11.9 percent, or $6.0625 a share, to
$44.875.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers and analysts disagreed about the significance of the
ruling. Fibich described the Lovett case as relatively weak,
particularly since Ms. Lovett had not suffered as greatly as other
users of fen-phen. ``If that case can be won, that tells me almost
any case can be won,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Neil Sweig, a pharmaceutical analyst with Ryan, Beck,
Southeast Research in New York, said analysts have begun to warn
investors not to overreact to American Home Products' problems.
When the problems with fen-phen surfaced in 1997, analysts
predicted that the company faced liabilities of as much as $5
billion.

SPORTS COLUMN: OZZIE NEWSOME HAS MADE IT, AND YET MORE NEEDS
DOING  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ala., Ohio, Md., Texas, Mass.)   By THOMAS GEORGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CANTON, Ohio _ Ozzie Newsome was born in Muscle Shoals, Ala., in
1956, early enough to pick cotton as a youth and to watch everyone
nearby tend his own garden and harvest his own food. Back then in
Muscle Shoals, any type of work at the local Ford plant was the
dream job.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get a job at Ford,'' Newsome said, ``and you've made it.''
</P>
<P>
   Newsome did. While playing football for Bear Bryant at Alabama
during the fall of 1974 through 1977, Newsome would work summers at
Ford back home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worked with hot metal, lava, in a big bin,'' he said. ``I
worked with the lava to make molds for pistons. I had to make sure
the bins didn't overflow. I did it for a while and then they got
concerned about me doing that type of work with my hands, so then I
moved on to other things there.''
</P>
<P>
   Even then, all could see that Newsome possessed magnificent
hands. Special ones. Newsome knew it, too, and so did Bryant,
because he always said of Newsome, ``He can catch a BB in the
dark.''
</P>
<P>
   Let alone footballs.
</P>
<P>
   Catch them he did, in big games at Alabama and then in big ones
in the National Football League. Newsome would play 13 Cleveland
Browns seasons, catch more passes (662) than any other tight end in
pro football history, grab passes in 150 consecutive games, play in
198 professional games and become a Browns team captain in a career
that ended in 1990. At 6 feet 2 inches and 225 pounds, he helped
reinvent the position by showing how tight ends could not only
block but could also catch the ball frequently and as a deep
threat.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday Newsome _ along with Eric Dickerson, Tom Mack, Billy
Shaw and Lawrence Taylor _ will become enshrined here at the Pro
Football Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   You get into this place and you've made it.
</P>
<P>
   This week of ceremonies leading to Saturday's induction has
allowed Newsome to reflect on his sacrifice, how he emerged from
the pack, and to remember teammates and family. He is the third of
five children. His brothers, Willie and Thomas, will be here, and
so will his sisters, Gloria and Sheila, and his wife, Gloria, and
his 7-year-old son, Thomas. His mother, Ethel, 76, will be present.
That means a lot to Newsome.
</P>
<P>
   So does his new challenge, building the Baltimore Ravens into
champions. Newsome is the Ravens' vice president for player
personnel, an encompassing and powerful job. Newsome and Bobby
Grier of the New England Patriots are the only two
African-Americans with such complete authority in NFL club
personnel matters.
</P>
<P>
   In a league where nearly 70 percent of the players are
African-American, only Newsome and Grier have been granted this
opportunity. More programs are in place around the league to
improve the numbers of African-American executives, but only when
men of sterling vision and scope like Art Modell and Robert K.
Kraft, owners of the Ravens and the Patriots, respectively, make
the move, take the risk, give African-Americans a shot, will the
numbers improve.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, Newsome knows that though he has made it, he is still
being evaluated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been evaluated all of my life, even though now my job is
one of constant evaluation,'' he said. ``There are blacks out
there, former players and others, willing to climb their way up. A
lot of people, owners included, are looking to see how I do. I am
being compared closely with my peers.''
</P>
<P>
   That is fine with Newsome. There are more sacrifices to make,
more challenges to emerge from the pack.
</P>
<P>
   Newsome was appointed to his current job by Modell when the
Cleveland Browns moved to Baltimore in 1996. Now that the new
Browns begin play against the Dallas Cowboys in the Hall of Fame
preseason game here on Monday night, the resentment in this area of
the old team's moving is beginning to fade. Newsome expects cheers
from the slew of Browns fans attending Saturday's ceremonies. He
also expects boos.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up as a Cleveland Brown,'' he said, ``and when I left
with Art, I could understand the fans' passion. But the people
should know that I'll always be No. 82 and a Cleveland Brown. No
matter how many boos are there, my mom will be there, and that is
what matters most to me. Now that is a lady who knows something
about sacrifice. I am the product of a lot of prayers that lady has
made for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Ozzie Newsome has made it _ for now.
</P>
<P>
   But there is more to mold. &QL;

GRAND CANYON GATEWAY PLAN WINS FOREST SERVICE APPROVAL
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK SHAFFER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLAGSTAFF, Ariz. _ Ending nearly a decade of studies and
suspense, the U.S. Forest Service on Friday said it will allow a
massive land trade with developers who plan to build a new tourist
gateway community for the next century at Grand Canyon National
Park.
</P>
<P>
   Canyon Forest Village of Scotts dale will receive 282 acres of
prime National Forest land adjacent to the park's main entrance.
The land is just north of Tusayan, an existing collection of hotels
and restaurants whose developers opposed the land trade in favor of
expanding their own townsite.
</P>
<P>
   For giving up what some have called the most valuable real
estate in northern Arizona, the Forest Service will receive 2,118
acres of private lands controlled by Canyon Forest Village that are
scattered among 12 sites within the adjacent Kaibab National
Forest.
</P>
<P>
   Eleanor Towns, Southwest re gional forester for the Forest Serv
ice, said the land trade will eliminate private inholdings - many
of them former frontier ranches - within the forest, while
maximizing the Grand Canyon experience for the park's nearly 5
million annual visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Towns predicted that Canyon Forest Village will ``better serve
the tourists ..., protect the forest's and park's natural
resources, and ... make living more affordable and bearable for the
local workers who stoke this region's economic engine, the Grand
Canyon.''
</P>
<P>
   However, there are more govern ment hurdles ahead for Canyon
Forest Village, and their opponents promise a fight to the finish.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Lopez, a Flagstaff city councilman who heads a group
opposed to Canyon Forest Village, said the Forest Service decision
will be appealed within the 45-day window allowed by federal guide
lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's face it, the ball has been rolling downhill all the way
from Washington in favor of this,'' Lopez said. ``That hill has
just gotten steeper for us. But we can delay it for a considerable
amount of time and that's what we plan to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt served for a brief time as a
consultant to Canyon Forest Village before his appointment to the
Clin ton administration in 1993. The Interior Secretary has recused
him self from all matters concerning the Canyon Forest Village
decision.
</P>
<P>
   If the Forest Service doesn't reverse its decision, Lopez said,
opponents would file lawsuits against it, challenging how the
decision was made and how the agency came up with its appraisals of
the lands to be exchanged. The Forest Service appraised the 282
acres it plans to give away at $5.4 million, and the 2,118 acres
wants at $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy they got to appraise it came from Texas. He doesn't
know anything about Arizona land val ues,'' Lopez said. ``Anyone
who knows anything about that knows that land just outside the
Canyon is worth more than $5 million.''
</P>
<P>
   If appeals and lawsuits don't work, Lopez said, his group is
prepared to bring the matter to vote via a public referendum.
County officials said nearly 1,500 voter signatures would bring the
matter to the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Coconino County Supervisor Paul Babbitt, a brother of the
Interior Secretary, said he expects a grueling battle for approval
before both the county's planning and zoning com mission and Board
of Supervisors, which he estimates will take a year.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Babbitt said he isn't worried about the fears among those
in the hospitality industry in Flagstaff and Williams that more
hotels and businesses near the Grand Canyon will have a devastating
economic impact on them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm more concerned about the continued degradation of the
park, and the lack of facilities and infrastructure there,'' Paul
Babbitt said. ``There's more than enough business for everybody if
they all plow their share of the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Former U.S. Rep. Karan English, co-chairperson of the Coalition
for the Canyon's Future, which favors Canyon Forest Village, said
the county was going to be facing more problems than how to handle
Can yon Forest Village. The 50-mile corridor of Arizona 64 between
Williams and the Grand Canyon is strung with other parcels of devel
opable land.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an abundance of private land all up and down the
highway, and this going to spur development all over. The county
has to keep a handle on that,'' English said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Canyon Forest Village plan, 1,220 hotel rooms will be
built on 282 acres of land it swaps for from the Forest Service,
just outside the pay station leading to the Canyon's South Rim.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange, the Forest Service receives 12 private inholdings
total ling 2,118 acres, which the Canyon Forest Village group had
earlier purchased.
</P>
<P>
   Canyon Forest Village's Tom De Paolo has pledged that the
project will use state-of-the art energy and water conservation and
materials recycling techniques in the develop ment of hotels,
270,000 square feet of retail space and 1,100 housing units for
local employees only. None of the housing will be available for
purchase on the general commercial market.
</P>
<P>
   The project includes 20,000 square feet of retail space for
Native American merchants, and 29 acres dedicated to Flagstaff's
Museum of Northern Arizona for a visitor-ori entation center about
the history of the Colorado Plateau.
</P>
<P>
   Local and national environmental groups backed the Canyon Forest
Village project, except the Sierra Club, which has concerns about
groundwater depletion in the canyon area.
</P>
<P>
   The Havasupai and Hopi tribes have blessed the Canyon Forest
Village project, mainly because it will not harm the canyon's
springs, some of which feed the canyon's largest waterfalls.
</P>
<P>
   Canyon Forest Village will have all its water transported from
the community of Topock on the Colo rado River, except during what
the Forest Service called ``emergency situations'' like wildfires
threatening the Tusayan area. But groundwater will be pumped,
temporarily, during construction of the project.
</P>
<P>
   Hopi Chairman Wayne Taylor Jr. said the concern about water on
the part of the developers earned his tribe's blessing for the
project.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice that we will have our craftsmen employed in the
retail area,'' Taylor said. ``But the key issue was that our sacred
springs be respected, and we're satisfied that they have.''
</P>
<P>
   Dave Simon of the National Park and Conservation Association,
called Canyon Forest Village the ``green alternative'' for accommo
dating the growing number of Grand Canyon visitors expected in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a rare environmental suc cess; a victory of long-term
conser vation vision over misinformation (and) jealous economic
self-inter est,'' Simon said.
</P>
<P>
   The first part of the development is expected to be completed
two years after final approval from the county, and the entire
project should be finished in four years after county approval.
</P>
<P>
   The FaeX plan pushed by Tu sayan business owners called for the
construction of 400 new hotel rooms and 250,000 square feet of
retail space along with an undeter mined number of housing units.

GIANTS' STAR PICK OF '96 FINALLY GETS CHANCE TO SHINE 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The Giants' first pick in the 1996 draft was the
fifth over all, the highest the team had selected in 15 years. They
chose defensive end Cedric Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Jones has had three career starts. While others in
the draft taken above and below him _ Keyshawn Johnson, Terry
Glenn, Simeon Rice, Eddie George, Terry Glenn, John Mobley and
Kevin Hardy _ have fashioned notable careers, Jones has 29 tackles
under his belt.
</P>
<P>
   But barring injury, the semi-anonymous portion of Jones'
National Football League experience is about to end.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, 25, has been anointed the Giants' right defensive end,
replacing Chad Bratzke, who left as a free agent to join the
Indianapolis Colts. Since Jones will play opposite the Pro Bowl
left defensive end Michael Strahan, there will be no hiding Jones _
he will see plenty of running plays and screen passes to his side
of the field.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Jim Fassel admits this situation might have made him
nervous two years ago. But last season, Fassel and his coaches
believe, they saw something different in Jones. And as it became
obvious the Giants probably would not be able to afford Bratzke, at
the same time, the Giants became comfortable that Jones would be
his replacement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not worried about that being an exploited position,''
Fassel said Friday of his right defensive end. ``I don't see it as
a weak spot. I wouldn't be as sure if this was Cedric Jones two
years ago, but he's made a turnaround. He's quick and explosive
now.''
</P>
<P>
   The turnaround came when Fassel's staff asked Jones to do the
opposite of what the former coach Dan Reeves' staff had been asking
him to do. Jones was told to put on weight when he arrived, which
was late in the 1996 training camp after a lengthy holdout.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, whose playing weight at Oklahoma University was about 270
pounds, got as high as 285 pounds. The idea was that the added
weight would make Jones more formidable when he went against
310-pound tackles. Instead, it appeared to make him slower. Also,
he had leg injuries in each of his first two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Fassel's coaches saw Jones play at 285 for parts of the 1997
season and decided he might be better, and quicker, at a lower
weight. By last season, Jones was closer to 275, and he had his
best season as a Giant.
</P>
<P>
   He recorded his first NFL sack in the team's fourth game and
three more later. He separated from blocks more effectively and was
more fluid running down ball carriers. His pass rushing forced two
fumbles, including one when he sacked Arizona's Jake Plummer. Jones
recovered the fumble, and the turnover set up the go-ahead
touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   In Jones' case, smaller does appear to be better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had my doubts about it all along,'' Jones said of the advice
to gain weight in 1996. ``But they're the coaches and you do what
they want. We tried it and it didn't work out.''
</P>
<P>
   He was aware that Fassel's staff did not know what to make of
him when they arrived in 1997. ``I hadn't played much so they had
nothing to watch of me on film,'' he said. ``It was going to take
time to gain their trust and confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   He has earned that, something made obvious when the Giants did
not pursue another defensive end when Bratzke departed. Giants
management made up its mind to give the job to Jones last season as
the team watched his impact on games become more significant.
</P>
<P>
   So now, three and a half years after Jones was the fifth player
taken, he is entering a season as a starter for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think of it as a landmark accomplishment or
anything,'' Jones said. ``But it is an opportunity I haven't had
before. All I have to do is start making plays and people will
start saying, `I knew he could do that all along.'''

   KASIGLUK, Alaska _ Crisscrossing the vast gray-green tundra of
southwestern Alaska, the bush pilots of Yukon Aviation fly high
school teams to games, shoppers to the market, patients to
hospitals, jurors to court, criminals to prison, dead people in
body bags to the coroner.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's the pizza.
</P>
<P>
   The cellular phone call came in a few weeks ago from a famished
surveying crew out in the bush near Napaskiak, unreachable by any
road but just a seven-minute flight across the Kuskokwim River from
Yukon Aviation's base in Bethel, which also happens to have a pizza
parlor.
</P>
<P>
   The cost for a dozen large pies plus air transport was $237,
recalled J.J. Taylor, a bearded 60-year-old pilot for the company.
The pizza was still hot when it was delivered to camp, near the
gravel-strip runway at Napaskiak. ``Domino's ain't got nothin' on
Yukon Aviation,'' said Taylor, with evident pride. Still, he didn't
get a tip.
</P>
<P>
   Far more than in any other state, airplane travel is a way of
life in Alaska, which has the most pilots per capita (six times the
national average), and the most planes (16 times the average),
according to the Federal Aviation Administration. A third of
Alaska's population has no access to the state's roadway system,
meaning their communities are reachable only by airplane or boat.
</P>
<P>
   And so bush pilots like the four men who fly for Yukon act as
virtual taxi drivers in the sky, hopping over the kettle ponds and
grassland of the tundra to deliver people for reasons sometimes
critical, and often mundane.
</P>
<P>
   But if airplane travel is an everyday and necessary affair in
Alaska, it is also a dangerous one. And while state and federal
authorities have launched a campaign this year to equip bush pilots
with better navigational aids and weather reporting, they and the
pilots themselves say there are huge obstacles to cutting accident
rates that routinely run two to four times the average, per flying
hour, than elsewhere in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The safety problems are due partly to the rugged terrain and
harsh weather, and partly to the ramshackle conditions and lack of
navigating equipment at the ubiquitous dirt-strip runways in the
Alaskan bush country. But they may also be due to what a National
Transportation Safety Board report on aviation safety in Alaska
once termed ``the bush syndrome.''
</P>
<P>
   The syndrome, which many Alaska bush pilots dismiss as a term
coined by bureaucrats who have no concept of the realities and
pressures of flying in the bush, was defined as ``an attitude of
air taxi operators, pilots and passengers ranging from their casual
acceptance of risks to their willingness to take unwarranted
risks.''
</P>
<P>
   That 1995 study and subsequent surveys of the accident rates
have sparked a series of recommendations to improve flying safety
here in the Last Frontier, only a fraction of which have been
implemented.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Aviation Administration is in the midst of a
three-year, $11 million test project in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta
that will put new display equipment in the cockpits of many air
taxis here. Known as the Capstone Program, it will give pilots much
more detailed information about weather conditions and the location
of other airplanes in the area. They eventually hope to bring to
the great majority of planes.
</P>
<P>
   But even those in charge of safety acknowledge that it is only a
start, and weather reports are still often shared, not always
reliably, via word-of-mouth.
</P>
<P>
   ```Oh, you can see as far as you can see,''' recalled Cindy
Andrecheck, co-owner and dispatcher for Yukon Aviation. ``That's an
actual weather report from Hooper Bay I got on the telephone one
day.''
</P>
<P>
   And the cost of the recommended improvements to runways, many so
short that they leave little or no margin for a landing error,
remains steep. Alaska has more than 1,100 ``designated landing
areas,'' only 285 of which are public airports, according to Paul
Bowers, director of Alaska's statewide aviation division. That
figure doesn't include beaches, many of which are legal to land on
but not exactly conducive to a smooth landing.
</P>
<P>
   The delta region here is particularly reliant on air transport,
because many communities are inland and nowhere near any roads that
could bring people to Bethel, which is something of a regional hub,
with 25 landing strips within a roughly 40-mile radius. Rivers can
be navigated by snowmobile or even trucks in the winter and boat
during the summer, but during ``break-up'' and ``freeze-up,'' the
times of the year _ several weeks each spring and fall _ in which
the ice melts or forms, airplanes are the only way in or out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We help people do just about everything you can think of,''
said Ms. Andrecheck. Dogs, too: one of her pilots recently took a
man and his dog all the way to a veterinarian Anchorage, a $1,000
trip, and last year another pilot brought a planeload of dogs out
for the Kuskokwim 300, an annual sled race.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not some sensational thing,'' she added, with a shrug.
``This is life as we live it.''
</P>
<P>
   The travel is expensive, with rates of $150 per hour and up, but
not prohibitively so. Many trips, from villages such as the Yup'ik
Eskimo community of Kasigluk to Bethel, take 10 minutes or less.
</P>
<P>
   There is clearly some sort of disconnect between federal
regulators and the bush pilots themselves over the idea of a ``bush
syndrome,'' as many pilots here contend that what bureaucrats see
as risks are also vital missions.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``We have people calling up who are in labor, and you have to
get there,'' said 24-year-old Daryl Smith, a Yup'ik Eskimo who has
already flown three such women from Yup'ik villages to the hospital
in Bethel during his three years as a Yukon pilot. ``I just wanted
to get them there. What I was really scared about was that they
might have a baby in the airplane.''
</P>
<P>
   Veterans such as Taylor contend that if a bush pilot knows what
he is doing, flying in Alaska is actually safer than flying in the
Lower 48.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a lot more comfortable here in the wide open spaces,''
contended Taylor, who has 42 years of experience flying small
planes, starting as a crop-duster in the Midwest but eventually
gravitating to the Alaskan tundra. ``There are a whole lot more
places to land, actually. You might ding up your airplane, but
you'll be OK.''
</P>
<P>
   He has been OK, but when pressed, he can tick off the names of
23 friends and acquaintances in the business who have been killed
in flying accidents over the years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure there's risk,'' he said. ``Statistically, I'd be crazy to
deny that. But there's risk everywhere. I still say you're safer
here.'' With that, a call came in to the Yukon dispatcher, Ms.
Andrecheck, from a woman in the village of Nunapitchuk who wanted
to take her father to the hospital in Bethel.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, Nunapitchuk, we'll be there in 15 minutes,'' said Ms.
Andrecheck. Taylor hopped into his red Cessna Skyhawk, maneuvered
onto the runway behind a cargo plane flown by Arctic Circle Air,
and took off.
</P>
<P>
   The sky was clear, but the weather can quickly turn ferocious
here. The safety improvements are intended to at least cut in half
the number of flying accidents in Alaska, said Jim LaBelle, state
director for the NTSB. The average now is about 170 accidents a
year, and 40 fatalities, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the process is expensive and other moves, such as much
stricter regulatory standards that the FAA set last year for
hunting and fishing guides who fly clients to remote locations,
have met bitter opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a tedious process, it is a slow process, and much of it
has yet to bear fruit,'' said LaBelle.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the bush pilots fly on much as they always have, and
they are clearly a big part of the state lore. ``Alaska and
aviation were made for each other,'' wrote Joe Rychetnik, a former
state trooper and reporter, in his book ``Alaska's Sky Follies: The
Funny Side of Flying in the Far North'' (Epicenter Press, 1995).
``Bush pilots _ with usually a meager financial investment but with
200 percent of their energy and courage _ soon became the binding
sinew of the vast territory.''
</P>
<P>
   They still are, all the way down to food deliveries. As Ms.
Andrecheck said, there wasn't much of an alternative for the
surveyors craving their pizza.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess they could have gotten it by boat, down the Kuskokwim
River. But then the pizzas would have arrived cold. And wet. And
late.''

ADDS ART AVAILABILITY TO SLUGLINE  
 CELEBRATING IN A BIG WAY _ CRUISING TO MEXICO ON SUPERLINER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JEFF LARSEN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For your first cruise you might think a smaller ship would be
better _ less intimidating, more intimate.
</P>
<P>
   Well, my wife, Trish, and I decided bigger might be better. So
to cruise to the Mexican Riviera to celebrate both our wedding
anniversary and her college graduation, we picked Carnival Cruise
Line's newest and biggest ship, the MS Elation.
</P>
<P>
   The giant ship, based in Los Angeles, first set sail last year
and is the seventh in a series of eight 70,000-ton superliners that
Carnival ordered. It can serve more than 2,000 passengers per trip
and has a crew of more than 900. Big is an understatement.
</P>
<P>
   After landing in Los Angeles, we were taken by bus to the ship's
moorage at San Pedro, where we quickly checked in at the terminal
and boarded the ship. Carnival agents assured us our bags would
arrive at our room just before or right after the ship was under
way.
</P>
<P>
   It was a little disconcerting when the ship set sail and one bag
hadn't arrived at our room. I fretted that a huge ship like that
wouldn't be easy to turn around to retrieve our bag, but it
eventually arrived as promised.
</P>
<P>
   We spent the first two days of the weeklong cruise sailing to
Puerta Vallarta. The day after that we sailed back up the coast for
a day in Mazatlan and then on to a five-hour visit to Cabo San
Lucas, a popular resort area on the tip of Baja California.
</P>
<P>
   Our upper-deck ocean-view room wasn't as small as we thought it
would be ... sparsely appointed, but comfortable. When we wandered
up on deck, we also discovered that the ship wasn't crowded with
tanned retirees spending their children's inheritance, as many
prospective cruise customers envision.
</P>
<P>
   The Elation is what Carnival Cruise Lines likes to call a ``Fun
Ship.'' That label obviously means fun for kids as well as
grown-ups.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the usual adult amenities such as bars, clubs, a casino,
workout areas, a jogging track, several Jacuzzis, restaurants and
entertainment centers, the company designed a 2,500-square-foot
``Children's World'' play area into the ship and has actively
solicited the growing family cruise trade.
</P>
<P>
   Once out of port, the first order of business was the mandatory
emergency life-raft drill, where passengers donned their life vests
and _ like a migrating herd _ stepped lively to the ship's muster
stations. Someone made cattle sounds during the drill, but
otherwise all passengers seemed to take it seriously.
(Surprisingly, later in the week the movie ``Titanic'' was shown.)
</P>
<P>
   Then the eating began. The food, no matter which dining area we
chose, was generally good. Pizza, served 24 hours a day, came in
handy between the regular meals.
</P>
<P>
   Trish particularly liked the soft ice cream and frozen yogurt
machines. I thought the juice maker was the most inventive machine
I've seen in a while. Just toss two unpeeled oranges down a funnel
and hold the glass under the spout and out came juice. Hey,
Carnival said it was a ``Fun Ship.''
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual sociological compatibility maneuver, Carnival
tries to match guests with like interests for the sit-down dinners
in two dining rooms, both with two seating times _ early and late.
</P>
<P>
   There are three sit-down dinner issues to consider:
</P>
<P>
   One: You're not required by laws of the open seas or Carnival to
eat the sit-down dinner every night. You can eat free pizza every
night if you like.
</P>
<P>
   Two: If you decide to attend the sit-down dinner every night,
you can change your seating assignment if you are unfortunate
enough to be seated with Homer Simpson and his family.
</P>
<P>
   And three: Even if you think you have already paid for it, the
sit-down dinner isn't exactly free. (I'll get to that later.)
</P>
<P>
   We lucked out and were seated with four very pleasant couples.
Two of them also were celebrating anniversaries. Be aware ... two
of the seven sit-down dinner nights require formal attire (dark
suit and tie for the men is OK).
</P>
<P>
   Elation passengers are encouraged to set their own onboard
activity schedules, and there is a long list of activities that
tries to cover most of the interests of the age groups represented
on the cruise.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the activities such as line-dance instruction and
aerobics are free. The list includes everything from bingo to
talent shows, singles parties, karaoke, disco dance lessons (ouch!)
and even a twist contest.
</P>
<P>
   We talked about hitting one of the singles parties to see if we
still
</P>
<P>
   had it after being married for 32 years, but decided to take a
nap in-
</P>
<P>
   stead.
</P>
<P>
   Mazatlan and Cabo San Lucas were a treat. Puerta Vallarta ...
ho-hum. And like the onboard activity list, we could choose from a
variety of different adventures such as snorkeling, golf and
sightseeing. Or we could just wing it on our own once we left the
ship.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the passengers we talked to agreed the five-hour stop at
Cabo San Lucas on the return leg of the cruise was too short.
</P>
<P>
   Now, why isn't the sit-down dinner free? You paid for it when
you paid for the cruise, right? Well Carnival Cruise Lines suggests
you tip practically anyone even remotely connected to your meal ...
and handsomely.
</P>
<P>
   The cruise line suggests you tip the table waiter, bus boy,
maitre'd and head waiter ... not just your waiter. For the table
waiter they suggest $3.50 per day per person, $2 per person per day
for the bus boy, and the sky's the limit for the maitre'd and the
head waiter. And cash only please.
</P>
<P>
   I was surprised we weren't asked to line up to pay the captain
as we left the ship.
</P>
<P>
   And when you get back to your room after handing out all that
cash at the final sit-down dinner, Carnival wants you to tip your
cabin steward as well _ in our case, someone we never even met _
$24.50 per person for the week.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, we slept well during our final night on board. We
were partly tanned, rested and ready to fly home. I was just glad
to we didn't have to tip the airline pilot, co-pilot and all the
flight attendants. I was out of cash.

 &HT;    In land of Giants, Baker stands tallest
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There would be no batting practice that day. And it
was Dusty Baker's fault. It happened in the early 70s, when Baker
was a kid in a Braves uniform and Hank Aaron's stomach was flat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I missed a cut-off man one day so we spent the whole practice
with cut-offs and relays,'' he said. ``Our team loved to hit so the
rest of practice, everybody's looking at me like I was a commie or
something. It was embarrassing.''
</P>
<P>
   It was also another lesson Baker filed away. No needless
embarrassment. (Following through, Baker won't even let on what
manager called off BP, though it was Eddie Mathews.) A living
collection of such lessons, Baker had never managed a game in his
life until San Francisco promoted him from batting coach in 1993,
choosing Baker to replace Roger Craig.
</P>
<P>
   What has ensued is an odd metamorphosis, front-office risk
begetting a two-time National League manager of the year. Baker's
wrist bands, the constant toothpick, the casual poses around the
dugout provide a false reading. Through Thursday, the Giants were
running 3 1/2 games behind Arizona in the NL West, running behind
all that high-financing with a banged-up roster. But out by the
Bay, they believe because Dusty has made them.
</P>
<P>
   Three times in his six years, the Giants have been alive for the
postseason on the last day of the season. Last season, after
slumping to four games back in the wild card race with six to play,
Baker's Giants rose from the dead to force a one game-playoff.
While Giants fans have come to expect such competitiveness, perhaps
his players have too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, Dusty doesn't have a doghouse,'' said general
manager Brian Sabean. ``He'll give somebody the third, fourth,
fifth try. He has a knack for judging people. And I think that
makes for a comfort zone.''
</P>
<P>
   This has not been an easy week for Baker. There is a differing
opinion within the organization on whether rookie Joe Nathan should
replace Mark Gardner (3-9, 6.87) in the rotation. During a stop in
Arizona before the Braves series, Baker had a sharp exchange with
Devil Rays manager Buck Showalter, who suggested the Giants were a
bit too proud for hanging on in the race despite injuries to, among
others, Barry Bonds, Jeff Kent, Ellis Burks _ merely the guts of
the club.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm tired of (Showalter) talking, to tell you the truth,''
Baker snapped.
</P>
<P>
   But it's August and the Giants as usual are right in the middle
of it. Deduct the injuries and this team has performed as most of
Baker's clubs: plenty of walks (462, third in the league), high
on-base percentage (.356, third) and plenty of scoring (5.4 runs a
game, fourth) with Bonds and Kent (on the DL) profiting from the
high on-base rate. These items reflect a game philosophy decades in
the making, as Baker solicited opinions from Aaron to Preston
Gomez, from Reggie Smith to Danny Ozark.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned from Tony La Russa to get your team prepared for
when they go out on the field, which he learned from Earl Weaver,''
Baker said. ``He also taught me to realize when the inning of
decision is, when to take the pitcher out, when to play the game
close, when to try to blow it open, how to get back into the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   To the front office, Baker's personality has helped define the
club's direction. With a restricted budget _ the Giants have yet to
ever spend as much as $50 million on payroll _ the team has been
able to successfully bring in second-tier talent to place around
Bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Kent arrived to break Rogers Hornsby's RBIs record for Giants
second basemen (128 last year). Marvin Benard, a .273 career
hitter, got off to .322 last year after Baker made him a leadoff
hitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``You really have to hand-pick who you're going to bring in,''
said Sabean. ``Guys do have to really want to play here, which puts
an emphasis on Dusty's relationship with the players. They know his
reputation as a player's manager, which really means he's going to
give everybody on the roster the chance to prove himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if he misses the cut-off man.

 &HT;    Brickyard grows in popularity
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ For a race only in its sixth year of existence,
the Brickyard 400 has quickly earned a permanent spot on the front
row of NASCAR's racing schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Indianapolis Motor Speedway, the most famous track in the world,
played host to its first Winston Cup race in 1994. Since then, the
Brickyard 400 has elevated to the point where its popularity is
only exceeded by the Daytona 500.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the beginning, we knew it would be a success,'' said Fred
Nation, IMS vice president of communications.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The track) is a special place, for motorsports fans of all
varieties. You can see that with the comments from the Winston Cup
drivers, and by the attitudes of the many fans that come here. They
view it as the shrine of motorsports.''
</P>
<P>
   Mystique surrounding the 2.5-mile oval track, which has been the
site of 83 runnings of the Indianapolis 500 and open-wheel racing
since 1909, seems to be the top attraction for the drivers. Dale
Jarrett, the leader in the points standings, paid the utmost
respect when discussing the possibility of winning today's 1 p.m.
race.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could almost stop racing after that,'' Jarrett said. ``It
doesn't matter what kind of car it's in. To me, what it's all about
is racing and winning at Indianapolis Motor Speedway. Obviously,
you want to win a lot of races, but if you could only win one, this
has got to be one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   An ever-growing purse is another reason for the Brickyard's
rapid popularity. Today's race will pay out around $6.2 million _
including an estimated $700,000 minimum to the winner _ trailing
only the Daytona 500 ($7.3 million) on the circuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It pays a lot,'' Mark Martin said. ``I've run third, fourth
and fifth here and when I finished fifth (in '95), I made more
money ($144,850) than I had ever won for winning any of my 30
races.''
</P>
<P>
   Winning the Brickyard 400 will result in instant fame, attested
by three-time Winston Cup champion Jeff Gordon. The No. 24 Chevy
driver first made a name for himself nationally by taking the
checkered flag at the inaugural race.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like your career is complete if you win at the
Brickyard,'' Ricky Rudd said. ``I'm always being introduced as the
'97 Brickyard 400 winner.''

 &HT;    Rider to Hawks: `I've changed'
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If he is feeling the jet lag from the long flight
east, Isaiah Rider isn't showing it on a sun-splashed Georgia
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   No, he is as cool as the diamond-encrusted watch on his right
wrist, the diamond-encrusted bracelet on his left wrist, the
diamond-encrusted crucifix that rests against the simplicity of his
NBA Players Association T-shirt and the diamond stud in his left
ear lobe. With all that ice, a man would have to be chilling.
</P>
<P>
   Rider is in town to take his physical so the trade that brought
him to Atlanta with Jim Jackson can be stamped official. He passed.
</P>
<P>
   He also is in town to face the media so he can repair the
bad-boy image that followed him from Alameda, Calif., to Las Vegas
to Minneapolis to Portland and now Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the fact that he owned up to his mistakes and he didn't
try to make excuses when we met today,'' coach Lenny Wilkens said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him, 'Hey, you start over with me. It's a clean slate.
You follow the rules here, you've got no problems with me.'''
</P>
<P>
   Wilkens also said,''I love his talent.''
</P>
<P>
   No one's walking away from the guy's talent, certainly not
Rider. ``The question's never been about my play, and I'm more
professional now. I demand double teams, and I'll kill you if you
go one on one with me,'' he said, laughing only a little because he
means it.
</P>
<P>
   The Eastern Conference better watch out, he said: ``A lot of
guys I want to knock off the pedestal.''
</P>
<P>
   Rider said he will confine his mistakes to the basketball court.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm 28 and I've learned some lessons,'' Rider said. ``I won't
make the same mistakes at 28 that I made at 23. This is my seventh
year in he NBA. I'm more mature now, more professional.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Rider was arrested twice in June, prompting a trade to
Portland in July, when he called the move his ``opportunity of a
lifetime.'' Then he missed exhibition games and was arrested for
marijuana possession. He also had 12 single-game suspensions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've changed,'' he said. Events were blown out of proportion
``that made me appear to be an animal or not an intellectual, that
discredited my family,'' he said. ``Bottom line is I made my
mistakes, but I don't want to dwell on the negative. Those things
are behind me.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point during the news conference, he prompted the media
to ask him some more questions so he could clear the slate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like this team was a little reserved at times, laid
back,'' he said. ``So I'm going to bring that (enthusiasm). I'm
gonna jump up; I'm gonna high-five. I think that's how you get a
relationship. They're gonna be excited about J.R. Rider. I'm gonna
go a little further than they expect, but when they see it enough,
they're gonna say, 'He's not crazy; he's just trying to wake us
up.'''
</P>
<P>
   Rider also said he really had been surprised the Blazers traded
him and attributed it to the disappointment of being swept in the
West finals in June. ``The people who didn't like me didn't know
me,'' he said. ``They knew my reputation from before (in
Minnesota), but they never took the time or had the chance to know
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Rider said he walked away from free agency and accepted the $5.4
million option year on his contract to show the Blazers how sincere
he was about staying in town.
</P>
<P>
   The day the trade broke, he said, he told some cronies that he
would play the year here and then go back to Portland. But he said
he has had time since then to think about his situation. ``But I'm
OK, and I like my team _ Jason Terry, J.J., Chris Crawford, Roshown
(McLeod), LaPhonso (Ellis). We've got some guys who can get out on
the break and put the ball in the basket. We've got the big fellow
(Dikembe Mutombo) to rebound, block shots and take care of
business. I'm not gonna wait 'til training camp to get with them.
I'll be back in September. ``
</P>
<P>
   Hawks president Stan Kasten, acknowledging Rider's reputation
for unreliability, said he already has improved. ``There was a
mix-up at the airport, a ready-made excuse,'' Kasten said, ``but
J.R. took matters into his own hands. He solved the problem, and he
got here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doesn't that say something in his favor?''

 &HT;    Hall raising play, salary
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, S.C. _ As has become his custom, Travis Hall went
back to his native Alaska for a while before training camp started
and did a little fishing with his wife, Tonya, and family.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons defensive tackle said he is not interested, however,
in fishing for more attention than he's getting as one of the NFL's
least appreciated interior linemen.
</P>
<P>
   Knee, ankle and shoulder injuries reduced his effectiveness at
times last year, when he missed two games and a third start. He
still finished with 73 tackles, 4 1/2 sacks, four fumble
recoveries, eight passes batted down and 30 quarterback pressures.
</P>
<P>
   His 279 tackles in the past three seasons lead all interior
linemen; Arizona's Eric Swann is a distant second, with 226 1/2.
</P>
<P>
   But in one recent ranking of the league's top tackles, Hall was
ranked 10th. And the 6-foot-5, 300-pounder has never been more than
a third Pro Bowl alternate.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's ridiculous,'' defensive end Chuck Smith said. ``Swann
ain't as good as Travis. Trav mashes people, man.''
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't seem to bother Hall, who grew up in Kenai, Alaska, in
the southwestern part of the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that our team is getting more recognition, I'm getting a
little more recognition. That's fine,'' he said. ``With three
Monday night games, and a Sunday night game ... the exposure will
keep coming.''
</P>
<P>
   When healthy, Hall is relentless.
</P>
<P>
   He played just three snaps as a rookie sixth-round choice in
1995. But the former end from Brigham Young got a lot bigger and
totaled 98 tackles and six sacks in 1996, despite missing two games
with a severe ankle sprain.
</P>
<P>
   Hall stood to become a restricted free agent after the '97
season, but one of the first things new coach Dan Reeves and
general manager Harold Richardson did was give Hall a contract that
included a $1 million signing bonus in April that year.
</P>
<P>
   That was more than five times what Hall was to have earned in
salary his third season.
</P>
<P>
   Now, even with three years left, one could argue that Hall has
earned another new deal.
</P>
<P>
   He put up big numbers in '97, registering 109 tackles and 10 1/2
sacks while earning a modest $200,000 in base salary. In the
offseason, the market for premier tackles was driving salaries up
to 10 times, and more, what Hall made.
</P>
<P>
   His salary jumped to $750,000 last season, and $1.15 million
this season. Those are nice raises, but the totals are perhaps only
one-third of Hall's market value.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of the deal he signed was simple.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons prevented him from becoming a restricted free agent,
and he got a lot more money that year, through the bonus, than he
would have.
</P>
<P>
   But the more that time passes, the more he falls below market
value. Falcon officials have said the deal will be restructured
before running its course.
</P>
<P>
   They have not talked, but Hall seems confident something good
will happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question, if I play out this whole contract, I
would be way underpaid,'' he said. ``But I've just got to keep
producing, and ... hope we can work things out, and make things
right.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall's health is mostly OK, although his right shoulder still
bothers him, after he torqued his arm at an odd angle last season.
</P>
<P>
   He usually plays left tackle, but he and right tackle Shane
Dronett have switched spots occasionally in camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something to maybe make our defensive line a little more
effective, give a different look,'' Hall said. ``Maybe we can keep
them guessing.''

 &HT;    Trying to find a target
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, S.C. _ When training camp began more than a week
ago, the Falcons faced questions at wide receiver, where they are
trying to replace Tony Martin as a deep threat.
</P>
<P>
   When they hold two joint practices today with the Jacksonville
Jaguars, they will have more questions.
</P>
<P>
   Free agent Chris Calloway was expected to replace Martin, at
least as the starting split end if not a deep threat.
</P>
<P>
   But he suffered a high ankle sprain to his left leg Thursday,
and will be out at least a few weeks. After Calloway and starting
flanker Terance Mathis, Atlanta receivers have combined for 12 NFL
receptions.
</P>
<P>
   Calloway's replacement, six-year veteran Ronnie Harris, has
eight. Behind him, second-year man Tim Dwight, who had four catches
as a rookie, will augment his work today as a reserve flanker with
time at split end.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a chance for Ronnie and Tim to show what they can
do,'' quarterback Chris Chandler said.
</P>
<P>
   Behind Harris will be Dwight and rookies Eugene Baker and Rondel
Menendez.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody looks more at your split receiver as your speed guy,
or your deep guy,'' receivers coach Rennie Simmons said. ``With
Terance and Chris, we could interchange them.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would play havoc on some defenses, but that's not going
to work out for a while, until we get Chris back.''
</P>
<P>
   None of the four split-end candidates offers the target that the
6-foot-1, 180-pound Martin did. Martin, who is on trial on
money-laundering charges, was waived by the Falcons after he
refused to allow the team to postpone a $400,000 March 1 roster
bonus.
</P>
<P>
   Harris (5-11, 185) runs pass routes well, and has a knack for
finding holes in coverage. However, Harris sometimes struggles to
get off the line cleanly.
</P>
<P>
   Dwight (5-8,180) has improved as a route runner, but he and
Menendez (5-9, 183) have been inconsistent catching the ball. Baker
(6-0, 167), who missed practice Friday because of a groin pull, has
the best hands, but is the slowest.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, behind Mathis at flanker, second-year split end Jammi
German (6-1, 192) will change positions, and Octavus Barnes (6-2,
195) will get some work.
</P>
<P>
   German did not catch a pass as a rookie appearing in six games.
Barnes was on the practice squad last year. Rookie Eric Harris
(6-2, 214) has missed most of camp with a bad back. Corey Allen
(6-1, 200), who was cut last year, had a good practice Friday
morning, but remains a longshot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our (flanker) is ... involved more on the strong side,''
Simmons said. ``Since we're a strongside run team, you should have
a pretty good blocker. We do in Terance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jammi continually gets better. He gives us a pretty good range
receiver downfield, even though he may not be blessed with the same
speed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to get familiar with (flanker),'' German said.
``It's more a matter of understanding what the defense is doing.
Watching Terance on film, he's so patient.''
</P>
<P>
   When the team uses a slot receiver, Mathis usually is the man.
Today, though, Simmons said Dwight will get extra repetitions
there. Mathis, Harris and German will work there, too. Coach Dan
Reeves said, ``These guys have to get a rapport with Chris
(Chandler) and convince him they can get open and catch the ball.''

N.Y. STATE TO DEVELOP DATABASE ON FELONS' DNA AS INVESTIGATIVE
TOOL 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA and JAYSON BLAIR  
 &HT;     
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   New York state will embark on one of the nation's most
aggressive programs of collecting DNA samples from convicted
felons, building a computer database that police can use to solve
crimes, under an agreement reached late Thursday night by Gov.
George Pataki and legislative leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials predict that such DNA databases will
be a tremendous breakthrough, becoming to crime-fighting in the
next century what fingerprints have been over the last century. The
systems will allow police to take DNA profiles gathered from the
tiniest scraps of evidence at crime scenes _ hair follicles, bits
of skin, droplets of blood, even saliva _ and enter them into a
computer and learn within minutes whether they came from known
criminals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's one of, if not the most important development in
forensic science in law enforcement,'' said Ronald Neubauer, the
president of the International Association of Chiefs of Police, and
the police chief in St. Peters, Mo. ``And in the 21st century, I
not only see DNA being a tool to solve crimes, but a way to insure
that innocent people are not being convicted of crimes they did not
commit.''
</P>
<P>
   Civil libertarians have objected to the wholesale collection of
DNA for databases, and there have been legal challenges in most
states and on the federal level, but none have been successful.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal struck here, starting Dec. 1, anyone who is
convicted of any of a long list of felonies will have a DNA profile
entered into a state computer. The state now uses blood samples to
collect DNA, but could, with further training, move to taking cells
from inside the mouth with a cotton swab, a technique used
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The law will apply to about half the defendants convicted of
felonies, or about 25,000 each year. The crimes that will put
people into the database include murder, manslaughter, assault, sex
crimes, drug dealing, robbery, burglary, grand larceny, and the
most serious categories of drug possession, attempted murder,
arson, kidnapping and attempted burglary. Exempted would be most
drug possession crimes, as well as child abuse and drunken driving.
</P>
<P>
   All 50 states have begun developing some kind of DNA database,
and five years ago the FBI began a federal database, which can be
linked to the state systems. Most of the state databases are not
yet on line, though Virginia and Florida have had theirs working
for several years.
</P>
<P>
   Like most states, New York currently collects samples only from
people who are convicted of sex crimes and a few other violent
offenses _ about 8 percent of felons each year. Most states exclude
robbers, kidnappers, burglars and those convicted of attempted
crimes. But under the new law, New York will include a wider range
of felons than all but eight states: Alabama, Maine, Massachusetts,
New Mexico, Tennessee, Vermont, Virginia and Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   Also, New York will collect samples from everyone now in prison,
on parole or on probation for one of the crimes on its list, about
100,000 people in all. Some states do not apply the testing
retroactively, to people convicted in years past, and only a
handful include people who are on probation and parole.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we get these samples into the databank, right away we
will have matches against evidence from unsolved cases,'' said
Katherine Lapp, Pataki's criminal justice coordinator. ``That's why
the retroactive pool is such a critical feature. Forty percent of
felony offenders return to prison for a new crime within three
years, so it's fair to say there's some unknown number of offenders
already in the system who've committed other crimes we don't know
about.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Police
Commissioner Howard Safir called for DNA testing of everyone who is
arrested, an approach that is used in Britain but nowhere in the
United States. Safir has also urged that the state help local
police departments pay for the training and equipment they will
need to take advantage of the system, funding that state lawmakers
did not include.
</P>
<P>
   ``My reaction is that it is a good first step, but it does not
go far enough,'' Safir said Friday of the state plan. ``We should
be collecting it from everybody. The only ones who have anything to
worry about from DNA testing are criminals. It would prove others
innocent.''
</P>
<P>
   But the New York Civil Liberties Union objects to any expansion
of the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're concerned that perhaps this is the beginning of leading
New York into a brave new world where New Yorkers' private genetic
codes are available to the government,'' said Norman Siegel, the
group's executive director. ``It is a mistake to equate DNA samples
to fingerprints. Fingerprints are representations of the physical
attributes of the tips of our fingers; they are used only for
identification purposes. DNA is that plus much more.''
</P>
<P>
   Civil libertarians contend that DNA samples could eventually be
used to extract personal information, such as susceptibility to
disease, that could wind up in private hands and violate
individuals' rights to privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Siegel said he did not anticipate suing to block the New York
law.
</P>
<P>
   Since the late 1980s, law enforcement agencies have used DNA,
the genetic code unique to each individual and found in every
living cell, to solve crimes, particularly sex crimes, where other
physical evidence is often lacking. The usual practice has been to
obtain a court order to take a sample from a suspect and see
whether it matches evidence taken from a crime scene, and that will
continue to be a common approach.
</P>
<P>
   While lawyers in criminal cases, most notably in the O.J.
Simpson case, have questioned the handling of DNA samples,
degradation of a sample can only prevent a meaningful result; it
cannot provide a false match.
</P>
<P>
   As useful as DNA evidence has been to police, it is perhaps
best-known for proving the innocence of suspects, even of people
who were imprisoned for years for crimes they did not commit.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Pataki, a Republican, proposed DNA sampling of
people convicted of any felony. Democratic Assembly Speaker Sheldon
Silver said it was pointless to include white-collar criminals in
the program, and that he was worried about the cost.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Late Thursday, Pataki, Silver and Republican Senate Majority
Leader Joseph Bruno agreed on the expansion of the database, and a
bill was hurriedly drafted. The Assembly passed the bill after
midnight. The Senate, which had adjourned Thursday afternoon, plans
to pass the bill when it returns, possibly in September.
</P>
<P>
   Getting the state system running presents daunting challenges,
beginning with the collection of samples from 100,000 people now in
the criminal justice system and entering them into the computers.
Ms. Lapp estimated that it would cost $1 million to $2 million to
collect that data, and that the money could be taken from existing
state funds. She said the job could be completed within a year. But
legislators in both parties put the cost far higher, at perhaps $10
million to $20 million, and predicted that simply finding that
money will mean delays until next year.
</P>
<P>
   Also, local law enforcement agencies must acquire the equipment
and expertise for handling and analyzing tissue samples for DNA,
and for exchanging information electronically with the state
database.
</P>
<P>
   New York state began collecting DNA samples in January 1996, and
has 7,000 to 8,000 of them. But the database is not yet in
operation because it cannot be accessed by law enforcement
agencies, a step Ms. Lapp said will be taken at the end of August.
</P>
<P>
   Some police officials and crime victims' groups have accused the
state of going too slowly, but Ms. Lapp said the state had been
waiting for the federal government to choose a national standard
for DNA testing from among four techniques available. The national
standard was settled on late last year.

STUDY ADVANCES PLAN FOR NUCLEAR STORAGE SITE, BUT QUESTIONS
REMAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A preliminary report on a nuclear waste storage
project in Nevada concludes that very little radiation would leak
from the site and that a repository there would be as safe and much
cheaper than securing the waste where it now collects, at dozens of
sites around the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The preliminary environmental impact statement, released Friday
by the Department of Energy, acknowledges, though, that some key
issues are not understood well enough to recommend using the place,
Yucca Mountain, Nev., in the desert about 100 miles northwest of
Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   The flow of water in the area is a major uncertainty. Opponents
say assumptions in the report used by the department about water
flow in the area are contradicted by other evidence the department
has gathered.
</P>
<P>
   A department official deeply involved in the Yucca Mountain
project acknowledged, ``we have a lot of work to do'' before a
recommendation is made to the energy secretary to proceed with
construction. But, he said, ``We probably know more about Yucca
than any other piece of property on the earth.''
</P>
<P>
   The report is a milestone in the department's plan to build the
repository. Another milestone is likely early next week, when the
Environmental Protection Agency plans to issue a draft of the rules
that a repository would have to meet to be licensed for operation.
The EPA will call for the repository to hold in the bulk of the
radiation for 10,000 years, but people familiar with the draft said
that the agency had not decided how many miles the radiation should
be allowed to spread in that period.
</P>
<P>
   The entire proposed site, which is 230 square miles, is
controlled by the Energy Department, the Air Force or the Bureau of
Land Management. But water flowing underground would eventually
carry radioactive materials beyond the site's borders.
</P>
<P>
   The environmental impact statement for the first time evaluates
the safety of leaving the waste where it is, at 72 commercial
reactor sites and five Energy Department sites, and finds little
safety difference, if storage canisters at the existing sites can
be replaced every century or so. But it finds that leaving the
waste there would be much more expensive in the long run than
storage at Yucca Mountain.
</P>
<P>
   The report says leaving the waste where it is would cost
hundreds of millions of dollars a year for thousands of years,
while the repository would cost tens of billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The statement is another step in the department's case to move
ahead with a project that critics say is doomed to fail because
engineers and scientists cannot say what will happen in coming
millenniums, when gradual climate change could make Nevada a wet
area, which could rust the containers and spread the waste.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest question is how much radioactive material would
gradually escape and be washed by rain into underground water
supplies. The statement says hardly any radiation would escape.
</P>
<P>
   But it relies on Energy Department theories that the seepage of
rainwater from the top of the mountain, down 660 to 1,400 feet to
where the waste would be buried, and then another 600 to 1,200 feet
to where underground water flows, called the saturated zone, would
be very slow, and that radioactive material would only move slowly
with the flow of water deep underground. Outside scientists dispute
those theories.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, rock at the site includes crystals that some
scientists say are evidence of intermittent upwellings of
underground water, which would speed the spread of radioactive
materials. The department is seeking to demonstrate that these
crystals were formed in the same volcanic process that made the
mountain, and that the water table is stable at a level hundreds of
feet below where the waste would go.
</P>
<P>
   The official involved in preparing the report said the saturated
zone and seepage need to be studied further before a recommendation
to build the repository can be made. Building ultimately would be
subject to approval of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The state of Nevada opposes the project, and at its Nuclear
Waste Project Office, Steven A. Frishman, the technical policy
coordinator, said that another key assumption behind the
environmental impact statement was how long the steel canisters
holding the waste would remain intact.
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department analysis assumes that of the thousands of
canisters that would hold the waste, only one would fail while it
was still ``juvenile,'' or less than 1,000 years old. Opponents
note that canisters now used to store fuel at reactors have already
had problems.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the report is based on calculations about how much
radiation it takes to cause a cancer fatality, and how many traffic
deaths are likely from crashes of trucks carrying nuclear waste. It
predicts ``about 22 to 50 latent cancer fatalities and
nonradiological fatalities'' during the 100 years of construction,
loading, monitoring and closing of a repository, vs. about 100
fatal cancer cases from radiation if the waste is left where it is.
</P>
<P>
   The 1,600-page study is unusual because it lists only two
alternatives, building Yucca or doing nothing. Most environmental
impact statements weigh a variety of options, but department
officials said that the Nuclear Waste Policy Act does not provide
for any others.

FEDERAL COURT TAKES JUDICIAL ROLE FROM OHIO'S MAYORS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANCIS X. CLINES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELMWOOD PLACE, Ohio _ By court fiat, judicial gavels are being
snatched from the hands of small-town mayors across this state,
striking down an old tradition and leaving Mayor Richard Ellison
ruefully asking what's wrong with local justice proving more
kind-hearted than blind?
</P>
<P>
   Ellison, who earns $6,900 a year as a one-stop symbol of law and
order and management in this humble blue-collar village of 2,900
souls, further asks what's so biased about a mayor's cutting
compassionate slack when he sits in judgment of some of the very
people who elected him?
</P>
<P>
   ``I only maxed out one guy in my court in the last six years,''
said the mayor, a nonlawyer who described how he threw the book at
a nasty drunk who had destroyed the tree flourishing outside
Charley's Bar a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three days in jail and $600,'' said Ellison, sounding
judicious to the last as he mourned the end of this state's
``strong mayor'' tradition of having local mayors, most of whom are
not lawyers, hear minor criminal cases ranging from disorderly
conduct to drunk driving.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a traumatic thing, involving real-life circumstances,''
he declared, grateful to live so close to his neighbors in having
to judge them. ``There's more opportunity for compassion. It gives
you a good feeling to go home and say I think I got the message
across and didn't have to wipe out some family's fortune.''
</P>
<P>
   But a federal appellate decision last month found the system had
more potential for bias than compassion. Since mayors control town
budgets and police forces, the judges said, it could be unfair to
have them judge cases with local police officers as witnesses and
fines that can boost municipal coffers.
</P>
<P>
   A good part of the 400 mayoral courts in the state will be
affected and face the option of hiring trained lawyers as part-time
magistrates, said Augustin F. O'Neil, the lawyer who successfully
challenged the age-old mayors court system before the 6th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   ``The end of an era?'' said O'Neil, hardly dewy-eyed at the loss
of this vestige of Ohio's small-town life. ``It should be the end
of an era. Frontier justice is what we have here,'' he said, citing
the Magna Carta in his successful argument that for a
revenue-hungry mayor to serve constituents as both police
administrator and judge presents a conflict of authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has to do with power and egos, just as anytime politics is
involved.'' O'Neil declared in an interview. He said some of the
``strong mayors'' _ those who run a municipality without the
insulation of a separate city manager _ are as dictatorial as
big-city machine bosses. ``A lot of these burgs generate big
revenues from mayors courts. Under that robe, a mayor in effect
wears a badge.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellison, a 64-year-old retired truck company manager who has
presided at thousands of cases, sadly dissents, fearing the ruling
is a step toward ``metropolitan'' government of centralized court
systems in which smaller jurisdictions like his will eventually be
eclipsed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the criminal factor so much as that personal, that
family, that social and emotional value,'' explained the mayor who
always presided in jacket and tie, never a robe. ``A family I know
might stand before me heartbroken over some dirt-bag son or brother
or cousin. They talk directly to me, hoping for some mitigation.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor understands the basis of the court ruling, for he
recalls his boyhood days of peddling newspapers in the now-departed
illegal gambling dens of this hamlet, before the interstate highway
was built. ``A mayor could be a dictator in those days, but they
were benevolent dictators,'' said Ellison, honoring the memory of
such predecessors as Art ``Butch'' Wise, a local butcher remembered
for a heart of gold and an iron hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then there was Otto Hessler, came over from Lichtenstein
as a young man and ran the village for 27 years,'' said Ellison.
``If you needed anything _ a ton of coal in a hard winter _ Otto
was the man who'd get it for you.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayors of Ohio are hardly unanimous in regretting the loss
of their gavels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mayors now are facing the possibility of liability _ that's
the crux of their problem,'' said John E. Gotherman, counsel of the
Ohio Municipal League, a nonprofit association of village and city
executives. ``Most mayors are concerned to protect their
municipalities and themselves,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling grew out of a 1994 case in Macedonia in which a
citizen charged his civil rights were violated when the mayor
responded spiritedly to an unpaid traffic ticket with an arrest
warrant plus a contempt of court charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly won't miss the hassle,'' said Mayor Elbert
Tannreuther of Monroe, who has sat in judgment of more than 10,000
cases for the past 13 years in his city of 7,000 residents. ``The
people you see in court today include a lot of repeaters, people
with just absolutely no respect for the system. I wasn't built that
way,'' he said, finding the court a catchbasin for the city's
underlife more than its wayward charm. ``It was depressing.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellison agrees it could be depressing _ but also redeeming. ``I
worked closely with Bob Newman, a legitimate liberal, as
prosecutor,'' said the mayor, who describes himself as an
unreconstructed Goldwater man. ``We weren't out to hang anyone,
because that $100 fine might mean a bicycle for some guy's kid. And
the 15 grand we'll pay for a magistrate _ well, that could go for a
new roof for town hall.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neil, the lawyer who challenged the mayors courts, says there
must be more to small-town life than nostalgia for the old ways.
``Justice needs to be blind,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Ellison, who has read bits of law in his years as a judge,
cites his own favorite prescription, a maxim from British law, he
said, on how to be a successful judge: ``First of all be a
gentleman. If you know a little law, so much the better.''

<P>
   CHESTNUT HILL, Mass. _ The topic was stress management in the
classroom, but as the professor began his case study about a New
England school coping with the death of a child in a storm, his
students desperately wanted to read aloud from the pages of their
own lives.
</P>
<P>
   An English teacher from Morocco politely interrupted to tell
how, as a young boy, he had watched as his school superintendent
was shot to death by a guerrilla who had invaded their classroom.
</P>
<P>
   A high school math teacher from Israel described how his
students were unable to concentrate for weeks after two schoolmates
were blown up by a terrorist bomb.
</P>
<P>
   And another English teacher, an Arab from the Gaza Strip,
recalled how one of his students lay gravely wounded on his
classroom desk, having been shot in the stomach three times by
Israeli soldiers who believed he had pelted them with rocks. After
a two-hour standoff, the teacher said, he slung the boy over his
shoulder and carried him to a nearby hospital, as explosives went
off around him.
</P>
<P>
   For 45 minutes, one teacher after another shared similar
experiences, their various accents blending into one. When it was
over, the professor, Paul M. Kline, a specialist in adolescent
mental health at Boston College, sat motionless.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fear,'' he said, ``that anything I say will be inadequate.''
</P>
<P>
   The exchange was but one snippet of an improbable dialogue among
19 high school teachers _ including Israelis, Palestinians and
Lebanese _ from seven Middle Eastern nations and territories that
stretched over four weeks, ending Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In coming together for a first-time symposium at Boston College,
their ostensible purpose was to swap methods of instruction and
curriculum. But those who had brought them here had another motive:
to demonstrate that the common bonds between teachers transcend
even the bitterest rivalries between their governments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came here not knowing what would happen between me and the
Israelis,'' said Zahia Khashab Fakih, 27, who teaches English in
Lebanon. ``I was worried, thinking, `How can I deal with people
whose army is occupying our country?'''
</P>
<P>
   ``What I learned in my stay in Boston is that people, between
themselves, can make deep peace,'' she said. ``If the peace process
is given to teachers to deal with _ and maybe to students _ then
they might make a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   In hopes of nurturing that very ideal, the organizers of the
program here have a far grander scheme in mind than just an intense
summer of learning. For three years, they have been working toward
establishing a fully accredited University of the Middle East, with
satellite campuses in every major capital in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Led by an Arab, Hala Taweel, 34, a doctoral candidate at Harvard
who is the sister-in-law of Yasser Arafat, and a Jew, Dr. Ron
Rubin, 28, a lecturer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
who grew up in Israel and California, the organizers of the
University of the Middle East Project are trying to raise $100
million, with an eye on opening their first campus, in Morocco, in
2005.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Taweel and Rubin took a first step toward making their dream
real by inviting the high school teachers here this summer. The 19
accepted were among 220 who had applied, their tuition paid almost
entirely by a collection of foundations. The organizers hope that,
upon the university's founding, these will be the first teachers to
recommend it to their students.
</P>
<P>
   To give them a taste of what the university might offer, the
teachers were immersed in the latest concepts of American
education. They were taught to resolve classroom conflicts through
role playing, to minimize lectures in favor of cooperative student
work, and to integrate the school psychologist into their
classrooms _ a prospect that many of the teachers found alien, if
not frightening.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our culture, psychiatrists are associated with craziness,''
said Fatima Kotbi, 35, of Morocco.
</P>
<P>
   But in truth, they likely learned more from one another than
from a roster of professors assembled from Boston College, Harvard
and MIT.
</P>
<P>
   In late-night talks in the hallway of their dormitory, they
realized they shared the same frustrations, whether it was large
class sizes (as big as 60 in Egypt), rigid course requirements
(every English teacher in the Gaza Strip must teach Dickens' ``Hard
Times'' in the 12th grade) or low salaries (from as little as $300
a month in some Palestinian schools to $1,000 a month in Israel.)
</P>
<P>
   And all agreed that their students had been set back in their
learning by conflicts that have never seemed to abate for long.
</P>
<P>
   In relating what it was like to teach on the West Bank during
the period that Arabs refer to as the Intifada, the seven-year
uprising against Israeli occupation that ended in 1993, Frieda
Khayat, 32, said: ``We couldn't get the kids involved in the
teaching because they always thought school would be canceled for
the next day.''
</P>
<P>
   As she spoke from her desk in a lecture hall on Wednesday, four
Israelis, three of them Jewish, sat just a few feet away. None
raised their voices to argue the relative merits of the various
combatants.
</P>
<P>
   At lunch that day, four teachers _ an Israeli flanked by a
Palestinian on one side and a Lebanese on the other, all sitting
opposite a Jordanian _ briefly debated whether Jerusalem rightly
belonged to the Jews, the Muslims or the Christians.
</P>
<P>
   The conversation never got heated or personal. And the four
agreed that ultimately, they would prefer to set aside their
convictions and to compromise rather than jeopardize the
friendships they had formed over the last month.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli teacher, Judith Zilberman, who is Jewish, said she
had found herself empathizing with the diner to her left, Hani El
Akkad, a Muslim from the Gaza Strip, who spoke of being punched in
the stomach by an Israeli soldier when he refused to translate
something from Arabic into Hebrew. El Akkad, 39, said he had told
the soldier he spoke no Hebrew.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to put myself in Hani's shoes and the Israeli soldier's
shoes,'' said Ms. Zilberman, a teacher for two decades, who was
reticent about revealing her age. ``It doesn't matter. They
shouldn't have hit him.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the table, Mona Barghout, 32, a Jordanian whose family
had been forced to flee Israel at its founding in 1948, told Ms.
Zilberman how hard it would have been, just a month ago, to imagine
herself having lunch with an Israeli.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people around me,'' Ms. Barghout said, of her friends and
family in Jordan, ``they wouldn't accept me making contact with the
enemy. Peace, it's only on paper.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet asked the following evening, at a New England clambake that
closed the program, what she would tell those same friends and
relatives upon her return, Ms. Barghout said: ``All people are the
same.''
</P>
<P>
   As if on cue, someone listening to the conversation exclaimed,
``Sah!'' the Arabic word for ``correct.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Moshe Peretz, a Jew, from Jerusalem.

<P>
   The bad news for lovers of velvety lawns is that much of the
grass underfoot these blistering summer days looks and feels like
Shredded Wheat _ harsh on the eyes and splintery on the bottom of
feet. And if lawns are not crispy now, they will be once the
sprinklers are ordered turned off, as they have been in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that most of the lawns now brown and dusty are
not dead but merely dormant. They will return to green luxuriance
in the fall, experts in turf grass management agree, especially if
they were well cared for before the extreme weather this summer and
not mowed or trampled while in a stressed state.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the beauty of perennial grasses,'' said James Murphy, a
turf specialist at Rutgers University Cooperative Extension. ``They
will return when the rains return.''
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics can check for themselves whether the withered thatch in
their backyard is ruined or just resting. ``Get down on your hands
and knees and look at the crown of the plant, just at the soil
line,'' said Tom Smith, a horticulturist at the University of
Cincinnati. Beneath the yellow blades should be a point of green
and below that a healthy root system, protecting itself now and
waiting to rebound later.
</P>
<P>
   That is the rule, but there will be exceptions, the experts say,
depending on the species of grass, the type of soil, the depth of
the root system and the duration of the drought.
</P>
<P>
   Grass that has been watered extensively but infrequently, rather
than drizzled on a daily basis, has the best chance of survival
because it develops a deeper root system. So does grass that has
been mowed to a height of two to three inches, not given a buzz
cut, because the crown stays cooler and the extra leaf matter
promotes photosynthesis.
</P>
<P>
   The duration of the drought and the severity of the heat could
change the outcome. The benchmark number, experts say, is 60 days,
meaning that most grass will survive two months without any water,
even in temperatures of 90 degrees or hotter, regardless of its
appearance.
</P>
<P>
   George Hamilton, a senior lecturer on turf grass science at
Pennsylvania State University, sees no magic in the 60-day limit,
since shade, fertilization and proper cultivation all come into
play. But there is a ``permanent wilting point,'' Hamilton said,
when a dormant plant that has slowed its respiration will stop
breathing entirely.
</P>
<P>
   Ashton Ritchie, an agronomist at Scotts Co. in Marysville, Ohio,
the country's leading supplier of lawn care products, said that
people who live in areas where sprinkling is still permitted can
protect their grass with minimal water. A lawn that is the envy of
the neighborhood takes an inch of water a week, Ritchie said. But a
quarter-inch every two weeks ``is just enough to keep it from
dying.''
</P>
<P>
   Even when the grass looks hopelessly dead, experts agree,
homeowners and landscapers can influence its ability to recover.
They suggest that the owners stop mowing and try to keep children
from trampling the dry mat. Also, they say, use no fertilizer or
pesticide.
</P>
<P>
   Surviving lawns will not be trouble free, however. Summer weeds,
like crab grass, flourish when it is hot and dry, experts say, and
thus will be more prevalent next year. Also, humidity promotes lawn
disease and pests, which can run rampant in grass that wore itself
out staying alive in trying conditions.
</P>
<P>
   All of these experts say they have stopped watering their own
lawns. William A. Torello, a professor of turf grass management at
the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, was one of several
experts who said that the parched grass is easier to tolerate if
one considers it ``blond'' rather than ``brown.''
</P>
<P>
   Torello also urged some revisionist thinking about weeds. ``A
lot of people are perfectly happy with crab grass,'' he said. ``At
least it's green.''

WIFE OF U.S. ARMY OFFICER IN COLOMBIA CHARGED IN DRUG CONSPIRACY 
</HEADLINE>

 By ROBERT D. McFADDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In April and May, Laurie Anne Hiett, the wife of an
Army colonel in charge of all U.S. military operations in Colombia,
mailed six packages to New York City from the American Embassy in
Bogota. Each was sealed in plain brown paper and weighed several
pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hiett, 36, sent four of them to an apartment in Queens and
the others to mail drops in Queens and Manhattan. She wrote her
name clearly on the return addresses and filled out U.S. Customs
forms declaring the contents to be books on Colombia or items like
candy, a T-shirt, coffee or candles.
</P>
<P>
   But the names of the recipients were fictitious and the packages
turned out to contain a total of 15.8 pounds of pure cocaine with a
street value of up to $230,000, according to a criminal complaint
filed on Thursday in federal court in Brooklyn charging Ms. Hiett
and two others in a bizarre drug-trafficking conspiracy that took
advantage of the embassy's special mailing privileges.
</P>
<P>
   A three-month undercover operation by New York police, U.S.
Customs agents and the Army's Criminal Investigation Division found
no evidence of involvement by Col. James Hiett, who was responsible
for U.S. military activity in Colombia from July 1998 until last
week, when he stepped aside voluntarily because of the allegations
against his wife.
</P>
<P>
   While the purported drug-smuggling operation was not large, the
allegations brushing the embassy come at a sensitive time in the
joint efforts to combat the drug trade in Colombia, the world's No.
1 source of cocaine and the primary country of concern for American
anti-drug policy. It will receive $289 million in aid from
Washington this year, and most of it will go to fight the drug war.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hiett, who was arraigned before Magistrate Judge Cheryl
Pollak in federal court in Brooklyn on Thursday and ordered
released on $150,000 personal recognizance bond, admitted to
investigators that she had mailed the packages, but insisted that
she had not known the contents and that she had sent them at the
behest of her husband's chauffeur, a Colombian national.
</P>
<P>
   The chauffeur, Jorge Alfonso Ayala, who had been a driver for
the American Embassy in Bogota for 15 years, was named as a
co-conspirator and was being sought by the authorities in Colombia.
The complaint said he told investigators at the embassy in June
that Ms. Hiett ``abused cocaine,'' and that he helped her buy it in
La Zona Rosa, a notorious drug-trafficking district in Bogota, and
from ``an unknown woman in a taxi'' at the back gate of the
embassy.
</P>
<P>
   Confronted with these assertions by the investigators, the
complaint said, Ms. Hiett became ``extremely agitated.'' She
insisted that she had got the packages from Ayala, who ``obtained
them from individuals in a taxi outside the embassy.'' But when
pressed, she said: ``I'm afraid they'll kill me.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hiett's lawyer, Paul Lazarus of Miami, said Friday that his
client denied the allegations, although he noted that no indictment
had been filed, and that Ms. Hiett had not yet been required to
enter a plea. He said he was not prepared to make further
statements until he had a chance to study the case, which was first
reported Thursday evening on the Web site of The Village Voice
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Dunst, the assistant federal prosecutor in the case,
declined to comment beyond the complaint, which accused Timla
Arcila, 61, and her brother, Hernan Arcila, 53, of receiving the
packages at their apartment at 31-47 92nd St. in Jackson Heights,
Queens; at a rented post office box in Elmhurst, Queens, and at a
commercial mail drop in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Arcila was named as a co-defendant and was arraigned and
released on bail on Thursday. No dates for later hearings were set.
Conviction on the federal charge of conspiracy to possess cocaine
with intent to distribute it is subject to 10 to 12 years in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   No federal charges were filed against Hernan Arcila, who was
being held at the Queens House of Detention on an unrelated charge,
filed by the Queens district attorney, of criminal possession of
narcotics in the first degree, which carries a penalty of up to
life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for Colombia's ministry of defense, which oversees
relations between Colombian and American security forces in the
drug wars, and for President Andrew Pastrana, declined to comment
on the case. The Colombian Embassy in Washington did not respond to
requests for comment, and the U.S. Embassy in Bogota, citing
privacy considerations, said it too could not comment.
</P>
<P>
   But a Colombian government official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said that Ms. Hiet's contention that she had mailed
packages containing cocaine unknowingly at the request of her
family's driver did not seem far-fetched. He noted that mail
service in Colombia, as in many Latin American countries, was
unreliable, and that Colombians close to foreign diplomats often
asked them to send mail. ``Everybody knows that the embassy mail
works extremely well out of here,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   However, such requests are usually to mail letters, not
packages, and to show that nothing illegal is being mailed the
packages are left unsealed when given to American diplomats or
members of their families. ``I think she was being extremely
naive,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   But investigators said there was ample evidence that Ms. Hiett
was aware of what was in the packages. They said Customs travel
records show that she even made several trips to the United States
in April and May, and indicated that the purpose of the trips was
to prepare for and help coordinate the conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   According to the federal complaint, the packages _ each about 12
inches long, 6 inches high and 4 inches wide and weighing about
three pounds _ were mailed from the embassy's postal service, which
is not open to the general public and does not even provide
services for Colombian citizens who work at the embassy.
</P>
<P>
   The packages were sent between April 13 and May 26, four of them
to the Arcila apartment in Jackson Heights, but two others to the
mail drops in Queens and Manhattan that were said to have been
rented by Timla Arcila. On May 23, a Customs official in Miami,
conducting a routine search, discovered cocaine in one of the
packages, which was addressed to a Jacqueline Wellipon at the
Queens apartment. Ms. Hiett's name was on the return address.
</P>
<P>
   Law-enforcement officials then began an undercover
investigation. The package containing the cocaine was delivered to
the Arcilas, who accepted it saying that the addressee was not
home. The brother and sister were arrested, and a search of their
apartment found more cocaine, $13,000 in cash and notes that led
the authorities to suspect Ayala's involvement.

<HEADLINE>
N.J. STATE DINOSAUR DUE FOR A MAKEOVER 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Spelling of ``Hadrosaurus foulkii'' in lede is correct.) 
(yn) 
 By JERRY GRAY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ Unheralded, unappreciated and just plain
unattractive, New Jersey's state dinosaur, the Hadrosaurus foulkii,
has never approached the marquee status of prehistoric megastars
like Tyrannosaurus rex or Velociraptor.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy is our own sort of humble, native New Jerseyan, and
so he doesn't receive quite the press that the dinosaurs do out
West,'' said William B. Gallagher, registrar of the Natural History
Bureau of the New Jersey State Museum, where the dinosaur has been
on display for more than 60 years. ``But he is a substantial
dinosaur.''
</P>
<P>
   When it was first identified nearly 150 years ago, Hadrosaurus
opened the door to modern paleontology. It was the world's first
mounted dinosaur skeleton and it proved that some dinosaurs walked
upright on two legs rather than the reptilian-like crawl that many
had suspected, touching off the first wave of ``dino-mania.''
</P>
<P>
   Because knowledge about the Hadrosaurus dinosaur has grown,
Gallagher is looking to to update the museum's display to reflect
the changes.
</P>
<P>
   There is one hitch: Hadrosaurus needs a new head.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a really minor thing,'' he said, ``but we want to have it
as correct as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The first traces of Hadrosaurus _ huge pieces of fossilized
vertebrae _ were discovered in 1838 on a farm owned by the
financier Johns Hopkins near Haddonfield, N.J., by diggers mining
marl, a mixture of clay, sand and limestone used as fertilizer. The
discovery set off a bone rush among amateur paleontologists, many
of them wealthy Philadelphia residents who flocked to southern New
Jersey in the summer to escape the city's heat.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years passed before William Parker Foulke, a friend of
Hopkins and a member of the Academy of Natural Sciences of
Philadelphia, organized the first scientific dig, which turned up a
treasure trove of bones. Foulke quickly sought expert help,
bringing in Dr. Joseph Leidy, an anatomist at the University of
Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   The second excavation of the marl pit, in 1858, yielded enough
bones to assemble the most complete dinosaur skeleton ever
reconstructed, a creature that Leidy named Hadrosaurus foulkii
(``Foulke's bulky lizard'') in honor of Foulke.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, for the first time, they finally had enough of a dinosaur
to make some conclusions about how they stood and walked,''
Gallagher said.
</P>
<P>
   After observing the short arm bones of Hadrosaurus and the much
longer leg bones, Leidy offered a revolutionary notion: that
Foulke's bulky lizard was able to rear back on its hind legs in a
kangaroo-like stance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hadrosaurus was the dinosaur that brought dinosaurs up from
all four legs,'' Gallagher said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1868, a decade after Hadrosaurus was unearthed, Benjamin
Waterhouse Hawkins, an English artist living in Philadelphia,
presented the Academy of Natural Sciences with a mounted skeleton
made from casts from the bones of Hadrosaurus, the first ever
displayed.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Hadrosaurus was the most complete dinosaur known to
science, there remained a problem: its skull was never found.
</P>
<P>
   Gallagher surmised that the skull was washed away. Only a piece
of the lower jaw with some intact teeth were found.
</P>
<P>
   When the current display of skeletal casts was installed in the
New Jersey Museum in the 1930s, the Hadrosaurus had already been a
has-been for half a century. Scientists working in the western
United States in the late 1800s had unearthed the first full
skeletons of Tyrannosaurus rex and more complete skeletons of the
Hadrosaurus family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hadrosaurus actually started the first wave of dino-mania in
the United States,'' Gallagher said. ``But once they discovered
that there were better things to be found out West, that was kind
of the death knell for New Jersey dinosaur hunting.''
</P>
<P>
   Scientists' knowledge of Hadrosaurus has not changed much from
Leidy's conclusions made more than a century ago. He estimated that
the dinosaur was about 25 feet long, weighed 7 to 8 tons and stood
10 feet tall. Its blunt teeth confirmed that it was a vegetarian.
And, he concluded that its most identifiable feature was a broad,
flat skull that was common to many duck-billed dinosaurs.
</P>
<P>
   Gallagher said modern science supports the belief that
Hadrosaurus may have been at least 30 feet long, roamed the forests
and swamps of New Jersey's ancient seacoast about 72 million years
ago, 8 million years earlier than had been thought, late in the
Cretaceous period. And instead of the broad, flat head that now
sits atop the skeleton, Gallagher said recent research has led him
to believe that Hadrosaurus' skull was narrower.
</P>
<P>
   But Gallagher is quick to point out that he is not planning to
drastically remake the creature that has been a wonderment to
generations of children and teachers during their field trips to
the state museum.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, a 10-year lobbying campaign by Joyce Berry, a teacher
at Strawbridge Elementary School in Haddon Township, N.J., and
letters written by her 4th-grade classes led Hadrosaurus foulkii to
be designated the state dinosaur in June 1991.
</P>
<P>
   If he finds funding to remake the Hadrosaurus, Gallagher plans
to replace its skull with one cast from a duck-billed dinosaur
found elsewhere. He said he believes that skull, which was
unearthed intact, is the same as that of the New Jersey dinosaur.
</P>
<P>
   So far, however, the state Legislature has not put up the
estimated $100,000 that updating the mounted skeleton will cost.
Gallagher admits that he feels a bit pressured to complete the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know there are some very knowledgeable junior dinosaur
specialists who visit the display at the state museum,'' he said.
``Nobody has challenged us yet, but I suspect one day some
12-year-old is going to say, `But that's the wrong skull.'''

 &HT;    Drought spreads to northeast
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Southern farmers are glancing nervously at the sky
with the return of hot, dry weather, but the region is faring
better than their neighbors to the north.
</P>
<P>
   Maryland, Delaware, New Jersey and Rhode Island are suffering
their worst droughts this century.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina's corn crop has been hit hard, and farmers now
are worried about cotton crops that had been expected to be the
best in years. In Virginia, some dairy farmers in the Shenandoah
Valley are hauling water to their farms because wells and ponds
have dried up.
</P>
<P>
   In Mississippi, critically low water supplies have led to a ban
on outdoor water use in several communities.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said Friday that the drought in the northeast
threatens to cripple businesses and communities in the hardest hit
farm communities. ``Throughout much of this country, we have seen
the worst drought since the Dust Bowl days,'' Clinton said before
leaving the White House for a weekend trip to Arkansas and
Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   ``Such a natural calamity can have devastating consequences, not
only for farmers, but for small businesses and communities that
depend upon a thriving agricultural sector, and for the electric
power system so vital to our nation,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the mid-Atlantic region already has been declared a
federal disaster area.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are hurting some, but nowhere to the extent of those
states,'' said Allen Tyree, cooperative extension agent in Hamilton
County, an area of northern Florida that produces tobacco, cotton,
peanuts and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, agricultural economist Keith Kightlinger of Tift
County said, ``We are back into a dry situation, but rain in July
helped us a lot. We have not had prolonged dryness.''
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina is faring better this summer than last, but two
dozen municipalities have enacted water restrictions. At this
point, most are voluntary, including in Charlotte and Raleigh. But
Cary, Morrisville and Holly Springs _ in the Raleigh area _ have
mandatory curbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we do get some rain, we will see more systems going to
conservation,'' said Tony Young, chairman of the North Carolina
Drought Monitoring Council. ``Things have gotten a little bit more
serious lately.''
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina farmers ``have gotten rain at critical times when
they needed it. Crops are doing relatively well,'' Young said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Southeast Regional Climate Center in Columbia,
S.C., the region's dry spots include northern Florida, all of South
Carolina, especially the Pee Dee region, southwestern Georgia and
central Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nation as a whole is quite dry,'' said Sam McCown, a
meteorologist with the National Climatic Data Center in Asheville,
N.C. ``There are very few areas that are considered wet.''
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee has been spared serious drought, but forecasters say a
few more days of dry weather could change that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are on the edge. If we go another week without rain, we
could be in trouble,'' said Gene Danekas, a statistician for the
state and federal agriculture departments in Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   Some areas of the nation ``are in the grips of a drought of
historic proportions,'' Deputy Commerce Secretary Robert L. Mallett
said. And there was little promise for relief.
</P>
<P>
   Many parts of the East are 8 to 18 inches below normal rainfall,
and while the outlook is for a return to normal rainfall, that will
not make up the deficit, said James Baker, head of the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``This drought did not happen overnight ... and it will take a
long time to be alleviated,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said the drought has not
affected commodity and consumer prices because it is not impacting
the large growing regions of the Midwest and California.
</P>
<P>
   By being concentrated in the East, the dry period has been
particularly hard on smaller farmers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The White House will convene a task force of affected federal
agencies ``to coordinate our efforts and focus our attack on this
problem,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The president also said he thinks Congress will come through
with emergency farm money soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``There needs to be a special provision to deal with the drought
crisis, and I hope ... and believe that there will be,'' Clinton
said in response to a reporter's question about criticism of the
administration's efforts so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish we could have done it before the August recess,''
Clinton said, referring to a vacation break in Congress. ``But I
think it will be there in time to aid the farmers.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate approved $7.4 billion in emergency farm aid on
Wednesday. The House will consider an emergency aid package after
the recess.

JAPAN'S RULING PARTY SAYS IT WON'T PRESS ON BONDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By STEPHANIE STROM    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ The ruling Liberal Democratic Party said Friday that it
would not press the Bank of Japan to buy Japanese government bonds
that are likely to be used to finance further fiscal stimulus
programs.
</P>
<P>
   The issue had become a major point of contention between the
central bank and politicians, who were worried earlier this year
that Japan's rapidly growing debts would force them to raise
interest rates to attract buyers for new government bond issues.
</P>
<P>
   The standoff attracted the interest of economists and
international investors, who viewed it it as a test of Japan's
commitment to free-market principles, one of which is the
maintenance of a central bank free of political interference.
</P>
<P>
   Michio Ochi, chairman of the party's Financial Issues Research
Council, said that the party thought there were other ways to keep
interest rates low now that the economy had shown signs of
stability. ``We are discussing how to develop the bond market so
that it will no longer be necessary to discuss underwriting by the
Bank of Japan,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Bank of Japan has campaigned vigorously against the proposal
since politicians floated it in February, saying that forcing it to
buy bonds would cause inflation, undermine confidence in its
independence and possibly lead to a downgrade of Japan's credit
quality by ratings agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the improving economic outlook here provided the
underpinning for the party's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember in January and February, we still had very much of a
sense of crisis here in Japan, and as a result of that, there were
calls for all kinds of policies, radical policies, to be taken,''
said Jesper Koll, chief economist at Merrill Lynch in Tokyo. ``Now,
the economy has stabilized, the sense of crisis has abated and they
can start to be politically correct again.''

</P>
<P>
   Employers added an estimated 310,000 nonfarm jobs in July, 50
percent more than analysts had anticipated, suggesting that
economic growth rebounded early in the summer after tailing off in
the spring. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate in July remained
steady at 4.3 percent, the Labor Department said.

<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Waste Management Inc. was in trouble as its board
met for dinner four weeks ago at the Four Seasons Hotel near its
headquarters in Houston. Its chairman and chief executive was
sidelined by a brain tumor.
</P>
<P>
   The company had just announced that earnings would be below
projections, sending its stock plunging 37 percent in one day. To
make matters worse, many executives had sold shares in the weeks
before the bad news was revealed, prompting a bevy of shareholder
lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   The directors knew they needed to put one of their number in
command. Looking around the room, their eyes fell upon a person
whom most corporate executives and directors would have once kept
as far from the board table as possible _ Ralph V. Whitworth.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, Whitworth had been a corporate raider, an aide to
the Texas oilman T. Boone Pickens. In the early 1990s, he was a
corporate gadfly, railing against overpaid executives and
underperforming companies.
</P>
<P>
   On this Monday, however, he was elected Waste Management's
interim chairman. ``It was a good, warm, fuzzy feeling all
around,'' said Steve Miller, a board member and himself a former
chairman of the company.
</P>
<P>
   There is no better measure of the growing power of investors
than the fact that a corporate critic can become a chairman of a
Fortune 500 company. Indeed, Whitworth is the avatar of a trend:
With a style that is surprisingly low-key for a one-time
rabble-rouser, he is helping transform the role of shareholder
activist from outside agitator to inside operator.
</P>
<P>
   Relational Investors LLC, an investment fund he runs with David
H. Batchelder, takes stakes in companies it thinks are
under-performing and need shaking up. Many, in Relational's view,
have dysfunctional boards or executives who disdain shareholder
interests. Relational then uses its leverage as a shareholder to
try to bring about change, gaining board seats if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've heard of extreme sports,'' said Nell Minow, a principal
of Lens Investment Management, a fund in Washington, D.C., with a
similar strategy. ``This is extreme shareholder activism.''
</P>
<P>
   The approach is not that surprising, given that the biggest
investor in Whitworth's fund is the California Public Employees
Retirement System, or Calpers, the huge and powerful pension fund
that has long been a leader in activist investing.
</P>
<P>
   Fueled by $750 million in investor funds _ including $500
million from Calpers _ Whitworth, 43, has become the chairman of
Apria Healthcare Group, a home health care provider in Costa Mesa,
Calif., that he seems to have turned around. And last month he won
a board seat at Tektronix, an Oregon electronics company.
</P>
<P>
   But Waste Management could prove the most daunting test of
whether such shareholders can make good managers. Only two weeks
after Whitworth was named acting chairman, the company lowered its
second-quarter earnings projections for a second time. And
Whitworth got a taste of his own medicine, as angry investors on a
conference call contended that the company was out of control.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no turmoil here,'' he replied, somewhat defensively.
</P>
<P>
   There are, of course, precedents for what Relational Investors
is doing.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate raiders and leveraged-buyout firms look for situations
ripe for restructuring. But their strategy is to buy the company.
Relational Investors acts more as a catalyst than a conqueror, with
the target company remaining public.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Price, the mutual fund manager, used big shareholdings
to help force the merger of Chase Manhattan and Chemical Bank. But
many institutional investors become involved with companies only if
an investment goes sour.
</P>
<P>
   Relational actively looks for underperforming companies it can
fix, a strategy sometimes called relationship or relational
investing. Similar funds include Greenway Partners, formed by
former aides to Carl Icahn; Trinity I Fund, run by Thomas Taylor, a
fund manager for the Bass brothers of Texas; Active Value, based in
London, and Lawndale Capital in San Francisco. Relational is one of
the biggest and, along with Lens, the best known.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly isn't unknown in the past for key investors in
troubled companies to step into leadership roles,'' said Scott
Fenn, executive director of the Investor Responsibility Research
Center in Washington. ``What is a newer phenomenon is to take
positions in companies from a governance perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   But Whitworth says taking a board seat is a last resort. Between
them, Whitworth and Batchelder, 50, are on the boards of only 4 of
the 24 companies they have invested in, though that is a majority
of their seven current holdings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ultimate success for us is if we can get the companies to
undertake the changes on their own without the need for us to get
intensely involved,'' Whitworth said. ``But we have to be willing
and able to get intensely involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Relational has had an annualized return of 33.8 percent from its
inception in March 1996 through June 30 of this year, according to
Calpers. Its return for the year ending June 30 was 31 percent, and
its three-year return was an annualized 38.2 percent, surpassing
the 22.8 percent and 29.1 percent returns of the Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 for the same periods.
</P>
<P>
   For the stocks it has already sold out of, Relational reports an
annualized return of 76 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that performance, relationship investing is a risky
business. Board membership makes an investor a corporate insider,
limiting the freedom to buy and sell shares, and subjects the
investor to shareholder lawsuits. It can raise suspicions among
other shareholders that the one with the board seat will benefit at
their expense.
</P>
<P>
   There are also questions about whether such activists have the
vision to work for the long-term future of the company or just want
to produce a quick uptick in the stock and sell out.
</P>
<P>
   Nor does board membership come with the guarantee of a
turnaround. Taylor, the Bass Brothers' fund manager, was on the
board of Loewen Group, a Canadian funeral home company, when it
sought bankruptcy protection. John A. Bricker Jr. of Sandera
Partners, another activist investor, was on the board of General
Housewares of Terre Haute, Ind., but could not get the company to
follow his advice.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Greenway Partners lost a proxy fight to elect
directors of Venator Group Inc., the company once known as
Woolworth. And Lens has never won a board seat at a company in its
portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Relational, as well, typically meets with resistance from
executives. But Whitworth is disarmingly persuasive and personable,
skills he honed during his time as a Washington lobbyist. He has
avoided proxy fights so far, although he has threatened them on
occasion.
</P>
<P>
   At Tektronix, where an unprofitable video equipment business was
bleeding the company, the chief executive, Jerome J. Meyer,
initially opposed giving Whitworth a seat on the board when
Relational emerged earlier this year with a nearly 10 percent
stake.
</P>
<P>
   But after checking Relational's track record, Meyer changed his
mind. ``It's quite a different situation from the fast-buck guys,''
Meyer told The Oregonian last month. He declined to be interviewed
for this article.
</P>
<P>
   In return for the seat, Relational agreed not to wage a proxy
fight and to limit its stake to 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Whitworth learned early the value of fixing things. As a
teen-ager in his tiny, remote hometown of Winnemuca, Nev., he loved
to repair appliances. His ability to fix the city's irrigation
system landed him a job as superintendent of parks at the age of
19.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, he headed to the University of Nevada at Reno and
then to law school at Georgetown. His father, a mining engineer,
died while he was in college, so Whitworth worked his way through
law school, for Nevada Sen. Paul Laxalt, and sent money home to his
family. He also worked in President Ronald Reagan's 1984
re-election campaign, keeping his student status to himself.
</P>
<P>
   His political work led to his meeting Pickens. Whitworth briefly
dated the oilman's daughter, Liz, but his work relationship with
the father lasted longer. Whitworth joined Mesa Petroleum, where he
participated in efforts to take over companies like Unocal and
Newmont Mining. It was there that he also met Batchelder, Pickens'
right-hand man.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, Pickens set up the United Shareholders Association in
Washington to champion the rights of small shareholders. He put
Whitworth in charge. While the organization was sometimes derided
as merely a front for Pickens' political ambitions, Whitworth
became a shareholder activist to be reckoned with.
</P>
<P>
   United Shareholders published a list of 50 companies each year
that it made the target of negative publicity and a barrage of
shareholder resolutions. Its proxy battle with IBM helped pressure
the board into ousting its president, John Akers.
</P>
<P>
   Whitworth also lobbied in 1992 for regulatory changes that,
among other things, made it possible for dissidents to nominate
only one or two directors to a board, rather than an entire slate.
This later became key to Relational's strategy.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1993, United Shareholders did something extraordinary for
a Washington lobbying group. It declared that it had accomplished
its goals and shut down. Others suspected that Pickens, who had
faded from the limelight, had grown tired of subsidizing the group.
Whitworth worked at the association without pay, supporting himself
as a corporate lobbyist.
</P>
<P>
   By this time, Whitworth had received a telephone call from his
old Mesa colleague, Batchelder, who was running a
mergers-and-acquisition advisory firm in San Diego. Calpers was
looking to invest in an activist fund, Batchelder told him, so the
two teamed up and won out over about seven other contenders.
</P>
<P>
   Calpers concluded that it could not get so actively involved
itself in companies, but figured that it could improve the overall
performance of its portfolio by having Relational stalk a few
underperformers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You only have to bring down a couple of wildebeests to get the
herd moving in the right direction,'' said Sheryl Pressler, chief
investment officer of Calpers. Other investors in Relational
include Hermes, an activist British pension fund, and the pension
funds of Maryland and San Diego County.
</P>
<P>
   Batchelder, whose advisory firm is in an adjoining suite,
provides financial acumen to Relational. A third managing member,
Joel L. Reed, who also comes from the Texas oil industry, mainly
works for Batchelder's firm. Whitworth is often Relational's face
to its targets.
</P>
<P>
   Friends and associates describe Whitworth as honest and
thoughtful, cool in a crisis and graceful.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows everyone on my staff,'' said Sarah Teslik, executive
director of the Council of Institutional Investors, a
Washington-based association of pension funds. ``He knows the
lowest of the low. He knows about their spouses.''
</P>
<P>
   Because he can talk to anyone, she said, she sits him next to
the shyest people at her functions. When Ms. Teslik mentioned to
Whitworth that she had hurt her knee running, a book on runners'
medical problems soon showed up in the mail.
</P>
<P>
   Whitworth describes himself as a family man who tries to get
home by 5 p.m. He likes to cook, and his designs for columns on the
veranda of his former home on the Potomac River in Washington were
featured in some architecture magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Here in San Diego, the walls and shelves of his office are
festooned with photographs of his two young children and his wife,
Wendy Walker, the executive producer of the ``Larry King Show.''
CNN built a control room in the couple's new home in Rancho Santa
Fe, north of San Diego, so that Ms. Walker could work there almost
as if she were in King's Washington or Los Angeles studios.
</P>
<P>
   Whitworth's political instincts have helped in his corporate
battles. Relational picks its fights carefully. In fact, some
corporate executives say the fund merely jumps in the front of
moving parades.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of what they are about with regard to corporate
governance we were well on the way to accomplishing,'' said Douglas
L. Foshee, chairman and chief executive of Nuevo Energy, a Houston
oil company where Relational has a 9.65 percent stake and
Batchelder holds a board seat.
</P>
<P>
   Tektronix officials say they decided on their own to split into
two companies and sell off a money-losing division, all things that
Whitworth pushed for. Whitworth took a board seat, he said, to make
sure that the company goes through with the restructuring.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Relational invested in the Storage Technology Corp., a
Colorado company that makes data storage devices, urging a $1
billion stock buyback. Michael Klatman, vice president for
corporate relations, said Storage had already decided by then on a
buyback, though not on its size. Other investors had been urging a
similar course, he said, though Relational set itself apart by
doing its own financial analysis.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of months later, Whitworth went public with his
demands. Soon, Storage announced an $800 million buyback, about
twice as large as analysts had been expecting. Whoever deserves the
credit, the stock shot up, and Relational sold out with a profit of
$14.6 million on its investment of $44.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Whitworth concedes that Relational's ideas are rarely new. ``We
get more opportunities from the `Ready, aim, aim, aim' syndrome,''
he said. ``The company knows what needs to be done but can't pull
the trigger.''
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, Relational has profited from a stock's rise, even
though it hasn't forced the company to do anything. It also has
suffered reverses: a big loss on its investment in Nuevo and
smaller losses in companies like the Moore Corp., an office
supplies maker, and Pennzoil.
</P>
<P>
   Till recently, Whitworth's biggest challenge had been Apria
Healthcare. The company was created in a 1995 merger, and each of
the merging companies placed four members on the new board,
resulting in deadlock.
</P>
<P>
   ``The struggle permeated the whole company,'' Whitworth said.
``It was an absolute disaster, and the business began to
disintegrate.''
</P>
<P>
   Relational invested in 1997, and Whitworth, threatening a proxy
fight, pushed himself onto the board the next January, becoming
chairman that April. Then, at a meeting in May, Whitworth invited
the other board members, one by one, outside the room, Within a few
hours, five directors had resigned.
</P>
<P>
   ``They all resigned of their own accord,'' recalled Richard H.
Koppes, the former general counsel of Calpers who was brought onto
the board by Whitworth. ``He just has the kind of skills to operate
within that crisis situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitworth brought in a new board and a new chief executive. The
staff was cut, nonperforming businesses sold and profits restored.
Apria's stock, which fell below $3 last year, closed on Friday at
$19. Relational now owns 22 percent of the company, at an average
purchase price of $12.59 a share.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's why one board seat is so significant,'' Batchelder said.
``As soon as you infused Ralph as the ninth director, the swing
vote, everything changed overnight.''
</P>
<P>
   At Apria's annual meeting last month, the main question from
shareholders was when Relational would sell its stake. Not for a
while, Whitworth said.
</P>
<P>
   Now his crisis skills will be tested at Waste Management, a
company with a history of accounting and management problems.
</P>
<P>
   Whitworth's involvement began when he was recruited to help USA
Waste Services, another trash hauler, acquire Waste Management.
Relational invested $71.2 million in Waste Management before the
acquisition, selling its shares for a profit of $28.6 million and
also earning a fee as an adviser on the deal.
</P>
<P>
   He was named to the board of the merged company, which kept the
Waste Management name. Relational now owns 1.2 million shares, a
small stake purchased at a price that Batchelder said was in the
low $40s.
</P>
<P>
   Whitworth was appointed acting chairman because he was the head
of the board's governance committee _ and also because he had the
time to get heavily involved. He is working with two other board
members on an executive committee _ Roderick Hills, a former
chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and Jerome
York, who works for Kirk Kerkorian, the financier.
</P>
<P>
   York had recruited Whitworth to help in both Kerkorian's attempt
to take over the Chrysler Corp. in 1995 and USA Waste's effort to
take over Waste Management.
</P>
<P>
   They are scrambling to devise a plan to be put before the board
on Friday for selling underperforming assets and using some of the
proceeds for a stock buyback. The stock is now at $23.875, less
than half the $60 it reached on May 4, its recent peak.
</P>
<P>
   The company must also replenish its management. When the second
earnings revision in a month occurred, Whitworth pushed out the
chief financial officer and accepted the resignation of the general
counsel. He said it was premature to look for a new chief executive
because the current one, John E. Drury, still may recover from his
brain cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Whitworth said the company's troubles stem from poor
projections, not from being a poor business. ``The merged company
won't do everything it was expected to do,'' he said in an
interview. ``But there's no question it's a better company than the
two separate companies.''
</P>
<P>
   His fellow shareholders hardly seemed convinced, though some
said they were happy he was there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It always provides comfort when the insiders are significant
shareholders,'' said Alan Benasuli, a portfolio manager at European
Investors Inc. in New York. But he said a stock buyback, much as he
would like the stock price to go up, would be ``ludicrous,''
because of the company's high debt level.
</P>
<P>
   Whitworth disputes any contention that investors like him go
only for short-term fixes, saying that he can only sell a stock at
a profit if the company's long-term prospects are better than when
he bought.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is one change you could make in corporate America, it
would be to put a large shareholder on the board of every
company,'' he said. ``Certainly their incentives are such that you
are going to get better decisions out of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, at Waste Management, he will get a chance to prove it.

YASTRZEMSKI PRAISES RED SOX TEAM PHYSICIAN PAPPAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Carl Yastrzemski says his career with the Red Sox would have
ended a lot sooner, if not for one man _ Dr. Arthur Pappas. ``I
don't understand what all the criticism is about,'' Yastrzemski
said this week, after Pappas took some verbal heat from present Red
Sox players. ``This man is one hell of a doctor. He kept me on the
field for the last five or six years. Without him, I couldn't have
played. I had a real bad back and I never knew when it was going
out on me. He constantly had to help me with my back, getting me
back on the field. I can't tell you how many times I went up to
UMass-Worcester to get treated by him. I remember one time he
wanted to test me swinging before he would let me play again. There
wasn't a bat around, so he had me swing a shovel to prove I could
swing again without re-injuring the back. I think Dr. Pappas has
done a great job for the ballclub.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Mike Foley of St. Elizabeth's Hospital in Boston, who also
works for the Red Sox, is another big supporter of Pappas. ``I've
seen him at work for the past 20 years and he is one of the best
orthopedic doctors you could possibly have,'' Foley said. ``He is
regarded as one of the best in the country. If anything was wrong
with anyone in my family with any kind of orthopedic problem, he
would be the first one I would send them to. He absolutely always
has the best interests of his patients at heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Pappas was criticized by shortstop Nomar Garciaparra after the
word came down that closer Tom Gordon could be out for the year
with an elbow problem. Garciaparra also was upset about the
treatment his friend Lou Merloni received from Pappas a year ago,
when Pappas apparently misdiagnosed a stress fracture.
</P>
<P>
   Pappas, a part-owner of the team, has been with the Sox for 22
years. This reporter has criticized his dual role as owner/doctor
for years and still maintains he should do one or the other, not
both. Pappas is held in high regard in the local medical community,
and it is doubtful that the Sox could get someone of his caliber to
replace him. But if he wants to stay the Sox' top doctor, he should
sell his interest in the team. Then there wouldn't be any question
of his possibly giving an injured player a clean bill of health in
the best interests of the team, and not the player. The present
ownership isn't going to be around here much longer, so now might
be the right time to do make the move.

   Remember all the questions after the All-Star Game, asking why
Yaz didn't wear a Red Sox cap during the pregame introductions of
the all-time all-stars? Here is his explanation: ``The day I
retired at Fenway Park and played my last game, I was running
around the field when it was over saying goodbye to the fans. I
took my hat off and gave it to a little kid in the crowd. Later I
told myself that would be the last time I would ever wear the Sox
hat in Fenway. Before the introductions for the All-Star Game, all
of us were underneath the center-field bleachers waiting to be
introduced. I was talking with Hank Aaron when someone came over
and gave me a Red Sox hat. I thought for a minute that I wouldn't
wear it. But when it came time to be introduced, I was going to
bring it with me and give it to some little kid. When I looked
around, it was gone. Someone took it. It's as simple as that.'' . .
. Yaz on Wade Boggs, Cal Ripken, and Tony Gwynn all pursuing 3,000
hits at the same time. ``Boggs is the best I have ever seen keeping
his head on the ball until it hits the bat. No one has ever done it
better. I always admired Ripken for the kind of competitor he is
and Gwynn for his ability to hit the ball all over the park. I also
like both Ripken and Gwynn because they stayed with the same
organization all the way through their careers. You don't see that
much anymore with guys of their ability.''

   ESPN is generating a lot of interest with its countdown toward
the top athlete of the century. The real question is: How is
``athlete'' defined? If you pick an all-around athlete, then who is
better than Jim Thorpe, who, I believe, was chosen the top athlete
of the first half of the century. Thorpe won the decathlon in the
1912 Olympics, symbolic of the best athlete in the world at that
time. He went on to play major league baseball from 1913 to 1919
and professional football with the Canton Bulldogs; he was a
charter member of the NFL, playing in the league when it was formed
in 1920 until he retired in 1928.
</P>
<P>
   Are they going to say that Michael Jordan, the best basketball
player ever, is a better athlete than Thorpe? Jordan couldn't even
excel at minor league baseball.
</P>
<P>
   I'm guessing that the final five in the ESPN poll will be 1.
Babe Ruth; 2. Jordan; 3. Muhammad Ali; 4. Jack Nicklaus; and 5. Jim
Brown.
</P>
<P>
   If they are taking an athlete based on just one sport, it should
be Ruth, who was the greatest lefthanded pitcher in the game until
he switched solely to hitting, then changed the face of the sport
with his home run power. He was also an excellent defensive
outfielder and had a tremendous arm.
</P>
<P>
   The best athlete of the second half of the century was Brown. In
this opinion, he is the greatest football player ever. He also is
regarded by experts as the greatest lacrosse player ever, and was
on the Syracuse track and basketball teams as well.
</P>
<P>
   The most overrated athlete is Ali. He certainly was a great
fighter, but when you lose to Kenny Norton, Leon Spinks, and the
ever-popular Trevor Berbick, among others, you are not the
century's greatest athlete. Rocky Marciano didn't lose to anyone,
and they couldn't find a place for him in the top 50?

   Red Auerbach on the Celtics' latest moves: ``I thought we did
well. (Ron) Mercer didn't want to be here. And he tells Denver he
won't show there either until he gets the contract extension.
(Danny) Fortson will really help us. He's a bull. He plays hard.
He's something like fourth in the league in rebounding. If Kenny
Anderson comes back ready to play, and he's healthy and stays
healthy, then we should be much better than we were last year.''
Personally, I never liked Mercer's game. A terrific jump shooter,
but he couldn't create his own shot and didn't give much effort at
the defensive end . . . Word is that the Patriots' new stadium in
Foxborough will be similar to the Ravens' stadium in Baltimore,
which, in the opinion of this humble scribe, is the best NFL
stadium to date. Patriots owner Bob Kraft, as a member of the NFL
stadium committee, in recent years has had the luxury of looking at
the plans for all the new stadiums in the league. He has taken what
he feels is the best of what he has seen and incorporated it into
the plans for this stadium.

   David Duval was right when he asserted that not enough money
from the Ryder Cup goes to the players, but the money should go to
charity, not into the players' pockets. If the Ryder Cup players
are in the top 12 in earnings, they don't need another paycheck.
However, with a gross of $65 million coming in for this year's
Ryder Cup at Brookline, and some $25 million-$30 million in
profits, each player's $5,000 stipend is nothing. Why doesn't the
PGA allow each of the 12 players and the captain to designate, say,
$250,000 each toward his favorite charity? That way the players
still would be playing for no pay and keeping in the spirit of the
Ryder Cup, yet at the same time they'd be doing something good for
their community. As it stands, the PGA takes about 75 percent of
the money, with the rest going to the host club.
</P>

   Incidentally, when the US team comes to Brookline to practice
Aug. 30, the club will be closed to all except the players and club
members. The practice session is not open to the public.

   There's something about the Patriots getting rid of Willie Clay
that doesn't fit. They have no one left in the secondary that has
ever done what was his most important job on the field _ putting
all the backs around him in the right place and making sure they
know their assignments before the ball is snapped. Lawyer Milloy is
one of the best players in the game, but the task is going to be a
burden on him and could hurt his own play. Between the Detroit
Lions and Patriots, Clay had been around long enough to have seen
just about every offensive formation ever designed. Generally, one
busted assignment in the secondary translates to 7 points in the
NFL. If Clay wasn't doing the job last year, how come he started
every game? And seeing he hasn't played a game since last season,
how did he get worse? The Patriots claim they tried to trade him as
far back as the draft and there was no interest . . . Art Dunphy
went out the right way. The former Boston University publicist
recently retired from the Boston Public Library, and his final
project won best of show in a contest by the Publicity Club of New
England. Dunphy's campaign celebrating the BPL's 150th anniversary
got a ``Super Bell Award,'' coming in first among 240 entries . . .
The Boston schools are going to lose two great coaches when Joe
Mason of Dorchester High and Mike Sheeran of Charlestown High hang
them up at the end of the coming school year. Both started coaching
in Boston in 1961 . . . How is this for loading up? Boston College
will play Penn State at home in 2004; Arizona State here in 2005;
and Tennessee, the reigning national football champion, here in
2007 . . . There are some veterans on the Patriots who feel Pete
Carroll's outburst chewing out the players on the practice field
this week was staged, as part of Pete's new ``get-tough'' image. If
you are going to chew out a team, you do it in the locker room
after practice, or in the meeting room that night, when only the
assistant coaches and players are around. You don't do it with the
fans and media nearby unless you want everyone to know what you are
up to . . . Bob Lobel proves that Major League Baseball juiced up
the balls used at the All-Star Game home run hitting contest in
Fenway Park, and no one seems to care. Next time, we should get
Tiger Woods, give him a driver, and let him hit Titleists into the
Charles River. Because the balls Mark McGwire and company were
hitting were smaller and lighter than regular baseballs, it makes
the whole contest a sham. Yet no one seems to care.

LAWYERS IN LEWIS CIVIL SUIT SET MEETING IN SEPTEMBER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SACHA PFEIFFER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Six weeks after the Reggie Lewis medical malpractice
suit ended in mistrial, attorneys for Donna Harris-Lewis and Dr.
Gilbert H. Mudge Jr. are gearing up to try the case again _ even as
the judge overseeing the matter encourages both sides to settle out
of court.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Harris-Lewis, Lewis's widow, and Mudge, the late
athlete's chief cardiologist, will meet Sept. 10 for a pretrial
``status conference'' at which Judge Thayer Fremont-Smith is
expected to query both parties on settlement possibilities,
according to several people close to the case.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, sources have confirmed that the insurance carrier for
a fourth doctor, Dr. John D. Rutherford, paid Harris-Lewis $500,000
in a settlement before the case went to trial.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement did not require Rutherford to admit guilt or
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   A person familiar with the deal called Rutherford's settlement
``short money, considering that the guy saved himself nearly two
months of trial and many, many flights to and from Boston.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bridget Asaro, an attorney for Harris-Lewis, said the amount
was appropriate because she viewed Rutherford as the least culpable
of the four defendants.
</P>
<P>
   In late June, after nearly seven weeks of testimony and six days
of deliberations, a 15-person jury could not agree on whether Mudge
was negligent in his treatment of the Celtics star before his 1993
death. Lewis collapsed and died while shooting baskets at Brandeis
University.
</P>
<P>
   Mudge's two co-defendants, Drs. Peter L. Friedman and Mark A.
Creager, were cleared of malpractice charges by the jury.
Harris-Lewis has appealed those verdicts.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Fremont-Smith ordered Harris-Lewis to pay nearly
$20,000 in trial costs to attorneys for Friedman and Creager _ an
amount that excludes legal fees _ but stayed the order pending
resolution of the appeals.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Fremont-Smith's urgings, there has yet to be any
``summit meeting'' between the two sides to discuss settlement
possibilities, according to a person close to the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the trial ended, the landscape is different for
everyone,'' the source said. ``Mudge has now seen what an entire
trial will do to him and his family. Donna has seen the gamble of a
trial. Everyone has been educated.''

VOLVO BUYS RIVAL, CREATING WORLD'S 2ND LARGEST TRUCK AND BUS
MAKER  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN:   Sweden, Japan, Italy, Mich.)   By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a $7.4 billion deal that will create the world's second
largest maker of trucks and buses, AB Volvo of Sweden is buying one
of its arch rivals, Swedish truck maker Scania.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, announced Friday in Sweden, comes just 15 months
after the merger of Chrysler and Daimler created the world's
largest truck and bus maker.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the deal, Volvo will buy the 49 percent of
Scania's shares now owned by Investor AB, the holding company that
is the main investment vehicle for Sweden's wealthy Wallenberg
family.
</P>
<P>
   Volvo will pay Investor 315 Swedish kronor per share or about
$38.55 in cash for 60 percent of the shares; the rest of the
payment will be either in cash, or in a swap of six shares of newly
issued Volvo stock for every five Scania shares. Volvo also said
that it will offer a similar deal for all remaining outstanding
shares of Scania.
</P>
<P>
   The deal did not surprise analysts, who had been expecting Volvo
to announce an acquisition ever since it sold its car business to
Ford Motor Co. earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one thought they were getting out of passenger cars so they
could sit around idly and reap 5 percent on their cash,'' said
James N. Kelleher, an analyst with Argus Research.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors have surfaced throughout the year that Volvo was looking
at Deere, Case, Navistar, Cummins Engines and other players in the
truck market. ``This takes a little heat off other companies that
thought they were targets,'' said Robert S. Murley, an investment
banker at Credit Suisse First Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, there were early signs that Volvo had its sights set
on Scania. Volvo had been accumulating Scania shares throughout
1999, and already owned 13 percent of its rival when it began
negotiating with Investor to buy its stake.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Volvo's and Scania's shared nationality makes the deal a
bit unusual in the rapidly consolidating truck industry. It has
been far more common for companies in different countries to set up
alliances, if not full mergers, in order to take advantage of each
other's markets.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors, for example, has a 49 percent stake in Japan's
Isuzu. The partnership gives GM's truck division an edge in eastern
markets, while the link to GM helps Isuzu in the United States and
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, there was speculation that Italy's Fiat would
try to buy Investor's share of Scania.
</P>
<P>
   For most of these companies, more is at stake than added truck
revenue. Many automotive companies view sales of commercial trucks
as a way to establish their brands in emerging economies.
</P>
<P>
   The Scania-Volvo deal will create a truck manufacturer that had
combined sales of $15.8 billion last year, and a work force of
about 76,000. Scania will remain a separate unit in Volvo, with its
own brands and distribution networks, but the sister divisions are
expected to combine purchasing clout, eliminate duplicate overhead,
and otherwise cut costs.
</P>
<P>
   While rival trucking companies expect the merged company to be a
major market force, few seem truly worried. ``Commercial trucks are
a fiercely competitive market segment, and this partnership will
escalate the competitiveness,'' said Dan Flores, a spokesman for GM
Truck Group. ``But it is not going to have any impact on our
long-term strategy or our partnership with Isuzu.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors apparently feel Scania got the best of the deal.
Scania American Depository Receipts rose $7.1875 or 24 percent to
$37.50. Volvo ADRs fell $2.50 or 8.3 percent to $27.50.

HEARST TO BUY SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE, LIKELY TO MERGE IT WITH
EXAMINER 
</HEADLINE>
   (ART ADV: Graphic is being sent to NYT graphic clients.
Non-subscribers can make individual purchase by calling (888)
603-1036 or (888) 346-9867.)  
 (bl)  
 By ALEX KUCZYNSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hearst Corp., the owner of The San Francisco Examiner, said
Friday that it was buying The San Francisco Chronicle, increasing
the likelihood that San Francisco will join the growing list of
one-newspaper cities.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst said that it would try to sell The Examiner, William
Randolph Hearst's first newspaper in his legendary empire, but that
if no buyers emerged it would combine the two papers.
</P>
<P>
   A morning newspaper with a circulation of about 475,000 readers,
The Chronicle is owned by the family descended from the deYoung
brothers, who founded the paper in 1865.
</P>
<P>
   The Examiner, an afternoon paper, has been owned by the Hearst
family since the 1880s, and for a number of decades it has borne
the slogan ``Monarch of the Dailies.'' But the Examiner's
circulation is just over 114,000.
</P>
<P>
   The sale marks the end of an increasingly unhappy era for both
publications, which have been run under under a joint operating
agreement since 1965.
</P>
<P>
   While neither side would disclose the amount of the transaction,
industry analysts estimated the price at approximately $500
million. The deal also includes SF Gate, the San Francisco Bay
Area's leading Web site.
</P>
<P>
   According to antitrust guidelines established by the Justice
Department, which state that a single corporation can own no more
than one major newspaper per city, Hearst will have to make a
good-faith effort to sell the Examiner. If the newspaper is not
sold, which newspaper-industry analysts predicted would be the most
likely outcome, the staff of the Examiner will be combined with
that of The Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   In a noontime meeting with staff members at The Chronicle,
Hearst chief executive Frank Bennack and and Chronicle Publishing
Co. president John Sias told employees that their jobs would be
maintained under the deal. Sias told staff members that Nan Tucker
McEvoy, a deYoung descendant who owns a third of the Chronicle
family stock, was ``devastated'' by the sale.
</P>
<P>
   Still up for sale are other assets of Chronicle Publishing. They
include the San Francisco NBC affiliate KRON-TV, two smaller
newspapers, two other television stations and two publishing
companies. KRON-TV is considered a prize property that could
attract the interest of NBC's parent, General Electric Co.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown said, ``Cities are better
served by having more newspapers rather than fewer newspapers. We
would hope that a buyer would be found for the afternoon
Examiner.''
</P>
<P>
   But some newspaper analysts are already predicting that in the
end, only one paper will survive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hearst is the clear winner here,'' said John Morton, a
newspaper analyst at John Morton &AMP; Associates. ``They are going to
end up publishing the one newspaper in San Francisco. It will be
much more profitable than the agency has ever been because they
will be spared the expense of producing a second newspaper.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Under the current joint operating agreement, the two papers
share business operations but run separate, competitive newsrooms.
On Sundays, the two newspapers produce a joint newspaper, The San
Francisco Examiner and Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco Newspaper Agency, which runs the shared
advertising and production operations of the two newspapers, has
about 3,200 employees, about 1,000 of whom are represented by at
least 10 unions. Despite The Examiner's smaller circulation, the
owners of The Examiner have always taken an aggressive public
stance, declaring that they have no intention of shutting the
operation.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of unions representing workers at The Chronicle, The
Examiner and the Agency have been in touch with Justice Department
antitrust experts and specialists in joint operating arrangements,
The Examiner web site reported Friday. They had no immediate
comment but have said that any sales arrangement would require that
contracts existing through 2005 be honored.
</P>
<P>
   While Bennack and Sias were adamant in their assertion that no
jobs would be lost, analysts said that, too, was unlikely. Peter
Appert, an equity analyst with Deutsche Bank Alex. Brown, said that
there are no buyers for the Examiner and that the staff would be
folded in.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is that they will most likely combine the morning
and afternoon newspapers,'' Appert said. ``That's reflective of
what's happening in the newspaper industry as a whole and across
the nation, which is the consolidation of morning and afternoon
newspapers and the continuing evolution to one-newspaper cities. In
terms of jobs, they will keep the strongest folks, and through
attrition, buyouts or reassignment, the staff will be reduced.''
</P>
<P>
   Morton put it in darker language: ``People will wither and fall
off the vine.''
</P>
<P>
   Appert said that Hearst had long been frustrated by the growing
unprofitability of the Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   William German, the editor of The Chronicle, said that the mood
among the Chronicle staff Friday was ``calm and positive. People
were asking very sound and sensible questions. They didn't seem to
be fingernail-chewing questions. The staff seems happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Phil Bronstein, the editor of the Examiner, was not available
for comment. He was admitted to a hospital Thursday afternoon with
chest pains and underwent surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The transaction means that the struggle between Hearst and
Knight-Ridder will become more pronounced. With the San Jose
Mercury News, Knight-Ridder competes with The Chronicle in the
Silicon Valley area south of San Francisco Bay, and the
Knight-Ridder newspaper in Contra Costa County competes for
suburban readers east of San Francisco Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Knight-Ridder chairman and chief executive P. Anthony Ridder
said he believed that the Examiner would be closed and the two
papers would be combined.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if that will make my job easier, but it certainly
won't make it harder,'' he said. ``We are used to competing on a
daily combined circulation of 600,000,'' he said, referring to the
circulation of both the Examiner and the Chronicle. ``And I don't
know if they combine the papers, all that circulation is
transferable.''
</P>
<P>
   The largest newspaper in Northern California, The San Francisco
Chronicle was founded as the Daily Dramatic Chronicle in San
Francisco in 1865 by two brothers, Charles and Michael deYoung. The
paper has been owned and operated for the last 134 years since then
by the brothers' heirs. The extended family that owns the paper has
had battles for two decades over the newspaper, wrangling publicly
for control of the newspaper and the company's board several times
during the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   Nion McEvoy, the son of Mrs. McEvoy and a board member, said:
``For the Chronicle staff, at least their future is clear. For the
Examiner staff suddenly everything has shifted. I'm just
speculating, but I imagine they will have to retool their
psyches.''
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco Examiner was taken over by William Randolph
Hearst in 1887; the corporation he founded with that move
eventually became Hearst Corp., which has published the Examiner
for the last 112 years.
</P>
<P>
   Sias, the chairman and chief executive officer of the Chronicle
Co. did not return phone calls seeking comment.

CAPE ELIZABETH RUN FULLY SUBSCRIBED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA HUEBNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As thousands of recreational runners trickled in behind a
stellar field of elite athletes at last summer's inaugural Peoples
Beach to Beacon 10K, race founder Joan Benoit Samuelson was almost
giddy with relief. After months of planning from, literally, the
ground up, she could finally pronounce her pet project _ a road
race in her hometown of Cape Elizabeth, Maine _ a success.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an incredible day,'' said Samuelson, reminiscing
recently about the crystalline weather and thrilling
shoulder-to-shoulder finishes in both the men's and women's races.
``I think the spectators enjoyed it as much as the athletes.''
</P>
<P>
   If the numbers are any indication, a lot of those spectators
appear to have turned into runners. The field, limited to 4,000,
filled up more than two weeks before the race, which steps off
Saturday at 8 a.m. near Crescent Beach before winding its scenic
way, with occasional views of Casco Bay, to the finish line at the
Portland Head lighthouse.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's 3,000 entrants had already made it the state's
largest road race, a fitting tribute to the 42-year-old native
daughter who brought home a gold medal in 1984 from the first
Olympic marathon for women. ``The Maine runners are so excited to
have an event like this in their state,'' said Samuelson.
</P>
<P>
   For the second year, the event _ offering $50,000 in prize money
_ has drawn some of the world's top athletes. The defending
champion is Johannes Mabitle of South Africa, who won last year in
28 minutes 18 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Heading the women's field will be Derartu Tulu, the 1992 Olympic
gold medalist at 10,000 meters from Ethiopia, and Hellen
Kimaiyo-Kipkoskei of Kenya, a close third last year in 32:18 behind
countrywoman Catherine Ndereba (32:15) and American Libbie Hickman
(32:17).
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of who crosses the finish line first, Camp Sunshine
will come out a winner. The camp, a retreat on Sebago Lake in
Casco, Maine, for chronically-ill children and their families, is
this year's designated beneficiary of proceeds from the race,
expected to be more than $30,000. Last year, $25,000 was raised for
Big Brothers/Big Sisters of Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Samuelson will not run in her own event. Often a
winner in the masters division, Samuelson said she is too busy to
even think about competing, but doesn't really mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough not to run, but this is a sport that has given me
so much,'' she said. ``This is one chance to give back.''

BYRON FARWELL, HISTORIAN AND VIRGINIA MAYOR, DIES AT 78  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va., Iowa, Ill., Ohio, Ariz., Canada, Switzerland,
Britain)   By ESTELA DURAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Byron Farwell, a military biographer and historian and a former
mayor of Hillsboro, Va., died on Tuesday at Loudoun County Hospital
in Virginia after a heart attack. He was 78.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Manchester, Iowa, he wrote 13 books, including
biographies and studies of military history, specializing in
British warfare.
</P>
<P>
   Among Farwell's works are ``Queen Victoria's Little Wars,''
``Mr. Kipling's Army'' and a biography of the journalist Henry M.
Stanley called ``The Man Who Presumed.''
</P>
<P>
   He was writing his 15th book, about Allied intervention in
Russia after World War I, when he died. His 14th book, the
Encyclopedia of 19th-Century Land Warfare, will be published next
year.
</P>
<P>
   His interest in military history began with his own service in
the Army during the invasion of North Africa in World War II, and
in the Korean War.
</P>
<P>
   He earned a master's degree in English from the University of
Chicago and attended Ohio State University
</P>
<P>
   With his wife, Ruth, he traveled around the world. In the 1960s
they lived in Switzerland and then in London.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly 30 years he lived in Hillsboro, Va., a town of 125
people in the Blue Ridge hills of Loudoun County, where he fought
the state and federal governments on issues like the census count
and health department regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Farwell was mayor of Hillsboro from 1976 to 1982. He lost the
election for a fourth term after a 17-17 vote. To break the tie, a
name was drawn from a punch bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Farwell also wrote articles and reviews for many publications,
including The New York Times, The Washington Post and Smithsonian.
</P>
<P>
   He worked for the Chrysler Corp. from 1954 to 1971 and was the
director of administration for Chrysler International in Geneva,
Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   Farwell was also a trustee of the Oatlands mansion, operated by
the National Trust for Historic Preservation, near Leesburg, Va.,
and held fellowships from the Royal Society of Literature and the
Royal Geographic Society. He was also a Wallerstein Fellow for the
Institute of government at the University of Virginia from 1978 to
1980.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife; three children, Joyce Lewis of Coal
Harbour, B.C.; Byron J. Farwell of Gilbert, Ariz.; and Lesley
Pesnicak of Stafford, Va.; and three grandchildren.

LET'S JUST KISS AND SAY GOODBYE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Bartender?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, hi, L.A. Surprised to see you before noon.''
</P>
<P>
   Early bird catches the worm, they say. Make it a double tequila.
</P>
<P>
   ``Troubles?''
</P>
<P>
   A woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Say no more.''
</P>
<P>
   Please, let me say more.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was just a figure of speech. Go on.''
</P>
<P>
   She walked out on me yesterday. Just when I thought we finally
had something special. She said she thought we should date other
people. I think she meant (begin ital)she(end ital) should date
other people.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, you may have met her in here. Goes by the initials
N-F-L. Seems like kind of a tease, but she's just outgoing, that's
all. Don't let the devil tattoo fool you. Real pretty face.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of guys seem to think so.''
</P>
<P>
   What'd you mean by that?
</P>
<P>
   ``Sorry. I know I'm supposed to be the sympathetic ear.''
</P>
<P>
   I also think she has her eye on a certain ``other people''
already. Somebody from out of town. Roses keep showing up at the
house with cards signed, ``Houston.'' Didn't take more than a month
of that before I realized something was up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can't slip anything by you.''
</P>
<P>
   I mean, what do I look like, a rube?
</P>
<P>
   ``Um, ready for another drink?''
</P>
<P>
   What frosts me is the sacrifices I made for her. OK, I didn't
exactly (begin ital)make(end ital) sacrifices, but I promised to
make them, and she acted like that was the biggest commitment she'd
ever had from a man. I thought she loved me.
</P>
<P>
   I even told her I was going to patch the crack in the living
room where the termites come in. Only time I saw her cry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Didn't you go with this, uh, lady once before?''
</P>
<P>
   We were together for a few years, a few years ago. Had a nice
place together in Orange County, then we shared the fixer-upper
near downtown. She moved out, I kept the house.
</P>
<P>
   It ended badly the first time, and I always blamed myself.
Didn't show her enough attention. A woman like that deserved
better. I vowed I'd make it up to her someday. Now it looks like
I've blown that too. Guess I'm not good enough for her.
</P>
<P>
   ``There, there. Want some advice?''
</P>
<P>
   You're a bartender _ who else would I ask for advice?
</P>
<P>
   ``I do try to be the voice of experience and common sense,
especially when business is slow, as it tends to be at 9 a.m. Now,
you probably don't want to hear this, because it's obvious you
carry quite a torch for her. . . .''
</P>
<P>
   You know how it is. You never miss somebody till they're gone.
Shoot, I'm starting to sound like Yogi Berra.
</P>
<P>
   ``. . . What I'm getting at is: This tease you want to hitch
your future to, you're better off without her. Somebody like this,
they'll leave, they'll come back, they'll leave, they'll come back.
The waiting will tear you up inside. And nothing you do when she's
there will ever be enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each time she shows up on your front porch, that suitcase in
her hand is packed with nothing but heartbreak.''
</P>
<P>
   Pithy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had this conversation before.''
</P>
<P>
   One more tequila, please.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not driving, are you?''
</P>
<P>
   I walked. Can't afford the parking around here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Am I getting through to you? You have a decision to make. Some
guys, they're willing to put up with someone like her. Those guys,
maybe they don't have the confidence to say no to the constant
demands, or they don't have enough else going on in their lives.
Maybe this `Houston' is like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you're different. You're smart, strong, worldly, popular,
wealthy. You don't need Miss N-F-L and all her aggravation. It's
time to tell her, `Go ahead, date other people, and don't come
running back to me!' ''
</P>
<P>
   You left out ``good-looking.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm cutting you off.''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks. And you know what? You are getting through to me. I've
let her rule my life for too long. She's always known I'd be here,
ready with a warm hug and a cold Budweiser, whenever she knocked on
the door. Well, let's just see what happens if I don't answer the
door the next time!
</P>
<P>
   She and I are through! This guy is moving on!
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll be happier in the long run.''
</P>
<P>
   Damn right! One thing. She still has a key to my place. If you
see her, can you get it from her, and I'll pick it up next time I'm
in?
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, if she's in the neighborhood, ask her to drop it by
the house. Maybe we could talk. &QL;

EDITORIAL: A TEST FOR KOREA  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, August 7:
</P>
<P>
   The near-collapse of Daewoo Group, one of the large
conglomerates that dominate the South Korean economy, is presenting
a test for the government of President Kim Dae-jung. Its
performance so far is not reassuring.
</P>
<P>
   Daewoo came close to bankruptcy last month, a fate that was
averted only when Korean creditors put up more money in exchange
for extensive collateral. At first the government said that those
creditors would be in charge of the restructuring, but then it
seemed to reverse itself and left the company's management in
charge. There are good reasons to doubt that the management is
prepared to take the steps _ of selling off assets and granting
stock to the creditors _ that are needed.
</P>
<P>
   Ominously, there are indications that Daewoo intends to treat
its foreign creditors worse than its local ones as it reorganizes.
Thirteen foreign banks have complained that they are being kept in
the dark regarding what is going on. They are also angry that they
were not offered the opportunity to share in the new collateral.
Daewoo says it will talk to the banks in due course.
</P>
<P>
   Daewoo, whose debts total $57 billion, overextended itself by
entering businesses in which it was unable to make money. The banks
that financed that reckless expansion may well lose money, and no
one should shed a tear for them if they do.
</P>
<P>
   But it is important that domestic creditors not be given
preferential treatment, and that creditors as a group be able to
take control of the company if an amicable restructuring agreement
cannot be reached. Any other result would send the message that
Korea's biggest conglomerates continue to have enough political
power to force others to pay for their mistakes.

BANKING EXPERT NOMINATED TO BE FED VICE CHAIRMAN
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   President Clinton Friday nominated Roger W. Ferguson Jr., a
management and technology expert whose monetary views are not
widely known in the investment community, to be vice chairman of
the Federal Reserve.
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson, who has served as a Fed governor for two years, was a
banking-industry consultant and partner at McKinsey &AMP; Co. in New
York before he joined the Fed. He is viewed as an expert in the
operations of banks and financial institutions, an important
specialty as the year 2000 nears. Only the third African-American
appointed a Fed governor, he would be the first to serve as vice
chairman.
</P>
<P>
   While the appointment would raise Ferguson's profile
considerably, the Fed's decision-making will still be dominated by
its chairman, Alan Greenspan. The seven Fed governors form the core
of the 12-member Federal Open Market Committee, which sets
interest-rate policy.
</P>
<P>
   If confirmed by the Senate, Ferguson, 47, would replace Alice
Rivlin, who resigned last month to rejoin the Brookings
Institution.
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson, whow was not widely known before his appointment two
years ago, was brought to the attention of Clinton administration
by Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, a classmate of Ferguson at
Harvard University. Before McKinsey, Ferguson was an attorney at
Davis Polk &AMP; Wardwell, a New York law firm. He received degrees in
economics and law, both with honors, from Harvard, where he later
received a Ph.D. in economics.
</P>
<P>
   The nomination follows Clinton's selection Thursday of Carol
Parry, a former senior executive at Chase Manhattan Bank and an
expert in community reinvestment laws, to replace Susan Phillips, a
Fed governor who resigned last year.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is a strong proponent of community
reinvestment laws, but Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas, chairman of the
Banking Committee, has sought to restrict the laws.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Gramm's committee said Friday that both
``nominations came in too late for Sen. Gramm to have a chance to
look at the papers, so he won't have a comment until after''
Congress resumes in September.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Ferguson by reporters, Clinton responded: ``He is
superbly qualified. He has served well. And I am very excited about
the prospect of his service. I'm glad he's willing to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan said in a statement that Ferguson is ``a person highly
respected by his colleagues,'' and ``an outstanding public servant,
with broad experience and sound judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Kudlow, chief economist at Schroder &AMP; Co. and a former
Reagan administration budget official, said Ferguson's monetary
policy views are little known in the investment community. ``There
may be a discovery process here,'' Kudlow said. ``Up till now, he's
compiled a voting record in accordance with Greenspan, and I think
around the Fed he is viewed more as a management consultant and
administrative guy.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kudlow added that the appointments of Ferguson and Ms. Parry
``may create the potential for two inflation doves who might be at
loggerheads with the chairman's view or certain hawkish views''
among other board members.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rivlin advocated the view that the economy is better able
now to grow without inflation than in past years, and she was more
sympathetic than other governors to the notion that growth and
lower unemployment was an acceptable trade-off for the risk of a
slight increase in prices.
</P>
<P>
   At his confirmation hearing two years ago, Ferguson emphasized
that he believed the Fed's most important mission was price
stability. The Fed's legislative mandate calls for it to promote
maximum employment, but under Greenspan, it has stressed inflation
control. Ferguson also said he was concerned with issues like
income inequality and job creation.
</P>
<P>
   The other African-Americans to serve on the Federal Reserve were
Andrew Brimmer, who was nominated by Lyndon B. Johnson in 1966, and
Emmett Rice, who was nominated by Jimmy Carter in 1979.

DEUTSCHE TELEKOM TO BUY BRITISH CELL PHONE COMPANY FOR $11.1
BILLION 
</HEADLINE>
  (yn) 
 By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Deutsche Telekom AG agreed to buy the British cellular
telephone company One 2 One Ltd. Friday in a deal worth $11.1
billion. The deal is the German phone giant's first big foray
abroad since its attempt to buy Telecom Italia SpA collapsed three
months ago.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition puts Deutsche Telekom in the middle of a
brutally competitive cellular telephone market in Britain. It also
signals a broader move by the company to become a pan-European
telecommunications brand.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Telekom will pay 6.9 billion pounds, or $11.1 billion,
in cash and will assume 1.5 billion pounds ($2.5 billion) in debt
for One 2 One, which is jointly owned by the London-based Cable and
Wireless PLC and MediaOne Group Inc., the Colorado-based Internet
provider recently acquired by AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Telekom's cellular telephone business, known as
T-Mobil, and One 2 One will have a combined base of 10 million
customers. Deutsche Telekom said it expected to enhance the service
to all its customers by expanding their capability to roam, or use
their cellular telephones over a wide geographic area.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement, which ended weeks of rumor and speculation
about a possible deal, means that Cable and Wireless and MediaOne
will finally rid themselves of Britain's smallest cellular
telephone company after a four-month search for a buyer. However,
the price is far less than the two companies had originally
envisioned.
</P>
<P>
   The companies had put One 2 One up for auction, hoping to get as
much as 11 billion pounds ($17 billion). Several companies,
including France Telecom, the German cellular phone network
Mannesmann AG and Telecom Italia Mobile, were said to be bidding
for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it was a steal for Deutsche Telekom, but it is a
pretty good value,'' said Jonathan Adams, a telecommunications
analyst at J.P. Morgan in London.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Telekom, the former state-run German monopoly, has
global aspirations but has not expanded much beyond Germany. Even
with the purchase of One 2 One, more than 90 percent of Deutsche
Telekom's business will be derived domestically.
</P>
<P>
   In May, the company's $93.6 billion takeover bid for Telecom
Italia was thwarted by Olivetti SpA, the former typewriter maker,
which is a fraction of Deutsche Telekom's size.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Telekom's chief executive, Ron Sommer, has raised $11
billion since then by selling additional shares of the company to
help finance acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   Executives close to Deutsche Telekom said it was in discussions
with a number of other telecommunication companies about possible
takeovers or mergers. Among the moves said to be under discussion
was a purchase of France Telecom's 10 percent stake in Sprint, the
U.S. long-distance and local communications provider. It is unclear
whether Deutsche Telekom, which also owns 10 percent of Sprint, has
made any moves to acquire control of the company, but
telecommunications analysts have not ruled this out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly they want to be a player in the pan-European market,''
said Tim Hirst, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney. ``This deal is
the first step.''
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts said Deutsche Telekom was entering an especially
tough market with its purchase of One 2 One, which lags
considerably behind its three larger competitors: Vodafone Airtouch
PLC, the market leader; BT Cellnet Ltd., which just came under the
complete control of British Telecommunications PLC; and Orange PLC.
In addition, One 2 One has yet to enter the lucrative business
market.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult to say it's a red-hot company,'' Hirst said.
``But the U.K. mobile market is strong.''
</P>
<P>
   The sale of One 2 One will help Cable and Wireless shift its
focus from the consumer market to the business market. The deal is
``a further step in repositioning Cable and Wireless,'' said Graham
Wallace, the company's chief executive. Just last week, Cable and
Wireless sold its consumer division to NTL Inc., a New York-based
telecommunications company.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Telecom shares fell .15 euro to 37.50 euros. Cable and
Wireless shares rose 4.4 percent to 765 pence ($12.31). MediaOne
fell 12.5 cents to $70.625.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition of One 2 One is expected to be completed by the
end of September, pending approval from regulators and
shareholders.  &QL;

MICROSOFT ISSUES A FIRST REPAIR FOR OFFICE 97 SECURITY FLAW 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By SARA ROBINSON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Microsoft Corp. released a partial corrective Friday for a
dangerous lapse in security. The flaw appears when the company's
Office 97 group of programs is installed with most versions its Web
browser, Internet Explorer.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft programmed the browser to trust all files created by
its Office programs, and it is possible that an intruder could
create a malicious program that masqueraded as an Office file _ a
Word, Excel or Powerpoint document _ and plant it on a World Wide
Web site or in an e-mail message.
</P>
<P>
   The corrective, released 10 days after Microsoft was alerted to
the problem, does not prevent intruders from exploiting the flaw,
but it installs a trip wire that requires the user to click ``OK''
before an Office file on a Web page or in an e-mail message opens.
It does not warn the user that the document in question could be a
malicious program.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft acknowledged Friday that the change was not a
satisfactory repair but said it was testing a better solution and
planned to make it available to customers during the week of Aug.
16.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the company said, no customers had reported intrusions
related to the flaw. The company posted a security bulletin at a
Web site, www.officeupdate.microsoft.com.
</P>
<P>
   The repair released Friday reconfigures the Internet Explorer so
that an e-mail message containing an embedded Office document
causes a window to pop up. It tells the user that he or she has
chosen to download a file from a Web site and asks if the file
should be opened or saved. The user has the option of clicking
``cancel.''
</P>
<P>
   If the file is saved to the hard drive, however, any malicious
code will still be executed if and when the file is ever opened.
</P>
<P>
   ``The warning is somewhat confusing,'' said Richard Smith, the
president of Phar Lap Software, in Cambridge, Mass., who has
discovered a number of bugs in Microsoft's Windows software. ``Most
people don't know that a Word document can be dangerous.''

IN SAN FRANCISCO, AN UNCERTAIN FUTURE LOOMS FOR REPORTERS AND
EDITORS 
</HEADLINE>
  (With SF-CHRONICLE-HEARST) 
(bl)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO. _ The men and women who pursue the news here
found themselves in the news Friday, and they became the source of
their own journalistic gossip and debate at the M &AMP; M Tavern, the
corner bar where people who work for The San Francisco Examiner and
The San Francisco Chronicle have gathered for decades.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the respective staffs, whose buildings share a block
and whose offices are attached, have heard the rumors that one side
would buy _ and maybe bury _ the other.
</P>
<P>
   The persistent state of uncertainty and expectation left some
feeling relief Friday when the management of each paper gathered
its reporters and editors to announce that Hearst Corp., which owns
the afternoon Examiner, would buy the morning Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   But the announcement raised new questions. Despite assurances
that employees would keep their jobs ``during the transition,''
many wondered how secure their positions would be over the long
haul.
</P>
<P>
   And they are concerned that they will soon be asked to cooperate
in one newsroom, rather than compete. To some long-time reporters
of the scrappier Examiner and the often more institutional
Chronicle, this is like asking the New York Yankees to join forces
with the Boston Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think either staff is happy about cohabitating with
the other,'' said Larry Hatfield, a 30-year member of The
Examiner's staff who holds the title of chief rewrite man. ``We're
friends and colleagues,'' he said ``but we like to kill each other
competitively.''
</P>
<P>
   Carl Hall, president of the Northern California Media Workers
Guild, which represents the news and advertising staff of both
papers, said the situation for employees was ``going to be
tricky.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall, a science reporter at The Chronicle, characterized the
mood at his newspaper as one of disappointment and sadness over the
prospect that the family-owned Chronicle would now be owned by a
``New York-based media giant.''
</P>
<P>
   But reporters and editors at The Chronicle expressed relief that
their jobs look secure for now.
</P>
<P>
   The Examiner's reporters and editors seemed less certain. Many
of them said they hoped their paper would be combined with The
Chronicle rather than sold.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst would be if we were sold to a nonunion paper,'' said
Christine Delsol, an editor in The Examiner's style section.
</P>
<P>
   At the M &AMP; M Tavern _ where pictures of San Francisco journalism
celebrities hang, sometimes crookedly, on the walls _ Taso
Manitsas, the bar's owner, said the merger would deprive the city
of a welcome competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has always been an Examiner and a Chronicle city,'' he
said. ``Now there will be only one.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With passage of a $792-billion tax cut secured,
Congress left for its August recess early Friday and set the stage
for a high-stakes autumn confrontation with President Clinton over
the nation's fiscal priorities in the new era of federal surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   The battle over how to divide the expected $3-trillion windfall
among tax cuts, federal programs and debt reduction through the
next decade is the most far reaching of many ideologically charged
policy disputes expected to come to a head in the fall. Others
include debates over gun control, regulation of managed care and an
overhaul of the campaign finance laws.
</P>
<P>
   On one of those issues, managed health care, House Speaker
Dennis Hastert on Friday tried to divide a group of Republican
dissidents by pledging to bring to the House floor a bill that will
include some expansion of the right to sue. His decision marked the
first time Republican leaders have put forward such a provision,
and it created a rival bill to one agreed to Thursday by Republican
rebels and House Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, with the razor-thin margin in the House
heightening the partisan competition, the two parties in Congress
have put less focus on legislating than on sharpening their
differences for the 2000 campaign. And Republicans believe their
tax cut will help define their identity next year.
</P>
<P>
   It is far from clear whether the president and Congress will be
able to reach some grand compromise on tax cuts, spending, Medicare
and perhaps health care legislation after Clinton makes good on his
promise to veto the Republican tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   In August both parties expect to wage a battle for public
opinion. Republicans said they would hold town meetings across the
nation to showcase different aspects of their tax cut, which would
be largest since 1981, and contains elements designed to appeal to
an array of constituency groups from social conservatives to women
to business.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats planned their own appearances to highlight their call
for some of the surplus to be used to overhaul the Medicare system,
the federal health insurance program for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton sounded the Democratic rallying cry Friday, by once
again vowing to veto the Republicans' tax cut.``I am disappointed,
though not surprised, that the majority party in Congress has
chosen to pass its massive tax cut, one that plainly would damage
our economic future,'' Clinton said at the White House before
leaving for Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to ensure the American people, because this tax cut
will not save and strengthen Medicare, because it will not add a
day to the Social Security trust fund, because it will not pay down
the debt and pay if off for the first time in 150 years, this tax
cut will not become law,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans, who see the tax cut as the crown jewel of their
legislative program, predicted that their bill would resonate with
the American people and that public opinion would force Clinton to
embrace it.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott said that if Clinton vetoes
the bill, ``it will be the strongest indication so far that he is
entering the phase of being a lame duck, because it will say to the
Congress, the American people, `I don't care what you say or do,
I'm going to veto this and I'm not going to work with you.'''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has proposed a far smaller tax cut of $250 billion, and
prefers to use some of the surplus to expand Medicare and increase
spending on such domestic programs.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the escalating rhetoric, some Republicans believe that
Clinton, with less than 18 months remaining in his presidency, will
want to burnish his record. That yearning, they say, will lead him
to strike a grand bargain with Congress, where Republicans will get
large tax cuts in exchange for the new Medicare prescription drug
program that he has proposed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got one more year,'' said Rep. Joe Scarborough, R-Fla.,
``He's run his last campaign. He would like to have a good tax cut
and some good reforms. I don't know how to say it without sounding
cliche. He's playing for history.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats counter that Clinton considers the healthy economy his
proudest accomplishment and that he will not strike a compromise
that does not begin to pay down the debt. ``They are misreading
what is motivating the president,'' said House Minority Leader Dick
Gephardt of the Republicans. ``What motivates him is that he has
achieved a very good economy and he has made some real strides on
crime and education. And he doesn't want to make a deal that would
compromise or jeopardize those accomplishments.''
</P>
<P>
   There is another factor this year that provides an incentive for
stalemate. During the days of deficits, an inability to act meant
the deficits grew. But this year if the parties cannot agree on a
tax cut, the surpluses automatically go toward paying down the
nation's $5.6 billion accumulated debt. So both sides say it might
not be so bad if they reach no agreement and take their competing
visions into the election.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a sense that we've done something if we've done
nothing,'' said Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond fiscal issues, the fate of other high profile legislation
is also unclear. Many of the topics on the fall agenda _ campaign
finance overhaul, managed care regulation and gun control _ are
favorite issues of the Democrats. Republicans view these
confrontations as ones they cannot win, but will try to dispense
with them with minimal damage.
</P>
<P>
   So they will hope to do as little as possible while Democrats
will be leery of accepting weak compromises.
</P>
<P>
   A signal of the intensity of the struggle came Friday when
Hastert and other Republican leaders agreed just before 2 a.m. to
allow a managed care proposal, which is being assembled by Reps.
Tom Coburn, R-Okla., and John Shadegg, R-Ariz., to move forward in
the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Their decision was prompted by Thursday's announcement by
dissident Republicans that they had reached agreement with House
Democrats on comprehensive legislation. They predicted they would
rally a majority of the House around their bill.
</P>
<P>
   Coburn, a family physician, and Shadegg were still drafting
their rival measure, which was expected to be similar to the the
bipartisan plan. But Coburn has said that he wants to keep the
right to sue provisions more limited than in the bipartisan
measure. He would require patients to prove they were injured
before they could sue.
</P>
<P>
   The existence of the second bill created an even fiercer fight
for perhaps 20 to 30 Republicans who could decide what kind of
managed care bill passes the House. But Democrats were expected to
oppose this version because it would contain a variety of tax
credits meant to help the uninsured get coverage. That would likely
include tax free medical savings accounts, which Democrats oppose,
saying such accounts would draw the healthiest and wealthiest out
of the insurance pool.

GEORGIA TOWN RIDES TO THE RESCUE OF ITS YOUNG INMATES 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   DALTON, Ga. _ For years, reports of overcrowding, assaults,
self-mutilation and suicide attempts flowed out of the state
juvenile detention center in this conservative northwest Georgia
community.
</P>
<P>
   In many towns, people might have said that the problem was
someone else's business. The children were not theirs, after all,
and the center was a source of jobs. Why should there be much
interest in serving as good hosts to dozens of delinquents?
</P>
<P>
   But not in Dalton.
</P>
<P>
   Upset at the treatment of these young inmates _ boys and girls
both, who typically ranged in age from 9 to 17 _ an unlikely group
including the owner of an asphalt-paving business, a doctor's wife,
a carpet-company owner and a bank president laid out the costs of
bringing a federal civil rights suit against the state, and won a
settlement improving conditions at the center.
</P>
<P>
   Now their unusual role _ it is rare for townspeople to rush to
the aid of local inmates, and rarer still for them to put up more
than $100,000 for the cause _ is drawing national attention. ``I
have never heard of anything like this'' in 20 years of litigating
juvenile justice cases, said Mark Soler, president of the Youth Law
Center, a public interest law firm in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Many lawyers say this rare kind of civic activism demonstrates
the lengths to which people must now go if poor prison conditions
are to be challenged. They blame the 1996 enactment of federal laws
that sharply curtailed the ability to bring lawsuits on behalf of
prisoners, in part by making it more difficult for lawyers to
finance them. The restrictions were passed largely out of anger
over what were seen as frivolous suits, with critics saying one
prisoner had even sued over a lack of chunky peanut butter.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs here, a loose grouping of a dozen or so,
maintained that children at the Dalton Regional Youth Detention
Center were receiving inadequate education, psychological therapy
and medical care and sometimes slept five to a room designed for
one, often on the floor near open toilets.
</P>
<P>
   Last December a federal judge agreed, pressing the state to
settle and praising the Daltonites who had taken action.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs say they had no choice, given what they had
learned about conditions at the center.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never gave it a thought,'' said J.M. Boring, a bank
president, ``other than that it was something that had to be
done.''
</P>
<P>
   Daryl Robinson, deputy counsel in the Georgia attorney general's
office, said the plaintiffs exaggerated the center's problems and
that the state had been moving to correct them anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problems were not anything near as severe as what the
lawyers alleged,'' Robinson said. ``But were there problems there?
Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, at its annual meeting in Atlanta, the American Bar
Association is to give a juvenile justice award for ``exposing
deplorable conditions'' to the Atlanta lawyers who handled the
case, Robert Cullen and his wife, Martha Miller, and to a
representative of the Dalton citizens' group, Deborah Peppers.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace Mlyniec, the ABA's juvenile justice chairman, said the
selection of the award's winners showed how widely known the case
had become among lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pretty remarkable when the nominations started coming
in,'' Mlyniec said. ``Everybody was talking about Cullen and Miller
and Debby Peppers and a group of people in this town who on their
own got together to make this happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Making it happen took some doing. The 1996 laws sharply limited
the legal fees that could be recovered by lawyers bringing suits
for prisoners, and also barred lawyers who get federal money to
represent the poor from handling prison suits at all. Cullen says
that as a result of those restrictions, the few lawyers still
willing to handle such cases no longer have the means to finance
them.
</P>
<P>
   So there would have been no Dalton suit, he says, had it not
been for the $101,103.88 that the group of residents borrowed to
pay for depositions, expert witnesses and other costs.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the mostly affluent plaintiffs were motivated by what
they had learned as volunteers in the local juvenile court. A few
worked for juvenile agencies. But some were simply interested in
children's issues, just as they were interested in other civic
matters. A few years before the suit was filed in 1996, they had
created Voice of the Children, a group devoted to influencing local
and state child policy.
</P>
<P>
   One member, Connie Maples Blaylock, who was then a lawyer in
juvenile court and is now a judge there, and Mrs. Peppers, then a
county commissioner who volunteered at the court as a child
guardian, began telling the others what the children in the
detention center were saying about the lack of education, therapy
and basic medical care.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were appalled to learn that these kinds of things were
even alleged to be going on in Dalton, Ga.,'' said Judge Blaylock.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs say they barely even discussed finances before
filing suit. If they won, they knew, the state would have to pay
them at least some of the money they borrowed. If they lost, they
would split the costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these children didn't have glasses'' to see with,
Deelee Barnwell, one of the group, said by way of explaining the
plaintiffs' lack of concern over money. ``They didn't have
toothbrushes.''
</P>
<P>
   (Under the settlement, the plaintiffs will now be reimbursed by
the state, which will also pay the lawyers' fee, although in both
cases the amount will be determined in arbitration.)
</P>
<P>
   Another plaintiff, Dawn Sanders, an executive in one of the
banks on the main street of this town of 25,000, said Dalton, a
carpet manufacturing center, had always had an entrepreneurial
ethic. That do-it-yourself spirit, she said, was simply applied to
the problem of the conditions at the center.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   After two weeks of testimony last December, the federal judge in
the case, Harold Murphy, sitting in Rome, Ga., made clear from the
bench that it would be in the interest of the Georgia Department of
Juvenile Justice to settle. If there was no settlement, Murphy
said, there would be a court order ``that will be embarrassing to
the department.'' He went on to say of the Daltonites, ``The
plaintiffs in this case are to be commended for calling the
attention of the public to issues in this case that should never
have existed.''
</P>
<P>
   Within days the state did settle, making broad promises of
improvements. For example, the settlement limits to 45 children the
permissible population of the center, which was designed for 30.
The plaintiffs had contended that as many as 120 children were
sometimes there _ a figure the state denied, although the center's
administrators acknowledged that there had been as many as five in
a one-child room.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement also requires improvements in educational,
psychological and other services, and these have apparently been
made. The accord grants the plaintiffs the right to inspect the
center, and Cullen now says, ``It is a different place.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the settlement seemingly brings to an end a living
nightmare for children like a slight 11-year-old boy identified in
the lawsuit only as W.C. He was an emotionally troubled runaway,
once arrested for shoplifting chewing tobacco, who ended up in the
Dalton center.
</P>
<P>
   In a deposition, W.C. maintained for the first time that in
those overcrowded rooms, a 17-year-old had sexually molested him
and a 12-year-old had tried. He was 9 at the time. At the center,
he testified, he tried to kill himself a few times.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, his mother, who agreed to speak if she was
identified only by the initials with which her son was identified
in the suit, said the case had accomplished much. ``It is not going
to undo what was done to my child,'' she said through tears, ``but
maybe some other child won't suffer the same way.''
</P>
<P>
   When W.C. gave his deposition, he was asked why he had tried to
kill himself at the Dalton center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because,'' he said, ``I hated it so bad there.''

GM AND DAEWOO SIGN DEAL THAT MAY LEAD TO ALLIANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By STEPHANIE STROM    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ General Motors Corp. signed an agreement Friday that
could lead to an alliance with the Daewoo Motor Co., the core of
South Korea's struggling Daewoo Group.
</P>
<P>
   GM, the world's largest automaker, could end up buying assets
from Daewoo or taking a stake in the company, possibly even a
controlling stake, said Alan G. Perriton, president of General
Motors Korea and head of new business ventures and strategic
alliances in the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
   A deal between the two companies would help GM's effort to
double its share of sales in the Asian market to 10 percent in five
years.
</P>
<P>
   For Daewoo, a deal with GM would bring in much-needed capital,
sound financial management and, most important, send a strong
message that the imperiled conglomerate is serious about radically
overhauling and streamlining its sprawling operations.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement announced Friday significantly advances
discussions that the two companies have been holding since February
1998, which had been stalled over issues of price and control.
``We've narrowed down the scope and taken it to a much higher
level,'' Perriton said in a telephone interview from Seoul. ``We'll
be focusing specifically on vehicles excluding commercial trucks
and buses.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the agreement was not an opportunistic response to the
Daewoo Group's current precarious financial condition, since
negotiations had begun several weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Daewoo was rescued from impending default
with debt payment extensions and fresh capital by its creditors.
They were acting at the behest of the Korean government, which was
concerned that the conglomerate's financial crisis was endangering
the country's economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange, Daewoo promised a sweeping revamping that would
result in the sale of various assets. The GM agreement seems to be
a step in that direction, but investors have seen so many potential
deals fall apart or fade away that Friday's announcement failed to
incite even cautious optimism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd hesitate to draw any conclusions too quickly,'' said
Richard Samuelson, head of SBC Warburg's office in Seoul, noting
that GM and Daewoo have been in discussions for some time already
without any clear results. ``This almost has a slapstick quality,
with the on-again, off-again nature of it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, the Korean government's last hope for finding a
home for the factory of the insolvent Samsung Motors is Daewoo
Motors. Analysts see little hope the Samsung plant will be sold to
another car company. But because it is in Pusan, an opposition
stronghold, the government wants to avoid a plant shutdown before
parliamentary elections next April. Perriton made it clear the
plant was not part of GM's discussions with Daewoo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The focus of this discussion is Daewoo and GM and the assets
that Daewoo has,'' he said. Should GM conclude a deal with Daewoo,
and Perriton said the two companies would work toward that end ``as
quickly as practical,'' the future of the Samsung plant would
almost surely be liquidation.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of weeks ago, Kim Woo Choong, the chairman of the
Daewoo Group, said he considered Daewoo Motors the ``crown jewel''
of his group and that he would lavish financial and management
resources on it. Now he is apparently offering to hand over control
of his crown jewel to GM if offered the right price.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen various interpretations of the same comment,''
Perriton said. ``It's reasonable to suggest that regardless of how
he views the automotive part of his business, there has always been
a willingness to have that considered in relation to another
international company.''
</P>
<P>
   The apparent change of position by the Daewoo chairman could
also be an indication of desperation, although Daewoo's finances
are so murky that any current assessment of them is at best an
educated guess, bankers and analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   The group is saddled with total liabilities estimated at $60
billion, a good chunk of it in short-term debt.
</P>
<P>
   The only realistic way it can help pay down those debts is to
sell assets, but many of Daewoo's assets are not competitive or in
slumping industries like shipbuilding.

HAMBLETONIAN BECOMES AN ALLEN FAMILY AFFAIR 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By ALEX YANNIS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Carl Allen had bypass surgery 18 months
ago and sustained broken ribs two weeks ago, but it seems that
nothing will stop the 69-year-old Allen from driving in the
Hambletonian. Allen has an insatiable desire to be a daredevil, and
he does not want to be outdone by his son, Rod, in harness racing's
most prestigious event.
</P>
<P>
   The Allens will go against each other Saturday afternoon at the
Meadowlands, driving a two-horse entry that is the second choice on
the morning betting line. Carl will drive CR Commando and Rod will
direct CR Renegade as they try to capture the first Hambletonian
title for a family that has been involved in racing for more than
40 years.
</P>
<P>
   The closest the Allens came to winning a Hambletonian, the $1
million classic for 3-year-old trotters, was in 1990 with Royal
Troubador, but the horse chipped a knee and finished fifth. The
Allens also had a good chance with CR Kay Suzie in the 1995
Hambletonian, but the popular filly broke stride in the first heat
and never qualified for the final.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have two horses of equal quality this time, and both are
going into the race having trained real good,'' Carl Allen said of
Renegade and Commando, who will leave from the first and third
spots, respectively. Renegade is a full brother of CR Kay Suzie.
</P>
<P>
   Renegade and Commando were the early 7-2 choice, behind the
three-horse entry of Angus Hall, Self Possessed and Rafaello
Ambrosio, who were at 3-5 and expected to go even better just
before the race. The Hambletonian will be the 11th race on a card
of 15 races that begins at 11:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Commando and Renegade have never raced against one another in an
official event. For Carl, this will be the second time he has
driven against one of his sons. He drove against his son Mike in an
elimination race.
</P>
<P>
   The Allens are not the first father-son confrontation in the
race. Ben White, Stanley Dancer and Billy Haughton raced against
one or more of their sons.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Allen wants to do well against his son. ``The young guys
want to put you out to pasture,'' he said. ``Sometimes it's hard
for the student to beat the teacher.''
</P>
<P>
   The elder Allen is a self-taught trainer and driver _ he never
apprenticed with anyone. He got into horse racing by accident in
Detroit while he was working as a bull rider in a rodeo.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's always liked daring things,'' said Mae Jean, his wife of
49 years. ``I think he needs the stimulation,'' she said with a
smile.
</P>
<P>
   Rod Allen was kinder when speaking of facing his father in the
Ham-bletonian. ``We're too close to have any vice,'' he said, ``but
there is a certain amount of competitiveness there. It goes back to
when these two horses were babies. We've competed in trials and
training, but this whole field is very competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the best in the field of 10 is Self Possessed, who
captured his Hambletonian elimination last Saturday by six lengths
in 1:53. He will be driven by Mike Lachance and will leave from the
fourth spot, which many drivers and trainers consider the most
desirable. &QL;

 SECURITY ISSUE COULD DELAY NUCLEAR SECRETS INDICTMENT  (mk) 
 By JAMES RISEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Energy Department has sought a delay in the
government's decision on seeking an indictment against a former Los
Alamos scientist in connection with the mishandling of nuclear
secrets, officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   More time is needed, the officials added, to decide whether to
release highly classified information for use as evidence. Energy
Secretary Bill Richardson has the legal authority to decide what
classified information can be released.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Richardson was waiting for a recommendation from
the department's new security czar, a former Air Force general,
Eugene Habiger. Habiger has to weigh whether the risks of exposing
additional classified nuclear data outweigh the need for the
prosecution of the scientist, Wen Ho Lee.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials are mulling how to handle the case,
and some reportedly believe that the case is too weak to prosecute.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. attorney for New Mexico, John Kelly, has been
considering indicting Lee on federal charges of mishandling
classified information, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The apparent lack of evidence means that the government is not
expected to charge Lee with espionage. The general allegation is
that China obtained nuclear weapons secrets through Lee, an
allegation that China and Lee have steadfastly denied.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Kelly's office in New Mexico declined to
comment.
</P>
<P>
   For three years, Lee has been the chief suspect in an FBI
inquiry into the possible theft of nuclear secrets from the Los
Alamos National Laboratory, including information related to the
most advanced nuclear warhead, the W-88. But he has never been
charged with a crime.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, prosecutors have been considering the lesser charges of
mishandling classified information, because Lee transferred nuclear
weapons data into an unsecured computer network. He has said that
the transfers were routine and that no crime was committed.
</P>
<P>
   Such a prosecution would be unprecedented, said John Martin,
former chief of the internal security section at the Justice
Department. Martin, who was in charge of the prosecution of
espionage cases until he retired in 1997, said such an indictment
would charge ``gross negligence'' and the mishandling of classified
information under Title 18 of the U.S. Code, Section 793/F. That is
a felony punishable by up to 10 years in prison. But it has never
been used in a federal criminal prosecution, Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for Lee in Los Angeles, Mark Holscher, did not return
calls for comment. But Lee has previously stated that he has never
betrayed secrets and that he transferred nuclear-weapons computer
codes into an unclassified computer network to protect the
information.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Friday that in a polygraph examination in
February, Lee provided deceptive answers on whether he had passed
W-88 information to an unauthorized person and whether he had given
computer codes related to nuclear weapons to an unauthorized
person. Polygraph results would not be admissible in court,
however.
</P>
<P>
   An important problem for the government is that prosecutors are
not certain they can keep classified information from being exposed
in a trial. They say they may not be able to use the Classified
Information Procedures Act, which was intended to let the
government prosecute spies without revealing secrets in court.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists from Los Alamos in New Mexico have been interviewed
by the government to explain the significance of Lee's transfers of
information. Those scientists, as expert witnesses for the
prosecution, could be cross-examined, and their information could
be compromised.
</P>
<P>
   The debate over charging Lee heated up a day after a Senate
report painted a devastating picture of the many errors that have
plagued the case, committed by investigators, lawyers and other
officials at the FBI, the Justice Department, Los Alamos and the
Energy Department. Those errors are part of the reason why the case
against Lee is extremely weak, many people in and out of government
apparently believe.
</P>
<P>
   The mistakes may make it impossible for the government to
prosecute anyone. Among the many missteps that the Senate report
detailed was the decision early in the investigation to focus on
Lee without having adequately reviewed other possible suspects.
</P>
<P>
   The report, issued by the chairman and ranking minority member
of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, notes that the FBI
had already investigated Lee two times, once in the early 1980s in
connection with China's reported theft of neutron-bomb data from
the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California, and a
second time in the 1990s, just before the the investigation
concerning the W-88 secrets began.
</P>
<P>
   The first inquiry of Lee started when the FBI found that he had
called the suspect in the neutron-bomb case. In that investigation,
Lee acknowledged having provided unclassified material to China.
Bureau officials have said he passed a polygraph examination, and
the bureau closed its inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate report does not identify the second inquiry, but
states that it was suspended in 1995 as soon as the bureau was
brought into the W-88 investigation. A federal official familiar
with that investigation said the FBI seemed to have prematurely
narrowed its focus on Lee, because he was already under scrutiny.

IN ALBANY WRAP-UP, A WIDE-RANGING PACKAGE EMERGES 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The package of bills endorsed by Gov. George
Pataki and legislative leaders Thursday night call for far-reaching
changes in a number of areas _ from crime to the environment _
affecting the lives of millions of New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   The package includes a plan that allows for the construction of
new power plants in the state for the first time in two decades,
along with several criminal justice measures, like tougher
penalties for stalking and blocking access to abortion clinics.
</P>
<P>
   But a number of high-profile measures were not addressed in the
rush to adjourn the 222nd session of the New York state
Legislature, victims of too little time or too little attention.
The unfinished business includes a proposal to stiffen penalties
for parents who fail to pay child support and a measure that would
have permitted New York to join the multi-state lottery known as
Powerball.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders agreed on legislation to create new criminal
penalties in New York for blocking access to abortion clinics.
Democrats had pushed for the legislation, largely because federal
law-enforcement officers have repeatedly said they lack the
manpower to enforce a similar provision in federal law.
</P>
<P>
   The new law mirrors federal legislation in that it makes a crime
of harassing or physically attacking people who work at abortion
clinics or seek services from them. The key difference between the
two is that the state law can be enforced by local law officers.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike the federal law, the state law does not allow people
to to seek civil damages in state courts against a person who is
convicted of the crime. Democrats had initially sought that
provision but backed away after Republicans resisted them.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers also agreed to create stiff new penalties for
stalking. The Republicans in the Senate had proposed the measure,
with strong support from women's groups who said it would add a
layer of protection for women enduring harassment by former
boyfriends or husbands.
</P>
<P>
   But the Democrats had opposed the measure, primarily because it
included a provision that they said was so broadly worded that it
could subject people to being charged for something as minor as
begging. Under the Republican proposal, the Democrats noted,
suspects could be charged with stalking if their behavior caused
someone else ``distress,'' even if that was not their intent.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Democrats agreed to enact a new crime for stalking,
but only after the wording was made more precise. In the
compromise, suspects can be charged with stalking only if their
intent is to frighten or harm another person. The crime is a
misdemeanor punishable by up to a year in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Shelly Nortz, the legislative director for the Coalition for the
Homeless, said the new law provides protections against stalking
while insuring that people aren't charged with a crime they had no
intention of committing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a much more sensible approach'' than the original
proposal, she said. ``On the one hand, it includes conduct that we
all know to be stalking, while at the same time protecting innocent
people from being arrested.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor and legislative leaders also agreed on a law to
allow the construction of power plants in the state. The proposal
gained urgency this year because, for the first time in two
decades, energy companies have applied to the state for permission
to build new plants, mostly in the Hudson Valley.
</P>
<P>
   But because of an oversight, no state agency had the authority,
under Federal law, to issue the permits. Environmentalists had
hoped to tie the law to new pollution controls on older power
plants, which are exempt from requirements imposed on new plants.
</P>
<P>
   But instead, the new law contains environmental provisions that
environmental groups dismissed as a sham. ``They have decided that
the pollution reduction plan for New Yorkers is to hold their
breath,'' said Peter Iwanowicz, director of environmental health
for the American Lung Association of New York State.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Elizabeth Forsling Harris, who was briefly the first publisher
of Ms. magazine, died on July 14 in Manhattan, where she lived. She
was 77.
</P>
<P>
   She died in a hospital of complications from emphysema, said a
friend, Patricia Reilly.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Harris helped start Ms. magazine in late 1971, but she left
after the first issue, citing disagreement on a wide range of
issues.
</P>
<P>
   In 1975, she filed a suit for $1.7 million against the first
editor of Ms., Gloria Steinem, and Pat Carbine, the publisher,
contending that they had fraudulently misrepresented the value of
the magazine's stock. The suit was dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   After Ms. magazine, Ms. Harris worked in the early days of cable
television, developing a shopping service called Cable Catalog with
Neiman Marcus. In 1976, she became the publisher of Working Woman.
In the early 1980s, she was a deputy commissioner at the New York
State Department of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Harris was born in Greeneville, Tenn., on Jan. 8, 1922, and
graduated from Mount Vernon College in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In 1941, she took a job at Newsweek in New York as a researcher.
She later became a radio and television editor. In 1951, she joined
ABC, where she produced a program featuring Walter Winchell, and
was one of the network's first programming executives.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, she left to start her own public relations
company in Dallas, where she remained through the late 1950s, until
she became a special consultant for Arthur Godfrey Productions in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   In 1961, she was the deputy associate director of the Peace
Corps. She returned to Dallas in July 1963 and was the local White
House liaison for President John F. Kennedy's visit on Nov. 22,
1963.
</P>
<P>
   After the Kennedy assassination, she returned to Washington,
where she again worked for the Peace Corps and the Democratic
National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   She later worked for the Girl Scouts of the U.S.A. in New York,
the Urban Institute research organization in Washington and CRM
Inc., in Del Mar, Calif., the publisher of Psychology Today.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Harris was the first president of the Women's Forum, a
networking organization, served on the board of the Planned
Parenthood Federation of America and was a trustee of Mount Vernon
College and Tusculum College in Tusculum, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   No immediate survivors were reported.

ANOTHER DAY, ANOTHER MILESTONE 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By MURRAY CHASS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In what seems to be baseball's nightly milestone, Tony Gwynn of
the San Diego Padres took his long expected place among the game's
great hitters Friday night, stroking the 3,000th hit of his career
at Olympic Stadium in Montreal. He was the 22nd player to reach the
3,000 plateau and the first to do it outside the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn's first-ining line single against Dan Smith, the Expo's
rookie right-hander, ended what little suspense was left after he
hit No. 2,999 on Thursday night in St. Louis. That hit came in the
same game in which Mark McGwire became the 16th player to hit 500
home runs.
</P>
<P>
   Never before had two hitters attained the 500 home run and 3,000
hit milestones in such proximity. In 1970, Ernie Banks slugged his
500th home run on May 12, and five days later Hank Aaron collected
his 3,000th hit. Two months after that Willie Mays joined Aaron
and, at the time, eight other players in the 3,000 circle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to get it done,'' Gwynn had said in St. Louis
after Thursday night's game. ``I just want to get a hit. It's down
to one little hit. One hit. Chinker, blooper, line drive, just one
hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Waiting to join Gwynn was Wade Boggs, who entered Tampa Bay's
game against Cleveland on Friday night needing three hits. The
careers of Gwynn and Boggs have paralleled each other. Both first
played in the major leagues in 1982, and both have won multiple
batting championships, eight in the National League for Gwynn, five
in the American League for Boggs.
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn, whose physique belies his talent as a hitter, would have
made it to 3,000 much earlier this season, but an ailing left calf
sent him to the disabled list twice. Nevertheless, he needed the
third-fewest games among the 22 players to reach 3,000. This was
his 2,284th game, trailing only Ty Cobb with 2,135 and Nap Lajoie
with 2,224.
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn, 39, is the first National League player to get to 3,000
in 20 years, since Lou Brock in August 1979. Seven American
Leaguers have joined the group since then. Paul Molitor, who was
the last, did it in 1996 with Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   A smooth left-hand hitter, Gwynn is also the 11th player to
collect all 3,000 hits with one team. George Brett of Kansas City
and Robin Yount of Milwaukee, who reached that total three weeks
apart in 1992, were the last to achieve the milestone with one
team.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres' right fielder had hoped to end his pursuit of the
magic number in St. Louis, but he failed to get a hit in his first
three plate appearances Thursday night. Then in his last at-bat, in
the ninth inning, he lined a double along the right-field line for
No. 2,999, and Friday night he remained on a roll.
</P>
<P>
   After he sent a soft liner past second base on Smith's 1-2 pitch
in his first time at bat, Gwynn singled up the middle in his second
at-bat, nudging ahead of Roberto Clemente of Pittsburgh, whose
final hit of the 1972 season, a double against the Mets' Jon
Matlack, was the 3,000th and last hit of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Clemente was killed in a plane crash the following New Year's
Eve as he was en route from Puerto Rico to Nicaragua with food and
supplies for earthquake victims.
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn singled again in the sixth inning for his 3,002nd hit.
Gwynn's next target as he climbs the list is Al Kaline of Detroit
at 3,007. Then comes Brock at 3,023.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the crowd at sold-out Busch Stadium in St. Louis on
Thursday night, fewer than 10,000 fans were in the stands at
Olympic Stadium for Gwynn's feat. The size of the crowd was not
surprising because the Expos have the tiniest attendance in the
major leagues.
</P>
<P>
   But the fans who were there stood and clapped throughout Gwynn's
first-inning at-bat and saluted him when he got the hit with a loud
and lengthy ovation. Even louder were the fireworks, in place for
Expos home runs, that were set off instantly.
</P>
<P>
   His teammates raced onto the field and mobbed him, and even the
first base umpire, Kerwin Danley, got caught up in the emotion and
excitement of the moment, hugging Gwynn. Then Gwynn's mother,
Vendella came onto the field and embraced him.
</P>
<P>
   That Gwynn waited until this night to get No. 3,000 was in one
way fitting. It was a special present for his mother, who was
celebrating her 64th birthday. Six years ago on her birthday, Gwynn
rapped No. 2,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of ironic that I can get 3,000 on her birthday,
too,'' Gwynn said in Montreal before Friday night's game. ``I'm
going to try my best, but it's like I told her this afternoon, I'm
not going to try to force the action. I'm just going to try to take
what they give me.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gwynn was on hand along with Gwynn's wife, Alicia, and
their daughter, Anisha.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's gone from one end of the country to the end of another
country to see this and it means a lot having her here,'' Gwynn
said of his mother. ``I thought 2,000 was a pretty good one, but
for a contact hitter this is the ultimate.''
</P>
<P>
   Although none of the previous 21 players got his 3,000th in
Montreal, Pete Rose, when he was playing for the Expos, stroked No.
4,000 in the Canadian city on his way to finishing with an all-time
high of 4,256 hits.

CO-CHAIRMAN OF TALENT AGENCY RESIGNS IN DISAGREEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BERNARD WEINRAUB    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Jim Wiatt, co-chairman of International Creative
Management, one of Hollywood's top talent agencies, unexpectedly
resigned Friday after disagreements with his partner, Jeffrey Berg.
Wiatt's departure could lead to defections of some of his movie
star and director clients to rival agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Wiatt declined to give a specific reason for his departure,
except to say: ``It seemed the best thing to do was to call it a
day. I'm going to move on and wish everybody well.''
</P>
<P>
   There was speculation that Wiatt, 52, a well-liked, highly
personable figure in Hollywood who had been with International
Creative Management for 22 years, was weighing the possibility of a
top job at the William Morris Agency, one of the biggest talent
agencies in town, or Endeavor, a successful new agency that counts
among its clients Adam Sandler, Bette Midler and David Kelley, the
writer-producer of ``Ally McBeal'' and other shows.
</P>
<P>
   There was also speculation that Wiatt was discussing the
possibility of joining Michael Ovitz and his partners at the
Artists Management Group, a talent management firm with clients
that include Leonardo DiCaprio. Wiatt declined to discuss his
plans.
</P>
<P>
   If Wiatt joins another agency, he will probably take some of his
clients with him. These include actors Eddie Murphy, Sylvester
Stallone and Tim Allen, as well as directors like Nora Ephron,
Richard Donner and Penny Marshall.
</P>
<P>
   Precisely why Wiatt left was not clear. Berg said in an e-mail
to co-workers: ``It is with great regret that I must inform you
that ICM and Jim Wiatt have been unable to conclude a new
agreement. As a result, Jim will be leaving the agency effective
immediately.'' Berg said in the message that he was saddened by the
departure. ``This was not the result I hoped for,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Associates of Wiatt said compensation was a factor behind his
departure. But the associates said other issues were more
significant. Although Wiatt had recently been named co-chairman of
the big talent agency, he still considered himself the No. 2 to
Berg, the longtime chairman. ``He always thought he was in Jeff's
shadow,'' one of Wiatt's associates said. ``He hated being No. 2.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond this, the associates said, Wiatt was unhappy with the
realignment of the agency's leadership that was announced last
October. Two top agents, Ed Limato, who represents numerous movie
stars, and Nancy Josephson, a television agent, were named
co-presidents.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Wiatt and Berg have failed to get along,
associates said. One talent manager who is a friend of Wiatt's
said: ``Jim has struggled there for quite a while in terms of his
relationship and day-to-day dealings with Jeff. They're very
different. Jim was pretty much the heart and soul of that agency.''
</P>
<P>
   International Creative Management ranks as one of the top talent
agencies in Hollywood _ along with Creative Artists, William Morris
and United Talent. Its clients include stars like Mel Gibson, Julia
Roberts and Dustin Hoffman, as well as directors like James Brooks,
Spike Lee and Francis Ford Coppola.

IN DOG DAYS, BRIGGS-BOTHA BOUT MAY BE AS GOOD AS ANY FOR SOME
TIME 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shannon Briggs and Francois Botha did as much as they could to
hype their heavyweight bout Saturday night at Trump's Taj Mahal in
Atlantic City, N.J. Briggs denigrated Botha's boxing skills, and
Botha questioned Briggs' stamina. Welcome to the dog days of summer
for boxing's heavyweights.
</P>
<P>
   On paper this is a fight that no one would really care about,
but Showtime Entertainment Television is hoping that the summer
doldrums will not keep boxing fans away from the pay-per-view. The
two boxers have never really reached their potential (although some
would argue that Botha has) and each was knocked out in the fifth
round of his last fight.
</P>
<P>
   With the rematch for the undisputed heavyweight championship
between Evander Holyfield and Lennox Lewis slated for November and
most of the top-rated contenders lining up for a shot at the title,
the match between Briggs (31-2) and Botha (39-2) is as compelling
as the division might get in the next couple of months.
</P>
<P>
   The trainer Emanuel Steward said that even before he signed on
to work Briggs' corner he was intrigued by this fight, because he
has a lot of questions about each boxer. Steward said he watched
the Mike Tyson-Botha fight Jan. 16 and walked away wondering
whether Tyson was that bad or whether Botha was that good. He was
working Lennox Lewis' corner when Lewis stopped Briggs last year
and recalls seeing a young boxer with a world of athletic ability
but without a clue how to harness it.
</P>
<P>
   ``When is all this potential going to be put together?'' Steward
said. ``I think he's finally decided that he was to be the star
now. I think this is the biggest difference in this fight.''
Douglas Faces a Hurdle
</P>
<P>
   Buster Douglas had to overcome some big odds (42-1) to defeat
Mike Tyson the first time they fought in 1990. And if the two are
to fight again, which it appears will happen Oct. 2 at the MGM
Grand in Las Vegas, then Douglas is going to have to clear a major
medical hurdle.
</P>
<P>
   A few years after defeating Tyson, Douglas ballooned to more
than 400 pounds, went into a diabetic coma and nearly died. He
undertook a weight loss program in 1995 and returned to boxing in
1995. The Nevada State Athletic Commission plans to take a close
medical look at the 39-year-old Douglas before he steps into the
ring.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas has not fought in Nevada since he lost the undisputed
heavyweight title to Evander Holyfield on Oct. 25, 1990. Dr. Flip
Homansky, the doctor for the Nevada commission, said he would
review information from the hospital where Douglas recovered from
his diabetic coma; order a battery of cardiology tests; get a
magnetic resonance imaging scan of Douglas' brain; have a diabetic
eye specialist examine his eyes, and have tests done on his
kidneys.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd do the same type of test if he were fighting a six-round
fight on the undercard,'' Homansky said.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas' training habits were always questionable, even when he
defeated Tyson in 1990. But now it appears that Douglas may be a
shell of the fighter he was nine years ago. On June 25, 1998, Lou
Savarese delivered a crushing first-round knockout that exposed
Douglas' fragile chin.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently that physical liability proved to be a major asset
for Douglas in landing a lucrative rematch with Tyson. The two
other boxers who were in the sweepstakes were Zeljko Mavrovic, who
gave Lennox Lewis a battle over 12 rounds last year, and Orlin
Norris.

AN INEVITABLE MOVE FROM PATAKI 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ From any perspective, Gov. George Pataki's
announcement Friday that he would support Rudolph Giuliani in a
likely Senate race next year, instead of Rep. Rick A. Lazio, was a
critical moment both in the Senate race and in the feud between two
New York Republicans with competing national ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, Giuliani no longer has to worry about a Pataki-backed
primary challenge that many Republicans had viewed as a serious
threat to the mayor's prospective candidacy. Giuliani no longer has
to worry, as well, about attacks from the leadership of his own
fractured party. He can now presumably turn his full attention to
Hillary Rodham Clinton, and one of the mayor's advisers said there
were cheers at city hall when news of Pataki's decision came over
the news wires.
</P>
<P>
   But if Pataki's announcement was a critical moment in this
emerging Senate contest, it was an inevitable one as well. And it
said more about Pataki's own ambitions than about either the
prospect of Giuliani as a Senate candidate or a potential
reconciliation between two rivals locked in one of the more caustic
feuds that New York politics has seen in a long time.
</P>
<P>
   In a race that has drawn extraordinary attention from
Republicans around the nation, Pataki was with each passing day
putting himself at risk of being blamed as a spoiler if Giuliani
ran and lost or skipped the race entirely.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki might have begun his tacit encouragement of a Lazio
primary challenge in hopes of rattling an old rival, but in recent
weeks, as Mrs. Clinton traveled through the state in what seemed
like a precursor to a campaign, his actions have drawn unfavorable
attention from Republicans nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't just about Giuliani,'' said Adam Goodman, the
Republican consultant who advises the mayor, in discussing Pataki's
decision. ``It was a question of, is the Republican Party prepared
to do whatever is necessary to put our best forward? Anybody who
doesn't show that publicly, if this race goes against the
Republicans, has to fear that they will be held accountable.''
</P>
<P>
   Pataki has spent much of this year traveling the nation, giving
speeches and presenting himself as a potential national candidate.
The notion that actions by Pataki could have led to Mrs. Clinton's
sitting in the Senate in 2001 ``would certainly not be the kind of
perception that you would want to create for someone who is a
national figure,'' one of Pataki's aides said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's advisers have been coming to terms with what is, for
them, the unsavory reality that the governor would have to embrace
a campaign by Giuliani that seems certain to eclipse Pataki's
national stature. Pataki's advisers said that the governor decided
to act Friday because Lazio had scheduled a mid-August announcement
of his candidacy, and because the governor is leaving on Monday for
a vacation in Ireland and France.
</P>
<P>
   ``The primary that could have hurt the nominee, or the probable
nominee, might have become a fait accompli if he didn't act,'' said
Kieran Mahoney, a Republican consultant and adviser to Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   But there were other, perhaps more compelling reasons for Pataki
to move now. Mrs. Clinton has, with each of her weekly trips to New
York, become more definitive about actually entering the race.
Early polls, which are being closely followed by Republicans in
Washington, suggest how tight this contest could be.
</P>
<P>
   And the risk that Pataki's covert support of Lazio could be
viewed as disloyal became clear this week after an encounter
between the governor and Neal Travis, a New York Post gossip
columnist, at a birthday party for Alfonse M. D'Amato, the former
senator, in Bridgehampton last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   When Travis asked about the best candidate to run against Mrs.
Clinton, Pataki laughed and said, ``You mean Rick Lazio, of
course.''
</P>
<P>
   His senior political adviser, Zenia Mucha, said Friday that the
governor was being jocular. Still, the remarks stirred new waves of
concern among Republicans inside and outside the state.
</P>
<P>
   There is no evidence of Pataki's having expressed much interest
in Lazio's political fortunes before this year. And while Lazio
could be a formidable opponent to Giuliani in a Republican primary
_ he is more conservative on issues that would count with that
electorate _ most politicians in the state believe that the mayor
would be a far stronger Republican opponent to the first lady.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the problem for Pataki is that the New York
political stage is only so big. To increase Giuliani's stature,
then, is to diminish Pataki's. And so, when Pataki finally decided
to make his announcement, he did it with as much fanfare as might
accompany a visit by the governor to the dentist.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki _ who had rented a huge Manhattan ballroom for his
well-advertised endorsement of Gov. George W. Bush of Texas for
president earlier this year _ this time read a short, terse
statement from a lectern in his office, on a hot and lazy Friday
afternoon in August, when experienced politicians often release
news that they want to get minimal attention. The governor took a
few questions and then hurried back to his office.

   WASHINGTON _ Network Solutions Inc., which has been battling the
federal government over the company's monopoly on registering
Internet addresses, or domains, agreed Thursday to open its
database _ the equivalent of the Internet's telephone directory _
to public use while negotiations over its monopoly continue.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce Department announced the agreement as it extended
for a third time, until Sept. 10, its target date for introducing
full-scale competition into the domain registration business.
</P>
<P>
   The department and Network Solutions are wrangling over the
terms under which other companies can begin adding Internet
addresses to the master registry of addresses that end in .com,
.net and .org, which the company still administers.
</P>
<P>
   Among the key sticking points has been ownership of the
database. The data had always been considered public, but earlier
this year Network Solutions claimed it as the company's
intellectual property.

TINO MARTINEZ'S NUMBERS HAVE NOT ADDED UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The roof on the beautiful new Safeco Field began to
close as the New York Yankees took batting practice before Thursday
night's game, the massive retractable sections eventually
spreading, like a tent spread for an evening picnic.
</P>
<P>
   Chad Curtis and other Yankees who hit in the first rounds of
batting practice noticed that with the roof open, fly balls tended
to lose their propulsion quickly. Once the roof closed, and the
field was better shielded from the wind, the ball carried better _
as Tino Martinez discovered once the game began.
</P>
<P>
   After chatting with Joe Torre in the manager's office and
working diligently with the batting coach Chris Chambliss, Martinez
broke out of a slump with a pair of home runs, the 200th and 201st
of his career, as the Yankees dumped the Mariners, 7-4, and moved 6
1/2 games ahead of the Toronto Blue Jays in the American League
East.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours before the game, Torre summoned Martinez to his
office to talk about what Martinez thinks about when he is hitting.
This is what Torre does with slumping players: he reminds them of
all the good things they have done and will do again. Torre told
Martinez that even when he is not hitting, he is an important
member of the team.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, in turn, reminded Torre that when Martinez was with
the Mariners, he often batted seventh against left-handed starters
and doing so with the Yankees would not bother him. So Martinez
batted seventh, the lowest lineup position he has occupied in his
four seasons with the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``You try to get him to relax,'' Torre said after the game. ``We
all know he can be very tough on himself. You just have to keep
supporting him, and keep telling him not to force it.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez had not hit a home run in 79 at-bats and had just 15
runs batted in during his previous 35 games. He has felt as if,
lately, he has been more responsible for his own failures than
opposing pitchers have been; Martinez felt he was lurching at the
ball with his body, and in turn, his swing often was ill-timed, out
in front.
</P>
<P>
   In working with Chambliss before Thursday night's game, Martinez
and the coach tried a new approach _ the same solution that helped
Baltimore's Cal Ripken work through what appeared to be a terminal
slump earlier this year and drive his batting average over .300.
Like Ripken, Martinez is trying to reduce the movement in his body
and trust his hands to do more of the work; keep the body still and
bring the hands through. During Thursday night's game, Martinez
felt that his stroke was more compact, quicker.
</P>
<P>
   He slammed a breaking ball from Seattle's Jamie Moyer to
right-center field in his first at-bat, in the second inning, his
200th home run clearing the wall and the outstretched glove of
right fielder Jay Buhner by inches. Four innings later, Martinez
again homered off Moyer, this ball going deep into the right-field
stands.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez is like Paul O'Neill in that he berates himself
constantly, but Martinez's anger is contained; he is like a giant
steam engine without release. Afterward, after he felt he had
contributed, Martinez smiled broadly, happily, finally.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not hard when it's early in the season and you're trying
to get going,'' Martinez said. ``When it's August, it's more
frustrating, because you know your season is coming to an end and I
feel like I haven't done much and I want to get hot going into the
post-season.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez did not have to go far for his pregame work with
Chambliss, for the visitors' clubhouse is next to a batting cage,
just one of the many reasons why the Yankees offered four-star
reviews of Safeco Field.
</P>
<P>
   Torre believes the park is fair to pitchers, with relatively
deep alleys in left-center and right-center; most new parks, Torre
noted, are built to facilitate offense, but here a ball can be hit
hard to straightaway center and stay in the park.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Clemens, who worked seven innings Thursday in improving
his record to 10-4, liked the mound. The clubhouse is beautiful,
the players said, although Joe Girardi stretched for a clothes
hanger and suggested with a smile that the lockers are built for
basketball players.
</P>
<P>
   Fans surround the bullpens beyond the left-field fence, and one
plunked reliever Ramiro Mendoza on the head with a hot dog. When
warming up in the bullpen, Clemens suggested that he felt as if he
was throwing down a small alley. Curtis said he loved the green
colors, of the grass, of the field. ``Green goes good with
baseball,'' Curtis said.
</P>
<P>
   The dugout has the smell of freshly cut wood. Several Yankees
mentioned that even with the roof overhead, there were still
open-air areas all around the perimeter of the park, leaving the
players with the feeling that they were conducting the game
outdoors. They all agreed that Safeco is a vast improvement over
the Kingdome, which was dark and hard in both its artificial
surface and its feeling. ``You're cheating the people in this city
when you make them go inside,'' Torre said. ``The people here are
so hardy and they like to be outdoors.''
</P>
<P>
   Said O'Neill, ``All new ballparks are nice, but this is extra
nice, because you're coming from that dome.''

BOND BUYBACK IS ROUTINE BOOKKEEPING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The excitement over the Treasury's much ballyhooed plan to buy
back some of its bonds proved once again how little the public
understands when it comes to Washington's fiscal machinations. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   First of all, the administration didn't really commit to
repurchasing the bonds. Rather, it announced a proposed mechanism
for doing so, which makes it something less than a big deal. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A more significant reason it's not a big deal is the way debt
reductions have become routine. Hardly anyone notices, though,
because it's all green-eyeshade stuff. No political hoopla, just
boring bookkeeping. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A couple of weeks ago the Treasury announced it was paying down
$10.7 billion in federal debt this quarter. It was as simple as the
amount of the newly issued debt amounting to $10.7 billion less
than old debt being retired. Nobody made a big deal of it, but
perhaps they should have. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Over the past 12 months the total marketable debt outstanding
has declined by $127 billion. This is the portion of the debt held
mostly by individual and institutional investors and foreign
governments. In terms of budgetary surplus, this is the real deal. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This improvement gets lost in the overall national debt figures,
however, because the total nonmarketable debt increased $206
billion during the same period. The nonmarketable debt, as some
Americans are beginning to understand, is the money borrowed from
trust funds such as Social Security when tax revenues earmarked for
specific purposes outpace the program's expenditures. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Uncle Sam spends the extra money and the trust funds get an IOU,
which also pays interest. No real money is involved, however,
because these are only accounting transactions. Nevertheless, the
resulting IOUs show up on the books as part of the national debt. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Thus, what we have here is a situation in which Washington is
spending excess tax receipts dedicated to Social Security, highway
construction, airport infrastructure and the like faster than the
Treasury can pay down the publicly held debt, which is real money
owed real people. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When the Treasury this week signaled an inclination to buy back
some of its debt, it was talking about the bond portion, which is
the longest-term and smallest component of the federal debt.
Whatever happens, these transactions won't make much practical
difference in the grand scheme of federal debt management. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So, why all the excitement? The Financial Times got it just
about right when it said the intention is ``to cast the Democrats
as the party of sound economic management in the run-up to next
year's presidential election as they battle against Republican
plans for huge tax cuts over the next 10 years.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In reality there is no ``party of sound economic management,''
Democrat or Republican. There are only politicians dedicated to
hornswoggling hard-working taxpayers. This is easily done because
most Americans don't have a clue as to the devious ways Washington
manipulates the nation's finances. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The administration says this is like refinancing a mortgage.
Depends on how you look at it. Even if all the national debt's
publicly held bond component were involved, it would amount to only
$10,000 or so worth of a $100,000 mortgage. &QL;

ELDERLY MAN IS CHARGED WITH HELPING HIS AILING WIFE COMMIT SUICIDE
</HEADLINE>
  (af)  
 By SUSAN SACHS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A 75-year-old man was charged Friday with helping his
ailing wife commit suicide by fixing a rope to a ceiling beam in
their Queens apartment and tying it into the noose she used to hang
herself early Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The man, Peter Florio, stood silently in Queens Criminal Court
Friday as his lawyer entered a plea of not guilty to a single
charge of second-degree manslaughter during a brief arraignment.
Judge Pauline Mullings set bail at $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said Florio, a trim gray-haired retiree, had told
them that his wife, Ann, had often asked him to help her commit
suicide after learning five months ago that she had Parkinson's
disease.
</P>
<P>
   The police said Mrs. Florio, 70, had recently been told that she
was not improving and that, in addition to Parkinson's, a
degenerative neurological disease, she had heart problems. She
bought the rope about one week ago, according to the account her
husband gave to the police, and announced that she wanted his help
in hanging herself.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators said Florio told them that late on Wednesday
in their apartment, he drilled a hole in the ceiling beam, threaded
the rope through it and made a noose.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday morning, about 7:30, he left the apartment to do
errands and go to a doctor's appointment, according to the account
he gave to the police. When he returned home about 1 p.m., Florio
told the police, he found his wife hanging from the rope, dead, and
called paramedics.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, criminal charges for assisted suicide are rare, in
large part because few of the deaths are dramatic or public enough
to draw the attention of law enforcement authorities. And when
people have been accused of helping an ill family member or friend
die, juries have proved reluctant to punish.
</P>
<P>
   Only last month, a Manhattan grand jury declined to indict Marco
Zancope, a Manhattan veterinarian who said he had acceded to a
dying friend's request to inject her with a fatal dose of drugs.
Like Florio, he had been charged with second-degree manslaughter.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors described the Florios as a devoted couple who had been
married for more than 45 years, always danced together at their
building's annual courtyard party and loved to feed the stray cats
in the neighborhood. For the last five years or so, they lived on
the fifth floor of a six-story cooperative apartment building in
Jackson Heights.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Florio was said to be an avid reader who regularly walked
the 10 blocks from her apartment to the library to replenish her
stock of books. Lately, people in the building said, she had not
been seen much.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't seen Ann for about a month, so I asked Pete how she
was doing,'' said one neighbor, Margaret Hughes. ``He told me, `Not
too well. She doesn't go out much. She's been having some health
problems.' I didn't think much of it at the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Gonzalez, the superintendent of the Queens apartment
building where the Florios used to live, said he had seen the
couple a few days ago when they came to put out food for the
strays. Mrs. Florio, he said, appeared ill and sad.
</P>
<P>
   ``She told me she was very sick and hardly went out anymore,''
Gonzalez said. ``She said she'd waited until late afternoon to come
that day because it wouldn't be as hot. Her husband told me she had
a heart condition and he felt bad for her because she was so
sick.''
</P>
<P>
   John J. Halton, the lawyer representing Florio, said it would be
premature to provide information about the family or the
circumstances of Mrs. Florio's death. ``They were a very loving
couple and now the family is dealing with a tragedy of immense
proportion,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The manslaughter statute under which Florio is charged
specifically covers those who intentionally cause or aid another
person to commit suicide. It carries a possible prison term of up
to 15 years. &QL;

SEASON OVER FOR SPEEDY RECEIVER MCKNIGHT WITH TORN ACL (For use by
NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS _ There was a moment during a spirited photo-op
before coach Chan Gailey's daily news conference yesterday when
Jerry Jones suddenly lost his smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did y'all get the official word on James McKnight?'' the
Cowboys owner] asked inside the interview room before delivering
the worst news of the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``ACL. Out for the year.''
</P>
<P>
   That was it in a painful nutshell.
</P>
<P>
   McKnight, whom the Cowboys acquired just six week ago from
Seattle to be a deep threat in Gailey's four-wide receiver package,
was the most serious casualty in a Blue-White scrimmage in which
nine players made the team's official injury list.
</P>
<P>
   McKnight, whom the Cowboys traded a third-round pick in 2000 to
get, has been diagnosed with a torn anterior cruciate ligament, and
will undergo surgery within the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to lose a guy who had such great potential to come
in and be a positive force on your football team,'' Gailey said.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I've never been around that many injuries in one
\Rscrimmage\S situation like that before. If I have, I probably
blotted it out of my memory.''
</P>
<P>
   The loss of McKnight creates a highly competitive duel between
much-improved, second-year veteran Jeff Ogden and rookie Wane
McGarity, a fourth-round pick from Texas. Either Ogden or McGarity
will be in the No. 4 wide-receiver position behind Michael Irvin,
Raghib ``Rocket'' Ismail and Ernie Mills.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey suggested that the Cowboys are in an ongoing ``evaluating
process'' to see if there is a need to go outside the team to bring
in a quality receiver or if their needs can be met by players
already in camp.
</P>
<P>
   Translation: It's too early to tell.
</P>
<P>
   But don't look for management to have a knee-jerk reaction and
bring in a big-time receiver, even if a couple of big-time names
are out there: Carl Pickens, who continues to say he will never
play again for the Cincinnati Bengals, and Michael Jackson, who
isn't with any team after the Baltimore Ravens declined to exercise
the option in his contract in 1999. The Cowboys brought in Jackson
for a workout in June.
</P>
<P>
   The Bengals supposedly have turned down a first-round pick in
exchange for Pickens, and reportedly want first- and third-round
picks. They initially demanded a pair of No. 1 picks. Pickens has
said through his agent, Stephen Zucker, that he would play for the
Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   ``If our receiver situation can hold up as it is right now,''
said Stephen Jones, Cowboys executive VP/player personnel, ``even
with the injury to McKnight, we're confident that our current group
of receivers can get the job done.''
</P>
<P>
   The loss of McKnight also cracked the door open a few more
inches for two of three more young receivers to make the team:
MarTay Jenkins, a sixth-round rookie from Nebraska-Omaha, and a
pair of first-year free agents who played at TCU _ Jason Tucker and
John Washington. The Cowboys most likely will keep six wide
receivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I've said 100 times before,'' Gailey said, ``injuries give
someone else an opportunity to come in and make plays.
</P>
<P>
   Cases in point include rookie offensive tackle Solomon Page, a
second-round rookie from West Virginia, and Jeremy Akers, a
free-agent offensive tackle from NFL Europe. Both could be starters
against the new Cleveland Browns on Monday night in the Pro
Football Hall of Fame game in Canton, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Akers worked for the first time with the first unit yesterday.
He replaced Flozell Adams at left tackle, which protects Troy
Aikman's blind side. Adams suffered a strained hip flexor Thursday
night in the scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Adams, the next most serious injury from the
scrimmage was to cornerback Kevin Mathis, with a lower back
contusion.
</P>
<P>
   But neither was as bad as the news on McKnight.
</P>
<P>
   Because the trade with Seattle occurred in June, ``\RMcKnight\S
hadn't been in any minicamps, any coaching sessions ... we were
just getting to know each other really,'' Gailey said. ``We didn't
have anything especially planned for him, but after two weeks of
practice it was \Rbecoming\S an exciting thought process.''
</P>
<P>
   In McKnight, the Cowboys have lost more than just a wide
receiver.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had two big roles he was going to play for us,'' Gailey
said. ``He was going to be a deep threat or speed receiver, and he
was going to get a lot of snaps. Plus, he was an excellent
special-teams player. That's two spots we have to fill now.''
</P>
<P>
   The possibility always exists that the Cowboys can decide to
upgrade any area of the team through the waiver wire, but the
better players won't become available for more than two weeks. NFL
teams cut down to 60 players Aug. 31 and to 53 players Sept. 5. nn

WIFE OF U.S. ARMY OFFICER IN COLOMBIA CHARGED IN DRUG CONSPIRACY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to add five grafs to end of original text; In 4th graf of 1st

 By ROBERT D. McFADDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In April and May, Laurie Anne Hiett, the wife of an
Army colonel in charge of all U.S. military operations in Colombia,
mailed six packages to New York City from the American Embassy in
Bogota. Each was sealed in plain brown paper and weighed several
pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hiett, 36, sent four of them to an apartment in Queens and
the others to mail drops in Queens and Manhattan. She wrote her
name clearly on the return addresses and filled out U.S. Customs
forms declaring the contents to be books on Colombia or items like
candy, a T-shirt, coffee or candles.
</P>
<P>
   But the names of the recipients were fictitious and the packages
turned out to contain a total of 15.8 pounds of pure cocaine with a
street value of up to $230,000, according to a criminal complaint
filed on Thursday in federal court in Brooklyn charging Ms. Hiett
and two others in a bizarre drug-trafficking conspiracy that took
advantage of the embassy's special mailing privileges.
</P>
<P>
   A three-month undercover operation by New York police, U.S.
Customs agents and the Army's Criminal Investigation Division found
no evidence of involvement by Col. James Hiett, her husband. He
joined the Army in 1976 and became a colonel in 1992. He was
responsible for U.S. military activity in Colombia from July 1998
until last week, when he stepped aside voluntarily because of the
allegations against his wife.
</P>
<P>
   While the purported drug-smuggling operation was not large, the
allegations brushing the embassy come at a sensitive time in the
joint efforts to combat the drug trade in Colombia, the world's No.
1 source of cocaine and the primary country of concern for American
anti-drug policy. It will receive $289 million in aid from
Washington this year, and most of it will go to fight the drug war.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hiett, who was arraigned before Magistrate Judge Cheryl
Pollak in federal court in Brooklyn on Thursday and ordered
released on $150,000 personal recognizance bond, admitted to
investigators that she had mailed the packages, but insisted that
she had not known the contents and that she had sent them at the
behest of her husband's chauffeur, a Colombian national.
</P>
<P>
   The chauffeur, Jorge Alfonso Ayala, who had been a driver for
the American Embassy in Bogota for 15 years, was named as a
co-conspirator and was being sought by the authorities in Colombia.
The complaint said he told investigators at the embassy in June
that Ms. Hiett ``abused cocaine,'' and that he helped her buy it in
La Zona Rosa, a notorious drug-trafficking district in Bogota, and
from ``an unknown woman in a taxi'' at the back gate of the
embassy.
</P>
<P>
   Confronted with these assertions by the investigators, the
complaint said, Ms. Hiett became ``extremely agitated.'' She
insisted that she had got the packages from Ayala, who ``obtained
them from individuals in a taxi outside the embassy.'' But when
pressed, she said: ``I'm afraid they'll kill me.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hiett's lawyer, Paul Lazarus of Miami, said Friday that his
client denied the allegations, although he noted that no indictment
had been filed, and that Ms. Hiett had not yet been required to
enter a plea. He said he was not prepared to make further
statements until he had a chance to study the case, which was first
reported Thursday evening on the Web site of The Village Voice
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Dunst, the assistant federal prosecutor in the case,
declined to comment beyond the complaint, which accused Timla
Arcila, 61, and her brother, Hernan Arcila, 53, of receiving the
packages at their apartment at 31-47 92nd St. in Jackson Heights,
Queens; at a rented post office box in Elmhurst, Queens, and at a
commercial mail drop in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Arcila was named as a co-defendant and was arraigned and
released on bail on Thursday. No dates for later hearings were set.
Conviction on the federal charge of conspiracy to possess cocaine
with intent to distribute it is subject to 10 to 12 years in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   No federal charges were filed against Hernan Arcila, who was
being held at the Queens House of Detention on an unrelated charge,
filed by the Queens district attorney, of criminal possession of
narcotics in the first degree, which carries a penalty of up to
life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for Colombia's ministry of defense, which oversees
relations between Colombian and American security forces in the
drug wars, and for President Andres Pastrana, declined to comment
on the case. The Colombian Embassy in Washington did not respond to
requests for comment, and the U.S. Embassy in Bogota, citing
privacy considerations, said it too could not comment.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But a Colombian government official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said that Ms. Hiett's contention that she had mailed
packages containing cocaine unknowingly at the request of her
family's driver did not seem far-fetched. He noted that mail
service in Colombia, as in many Latin American countries, was
unreliable, and that Colombians close to foreign diplomats often
asked them to send mail.
</P>
<P>
   However, such requests are usually to mail letters, not
packages, and to show that nothing illegal is being mailed the
packages are left unsealed when given to American diplomats or
members of their families. ``I think she was being extremely
naive,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   But investigators said there was ample evidence that Ms. Hiett
was aware of what was in the packages. They said Customs travel
records show that she even made several trips to the United States
in April and May, and indicated that the purpose of the trips was
to prepare for and help coordinate the conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   According to the federal complaint, the packages _ each about 12
inches long, 6 inches high and 4 inches wide and weighing about
three pounds _ were mailed from the embassy's postal service, which
is not open to the general public and does not even provide
services for Colombian citizens who work at the embassy.
</P>
<P>
   The packages were sent between April 13 and May 26, four of them
to the Arcila apartment in Jackson Heights, but two others to the
mail drops in Queens and Manhattan that were said to have been
rented by Timla Arcila. On May 23, a Customs official in Miami,
conducting a routine search, discovered cocaine in one of the
packages, which was addressed to a Jacqueline Wellipon at the
Queens apartment. Ms. Hiett's name was on the return address.
</P>
<P>
   Law-enforcement officials then began an undercover
investigation. The package containing the cocaine was delivered to
the Arcilas, who accepted it saying that the addressee was not
home. The brother and sister were arrested, and a search of their
apartment found more cocaine, $13,000 in cash and notes that led
the authorities to suspect Ayala's involvement.
</P>
<P>
   Other packages containing cocaine were found at the mail drops,
and officials said that customs declarations, admissions by the
Arcilas and other evidence made them conclude that at least six
packages of cocaine were sent from the embassy, five directly by
Ms. Hiett and one by another woman acting for her. The other woman,
not identified in the complaint, was described as a witness and was
not regarded as a suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the six packages, for which Arcila said he was paid
$1,500, contained 1.2 kilograms of cocaine, or about 2.64 pounds.
In total, the six packages contained 7.2 kilos, or 15.84 pounds,
which narcotics investigators said had a street value in New York
of up to $230,400. Investigators said others who were believed to
have paid Arcila were being pursued.
</P>
<P>
   When first questioned, Ms. Hiett said Ayala approached her
several months earlier and asked if she could mail a package for a
friend from the embassy, and she said she had agreed. She said the
package was wrapped in brown paper and sealed when she got it,
though she wrote the address and return address, as Ayala had
specified.
</P>
<P>
   Why she listed contents at all if she did not know what they
were was unexplained.
</P>
<P>
   The case comes at a sensitive time in relations between
Washington and Bogota over joint efforts to combat cocaine and
heroin trafficking that intelligence officials believe is
supporting left-wing guerrillas. Critics contend that it is
becoming increasingly difficult to distinguish between the drug
fight and combat with the Colombian guerrillas.

ANOTHER DAY, ANOTHER MILESTONE AS GWYNN REACHES 3,000 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ADDS Gwynn going 4 for 5 in fifth graf, attendance figure in 14th
graf.) (af) 
 By MURRAY CHASS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service      
<TEXT>
<P>
   In what seems to be baseball's nightly milestone, Tony Gwynn of
the San Diego Padres took his long expected place among the game's
great hitters Friday night, stroking the 3,000th hit of his career
at Olympic Stadium in Montreal. He was the 22nd player to reach the
3,000 plateau and the first to do it outside the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn's first-ining line single against Dan Smith, the Expo's
rookie right-hander, ended what little suspense was left after he
hit No. 2,999 on Thursday night in St. Louis. That hit came in the
same game in which Mark McGwire became the 16th player to hit 500
home runs.
</P>
<P>
   Never before had two hitters attained the 500 home run and 3,000
hit milestones in such proximity. In 1970, Ernie Banks slugged his
500th home run on May 12, and five days later Hank Aaron collected
his 3,000th hit. Two months after that Willie Mays joined Aaron
and, at the time, eight other players in the 3,000 circle.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``I just want to get it done,'' Gwynn had said in St. Louis
after Thursday night's game. ``I just want to get a hit. It's down
to one little hit. One hit. Chinker, blooper, line drive, just one
hit.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gwynn went well beyond the hit he wanted. He collected four
hits in the Padres' 12-10 victory and left the game in the eighth
inning with a career total of 3,003.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Waiting to join Gwynn was Wade Boggs, who entered Tampa Bay's
game against Cleveland on Friday night needing three hits. The
careers of Gwynn and Boggs have paralleled each other. Both first
played in the major leagues in 1982, and both have won multiple
batting championships, eight in the National League for Gwynn, five
in the American League for Boggs.
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn, whose physique belies his talent as a hitter, would have
made it to 3,000 much earlier this season, but an ailing left calf
sent him to the disabled list twice. Nevertheless, he needed the
third-fewest games among the 22 players to reach 3,000. This was
his 2,284th game, trailing only Ty Cobb with 2,135 and Nap Lajoie
with 2,224.
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn, 39, is the first National League player to get to 3,000
in 20 years, since Lou Brock in August 1979. Seven American
Leaguers have joined the group since then. Paul Molitor, who was
the last, did it in 1996 with Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   A smooth left-hand hitter, Gwynn is also the 11th player to
collect all 3,000 hits with one team. George Brett of Kansas City
and Robin Yount of Milwaukee, who reached that total three weeks
apart in 1992, were the last to achieve the milestone with one
team.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres' right fielder had hoped to end his pursuit of the
magic number in St. Louis, but he failed to get a hit in his first
three plate appearances Thursday night. Then in his last at-bat, in
the ninth inning, he lined a double along the right-field line for
No. 2,999, and Friday night he remained on a roll.
</P>
<P>
   After he sent a soft liner past second base on Smith's 1-2 pitch
in his first time at bat, Gwynn singled up the middle in his second
at-bat, nudging ahead of Roberto Clemente of Pittsburgh, whose
final hit of the 1972 season, a double against the Mets' Jon
Matlack, was the 3,000th and last hit of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Clemente was killed in a plane crash the following New Year's
Eve as he was en route from Puerto Rico to Nicaragua with food and
supplies for earthquake victims.
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn singled again in the sixth inning for his 3,002nd hit.
Gwynn's next target as he climbs the list is Al Kaline of Detroit
at 3,007. Then comes Brock at 3,023.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the crowd at sold-out Busch Stadium in St. Louis on
Thursday night, 13,540 fans were in the stands at Olympic Stadium
for Gwynn's feat. The size of the crowd was not surprising because
the Expos have the tiniest attendance in the major leagues.
</P>
<P>
   But the fans who were there stood and clapped throughout Gwynn's
first-inning at-bat and saluted him when he got the hit with a loud
and lengthy ovation. Even louder were the fireworks, in place for
Expos home runs, that were set off instantly.
</P>
<P>
   His teammates raced onto the field and mobbed him, and even the
first base umpire, Kerwin Danley, got caught up in the emotion and
excitement of the moment, hugging Gwynn. Then Gwynn's mother,
Vendella came onto the field and embraced him.
</P>
<P>
   That Gwynn waited until this night to get No. 3,000 was in one
way fitting. It was a special present for his mother, who was
celebrating her 64th birthday. Six years ago on her birthday, Gwynn
rapped No. 2,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of ironic that I can get 3,000 on her birthday,
too,'' Gwynn said in Montreal before Friday night's game. ``I'm
going to try my best, but it's like I told her this afternoon, I'm
not going to try to force the action. I'm just going to try to take
what they give me.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gwynn was on hand along with Gwynn's wife, Alicia, and
their daughter, Anisha.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's gone from one end of the country to the end of another
country to see this and it means a lot having her here,'' Gwynn
said of his mother. ``I thought 2,000 was a pretty good one, but
for a contact hitter this is the ultimate.''
</P>
<P>
   Although none of the previous 21 players got his 3,000th in
Montreal, Pete Rose, when he was playing for the Expos, stroked No.
4,000 in the Canadian city on his way to finishing with an all-time
high of 4,256 hits.

THE Y2K MEDIA FRANCHISE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID HAYES and FINN BULLERS  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Y2K bug has never really been just a computer problem. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The bug has scored roles in local and national TV commercials
and become a Hollywood problem child. Books? We quit counting at
50, but Amazon.com lists 300 titles. There's a TV infomercial. Even
songwriter and singer Loudon Wainwright III has jumped on the Y2K
bandwagon. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Follow us on the trail of this emerging media icon. &QL; 
Restraint 1, bug 0 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Despite reports in the Boston Globe, Newsweek and elsewhere, a
Warner Bros. spokesman in Kansas City, Mo., tells us the studio
never had plans for a Year 2000 movie. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The script for ``Y2K'' simply didn't hold up, said publicist Tom
Blanck, and is being shopped around to the studio's sister
organizations such as HBO. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The film's producers apparently thought they had a deal _ after
all, Warner Bros. has a Web site at www.y2k-themovie.com. The
producers now criticize the studio for not putting faith in
moviegoers to distinguish the difference between Year 2000 fact and
fantasy. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like they don't even want to talk about Y2K,'' said Bing
Howenstein, president of George Street Pictures, the company behind
the film. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Chris O'Donnell, the boy wonder of Batman fame, was cast to
portray a computer programmer who discovers a Y2K bug that could
leave New York security systems vulnerable to terrorists. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some thought the script was too provocative but movie consultant
Peter de Jager, the Toronto computer guru who is credited with
first sounding the global alarm about Y2K, said the movie script is
``non-volatile.'' &QL; 
Bug 1, Hollywood 1 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Spectrum Films of Mesa, Ariz., whose Web address is just one
character off from the Warner Bros. movie site, is scheduled to
release its direct-to-video thriller, ``Y2K: Year to Kill,'' on
Aug. 31. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who prepared for the millennium have become the target
of those who didn't,'' says the movie's Internet trailer, which can
be found at www.y2kthemovie.com. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Amid the chaos, a gang of young thieves run rampant, taking
what they want and killing whom they please. Everyone is at risk in
a world without technology, where trust and ammunition are the only
currencies.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The depths of our anxiety appear to be limitless, said Jonathan
Imber, editor of Society magazine. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no coincidence that in the last several years we've had
all these movies about violence and the Earth being destroyed,'' he
said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference may be that today, people are just capitalizing
on those anxieties rather than believing everything is going to
come to an end. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a commercial opportunity for everyone in Hollywood.'' And
Arizona. &QL; 
Bankers 1, bug jokes 0 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Moments before New Year's Eve, a young man stares vacantly at
the ATM screen. His bank account in glowing green figures shows him
to be a pauper. He snaps a picture of the monitor with his new
PopShot camera from Polaroid _ instant Y2K hard copy financial
backup. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The clock strikes 2000 and bingo _ the Y2K bug adds an extra
string of zeroes to his bank balance. Our pre-2000 pauper is now a
budding Silicon Valley venture capitalist. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A second photo with the Polaroid PopShot records his newfound
wealth in the parody commercial. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the American Bankers Association is not laughing. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some things you just don't joke about,'' said George
Cleland, a spokesman for the trade association that represents some
6,000 large and small banks. ``On this issue, there are a lot of
people who just don't get the humor.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Suggesting banks will have problems could create real problems,
he said. ``We simply don't want people to ... take all their money
out of the bank. That is foolish and dangerous.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Banks are heavily regulated by the federal government and are
considered to be well prepared to handle any Y2K glitches. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So when approached by the bankers, Polaroid, based in Cambridge,
Mass., agreed to pull its ad. But that was not the case in May,
when Kia Motors, based in Irvine, Calif., took on the bankers. &QL; 
Bug jokes 1, bankers 1 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Two Kia spots to promote a May sales event were intended to mock
extremist reactions to the year 2000. One ad showed a run on a bank
and another featured a family hunkered in a bunker. The message?
Y2K actually meant ``Yes 2 Kia.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The campaign gave the upstart motor company its second-best
sales month in its history, selling 12,795 cars in May. That
compares with 11,400 sold in March and 13,593 in June, said Geno
Effler, the firm's public relations manager. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the campaign also ticked off bankers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kia received 150 letters from bankers across the country
complaining about the spots. Two letters from banks in
Massachusetts said the lending institutions would not loan money to
those seeking funds to purchase a Kia, Effler said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Effler characterized those letters as a ``threat'' and said he
has since forwarded them to the consumer protection branch of the
Federal Trade Commission. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, both sides are standing their ground. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The bankers association says it is prepared to confront any
media spots that it says work to undo the $8.2 billion being spent
by financial institutions to combat Y2K. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kia, for its part, is preparing to challenge a Wisconsin bank to
a Y2K readiness test, Effler said. In a June 18 letter, the bank
took Kia to task for its ads and claimed the bank was more prepared
for the year 2000 than was Kia Motors. &QL; 
Dead bug &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If bankers are angry at Kia, they might love the folks at S.C.
Johnson &AMP; Son in Racine, Wis. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The makers of Raid are airing an animated commercial with a can
of the well-known insect killer chasing the Y2K bug. The can, of
course, wins. And the proclamation from S.C. Johnson? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's official. The millennium bug is a dead issue.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Skunks in the machine &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even Loudon Wainwright III, best known for writing that little
1970s ditty ``Dead Skunk (In the Middle of the Road)'' is getting
in on the Y2K action. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wainwright's latest album, released last month, includes a song
called ``Y2K ... a song which celebrates the termination of the
world as we know it promptly on Jan. 1, 2000,'' according to
Hannibal Records. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital.)We've been trucking down the information
superhighway &QL;

WITHOUT ENTHUSIASM, PATAKI ENDORSES GIULIANI FOR SENATE

 By CLIFFORD LEVY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Seeking to avoid a civil war that could poison the
Republicans' chances next year, Gov. George Pataki on Friday put
aside his antipathy toward New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani,
endorsed him for U.S. Senate and urged the other major contender to
abandon the race.
</P>
<P>
   The governor, who had faced pressure from the national party to
end what had appeared to be a furtive campaign to undermine the
mayor, said Giuliani was the best candidate to take on the probable
Democratic nominee, the first lady, Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki said he had asked Rep. Rick Lazio, a Long Island
Republican who had been planning to enter the primary with the
governor's tacit backing, to run only if Giuliani did not.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio had said in recent months that he would drop out if Pataki
wanted him to, but Lazio's associates said Friday night that he
would not do so. It was clear, though, that without the support of
Pataki, the party leader in New York, Lazio would find that his
prospects would quickly wither.
</P>
<P>
   While Pataki had never formally endorsed Lazio, Pataki's
longstanding reluctance to support Giuliani, and his praise for
Lazio, had signaled his preference. On Friday, though, Pataki said
it was time for Lazio to retreat to the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ``To win, we have to unite behind one strong candidate,'' Pataki
said at a news conference at his Manhattan office. ``I believe Rudy
Giuliani has earned the right to be that candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has not formally declared that he is a candidate, but
he has acted like one, harvesting more than $3 million in donations
and familiarizing himself with regions of the state unaccustomed to
visits from New York City mayors. With a Republican primary now
less likely, Giuliani can train his sights on Mrs. Clinton, in a
campaign that is expected to be one of the most expensive,
contentious and well-publicized in the nation's history.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Wolfson, a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton's exploratory
committee, offered little reaction to the governor's move. ``What
the Republicans do or don't do is up to them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While Pataki commended Giuliani on Friday, the tone of the
announcement suggested that the endorsement was less than
enthusiastic. The governor called the news conference with almost
no notice and did not appear with the mayor, as is customary at
such events. In contrast, when Pataki threw his support in May to
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas in the Republican presidential
primary, Pataki aides tried to orchestrate a lengthy build-up to
the announcement, and Bush spoke by satellite at the news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after Pataki made the announcement, Giuliani issued a short
statement thanking him, but did not speak to reporters. ``I very
much appreciate Gov. George Pataki's strong words of support,''
Giuliani said.
</P>
<P>
   The endorsement opens a new chapter in a relationship that has
rarely been warm. It was perhaps irrevocably scarred in 1994, when
the mayor supported the incumbent Democrat, Gov. Mario Cuomo, over
Pataki, then an obscure state senator. While they still tend to
utter niceties in public about one another, both men and their
aides are continually suspicious that the other side is engaging in
some strategy to embarrass or hurt them.
</P>
<P>
   And Pataki and his associates obviously realize that if Giuliani
becomes senator, he will gain stature and might even be able to
challenge the governor for the leadership of the party in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki and his advisers said he had decided to issue the
endorsement Friday because the Legislature had just concluded its
annual session, allowing him to concentrate on politics. Pataki
also wanted to head off Lazio before leaving for a vacation in
Ireland and France on Monday. Lazio had planned to announce his
candidacy on Aug. 16th.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's mentor, former Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, who has also
feuded with the mayor, met with Giuliani this week, and their
discussions may have also helped bring about detente. On Friday
afternoon, D'Amato issued a short statement backing Giuliani in the
race, though its tenor left the impression that he too was giving a
grudging endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more important than the maneuvering in New York were the
repercussions of the internecine strife on the national scene.
National party officials are eager to seize the Senate seat, which
is now held by a Democrat, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who is
retiring. But they had expressed growing concern that after a
debilitating Republican primary, Mrs. Clinton would coast to
victory.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki may have begun to fear that if that happened, he would be
blamed, and his national standing would suffer. The governor has
been seeking to broaden his reputation, and his aides say he would
like to become the Republican vice presidential nominee next year.
</P>
<P>
   National Republicans had even debated whether they should try to
mediate between the governor and mayor, but concluded that such a
strategy might only exacerbate the situation. They decided instead
on prodding Pataki behind the scenes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a big concern,'' said U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell,
R-Ky., who oversees the Republicans' campaign arm in the Senate.
``This is a big step forward.''

ANGELS CALL UP DURRINGTON

   ANAHEIM -- It figured the Angels would search far and wide to
find a second baseman. But Australia?
</P>
<P>
   The Angels called up 23-year-old second baseman Trent Durrington
Friday and put him in the starting lineup. Durrington, a native of
Sydney, Australia, was playing at double-A Erie this season.
</P>
<P>
   He's been in the Angels' organization since 1994 after playing
for the Australian National Team. He was hitting .288 for Erie this
season with a league-leading 59 stolen bases.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball, as one might imagine, was not his primary sport
growing up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played rugby,'' said Durrington, who is 5-foot-10, 172
pounds. ``A buddy was playing baseball and I was looking for a
summer sport. I asked him to take me and I loved it from Day One.''
</P>
<P>
   Angels manager Terry Collins emphasized that Durrington is here
to stake a claim for the starting job next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not here to audition, just to play,'' Collins said. ``He
can't worry about what he does here, he just needs to play. We want
to look at a young player whose had a good year and worked hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Durrington said because baseball isn't publicized much in
Australia, he didn't have an opportunity to choose players to
emulate. But ``(Chuck) Knoblauch was a guy I looked up to, and
(Craig) Biggio too.''
</P>
<P>
   Mo Vaughn made his first visit to Edison Field Friday since
Tuesday night. Vaughn, recovering from a staph infection in his
right shin, spent a couple hours getting treatment from trainers
and visited with former Red Sox teammates just outside the Red Sox
clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn, who is taking antibiotics for the infection, is expected
to miss a couple more days before returning to the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Angels president Tony Tavares has held his tongue this season, a
calculated decision because of his tendency to let his emotions get
the best of him during interviews.
</P>
<P>
   But he broke his silence for the first time earlier this week in
an interview on the Angels' flagship station KLAC. Following is an
excerpt from the interview:
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been the bickering, the blame, the finger pointing.
But, bottom line, and my concern, is that there's not enough
looking in the mirror. It's been the manager's fault, the general
manager's fault, the fans' fault. Next thing I'm going to hear is
that we've changed the names of the bears (mascots) and that's
somehow had an impact. It's ridiculous. People have to take
responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim Belcher will start tonight against the Red Sox, pushing back
Jack McDowell to Sunday. An interesting matchup will take place
Tuesday when the Angels will throw Chuck Finley against the
Indians' Mark Langston, a former Angel.
</P>

   Time: 1:05 p.m. at Edison Field
</P>
<P>
   TV/Radio: Fox Channel 11; KLAC-570, XPRS-1090
</P>
<P>
   Matchup: Tim Belcher (5-6, 6.53 ERA) returns to the mound after
missing nearly six weeks with a broken pinky finger on his right
hand. Pat Rapp (3-5, 4.61) will start for Boston.

SMU SUSPENDS COACH FOR ALLEGED RECRUITING VIOLATIONS (For use by
NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Whit Canning 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ SMU assistant coach Steve Malin has been suspended and
the school has reported alleged recruiting violations to the NCAA
and hired a law firm to investigate the matter, athletic director
Jim Copeland said yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, the suspected violations appear to be secondary in
nature and isolated to one coach,'' Copeland said. ``We won't know
how many athletes are involved until the investigation is
completed.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas City firm of Bond, Shoeneck &AMP; King has been retained
to conduct the investigation and report its findings to the NCAA,
Copeland said.
</P>
<P>
   Copeland said the violations were ``uncovered by our assistants
about two weeks ago through a procedure used to check each class as
it graduates. They appear to cover a period of three to four
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Malin, a Dallas native with a master's degree from SMU, joined
Tom Rossley's staff as a graduate assistant in 1994 and was
retained by Mike Cavan when he became the head coach after the 1996
season. Malin coached the defensive line and recruited the Dallas
and Houston areas.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement comes 10 years after SMU returned from the
NCAA's ``death penalty,'' which caused the school to shut down its
football program for the 1987 season after repeated violations
throughout the early '80s. The school chose to voluntarily shut the
program down for a second year before resuming play in 1989. SMU,
found guilty twice within a five-year period in the mid-80s, is the
only school to receive the death penalty in football.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the earlier situation, Copeland said, ``There is no
evidence at this point of booster involvement, and as yet the NCAA
has given us no indication that it will become involved in the
investigation. If the allegations are proven, it might be
appropriate for us to enact a self-imposed penalty. Beyond that, it
would be in the hands of the NCAA.''
</P>
<P>
   Copeland said he does not feel that the school's past will
become a factor in the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't speak to what happened before I came here,'' he said.
``I can tell you that this SMU of today is very concerned, and
takes every violation seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't speculate on what the NCAA will do, other than to say
I believe we will be treated fairly. As for my personal feelings,
this certainly is not a highlight of the job.'' nn

JARRETT HASN'T BACKED DOWN FROM CUP TITLE RACE (For use by NYTimes
News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Dale Jarrett has a checkered past with the No. 88
Ford he will drive in the Brickyard 400 today.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a good race car,'' said Jarrett, referring to the
red, white and blue No. 88 Quality Care Service/Ford Credit Taurus
with which he has become synonymous. ``It's the same car as last
year _ except with a bigger fuel cell.''
</P>
<P>
   A year after he ran out of fuel while leading the Brickyard 400
at the halfway point, Jarrett was not above recounting one of the
most expensive gaffes in recent NASCAR Winston Cup history. The
fact that Jarrett has returned to the Indianapolis Motor Speedway
leading the points championship certainly has softened memories of
last August, when he made up a daunting four-lap deficit.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Jarrett and crew chief Todd Parrott spent part of
practice here yesterday morning calculating fuel mileage around the
2.5-mile rectangular Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ran out of gas at Las Vegas earlier this year, too, so
obviously we haven't gotten it totally down pat,'' said Jarrett, a
serious look crossing his face. ``I think we've worked hard on our
fuel mileage. When you produce a lot of horsepower, that becomes a
problem. We have a lot of horsepower at Robert Yates Racing. I
think what we've done is kind of look at our limitations.''
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen races into the schedule, the limitations have been few
for the man known as D.J. In a workmanlike manner reminiscent of
his father, Ned, a two-time NASCAR champion in the 1960s, Jarrett
has fashioned a 254-point lead over injured Mark Martin. Three-time
and reigning series champion Jeff Gordon and Jeff Burton each have
won four races, but Jarrett has kept pace with three victories.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, no one has racked up more top-fives than Jarrett's
15, or more top-10s than his 17. He has been saddled with only one
point-sapping Did Not Finish result.
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR's points system rewards such consistency with checks and
championships, as Gordon fully appreciates.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as the championship, I haven't seen anyone touching
Dale Jarrett if he continues doing what he's doing,'' said Gordon,
looking up from a 492-point deficit and sixth place after what
amounted to a perfect season in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be hard to define what a perfect season would be,''
Jarrett said, ``because this is so long, and we've had our
difficulties. It looked for a while that even as good as we were
running and finishing in the top five that it was going to be
difficult for us to win. But since that win in Richmond \Ron May
15\S we've been an extremely good race team and have given
ourselves an opportunity to win other races.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett has finished third, second and third in the Cup
standings from 1996-98, a period that has seen him score 14 of his
21 career victories.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gotten ourselves in a position to kind of make it where
we're in control of this championship,'' said Jarrett, seeking his
first Cup title at age 42. ``We're in control of our destiny,
instead of having to chase someone.''
</P>
<P>
   Most notably Gordon, who edged Jarrett by 14 points for the 1997
championship. More recently, the two engaged in a blowup worthy of
Jerry Springer after the Jiffy Lube 300 in Loudon, N.H., on July
11. Gordon used a bump-pass to muscle his way around Jarrett for a
third-place finish, dropping Jarrett to fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett tracked Gordon down in the pits afterward, got in his
face and told him the next time that happens, his rainbow-hued race
car would end up going over the bleeping fence.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett later apologized _ but only for the color of his
language.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't proud of his choice of words, and he did come back
and apologize for that,'' Ned Jarrett said of his son. ``I was
proud to see him stand up for what he thought was right.''
</P>
<P>
   Ned Jarrett said his son, a former all-conference performer in
football, basketball and golf at Newton-Conover (N.C.) High School,
is a fiercer competitor than he ever was. If D.J. can win this
title, he and his father would join the legendary Pettys _ Lee and
Richard _ as the only father-son championship combination in Cup
history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that Dale deserves the championship,'' said the elder
Jarrett, a popular NASCAR television commentator. ``He's paid his
dues to the point that if he does win one, he deserves it. And it's
important to win a NASCAR Winston Cup championship for any driver
because that completes his resume. Certainly, \Rcar owner\S Robert
Yates deserves to win a championship because of all he's been
through and the contributions he's made to the sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I've made the statement before and really feel this way:
We're most proud of Dale for the type person he is. The type dad he
is to his kids and the type husband he is to his wife. And the type
person he is in the community. What he does on the racetrack is a
bonus, but he's been giving us some pretty big bonuses lately.'' nn
