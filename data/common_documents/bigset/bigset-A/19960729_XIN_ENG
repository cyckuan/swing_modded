<HEADLINE> Ethiopian Roba Wins Olympic Women's Marathon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Fatuma Roba of Ethiopia clocked
two hours 26 minutes and five seconds to win the women's marathon
gold medal here Sunday morning at the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
It is the first gold medal for Ethiopia at the current Games.
</P>
<P>
Valentina Yegorova of Russia, Olympic silver medalist at the
previous games, finished second in 2:28:05 and Yuko Arimori of
Japan, last Games bronze medalist, won the bronze again in
2:28:39.
</P>
<P>
Starting at 7:05 A.M., Roba, who placed 21st on the world
ranking with a personal best 2:29:05, was among the leading field
and passed the first five kilometers in 17:46.
</P>
<P>
Uta Pippig of Germany, the fastest marathon woman in the world
last year, was a clear leader in the first five kilometers,
followed by a big bunch.
</P>
<P>
Pippig built up a nearly 30 seconds lead after 10 kilometers
and looked strong enough to stride away for victory, only five
person remained in the chasing group including Roba, Yegorova,
Katrin Doerrie-heinig of Germany, Arimori and Rocio Rios of Spain
passing the 10km mark at 34:57:00.
</P>
<P>
But after 20 kilometers, Pippig faded away to fifth while Roba
snatched the lead with Yegorova, Arimori, Doerrie-heinig other two
runners following her closely.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopia built up a big gap from the rest after another
five kilometers and from then she never looked back to run a solo
leading pace for victory.
</P>
<P>
She passed the 35km mark in 2:00:46, more than one minute than
her nearest chaser Yegorova, and wrapped up the gruelling 42.195km
race two minutes faster than the Russian.
</P>
<P>
Pippig, London and Berlin marathon winner with a personal best
time of 2:25:11, didn't finish the race.

<HEADLINE> Iran to Ban Imports of Industrial Goods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian government announced
here today that it has banned the import of hundred sorts of
consumer and industrial goods.
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Ministry stated that the ban on import of some
chemical and cellulose items was aimed at promoting domestic
production.
</P>
<P>
The Persian evening paper "Ettellat" reported that the ban
also applies to such items as bicycle and motorcycle tire,
industrial and automobile oils, raisins, casting powders,
industrial cleaners, film development chemicals, printing ink and
others.
</P>
<P>
Since Iran's oil export revenue suffered a drastic drop and the
country felt mounting pressure of foreign debts two years ago,
the Iranian government has adopted an austerity program by
greatly reducing the imports.
</P>
<P>
According to local press reports, some Iranian businessmen have
tried to smuggle in foreign goods amid fears that the ban would
lead to shortage of goods and price hikes.

<HEADLINE> Donors Backs decentralization in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The international donor community
has pledged to fund capacity building for Zimbabwe's rural
district councils who will soon take over management of their own
resources.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's Local Government, Rural and Urban Development
Minister John Nkomo said on Sunday the government approached the
donors after realizing that decentralizing power to districts
without laying an income and development base for them could
result in chaos.
</P>
<P>
''The handover is going to be a systematic process which will
only be completed when every district has the capacity to govern
itself, provide for its community adequately and contribute to
the national economy,'' said Nkomo.
</P>
<P>
He said the capacity building process would be in three areas
of institutional governance training, human resources development
and provision of equipment.
</P>
<P>
Britain's Overseas Development Association would soon release
15 million U.S. Dollars for institutional governance training.
</P>
<P>
''We have donors from Nordic countries who are going to
provide money and expertise for human resource development while
several countries have pledged to provide all equipment needed
for an effective transformation to self-determination for rural
communities,'' the minister said.
</P>
<P>
If pledges form donors to assist in developing rural areas
were fulfilled, he said, there would be enough funds to carry out
all the planned projects.

<HEADLINE> Eight KDP Members Killed in Artillery Shelling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Iran announced here today that its
military forces killed eight members of the Kurdestan Democratic
Party (KDP) and wounded several others in heavy long-range
artillery shelling in its western border region.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made by a commander of the Islamic
Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) and wired out by the official news
agency IRNA.
</P>
<P>
The unidentified commander said:"The Iranian forces shelled KDP
concentration centers with long-range artillery and inflicted
heavy damage."
</P>
<P>
The exact location of the KDP concentration centers were not
specified.
</P>
<P>
The official said that in view of the intensity of the Iranian
artillery attacks, many more of the "aggressors" may have been
killed.
</P>
<P>
He warned that the Iranian military operation would continue
until the dispersion and mopping up of the KDP concentration
places.
</P>
<P>
"Several armed gangs composed of bandits, smugglers and
mercenaries of counter revolutionary grouplets crossed the border
Sunday morning and attacked several border villages," he added.
</P>
<P>
The KDP radio has so far made no mention of the Sunday clashes
between the KDP groups and the Iranian border guards.
</P>
<P>
The radio, however, earlier reported that two Iranian soldiers
had been killed in the past two weeks by the KDP groups.

<HEADLINE> Land Issue Time Bomb: Zimbabwean Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Local Government, Rural
and Urban Development Secretary Willard Chiwewe today warned of a
second revolution unless the government takes a radical approach
in resettling millions of landless Zimbabweans.
</P>
<P>
Chiwewe said Zimbabwe is sitting on a time-bomb which could
explode at any time if the government fails to redress the issue
of land imbalances.
</P>
<P>
He said the government is handling the redistribution of land
to the landless as a priority.
</P>
<P>
"One of the greatest forces for the liberation struggle was
for land and at assuming independence, land redistribution was a
national need, " Chiwewe said, adding "the landless group is the
most volatile which requires a radical approach so that they are
put on land as soon as possible."
</P>
<P>
"My ministry is handling this group as priority in order to
diffuse a possible time bomb on the land issue and the bomb can
explode at any time. We are aware that these landless people can
take the law into their own hands," he continued.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Local Government, Rural and Urban Development
requires about 10 million US Dollars a year to redress existing
land imbalances in Zimbabwe, but was only allocated 3.2 million
US Dollars this fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwe government had initially anticipated resettling
about 5,000 families every year, but due to lack of resources, it
is only able to resettle about 1,500 annually.
</P>
<P>
So far 60,000 families have been resettled and nearly 80,000
are awaiting their turn.
</P>
<P>
Chiwewe is optimistic the government will be able to resettle
more than 5,000 people during the current fiscal year, now that
the British government has agreed to finance the program.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The Inkatha Freedom Party
(IFP) today established a special commission to oversee the
restructuring of Inkatha to prepare it for the next general
election in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The decision to set up the commission was made on the final
day of the party's 21st annual general conference being held at
Mandleni camp in Ulundi, Kwazulu/Natal province.
</P>
<P>
The conference, started on Saturday, was attended by several
thousand IFP supporters from all over the country.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Walter Felgate, adviser to IFP leader
Mangosuthu Buthelezi, said the party's provincial structures
would be strengthened and the role of the secretary general
reviewed to ensure Inkatha would be equipped to effectively
contest the general election in 1999.
</P>
<P>
"We are therefore going to embark on a process of
rationalizing the party, strengthening it, and gearing it up in
preparation for the 1999 election," said Felgate.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kwazulu/Natal provincial government premier Frank
Mdlalose also said: "we in the IFP must now finally and fully

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Ramos Seeks Wider Support for Peace Deal With MNLF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 28 (Xinhua) -- As the Philippine government and
the MORO National Liberation Front (MNLF) are expected to finalize
their peace deal in Jakarta next month, President Fidel Ramos has
intensified his campaign to seek wider support for the creation of
the Southern Philippines Council for Peace and Development
(SPCPD).
</P>
<P>
The SPCPD, a MNLF-led transitional mechanism to be created
under a peace deal between the government and the Muslim rebel
group, will lead to a new and broader autonomous region covering
14 provinces in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to remove the judicial barrier to its peace pact with
the MNLF, the presidential palace on Friday asked the supreme
court to dismiss the case filed by a lawyer to question the
authority of the president to create the SPCPD.
</P>
<P>
In a 36-page statement, the palace said the suitor has no legal
standing to sue since he lacks the required personal and
substantial interest in the issue and the case is still not "ripe"
for judicial review because no final peace agreement between the
government and the MNLF has been made.
</P>
<P>
The palace asked the court to uphold the authority of the
president to create the planned consultative body.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the SPCPD is a major point in the
agreement reached by the government and the MNLF in Davao city
last month. The council, which will be led by MNLF Chairman Nur
Misuari, will oversee the peace and development in 14 provinces
and 10 cities in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was hailed as a breakthrough in the peace process
in the Southern Philippines. Just days after the agreement was
reached, Misuari decided to run for governor of the autonomous
region for Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) and swear his allegiance to the
Philippine constitution.
</P>
<P>
That means the MNLF had formally stopped its 24 years of armed
struggle against the government.
</P>
<P>
However, the peace deal, especially the decision to install the
SPCPD, immediately triggered widespread opposition from local
officials and Christians in Mindanao, the congressmen and some
religious leaders.
</P>
<P>
To convince opponents that the SPCPD is a very important tool
to bring final peace to Mindanao, Ramos held a series of
consultations with all sectors of society this month.
</P>
<P>
The president first tried hard to gain the support of 29
political leaders from Mindanao including one regional governor,
13 provincial governors and six city mayors. These officials
signed a resolution to express their support after a four-hour
meeting with Ramos.
</P>
<P>
Ramos told them that the SPCPD will not diminish the powers and
functions of local governments, and there also will be no new area
of autonomy to be set up until a law is passed and a plebiscite is
held.
</P>
<P>
Ramos also won support from the Catholic Bishops Conference
which called on the president to give more voice to Christians by
appointing more of them to the 81-member consultative assembly of
the SPCPD in proportion to their population.
</P>
<P>
But Ramos met trouble in the congress. Although he persuaded a
total of 181 representatives to side with him, analysts said their
support is just "verbal" and might be a fraud since their areas
are not covered by the SPCPD.
</P>
<P>
More importantly, Ramos failed to sway the senate. He had hoped
to hold talks with the senators, but only 14 of the 24 senators
were present at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Although they all expressed their support for peace in
Mindanao, almost all of them opposed the establishment of the
SPCPD.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, some senators said Ramos might face
impeachment because he acted beyond his power on the SPCPD issue
and allegedly conspired with the MNLF to dupe the public on peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
While asking Ramos to fully disclose the 123 points the
government reached with the MNLF in the past three years, the
senate constituted itself into a committee to look into the
agreement reached in Davao city last month. The committee has sent
a strong signal to the presidential palace that the new Mindanao
body can not be created without the senate's support.
</P>
<P>
As well, five senators, 13 representatives, five Mindanao local
officials and former speaker Ramon Mitra also forged a pact to
pressure Ramos to defer the peace talks with the MNLF in Jakarta
next month until the MNLF issue has been settled.
</P>
<P>
Although has persuaded most people, he has yet to convince the
local residents in Mindanao of the need to create the SPCPD,
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
According to Representative Daisy Fuentes of South Cotabato, 90
percent of her constituents reject the SPCPD. Christians, the
majority in Mindanao, have voiced fears that after decades of
ethnic conflict they will be put under Muslim's control.
</P>
<P>
The situation has got even worse. Some Christians in South
Cotabato have decided to form the Southern Philippines Unified
Christian Command, a militia group that would reportedly check
Muslim "atrocities" if the SPCPD is formed, and in Dipolog city in
Zamboanga Del Norte, residents even inverted the national flag to
show their protest.
</P>
<P>
Ramos warned against the establishment of the vigilante groups,
saying it could provoke a religious war. But he insisted that the
government will be bent on doing what it wants to do.
</P>
<P>
The president accused the opponents of hampering the political
stability, ethnic harmony and economic prosperity the peace deal
will bring to Mindanao. "There are 400 steps to final peace in
Mindanao, we have taken 399 steps, we must not lose the last
step," he said.

<HEADLINE> Mandela on ANC-SACP-COSATU Alliance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The future of the tripartite
alliance depends on changes to the social reality of the South
African nation, President Nelson Mandela said today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing at the 75th anniversary celebrations of the South
African Communist Party (SACP) in Cape Town, Mandela said the
tripartite alliance among the African National Congress (ANC),
the Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU) and the SACP
was a natural result of the social circumstances pervading South
Africa to date.
</P>
<P>
The SACP was established in Cape Town in July 1921.
</P>
<P>
Referring to criticism against the government's new
macro-economic strategy by the COSATU and SACP, Mandela said the
"debate and discussion" within the alliance ranks should be
understood in terms of the ANC being a national liberation
movement, and not a sectoral organization.
</P>
<P>
However, the president said such debate and discussion should
not cloud the fundamental agreement existing in the alliance
about the reconstruction and development program.
</P>
<P>
The macro-economic strategy, entitled growth, employment and
redistribution, was launched by Finance Minister Trevor Manuel
last month.
</P>
<P>
The strategy, serving as government's basic economic policy
until the next century, was criticized by COSATU General
Secretary Sam Shilowa as being a "neo-liberal plan" which posed
serious difficulties for the working class and the country as a
whole.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Shilowa warned that if the issue was not handled
correctly, it could lead to a crisis in the tripartite alliance,
saying the COSATU and SACP were finding it difficult to come to
terms with the ANC on the strategy.
</P>
<P>
While rejecting the notion that the ANC or the government was
hostage to any organization, Mandela said the mutual enrichment
that had characterized the alliance's relationship is not about
to change, whether it be in the ANC's relations with the SACP or
with the COSATU.
</P>
<P>
"There is no patronage in our alliance. There is no
trusteeship. There is none who constitutes the sole repository of
ideas and wisdom. We are sovereign organizations, and none
dictates to the other," added the president.

ATLANTA, July 28 (Xinhua) -- World champion Silvio Martinello
gave Italy its second cycling gold medal when he won the 40 kms
points race on Sunday in Stone Mountain, Georgia.
</P>
<P>
He added the Olympic crown to the world points title he won in
Bogota last year, finishing eight points clear of Canadian Brian
Walton.
</P>
<P>
Australian Stuart O'Grady gained his second bronze. He finished
third in the team pursuit 24 hours earlier.
</P>
<P>
After 54 of the 160 laps on the 250-metre wooden bowl,
Martinello and five other riders lapped the field.
</P>
<P>
Walton was not among the leading six but a huge drive brought
him back and maximum points in the final sprint took him from
fourth to the silver medal position.

<HEADLINE> IFP to Increase Power Base in Next Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The Inkatha Freedom Party
(IFP) today resolved to establish specific programs and develop
policies to ensure that it would be a force to reckoned with in
the next general election in 1999.
</P>
<P>
This was one of 15 resolutions adopted at the IFP's 21st
annual general conference held in Ulundi, Kwazulu/Natal province.
</P>
<P>
The two-day conference, started on Saturday, was attended by
several thousand Inkatha supporters from all over the country.
</P>
<P>
In a document issued after the conference, the IFP said the
programs would strive to "project" the party into all
communities, interest groups, the business sector, church groups
and non-governmental organizations.
</P>
<P>
In the document, the Inkatha conceded that in some instances
its human resources and party structures were inefficient and
ineffective. it also admitted the party lacked discipline and
that internal communication was inadequate.
</P>
<P>
To remedy this, Inkatha resolved that "all efforts must be
made to improve effectiveness and resourcefulness of the party's
leaders and structures and that an active role must be found for
youth and women in this process."
</P>
<P>
With regard to the lack of internal discipline, delegates at
the conference also resolved to crack down on party members who
brought the party into idsrepute.
</P>
<P>
In his opening speech on Saturday, party leader Mangosuthu
Buthelezi said the party could no longer tolerate the lack of
internal discipline, in-fighting and the undermining of
COLLEAGUES.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the IFP also reiterated its rejection of the new
constitution adopted by the constitutional assembly on May 8 this
year.
</P>
<P>
Among reasons cited for the rejection were that the national
constitution reduced the powers of the provinces and did not
provide protection for traditional communities.
</P>
<P>
The IFP withdrew from the constitution-making process in April
last year in a protest against the African National Congress's
failure to honor a pre-general election promise of international
mediation on Zulus autonomy in Kwazulu/Natal.

<HEADLINE> Uganda, Tanzania Reject Burundi's Junta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The heads of state of Uganda and
Tanzania today strongly condemned and rejected the military coup
which took place in Burundi on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni and visiting Tanzanian
President Benjamin Mkapa expressed grave concern about the
situation in Burundi following the military take-over of the
legitimate government of President Sylvestre Ntibatunganya on
July 25, a press release issued by the State House said here.
</P>
<P>
after having talks here yesterday, the two presidents said,
"the military coup undermines the efforts being undertaken by
both regional and world leaders, aimed at finding a peaceful
democracy to all the people of Burundi."
</P>
<P>
"The heads of state strongly condemned and rejected this
usurpation of power," said the release.
</P>
<P>
It said the two presidents discussed the current situation in
Burundi within the context of the Mwanza peace process and the
Arusha initiative, and expressed their support for the positions
taken by the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the U. N.
Security Council in condemning the removal of the legitimate
government of Burundi.
</P>
<P>
Also participating in the meeting was former Tanzanian
president Julius Nyerere, the facilitator of the Great Lakes
initiative on Rwanda and Burundi.
</P>
<P>
Museveni and Mkapa reaffirmed their support for Nyerere's
peace efforts by underlining the importance of the agreement
reached at the Arusha regional summit on June 25.
</P>
<P>
However, they avoided comment on a possible plan of action
over the military junta in Burundi, only saying that the issue
will be addressed at a regional summit meeting in Arusha,
Tanzania on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here held that Mkapa and Nyerere want Museveni to
back their tough action against Burundi's new strongman Major
Pierre Buyoya, but Museveni's attitude is unknown.
</P>
<P>
Without cooperation from Uganda, any possible sanctions
against Burundi by other African countries will be less
effective, they said.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Arrives in S. Arabia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
President Yasser Arafat arrived in Saudi port city of Jiddah this
afternoon for a two-day visit, a report reaching here said today..
</P>
<P>
During his visit, he is expected to brief Saudi King Fahd Ibn
Abdul-Aziz on the latest developments in the Middle East peace
process and the deteriorating economic situation in the
Palestinian self-rule territories due to the Israeli siege, the
report quoted Palestinian ambassador to Saudi Arabia Mustafa
Hashim Deib as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem issue and the PLO's peace negotiations with
Israel would top the Saudi-Palestinian talks during Arafat's visit,
according to Deib.
</P>
<P>
Deib said preparations for holding an emergency meeting of the
Jerusalem Committee were under way. The meeting was called for by
Arafat and Syrian President Hafez al-Assad during their recent
meeting in Damascus.
</P>
<P>
Arafat also expected to receive funds from Saudi Arabia to help
him deal with hardships faced by the Palestinians as a result of
renewed closure of the West Bank and Gaza Strip by Israel.
</P>
<P>
The five-month-old blockade was lifted Monday, but reimposed
after two Israelis were killed Friday by suspected Palestinian
militants in a drive-by shooting.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy termed the incident
"serious" and said that his government would take all
"intelligence, military and diplomatic measures to deal with it."
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government also demanded Friday the closure of the
youth and geography offices located in the Orient House, the
Palestinian headquarters in east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia had given the Palestinians political support and
financial aid which totaled 400 million U.S. dollars since the
establishment of the PNA two years ago.
</P>
<P>
During the last January's Paris conference of donor countries,
Saudi Arabia committed itself to providing another 100 million
dollars to the Palestinian Authority until 1999.

DAMASCUS, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq
al-Shara met here today with visiting Arab League Secretary
General Esmat Abdul Meguid.
</P>
<P>
Well-informed Syrian sources said the talks between Shara and
Meguid dealt with the Arab situation, the consequences of the
recently held Cairo Arab summit and the future of peace process in
the light of Israel's failure to adhere to the U.N. Security
Council resolutions 242 and 338 and the land-for-peace principle.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that Meguid has briefed the Syrian foreign
minister on the outcome of the intensive contacts undertaken by the
Arab League at Arab and European levels in a bid to support the Arab
stances and to build up Arab solidarity.
</P>
<P>
Meguid's visit to Syria is aimed at enhancing Arab solidarity,
salvaging the stalled peace process, and exerting pressure on
the Israeli government to adhere to the resolutions and principles
of the Madrid peace conference.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 28 (Xinhua) - Favorite Australia qualified for
the Olympic women's field hockey final by crushing the United
States 4-0 on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Australians recorded their fifth victory in six matches to
tally 11 points -- four more than second-placed South Korea in the
eight-nation round-robin league.
</P>
<P>
The Koreans, who play unfancied Argentina in their fifth match
later on Sunday and Germany on Tuesday, are expected to join
Australia in Thursday's final.
</P>
<P>
However, Britain stole the show with a brilliant 3-2 win over
Germany today. The British girls seemed down and out when Germany
scored on either side of the break through skipper Franziska
Hentschel's 29th minute penalty corner and Britta Becker's penalty
stroke push in the 38th.
</P>
<P>
The British, whose only previous success in the tournament was
a narrow 1-0 win over the U.S., were steered out of trouble by
their captain Jill Atkins.
</P>
<P>
Atkins' penalty corner expertise came in handy as she reduced
the margin in the 51st minute, and then scored the match-winner
one minute before the final whistle after Jane Sixsmith had drawn
level in the 61st.
</P>
<P>
The win gave Britain six points with the last league game
against Argentina in hand -- a position that could help them
finish third or fourth and fight for the bronze.
</P>
<P>
The Netherlands, which plays Spain in their fifth match on
Sunday night, also has six points. Germany was pushed to fifth
place after the defeat with five points.

ATLANTA, July 28 (Xinhua) - Sweden's Barcelona Olympic champion
Jan-Ove Waldner was eliminated by Canada's Huang Wen in the last
16 of the men's singles competition at the Olympic table tennis
tournament on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Fourth seed Waldner, who missed 14 days practice before the
Games because of an injured thumb, did not reach his normal dizzy
heights as the speed of Huang overcame the Swede's famed spin.
</P>
<P>
Huang, ranked 13th, won 21-15, 17-21, 21-16, 21-15 in a game
notable for the number of errors made by the normally reliable
Waldner.
</P>
<P>
With the 1991 world champion Jorgen Persson also out of the
singles and Persson and Waldner losing in the men's doubles
quarter-finals, the dominant European table tennis nation does not
have any players left in the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
In the quarter-finals, Huang will play world championship
runner-up Liu Guoliang of China, tipped for the title by two-time
world champion Jiang Jialiang earlier in the week. Liu defeated

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The South African Communist
Party (SACP) and the Congress of South African Trade Unions
(COSATU) today reaffirmed their commitment to alliance with the
African National Congress (ANC).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, they also repeated their criticism of the
government's macro-economic strategy.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the party's 75th anniversary celebrations in Cape
Town, SACP Secretary General Charles Nqakula said the unity of
the tripartite alliance is "more relevant than ever before.
However unity is not a mechanical agreement."
</P>
<P>
The SACP was established in Cape Town in July 1921.
</P>
<P>
About 1,500 people, including several cabinet ministers,
parliamentary members and Eastern Cape's Provincial Government
Premier Raymond Mhlaba, attended the celebrations.
</P>
<P>
The rally was also addressed by President Nelson Mandela.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Mandela said the future of the ANC-SACP-COSATU
tripartite alliance depends on changes to the social reality of
the South African nation.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Nqakula said the macro-economic strategy,
although a positive step to implementing the reconstruction and
development program, is too restrictive and could crush any
possibility of growth.
</P>
<P>
However, Nqakula said the SACP is proud of the ANC, adding the
tripartite alliance will remain rooted among the vast majority of
the country.

ATLANTA, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Lithuania qualified for the
Olympic men's basketball quarterfinals by beating China 116-55
here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Lithuania, the sixth qualifier for the quarterfinals, rose to
3-2 in Group A and will finish as a second seed unless Croatia
upsets the United States Dream Team.
</P>
<P>
Should Croatia lose to the Dream Team later Sunday and drop to
3-2, Lithuania would claim second place in preliminary Group A by
virtue of an 83-81 double overtime triumph over Croatia in the
opening game.
</P>
<P>
Already qualified for the playoff rounds were the American
team, Yugoslavia, Croatia, Australia and Greece.
</P>
<P>
At 2-3 China will also qualify because Argentina can finish no
higher and China beat them in the head-to-head.
</P>
<P>
Lithuania took the lead 90 seconds into the game for 4-3. They
made full use of all the players on the bench and steadily built
the lead to 30 points by halftime.
</P>
<P>
The final score equalled their largest lead of the game.
</P>
<P>
In the quarter-finals, Lithuania will play the winner of a game
between Greece and Australia.

Lithuanian star guard Sarunas Marciulionis, after missing two
games with a swollen knee, played 22 minutes.

<P>
ATLANTA, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Former powerhouse China knocked
out Japan of the Olympic women's volleyball tournament by beating
its old rival 3-0 here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
China, 1984 Olympics champion, won in straight sets of 16-14,
15-11, 15-10 to finish top of group A in the first round with a
100 percent record while Japan, champion in 1964 and 1976 and
bronze medalists in 1984, won only once in five matches.
</P>
<P>
Japan's defeat meant that the United States, South Korea and
Netherlands joined China in the quarter-finals before they had
played on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Japan had a set point in the first set but eventually lost
16-14 after saving three set points. China then took control,
winning the next two sets 15-11 15-10.
</P>
<P>
Brazil, Russia, Germany and holders Cuba are the
quarter-finalists from group B, all having qualified before
Sunday's games.
</P>
<P>
The results resurrected Brazil's chances of making the
quarter-finals in group A. Cuba has already qualified from the
group, with the Americans, Brazil, Bulgaria and Argentina fighting
for the remaining places in the final pool matches on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Russia and South Korea are chasing the last group B spot where

<HEADLINE> Croatia Seeks to Promote Ties with Gulf States </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABIE, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The Prime Minister of Croatia
Zlatko Matesa has disclosed that his country is seeking to
establish and promote good ties with all Gulf states.
</P>
<P>
In a press interview in the Qatari capital city of Doha today,
the visiting Croatian Prime Minister said that his country would
establish diplomatic relations with Qatar in the very near future,
indicating that there were no political obstacles involved and all
that remained to be done was the settlement of certain technical
matters.
</P>
<P>
He described his talks in Doha with Emir of Qatar Sheikh
Hamand Bin Khalifa Al Thani as good, adding that they discussed
economic relations and the prospects of Qatari businessmen
investing capital in Croatia.
</P>
<P>
He said the talks also covered bilateral cooperation in the
industrial and ship building sectors, expressing Croatia's desire
to assume a bigger share in the construction, development and
other sectors in Qatar
</P>
<P>
The Croatian Prime Minister pointed out that his talks with
Qatari Foreign Minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassem bin Jaber Al Thani
focused on future bilateral relations and the drafting of certain
agreements such as the prevention of dual taxation and
encouragement of investment. These accords are due to be concluded
shortly, constituting the grounds for bilateral economic
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He further stated that Croatia wishes to take part in Qatari
giant projects as partner because it cannot undertake the
management of huge projects alone. Croatia, however, has good
expertise in certain fields.
</P>
<P>
He said that his country also wishes to purchase crude oil, gas
and petrochemicals from Qatar, pointing out that the related
resources of Croatia cover 50 percent of its domestic needs.
</P>
<P>
The Croatian Prime Minister went on to say that his talks with
the Emir of Qatar afforded the opportunity to discuss the
development of the peace process in Bosnia-Herzigovina. He told
the Qatari Emir that the Dayton agreement on peace in Bosnia was
in force and that there had been no clashes ever since.
</P>
<P>
In reply to a question about the future of peace in the Middle
East as the Likud assumed power in Israel, he underlined that
there was no alternative to peace. It is the sole option.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister of Croatia arrived in Doha Friday on an
official visit to Qatar aimed at enhancing bilateral relations and
expanding the scope of economic cooperation between the two
countries.

<P>
CAIRO, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The following are business briefs
from Middle East countries:
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egyptian Prime Minister Kamal Al-Ganzouri said that
Egypt plans to spend 1,500 billion Egyptian pounds (442 billion
U.S. dollars) on building infrastructure facilities in more than
190 cities and villages to absorb the expected increased
population by the year 2017.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The Egyptian National Railways and a consortium led by
German steel giant Krupp signed Saturday a contract on building a
new bridge across the Suez Canal at El-Ferdan.
</P>
<P>
Krupp's partners are the Egyptian construction company Orascom
and the Belgian company Besix.
</P>
<P>
The construction of the bridge, which would cost an estimated
250 million Egyptian pounds (74 million U.S. dollars), is due to
begin later in 1996 and will be completed in 1999.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- Lebanon's foreign trade amounted to 3,919 million
dollars in the first six months of this year, statistics issued by
Lebanon's Customs showed.
</P>
<P>
The import in the first half of this year stood at 3,471
million dollars, compared with 3,540 million dollars in the same
period of last year, while the export increased to 448 million
dollars from last year's 355 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The statistics also showed that the country's trade deficit
reduced to 87.06 percent from last year's 89.97 percent.
</P>
<P>
TEHRAN -- Iran's industrial growth will exceed 10 percent in
the current Iranian calendar year (starting on March 20), the
Persian daily Iran reported today.
</P>
<P>
Morteza Mohammad Khan, Iran's Minister of Economic and
Financial Affairs, was quoted as saying that the industrial sector
reported an increase of 5.8 percent last year over the previous
year.
</P>
<P>
The growth rate stood at 6.2 percent in the first quarter of
the year and more than 10 percent in the second, the minister
said.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Iran's economy grew by 4.5 percent in the
last fiscal year which ended on March 19, 1996.
</P>
<P>
TEHRAN-- The Iranian government announced here today it has
imposed ban on the import of hundred sorts of consumer and
industrial goods.
</P>
<P>
The Persian evening paper Ettellat reported the import ban
covers such items as bicycle and motorcycle tire, industrial and
automobile oils, raisins, casting powders, industrial cleaners,
film development chemicals and printing ink.
</P>
<P>
The move came as a result of the adoption of an austerity
program by the Iranian government.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Wins Over Argentina in Men's Field Hockey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Ahmed Shabaz's three goals enabled
Pakistan to take a 6-2 victory over Argentina in its final group
match in the Olympic men's hockey event Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The win moved Pakistan past Argentina into third place in Pool
A with a 2-1-2 record and five points, and a possible chance for a
fifth place finish.
</P>
<P>
It was the third straight loss for Argentina, which fell to
2-0-3.
</P>
<P>
Shabaz scored off a penalty corner in the 32nd minute to send
both teams into the lockerroom tied 1-1.
</P>
<P>
He then gave Pakistan the lead 10 minutes into the second half,
taking a feed from Kamran Ashraf. But it was a seven-minute
stretch in which Pakistan scored three times to take control.
</P>
<P>
Muhammad Sarwar scored his first of two on a reverse stick
sweep in the 51st. Shabaz fed Zaman Tahir minutes later and
Sarward put Pakistan ahead 5-1 off a rebound of another shot by
Tahir in the 58th.
</P>
<P>
Shabaz scored his third goal to give Pakistan a 6-1 lead. Jorge
Lombi, who assisted on Rodolfo Perez's goal in the 24th minute,

<HEADLINE> Romanians Win First Olympic lightweight Gold on Final Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Romania's Constanta Burcica and
Camelia Macoviciuc claimed the first lightweight title of the
Olympic Games on the final day of the Olympic rowing competition
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Burcica and Macoviciuc were clocked 7:12.78, followed by the
United States 1.87 seconds behind and Australia 3.38 secopnds
behind.
</P>
<P>
The lightweight race was put on the Olympic agenda for the
first time.
</P>
<P>
Canada's Wendy Wiebe and Colleen Miller have dominated the
women's double since they won the title in 1993. But the Canadian
pair this time failed to qualify for the medal final and finished
second in final B, the race for 7-12 places.
</P>
<P>
"For this particular race we set out to win a silver this
morning. Fortunately we won the gold medal," said stroke seat
Burcica, who was the 1994 world championships women's lightweight
single sculler and a 1992 Olympic silver medalist in the women's
quadruple sculls.
</P>
<P>
The Romanians also won the women's coxed eight final Sunday as
they beat world champion the United States to fifth place with a
time of 6:19.73. Canadians took the silver 4.32 seconds behind.
</P>
<P>
With the double titles, Romania joins Australia in maintaining
their gold count won at the last Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Romania, Australia, Germany and Switzerland lead the gold count
in the current eight-day rowing race on Lake Lanier.
</P>
<P>
Rowing powerhouse Canada and Germany each won four golds in
Barcelona, and the Netherlands, Belarus, Denmark, Britain and
Italy took one gold medal each this time.
</P>
<P>
In Sunday's other five medal final races, Switzerland won its

claimed men's lightweight coxless four title; Germany defended its
crown in the men's quadruple sculls; the Netherlands edged
defending champion Canada into fourth to take the men's coxed
eight title, while German girls completed their country's gold
medal count at Lake Lanier by taking the women's quadruple sculls
easily.

<HEADLINE> Buyoya Promises to Halt Hutu Refugee Expulsions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 28 (Xinhua) - Burundi's new strongman Major
Pierre Buyoya said today he will not force Rwandan Hutu refugees
to go back to their homeland, a report from Bujumbura said.
</P>
<P>
"Our government will respect international law, including the
protection of the refugees on our soil," Buyoya, a Tutsi
military ruler, told a news conference in the Burundi capital.
</P>
<P>
The Burundi military toppled President Sylvestre
Ntibantunganya and installed Buyoya on Thursday, who ruled from
1987 but was defeated in Burundi's first free poll in 1993.
</P>
<P>
An army operation last week, launched before Thursday's coup,
sent back 15,000 Hutus to Rwanda from northern Burundi and this
act was sternly condemned. More than 70,000 Hutus remain in camps
in the north.
</P>
<P>
The Hutu refugees had fled their homeland in fear of revenge
for the mass killings of up to one million Rwandan Tutsis and
moderate Hutus in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The repatriations were carried out by Burundi authorities and
had support from President Ntibantunganya, who was overthrown by
Buyoya.
</P>
<P>
About 150,000 people have been killed in Burundi in three
years of violence driven by fear and hatred between Hutus, who
make up about 85 percent of the population and the minority
Tutsis, who dominate the army and state apparatus.
</P>
<P>
Buyoya's statement to halt forced expulsions of Rwandan Hutu
refugees is a move apparently aimed at defusing international
criticism of his takeover of power, analysts here said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Buyoya reaffirmed that he is opposed to any foreign
intervention to end tribal killings in Burundi, which run to
1,000 a month.
</P>
<P>
"The intervention of foreign troops has been very badly
received by the people. The solution to our problems is political
dialogue," he noted.

ATLANTA, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Defending Olympic champion Jens
Fiedler of Germany sprinted to victory in the men's sprint here
today, successfully defending his Olympic title at the Stone
Mountain Velodrome.
</P>
<P>
Fiedler edged past Marty Nothstein of the United States in two
consecutive match sprints, in a best-two-out-of-three format, to
keep his Olympic championship in the men's individual 200-meter
sprint.
</P>
<P>
Fiedler, a fifth place finisher in men's sprint at the 1995
World Cycling Championships in Bogota, Colombia, eliminated Garry
Neiwand of Australia, the 1993 world champion, in the semifinals
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Nothstein, who upset 1995 world champion Darryn Hill of
Australia in the quarter finals, received the silver medal for
racing against Fiedler in the gold medal race.
</P>

Curtis Harnet of Canada won the bronze medal, after beating
Neiwand in two consecutive match sprints in the bronze medal race.

<HEADLINE> Italian Rider Wins Men's Points Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 28 (Xinhua) -- World champion cyclist Silvio
Martinello of Italy racked up 37 points in men's points race here
today to capture the gold medal at the 26th Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Martinello, 33, beat Brian Walton of Canada by eight points in
the 40 kilometer event to win his first Olympic medal after
missing two consecutive Oplympic Games in Seoul and Barcelona.
</P>
<P>
Martinello first competed in the Olympic Games in 1984 in Los
Angeles, but his best performance was riding as a member of the
Italian squad in team pursuit, which finished the fourth. In the
men's points race, he was 16th.
</P>
<P>
But he became the world champion in 1995 at the World Cycling
Championships in Bogota, Colombia, upseting Bruno Risi of
Switzerland, who was the gold medalist at the 1994 World Cycling
Championships.
</P>
<P>
Brian snatched the silver medal with 29 points and Stuart
O'Grady of Australia took the bronze medal with 27 points.
</P>
<P>
In point race, points are awarded during lap sprints, which
occur every eighth lap. Five points are awarded to the lap winner,
three points to the second, two to the third place and one to the
fourth. The rider who accumulates the most points or who laps the
field, regardless of his total points, win the race.

<HEADLINE> OAU Envoy to ECOWAS Summit on Liberian Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The special representative of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) on Liberia has suggested a
government of national unity for the war-torn country to provide
an enabling environment required for reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
Canaan Banana, who was in Abuja to attend the just concluded
summit of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS),
said such a government should incorporate the various interests
in Liberia in order to promote the confidence necessary for its
stability, the News Agency of Nigeria reported today.
</P>
<P>
He said he hoped that two of the warlords in Liberia, Charles
Taylor and Alhaji Kromah, were sincere in their recent
pronouncement about being committed to disarmament, emphasizing
that if such commitment is discharged, it will help in the peace
process in Liberia.
</P>
<P>
"I met two of them during the current meeting in Abuja and
they assured me that they were committed to immediate
disarmament," he said, adding that disarmament is critical to the
resolution of the Liberian crisis.
</P>
<P>
Banana, as former president of Zimbabwe, argued that while
total disarmament might not be feasible because of the distrust
among factional leaders, verified disarmament to the extent that
it will be safe for political activities could suffice.
</P>
<P>
This level can be determined by the ECOWAS peacekeeping force
known as ECOMOG and the United Nations monitoring force in
Liberia, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
"I can only hope that the warring parties can begin
disarmament without quibbling," he said, noting that the absence
of a legitimate authority in Liberia is one of the problems
militating against the resolution of the crisis in Liberia.
</P>
<P>
However, Banana cautioned against bloated optimism, saying
that from the experience of numerous promises and failed
agreements to restore peace to Liberia, it is difficult to be
confident about the restoration of peace because "situations are
determined by daily events."

ATLANTA, July 28 (Xinhua) -- China entered the final of the
women's soccer tournament at the Centennial Olympic Games after
beating Brazil 3-2 on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese women's eleven dominated the first half and outshot
their Brazilian counterparts 5-1. Sun Qingmei opened the scoring
at the 7th minute with a supeb 25-meter shot.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian team had to play the first 20 minutes of the

they fought harder and forced the Chinese into defence.

score at the 67th minute after Wen Lirong of China was also sent
off for a tackle.
</P>
<P>
Only five minutes later, Chinese defender made a fatal mistake
and Pretinha took the chance to put Brazil 2-1 ahead.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilians seemed on the way to the first Olympic women's
soccer final but the Chinese team refused to give in and they
levelled the score 2-2 through second-half substitute Wei Haiying
at the 38th minute.
</P>
<P>
Wei Haiying then scored her second goal at the 43rd minute to
eliminate the Brazilians.

China will play in the final against the winners of the other
semi-final match between hosts the United States and world
champions Norway.

<HEADLINE> International Mediator Blasts Croats for Mostar Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, July 28 (Xinhua) -- A senior international mediator
today criticized Bosnian Croat authorities in Mostar for scuttling
the local elections designed to unify the ethnically divided city.
</P>
<P>
"I am seriously concerned about the developments in Mostar,"
said Michael Steiner, who is deputy chief of the High
Representative's Office set up here by European countries and the
United States to implement the Dayton peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
Steiner called on an unusual weekend press conference after he
failed to resolve the political stalemate in Mostar caused by
Croats' boycott of the city's newly-elected council.
</P>
<P>
The Croatian Democratic Union, which rules the western part of
the city and lost by a narrow margin to a Muslim party coalition,
refused to recognize the results on the the ground that there were
"irregularities" in the June 30 elections.
</P>
<P>
"The core problem that we have there is that you have a small
group of mafiusy (the adjective of mafia) figures" who defy the
legality of the elections and the Dayton agreement, he said.
</P>
<P>
"As long as these figures in western Mostar can influence the
events there, I think it will be very difficult to get real
progress in Mostar," he added.
</P>
<P>
Steiner said that the situation is worrisome because it has
created "an authoritative vacuum" in the city, will force the
withdrawal of EU administration and have a negative impact on the
upcoming nationwide elections.
</P>
<P>
"If we would allow this principle (of election) in Mostar to be
violated, we effectively could forget elections in September" when
many communities of Bosnia will be confronted with similar
problems, the German diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
Steiner called on Croatian President Franjo Tudjman to exert
his influence on Bosnian Croats as a guarantee of the Dayton
agreement and warned Croatia of unspecified punishment from
Western European countries if it could not force fellow Croats
into cooperation with Muslims in Mostar.

<HEADLINE> New Findings of Earth's Crust Movement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Millions of Chinese people are on
the move - without realizing it. Massive earth plates that make up
large areas of China's land mass are on the move.
</P>
<P>
And researchers are trying to work out the impact of collisions
and crushing movements between the layers of earth crust as the
plates move and crush against each other.
</P>
<P>
Research work will help them investigate earth quakes, the
movement of structures and changes in the country's sea level.
</P>
<P>
Studies on the movement of the earth's crust in eastern part of
China has found that the region's earth crust consists of three
different slabs of earth - known as massifs, and that they are in
a fault structure movement.
</P>
<P>
The research, co-sponsored by the China Research Institute of
Surveying and Mapping, and the National Oceanographic Information
Center, has excluded man-made factors leading to land subsidence
to get a real portrait of the movements of the earth's crust in
the eastern part of China.
</P>
<P>
The research results have shown that the eastern part of
China's mainland is made up of three different massifs, which can
be divided into southern China, northern China, and northeastern
China.
</P>
<P>
The Yangtze massif is moving southwest and is crushing against
the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, which explains the crushing influence
of the Pacific plate upon the structure movement of China's
mainland. The movements of the plates revealed the complexity of
the earth's crust movement.
</P>
<P>
Important basic data and information collected during the
research will lay a foundation for research on the geodynamics of
the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau. It will also explain the structure
movement of China's mainland, and aid research into earthquakes
and relative changes of sea levels in China.

<P>
ANKARA, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Turkey is greatly concerned about
the cross-border attack by the Iranian troops against Kurdish
rebels in northern Iraq, a Turkish official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry Spokesman Omer Akbel told reporters that "It
is no doubt that this is an important development in our region
and we are closely following the situation."
</P>
<P>
Shazad Saib, representative of the Patriotic Union of
Kurdistan (PUK) in Ankara, said that more than 2,000 Iranian
troops and 100 armored combat vehicles had pushed 60
kilometers into Kurdish-controlled northern Iraq to fight against
the Kurdish rebels.
</P>
<P>
The PUK representative said that the Iranian troops had
bombarded the position of the Kurdistan Democratic Party of Iran
(KDPI) near the town of Koy Sanjak in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The KDPI is fighting for an independent homeland inside
Iran. Over the past three years, Iran has launched several strong
attacks on Kurds inside a self-rule enclave in northern
Iraq.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 29 (Xinhua) -- China is to drive ahead with a new
way of running Beijing's International Auto Show.
</P>
<P>
Instead of one organizing department being in the driving seat,
the 1997 show will be run by a collection of departments, a major
step taken by various Chinese departments to pool their resources
to ensure the exhibition hits top gear.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Machine-building Industry, which is in charge
of the country's automotive industry, has launched a series of
seminars, exchanges and exhibitions focusing on the themes of
family car, auto spares and component development.
</P>
<P>
China Council for the Promotion of International Trade and
China National Automotive Industrial Corporation have already
staged a number of international auto shows.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that about 700,000 people attended two major
international auto shows last month.
</P>
<P>
Major overseas automotive heavyweights and research bodies, and
major Chinese auto makers took part in the exhibitions.
</P>
<P>
Authoritative sources from China's automotive circles said at
a press conference today that it was time a jointly held
comprehensive international auto exhibition, by pooling the
efforts of all the previous auto show organizers.
</P>
<P>
The sponsors for the new event will include MMI, CNAIC, CCPIT
and China Automotive Industrial Association.
</P>
<P>
The new show, according to the joint organizers, will display
assembled cars, spares and parts, latest developments in the
international auto industry, new and hi-tech products and other
related products, systems and equipment.
</P>
<P>
Since 1956 when the first ever car rolled off a China
production line the country has turned out 11.65 million motor
vehicles and 26.54 million motorbikes.
</P>
<P>
The country now has at least 2.5 million privately owned motor
vehicles, according to statistics provided by the MMI. But most
vehicles on China's roads are owned by work units and various
departments.

BEIJING -- China today expressed its deep regret over Japanese
Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's so called private visit to the
Yasukuni Shrine.
</P>
<P>
In response to a reporter's question seeking the Chinese
Government's comment on the issue, Foreign Ministry Spokesman Cui
Tiankai said "We express our deep regret over Japanese Prime
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's visit to the Yasukuni Shrine on July
29."
</P>
<P>
Asian countries which suffered from Japanese aggression have
been always strongly against visits by Japanese prime ministers
and other government leaders to the Yasukuni Shrine, where the
remains of Tojo Hideki and other leading Japanese militarists are
worshiped.
</P>
<P>
Over the past decade or so, Cui said, Japanese prime ministers
and other government leaders had adopted a prudent attitude
towards the issue, and had not paid visit to the shrine.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Hashimoto's visit today has seriously hurt the
feelings of the people of Asian countries, including China, who
suffered from the Japanese militarism, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
WASHINGTON -- U.S. President Bill Clinton said Sunday that he
will discuss with Congressional leaders and the head of Federal
Bureau of Investigation (FBI) tougher measures to counter
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
"This is a long, hard fight but if we work together, this is a
challenge we can and will meet," Clinton said at the 75th annual
Disabled American Veterans Convention in New Orleans, Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
Clinton flew to New Orleans from Camp David where he was
briefed on developments in the aftermath of the Saturday explosion
at the Olympics Centennial Park in Atlanta, in which two people
were killed and 112 were injured.
</P>
<P>
The president said that he might consider two tougher
measures: increased wiretapping and the use of chemical markers to
track those who make bombs, both of which were cut from the
anti-terrorism legislation he signed on April 24.
</P>
<P>
BEIJING -- The Chinese government declared today that it will
start a moratorium on nuclear testing effective from July 30,
1996.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the Chinese government said that such an
important decision by China is not only a response to the appeal
of the vast number of non-nuclear weapon states, but also a
concrete action to promote nuclear disarmament.

<HEADLINE> PA Official: Mubarak's Visit to US Significant for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Egypt's diplomatic drive in support
of the Palestinian cause and the Middle East peace process at
large is the focus of attention of all Palestinians and Arab
peoples as it will have a far reaching effect on the peace
process, a senior Palestinian Authority (PA) official has said.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed al Tayebi, adviser to PA President Yasser Arafat, made
the remarks in an interview with the Cairo-based Palestine Radio,
which was broadcast today.
</P>
<P>
In the interview, the PA official said that the
Egyptian-U.S. summit between Mubarak and Bill Clinton will have a
far reaching effect on the course of events in the Middle East,
the peace process and the Palestinian cause.
</P>
<P>
The PA official said that Palestinian demands to the U.S.,
co-sponsor of the peace process, are to persuade Israel into
abiding by the already signed agreements with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
These agreements, he said, include Israeli troop withdrawal
from Hebron, release of Palestinian detainees in Israeli jails,
safe corridors between the Palestinian self-rule territories, the
future of the peace process, and the final status negotiations on
refugees, Israeli settlements, borders and Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian official expressed skepticism over the
seriousness of Israel's attitude towards the peace process. He
attributed his conviction to Israeli statements made by the
right-wing Netanyahu government, which favors an expansion of
Israeli settlements in Palestinian territories and an increase of
settlers there.
</P>
<P>
Tayebi described a ruling of the Israeli Supreme Court permits
radical Jews to pray in the Aqsa mosque as a grave, unwise
decision, saying that it would lead to further tension in
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
He underlined that the Palestinians would not allow radical,
right-wing Israelis to violate the sanctity of the Aqsa
mosque or any attempt to seize it.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the Israeli policy of besieging the
Palestinian territories would not achieve security for Israel but
was aimed at isolating Jerusalem from the rest of the Palestinian
land.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The newly-launched state-owned
People's Property Insurance Company of China is to insure two
satellites due to be sent into orbit later this year in a 228
million US dollar deal clinched today in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The Telecommunications and Broadcasting Satellite Company of
China plans to launch the two satellites this year, both by
Chinese Long March Rocket Carriers.
</P>
<P>
One of the satellites scheduled for launch late next month is
ChinaSat-7, a product from the US Hughes Company. It will replace
the ageing ChinaSat-5 satellite, to provide telecommunications and
broadcasting services for China's TV stations.
</P>
<P>
 The second is Dongfanghong Number 3 satellite, designed and
made in China as a substitute for a telecommunications satellite
of the same name, which failed to go into operation in 1994 as a
result of fuel exhaustion. It is scheduled to be launched late
this year.
</P>
<P>
PICC Property, an offshoot of China's first insurance group,
has previously underwritten dozens of satellite launches,
including AsiaSat-1, AsiaSat-2 and the doomed Dongfanghong No. 3,
which cost it 400 million yuan in an insurance pay-out.
</P>
<P>
PICC Group was established a few days ago to become China's
first state-owned insurance group. Its predessor was the nation's
top insurance company, also called the People's Insurance Company
of China.

<P>
ATHENS, July 29 (Xinhua) -- One out of three Greeks will not go
on holiday this year due to the lack of money, according to a
survey conducted by the country's Consumer Institute.
</P>
<P>
The institute estimated that about 32.7 percent of Greeks will
stay home this summer. Among them, 70 percent said they could not
afford to go on vacation, while 11.8 and 14.7 percent respectively
said they had business or family obligations keeping them at home.
</P>
<P>
Among those who will go on holiday, just 7.8 percent said they
would take 30 days off. The remaining 81.5 percent said the
maximum vacation time will be 15 days. Meanwhile, only 1.9
percent are planning to travel abroad.
</P>
<P>
Some 43.5 percent of Greeks said the cost of this year's
holiday would be significantly higher than last year's. And 31.3
percent said they considered holidays this year as "very
expensive," while only 7.2 percent said the cost was the same as
last year's.

PARIS, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The French Foreign Ministry today
confirmed Algerian media reports that Foreign Minister Herve de
Charette will visit that country on Wednesday and Thursday at the
invitation of his Algerian counterpart Ahmed Attaf.
</P>
<P>
The visit, the first by a French foreign minister to Algeria in
three years, is hailed by Algerian media as the beginning of the
normalization of the relations between the two countries,
according to Agence France Presse reports from Algiers.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the two countries have been tense since
Algeria's presidential election in November 1995. Algeria accused
France of interfering its internal affairs by urging the holding
of legislative elections immediately after the presidential
election.
</P>
<P>
France, being Algeria's major aid supplier offering 5-6 billion
francs (1-1.2 billion U.S dollars) each year, is deeply worried
about the spreading of the Algerian Islamic extremism into its own
territory.
</P>
<P>
De Charette is expected to discuss with Algerian leaders the
question of air transportation between the two countries and the
service to be offered by the Algerian national carrier Air Algeria
to some airports in France, according to the AFP.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Protests against Iran's Cross-Border Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Iraq today protested to Iran
against its cross-border attack on the Iranian rebel Kurds
harboring in northern Iraq, and described the Iranian act as a
"flagrant violation" of the U.N. charter.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's Foreign Ministry has summoned the Iranian charge
d'affaires in Baghdad and handed him a strongly-worded protest
note, saying the Iranian cross-border attack infringed upon Iraq's
territorial integrity and sovereignty, the Iraqi News Agency (INA)
said.
</P>
<P>
A foreign ministry spokesman said that the Iranian government
is fully responsible for the "aggression." He demanded an
immediate withdrawal of Iranian troops from Iraqi territory.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Iran would maintain its legal right to demand
complete compensation for the damage caused by the Iranian military
action.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that Iran's persistence in continuing these
"aggressive acts" against Iraq exposes Iran's "ill-intention"
against the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian forces have reportedly pushed 50 kilometers into
northern Iraq to chase the rebel Kurds, who reportedly attacked
Sunday several border villages in Iran and were driven back by the
Iranian Revolutionary Guards with artillery fires.
</P>
<P>
The rebel Kurds are fighting for an independent homeland inside
Iran. Iran has over the past three years launched several fierce
attacks on the Kurds inside a self-rule enclave in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The enclave, established by the U.S.-led allies after the 1991
Gulf war, is protected by the U.S., British and French warplanes based
in Turkey. The Kurds, who have fought Baghdad for autonomy for
decades, have established their own administration there.

JINAN, July 29 (Xinhua) -- East China's Shandong Province
bounced back from a drop in overseas investment spending last year
to enjoy a rise this year.
</P>
<P>
The province has given the go-ahead to more than 2,500
foreign-funded projects during the first half this year, an
increase of 28 percent over the same period in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The new enterprises involve more than 3.7 billion US dollars in
contractual investment, virtually double the 1995 level.
</P>
<P>
During the January-May period this year, the number of new
overseas-funded projects with investment surpassing 10 million US
dollars each reached 72 - three and a half times the figure
during the same period in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Though large amounts of investments came from Hong Kong, Macao
and Taiwan, there was a speedy growth in funds from foreign
countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
The number of projects involved in production also went up,
with industrial projects accounting for 90 percent of the items
with investments exceeding 10 million US dollars each.
</P>
<P>
During the six-month period, the province also signed 365
contracts for overseas projects, involving 231 million US dollars
in contractual investments, an increase of 78 percent over

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Calls on International Community to Press </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait today called on the
international community to continue pressures on Iraq for the
release of more than 600 Kuwaiti Prisoners of War (POWs) allegedly
still jailed in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In a statement following the weekly session, the Kuwaiti
cabinet stressed that it was necessary for the international
community to continue their pressure on the Iraqi regime to
cooperate with the International Committee of the Red Cross to
release the Kuwaiti POWs and other captives from some third world
countries.
</P>
<P>
This came on the eve of the sixth anniversary of the Iraqi
invasion of the small emirate in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from the committee, the allied forces and Iraq
have met regularly in Geneva and on the Kuwaiti-Iraqi borders to
assess the fate of the Kuwaiti POWs and efforts for their release.
</P>
<P>
The latest meeting of such kind in Geneva was held on June 13
while the next will be held in October.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait says a total of 625 people are still missing from
Iraq's August 1990 invasion and the ensuing seven-month occupation
of the emirate.
</P>
<P>
So far Iraq has given information on 128 of the missing. But
Baghdad denied it held other captives as Kuwait insisted and said
it lost traces of others.
</P>
<P>
A settlement of the issue is one of the conditions set
by Kuwait and United States for a lifting of the U.N. sanctions
imposed on Iraq in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The statement also demanded Iraq to unveil all information
on its weapons of mass destruction, return all the properties
Kuwait said were stollen by the Iraqis, pay compensations
and guarantee the security and stability of the Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
It also reiterated Kuwait's gratitude and appreciation for the
Arab and international support in face of the Iraqi invasion and
the subsequent liberation on February 26, 1991.

result of the prevailing state of instability in neighbouring
Sudan.

<P>
The returnees were provided with material and other forms
assistance in accordance with the Eritrean government's
repatriation program so as to enable them to become eventually
self-supporting,the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, according to the United Nations High Commissioner
for Refugees (UNHCR), there are still about 420,000 Eritrean
refugees in Sudan up to May this year.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Meets Philippine Defense Secretary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIDAIHE, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng said
today that China and the Philippines can easily overcome any
problems in their relationship to live and work with each in
harmony. The premier called on both countries work with each other
closely.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with Philippine Secretary of Defense Renato de
Villa in Beidaihe, the North China's coastal resort, the Chinese
premier said Sino-Philippine relations have been growing well
since the two countries established diplomatic relations over 20
years ago.
</P>
<P>
He commented that the two countries have had "fruitful
cooperation" in politics, economy, trade, science, technology,
culture and other spheres.
</P>
<P>
Li described the current visit of de Villa as "an important
event" in the contacts between the armed forces of the two
countries. He added that the results of the visit have "added new
elements and vitality" to bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
He said he hopes the exchanges between the two armed forces
will continue to increase.
</P>
<P>
Li noted that both China and the Philippines are concentrating
on economic constructions, and both countries need a peaceful and
stable international environment, adding that developing
Sino-Philippine friendly relations is not only in the interests of
the two peoples, but will benefit peace, stability and development
of this region.
</P>
<P>
Echoing Li's remarks, de Villa said both the Philippines and
China are striving for peace and development. He added that
maintaining good relations between the two countries, as well as
between the armed forces of the two nations, is conducive to peace
and stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
Li reiterated that China's development is an important factor
of world peace and stability. China, pursuing an independent
foreign policy of peace and a good-neighborly policy, is a
"trusted friend" of ASEAN member countries.
</P>
<P>
The premier stressed that China attaches importance to its
relations with ASEAN member nations, including the Philippines,
saying China has its eyes on the future in developing such
relations.
</P>
<P>
Despite some problems which still exist in Sino-Philippine
relations, Li said, cooperation and friendship between the two
countries prevail.
</P>
<P>
"The problems can be resolved so long as the two countries set
out from the overall interests of bilateral relations, and conduct
friendly consultations and dialogues," he said.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, de Villa conveyed regards from Philippine
President Fidel V. Ramos to Chinese President Jiang Zemin and
Premier Li.
</P>
<P>
Li asked de Villa to take back greetings from Jiang and himself
to President Ramos.
</P>
<P>
Chi Haotian, vice-chairman of China's Central Military
Commission and defense minister, was present at the meeting.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 29 (Xinhua) -- New U.N. Special Envoy on
Afghanistan Norbert Holl arrived in the Afghan capital of Kabul
today for the first round of talks with government officials since
he took over the job earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Kabul quoted a government spokesman as saying that
Holl, a German diplomat, will meet with Afghan President
Burhanuddin Rabbani and other senior government officials during
his two-day stay in the besieged capital.
</P>
<P>
Holl, 60, took over as the UN secretary-general's envoy from
former Tunisian foreign minister Mehmud Mestiri, who resigned for
health reasons.
</P>
<P>
"We hope Holl can solve the issue of Afghanistan with
decisiveness and eagerness and with new United Nations
initiatives," said the government spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Senior government officials have welcomed Holl's appointment
following the two-year term of Mestiri.
</P>
<P>
"We warmly welcome Dr Holl to Kabul and pledge to be most
cooperative and to show even more determination and commitment
than before," said a spokesman for Rabbani's influential military
chief, Ahmed Shah Masood.
</P>
<P>
The envoy and his four team members, including a senior UN
political official and a new Russian advisor, will travel to the
northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif on Wednesday for talks with
warlord Rashid Dostum, reports quoted UN officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
The team will then fly to the southern city of Kandahar, the
headquarters of the Taliban religious student militia, for talks
with its leadership.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Iran's Deputy Foreign Minister Alauddin Broujerdi
arrived in Kabul last night on a two-day visit aimed at boosting
Afghanistan's peace process, officials said in Kabul today.
</P>
<P>
Broujerdi, who has for the past nine months acted as Tehran's
chief negotiator between the warring Afghan factions, is expected
to meet President Rabbani, new Premier Gulbuddin Hekmatyar and
Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Najibullah Lafraie, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
"Mr Broujerdi is here to speak to senior officials in an effort
to continue the peace drive that Iran helped initiate," Iranian
sources said.
</P>
<P>
Broujerdi's visit is his first since Hekmatyar, the former arch
rival of Rabbani, joined the government as the prime minister a
month ago.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Platinum Mine Set to Expand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Hartley platinum mine will
be expanded to make it one of the world's largest platinum mines in
10 years.
</P>
<P>
According to details released in Harare on Monday, Australian
Mining Conglomerates BHP and Delta Gold were discussing expanding the
mine, 80 km west of Harare, so it could produce up to seven times
more than what was currently planned.
</P>
<P>
In a commentary on the project, the Paris-based Africa energy
and mining newsletter said, ''BHP and Delta are now thinking of
enlarging Hartley to handle 10 million tonnes of ore per annum in
10 years time making it one of the biggest platinum mines in the
world.''
</P>
<P>
The mine, the country's single largest investment in over three
decades, was expected to process 2.1 million tonnes of ore per year,
producing 150,000 ounces of platinum and 120,000 ounces of palladium.
</P>
<P>
The second phase, on which a final decision is expected next year,
will see output doubled to 4.3 million tonnes for 300,000 ounces per
year of platinum.
</P>
<P>
The third phase could boost production to six million tonnes
for an annual output of 500,000 ounces. enditem

<HEADLINE> EU Optimistic over Approach to Cyprus Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 29 (Xinhua) -- A representative of the European
Union (EU) president expressed here today his optimism over "the
President's approach to the Cyprus problem and the way the
President expounded the Cyprus question".
</P>
<P>
Irish ambassador Kester Heaslip, the representative, said that he
is more optimistic about his mission in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark following a meeting with Cyprus President
Glafcos Clerides, during which they discussed the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
The EU envoy said that he based his optimism on "the
President's approach to the Cyprus problem and the way the
President expounded the Cyprus question".
</P>
<P>
"It was perfectly obvious to me that he is determined to
find a solution," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Irish ambassador, who arrived here Sunday to listen to
the views of the parties involved in the Cyprus issue,
described the meeting with President Clerides as "extremely useful
and comprehensive", but he declined to giver further details.
</P>
<P>
"I learned a great deal from it on the subject of
Cyprus, and this is the first substantive meeting I've had
with a principal statesman involved," he was quoted as telling the
press.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting with Clerides, Heaslip had a two-hour meeting
with Foreign Minister Alecos Michaelides.
</P>
<P>
He said after the meeting that he considered it is not the
right time for the EU to appoint a permanent representative to
Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Events concerning Cyprus settlement will have to be stepped up
before this question is considered, he said.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> BOC Helps To Beef Up Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of China (BOC) has
focused most of its export credit on sponsoring the country's
exports of high-tech and high value-added products over the past
few years.
</P>
<P>
By the end of this past June 90 percent of the bank's 20.3
billion-yuan export credit had been directed at high tech
industries..
</P>
<P>
The bank started the business in the 1980s, and so far has
provided export credit to domestic giant enterprises for the
launches of 14 commercial satellites, and exports of 200
domestically-made aircraft, 79 ships, and facilities for 11 large
thermal power plants.
</P>
<P>
Among them the 300,000-kw generating units exported to
Pakistan is the largest units that China can build at present.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the bank has also approved 580 million US dollars of
buyer's credit, in order to support exports of products made by
home enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The bank has not suffered any bad debts ever since it started
the business, and all the loans delivered have been paid back.

<HEADLINE> ADB Cancels Loans for Nigerian Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The African Development Bank (ADB)
has cancelled four loans worth over 500 million U.S. Dollars and
given notice to cancel four others in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
In a report on the review of its project fortfolio in Nigeria,
which was obtained here today, the bank said the loans were
cancelled for non-performance.
</P>
<P>
The projects for which the loans were cancelled are the bank
note and security paper project, a highway, a water supply
project and the industrial export support project. The first
three were cancelled in May and the last was done in June, it
said.
</P>
<P>
The loans for which notice of cancellation has been served are
related to a rice development project, two irrigation projects
and a vaccine production study project.
</P>
<P>
''Surveillance for new cases of non-performing loans will
continue and cancellation procedures will be initiated
promptly,'' the bank warned.
</P>
<P>
It would carry out supervision missions more frequently and
improve the maintenance of project accounts, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
It identified factors responsible for the poor performance as
delays in fulfilling loan conditions, delay in recruitment of
consultants and contractors, delay in disbursement procedures and
inadequate provision of counterpart funds.
</P>
<P>
The bank observed that the coordination of its projects by the
federal government had not been effective as the department
responsible in the Ministry of Finance has been constrained to
give guidance to borrowers on fulfillment of conditions,
procurement and disbursement.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, other weaknesses identified in the
portfolio are irregular submission of progress reports and lack
of project audits, frequent change of project managers, holding
up at the ports of imported goods and non-fulfillment of such
conditions as increase in tariffs for public utilities being
financed.

unity.
</P>
<P>
Solaiman el Qaddah, Deputy General Secretary of the National
Command of the Arab Baath Socialist Party (ABSP) of Syria, made
the remarks today in an interview with Xinhua.

Arab stances towards several issues.

on the principles governing international relations.

In addition, Qaddah praised the Sino-Syrian relations in the
past 40 years since the establishment of diplomatic ties between

<HEADLINE> Situation in Indonesian Capital Returns to Normal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The situation in the Indonesian
capital of Jakarta returned to near normal today as President
Soeharto ordered stern action against rioters who burned buildings
and buses in clashes between rival factions of the Indonesian
Democratic Party (PDI) last weekend.
</P>
<P>
"The head of state said security authorities should not
hesitate to take stern action against the rioters," Coordinating
Minister for Political and Security Affairs Soesilo Soedarman told
newsmen after a meeting with Soeharto.
</P>
<P>
Soedarman said the government has found evidence that the
so-called People's Democratic Party (PRD) masterminded the riots
after they issued a political statement and a political manifesto
last Monday.
</P>
<P>
Soldiers guarded key intersections and government buildings
along Jalan Salemba Raya -- the main road in the worst-hit
district of Salemba -- as spectators milled around building
entrances which were looted and gutted by fire.
</P>
<P>
Some schools advised parents to keep their children at home for
the day. At least five armored cars were seen parked in
riot-prone areas.
</P>
<P>
In another development, the country's financial markets plunged
today in the aftermath of the worst riots to hit the capital city
in more than two decades.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian rupiah fell to a year-low of 2,360 against the
U.S. dollar in early trading from Friday's close of 2,333/34, but
recovered a little to 2,353/55 by 13:40 local time (0640 GMT).
</P>
<P>
Military authorities announced on Sunday that at least 206
people were arrested and two killed during the violent clashes.
</P>
<P>
More than 22 buildings, 91 cars and two motorcycles were
destroyed and burnt during the clashes, which started early on
Saturday morning when supporters of PDI new leader Soerjadi took
over the party's headquarters.
</P>
<P>
The PDI headquarters were abandoned after the clashes were over
and the local police took control of the building.
</P>
<P>
Supporters of Megawati Sukarnoputri, leader of the PDI and
daughter of Indonesia's late first president Sukarno, had occupied
the headquarters in the last 45 days since the breakaway faction
last month ousted Magawati as PDI leader at a congress held in
Medan, north Sumatra.
</P>
<P>
Soerjadi was installed as new party chairman at the congress.
</P>
<P>
The government has recognized the faction led by Soerjadi and
agreed to allow the faction to take part in the general elections
in 1997, but deposed Megawati's faction has launched a series of
lawsuits in hope of having its ouster declared illegal.
</P>
<P>
There are three parties in Indonesia, namely the ruling Golkar,
the United Development Party (PPP) and PDI. The three parties
will compete for 425 seats in the 500-seat parliament in next
year's elections, with the remaining 75 seats reserved for the
armed forces.

<P>
BEIJING, July 29 (Xinhua) -- China today expressed its deep
regret over Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's so called
private visit to the Yasukuni Shrine.
</P>
<P>
In response to a reporter's question seeking the Chinese
Government's comment on the issue, Foreign Ministry Spokesman Cui
Tiankai said "We express our deep regret over Japanese Prime
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's visit to the Yasukuni Shrine on July
29."
</P>
<P>
Asian countries which suffered from Japanese aggression have
been always strongly against visits by Japanese prime ministers
and other government leaders to the Yasukuni Shrine, where the
remains of Tojo Hideki and other leading Japanese militarists are
worshiped.
</P>
<P>
Over the past decade or so, Cui said, Japanese prime ministers
and other government leaders had adopted a prudent attitude
towards the issue, and had not paid visit to the shrine.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Hashimoto's visit today has seriously hurt the
feelings of the people of Asian countries, including China, who
suffered from the Japanese militarism, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"Japan should earnestly retrospect its history of aggression,
take concrete actions to win the trust of the people of other
Asian countries, and walk along a path of peace, " the spokesman

<HEADLINE> China Issues Souvenir Badges to Mark Reincarnation of 10th Panchen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 29 (Xinhua) -- China has issued 11,995 gold and
silver souvenir badges to mark the reincarnation of the 10th
Panchen Lama.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that China has made gold and silver
commemorative coins for a living buddha, an event that has
attracted great attention from both home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
Senior lamas and monks from the Zhaxi Lhunbo Lamasery, the
residence for successive Panchen Lamas in Tibet, held an
inauguration ceremony for the unveiling of the special Buddha
image coins.
</P>
<P>
The reincarnated boy of the late 10th Panchen Lama was chosen
in front of the statue of Sakyamuni last December through the
practice of lot drawing from a gold urn strictly in line with
religious rituals.
</P>
<P>
The 11th Panchen Lama was then approved by the central
government and enthroned on December 8 last year.
</P>
<P>
To mark the great event, and advance the panchens' spirit of
loving the country and Buddhism, the Tibetan branch of the
People's Bank of China arranged for the minting and circulation of
the set of commemorative coins at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
Pagbalha Geleg Nemgyai, vice-chairman of the Standing Committee
of the National People's Congress and vice-president of the
Buddist Association of China, handwrote the name for the badge.
</P>
<P>
Each set includes a gold and two silver coins. The gold coin
carries the image of the late 10th Panchen Lama on the front and

<HEADLINE> Clue to 2,900-year-old Imperial Tombs Found in Shaanxi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, July 29 (Xinhua) -- A 2,900-year-old pit with at least
20 chariots and 100 horses that had been buried alive has been
unearthed in northwest China's Shaanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
Chinese archaeologists say that the chariot pit, the largest
ever found in that area, is a clue to imperial tombs of the
Western Zhou Dynasty (11th Century-771 BC).
</P>
<P>
According to the experts, the scale of chariot pit attached to a
tomb is a measurement of the rank of the tomb's occupant in the
Shang (16-11th Century BC) and Zhou dynasties.
</P>
<P>
So far none of the Western Zhou imperial tombs has been found.
</P>
<P>
The chariot pit was found when archaeologists excavated a tomb
group which have been robbed repeatedly in the past years. Their
search focussed on Huangdui village which is in the site of
Zhouyuan, origin of the Zhou People who established the dynasty.
</P>
<P>
Chinese archaeologists have so far excavated six tombs and
eight chariot pits, unearthing more than 2,000 cultural relics
including a piece of exquisite bronze ware to make fire from the sun.
</P>
<P>
The largest chariot pit, 7.3 meters by 5.3 m, was located
deeper than the others.
</P>
<P>
Luo Xizhang, director of the Zhouyuan Museum, says that the
chariot pit is different because the horses were buried alive, not
killed before, as shown in other pits of that period.
</P>
<P>
He says that the Western Zhou imperial tombs are probably located
nearby also because historical records have shown that the
coffin containing the body of Emperor Wuwang remained for a time in Zhouyuan
before burial in Bi.
</P>
<P>
He says that Bi was most probably the Huangdui, in Chinese it
means imperial tomb.

HEFEI, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Recently completed Tongling Hailuo
Cement Plant in Southeast China's Anhui province, the biggest

<HEADLINE> Syria Reaffirms Belief in Fair, Overall Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, July 29 (Xinhua) -- A senior official of Syria's
Baath Arab Socialist Party today reaffirmed the belief in the
establishment of a fair and comprehensive peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua here, Solaiman el Qaddah, Deputy
General Secretary of the National Command of the Baath Arab
Socialist Party, said that Syria "is seeking the establishment of
a peace based on the principles of international legitimacy, the
U.N. Security Council resolutions 242, 338 and 425, and the
land-for-peace principle."
</P>
<P>
"The desired peace is one that would restore and safeguard the
legitimate rights of the Arab people and would fulfill mutual
security," he said. "It is Israel which is obstructing and evading
the desired peace and its prerequisites."
</P>
<P>
"No matter how much conditions may change, Syria would remain
adhering to Arab rights, viz. a complete Israeli withdrawal from
the Golan Heights, from south Lebanon and the occupied
Palestinian territories, including Jerusalem, " Qaddah said.
</P>
<P>
Syria calls on the co-sponsors of the Middle East peace process
and world public opinion to shoulder their responsibilities and
to put pressure on Israel to fulfill the prerequisites of a fair
and overall peace, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Talking about Syria-U.S. relations, Qaddah pointed out that the
U.S. has been influenced by "the Zionist lobby" with the aim of
affecting Syria's stand at the peace talks with Israel. But Syria
is seeking to build its relations with the U.S. on objective
foundations, in view of the major role it has played in the new
world order, especially in the Middle East peace talks.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Burundi's new president Pierre
Buyoya has promised to bring peace to the tiny central African
state.
</P>
<P>
Major Pierre Buyoya made the promise Friday afternoon while
meeting a Tutsi civilian elite in the Burundian capital
Bujumbura, according to local reports.
</P>
<P>
Buyoya said: "I promise that I will be a president for all
Burundians and not just offering security for Hutus, and not just
acting on behalf of Tutsis."
</P>
<P>
He also promised to crack down hard on anyone sowing discorder
in the country.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Tutsis gathered in the city square in the last
two days to show support for Buyoya, a Tutsi who seized power
last Thursday after toppling Hutu President Sylvestre
Ntibantunganya in a military coup.
</P>
<P>
However, some of the Burundian Tutsi community and particulary
radical leader Jean-Baptiste Bagaza gave the new president a
less-than-welcoming response earlier yesterday, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Bagaza, a former president who was deposed by Buyoya in his
first coup in l987, denounced the Thursday military takeower,
saying he and his party would resist it by all peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
"We will oppose this government with the same tactics as we
used against the last government," he told a news conference at
his home in Bujumbura.
</P>
<P>
"The putsch is a stab in the back for the Burundian people.
Bagaza said. enditem

BEIRUT, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The National Bank of Kuwait has
bought most shares of the Lebanese Rif Bank, setting a precedent
of a foreign bank acquiring a controlling interest in a Lebanese
bank institution, the local business weekly Eco News reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The weekly quoted informed banking sources as saying that at
the end of 1995, the National Bank of Kuwait owned 45 percent
shares of the Rif Bank, and it stepped in to increase its basic
assets of the bank by injecting 5.5 million U.S. dollars to
acquire additional shares.
</P>
<P>
"This is an initial step aimed at improving the Lebanese
bank's assets level and towards changing the bank's name into the
National Bank of Kuwait-Lebanon," the sources were quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The 31-year-old Rif Bank has some 120 employees. Its fixed
assets totaled 80.2 million dollars at the end of 1993 and rose to
106.7 million dollars at the end of 1994.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, Filipino Defense Ministers Hold Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 29 (Xinhua) -- China attaches great importance to
developing its long-term and stable good-neighborly relations with
members of ASEAN, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, a
senior Chinese military leader said today.
</P>
<P>
Chi Haotian, vice-chairman of China's Central Military
Commission, made the remarks in Beijing during talks with
Philippine's Secretary of Defense Renato de Villa.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Government pays much attention to Villa's visit and
believes that it will serve to enhance mutual understanding
between the two countries, and promote the growth of military
relations, said Chi, who is also state councillor and defense
minister.
</P>
<P>
Chi hoped that leaders of the two defense departments and armed
forces would maintain frequent exchanges to push their friendship
to a new high.
</P>
<P>
As a developing socialist country, Chi said, China has
determined its national defense policy to be defensive for the
sake of its social system and national security interests.
</P>
<P>
Chi explained that China pursues a positive defense strategy,
and it will seek no hegemony or expansion, nor any form of
military alliances with any other countries. It will neither
invade any country, nor station troops or establish military bases
abroad.
</P>
<P>
The theory of a so-called "China Threat" is totally groundless,
Chi said. The theory spread by some Western countries claims,
wrongly, that an economically prosperous China will pose a
military threat to the rest of world.
</P>
<P>
The international situation is generally developing in the
direction of relaxation, but the world is far from tranquil, said
the Chinese minister, when briefing his Filipino counterpart on
China's view of the world situation. The situation in the
Asian-Pacific region, in contrast, is undergoing a sound
development, he added.
</P>
<P>
Chi said that China, as a friendly neighbor of the Southeast
Asian countries, sincerely hopes that peace and stability in
Southeast Asia will be maintained, and cooperation and mutual
development in the region be achieved.
</P>
<P>
Villa said that the Filipino Government attaches great
importance to this significant visit to China, which is designated
to establish closer ties between the defence offices and the armed
forces of the two countries for the maintenance of regional peace
and stability.
</P>
<P>
Villa also expressed his appreciation of China's active
participation in the ASEAN Regional Forum.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the talks, Chi presided over a welcoming ceremony in
honor of Villa, who arrived in Beijing over the weekend for an
official visit at Chi's invitation.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 29 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's Kwazulu/Natal
provincial government is preparing to challenge the central
government control of policing in the province, Inkatha Freedom
Party (IFP) Leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
A local daily "The Citizen" today quoted Buthelezi as saying
that any government could not be expected to effectively maintain
law and order without powers of policing.
</P>
<P>
Buthelezi made the remarks in a response to criticisms
directed at Kwazulu/Natal provincial government Premier Frank
Mdlalose that there was no government in the IFP-controlled
province.
</P>
<P>
Addressing reporters at the end of the IFP's two-day annual
general conference in Ulundi, Buthelezi noted that IFP leaders
continued to be assassinated in the province and accused the
national government of failing to track down suspects who had
murdered members of the party.
</P>
<P>
In a document issued at the conference, which was attended by
several thousand IFP supporters, the IFP called on the provincial
government to use all its powers to bring the killers to court.
</P>
<P>
The IFP said that there were at least 419 members had been
murdered since the mid-1980s when the politically-motivated
violence between the IFP and the African National Congress (ANC)
broke out.
</P>
<P>
It called on the party leaders to interact "far more visibly"
with communities affected by violence and urged members to become
actively involved in community policing.
</P>
<P>
It resolved to "strengthen all party initiatives and
structures intended to bring about peace" in the country's most
strife-torn province.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that violence in Kwazulu/Natal between the IFP
and ANC supporters had claimed about 20000 lives in the past few
years.

<HEADLINE> Poor-efficiency of State-run Retail Enterprises Recorded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 29 (Xinhua) -- State-owned retail enterprises
recorded a growth of 10.8 percent in sales in the first half of
the year, slower than the 15.1 percent rise in the non-state
sector, according to statistics of the State Statistics Bureau.
</P>
<P>
This shows that returns in large state-owned retail businesses
are not satisfactory, a market analyst notes.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, net income from sales in these
businesses only rose by 1.9 percent in the six months, much lower
than the national growth rate, while profits declined by 13.5
percent compared with the figure of the same period in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The statistics also revealed that about 58 percent of the large
state-owned retailers are running in the red.
</P>
<P>
Analysts attribute the problems to overheated development,
repeated construction, poor management, and no competition. Some
of the enterprises have been closed after having run into
difficulties.

<HEADLINE> Dolphins in HK Suffer Highest-Level Pesticide Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Dolphins in Hong Kong are
suffering some of the world's highest levels of pesticide
pollution, according to the latest analysis of Hong Kong's two
cetacean species.
</P>
<P>
In their recent study of tissue samples taken from 25 marine
mammals including Chinese white dolphins and finless porpoises,
researchers of Hong Kong and Canada said that PCBs and DDT
contained by Hong Kong's dolphins were almost three times higher
over Canada's regulations.
</P>
<P>
South China Morning Post reported that the Canadian regulations
stipulate substances containing over 50 parts per million of PCBs
require special licenses. But the PCB levels of HK dolphins were
at 125 parts per million.
</P>
<P>
Dolphin researcher Chris Parsons said that DDT levels contained
by the dolphins were at 380 parts per million. Parsons has just
returned from Canada where the study was jointly made by experts
of Hong Kong and Canada.
</P>
<P>
He said the levels of PCBs and DDT contained by the dolphins
were among the highest in the world.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, eight Chinese white dolphins and 14 finless
porpoises have been found dead in Hong Kong waters and experts
believe that toxic contamination could be a significant factor.
</P>
<P>
Experts will make further study over the effects on the biology
of animals and see how they past up the food chain, from fish to
dolphins, and the potential effects to humans.

<HEADLINE> South Korea's Current Account Deficit Rises Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, July 29 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's current account
deficit in the first half of this year rose to 9.29 billion
U.S. dollars, up 55.9 percent from the same period last year, the
Bank of Korea announced today.
</P>
<P>
The imbalance is more than the 8.95-billion-U.S.-dollar deficit
registered for all of last year and is expected to surpass the
revised estimate of 12 billion U.S. dollars for the whole of this
year, according to the central bank.
</P>
<P>
The current account comprises trade in goods and services as
well as investment income and government payments.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's trade deficit in the first six months of this
year increased by 20.1 percent from the same period last year,
with exports reaching 64.47 billion U.S. dollars and imports worth
69.68 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The gap was mainly due to the declining international prices of
semiconductors and chemicals.
</P>
<P>
Increased travel expenses abroad and royalties and freight
payments overseas pushed up the half-year invisible trade deficit
125 percent from a year earlier to 3.53 billion U.S. dollars, a
bank official said.
</P>
<P>
Unrequited transfers also registered a deficit of 116 million
U.S. dollars for the January-June period of this year, up 33.3
percent from the same period last year largely because of
increased remittances to students abroad.
</P>
<P>
The official, casting doubt over the possibility of the current
account deficit narrowing in the latter half of the year, said
that the government will hardly hold the imbalance to the revised
estimate of 12 billion U.S. dollars for the entire year.

<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, July 29 (Xinhua) -- South Korea granted 50,000 U.S.
dollars to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea through the
World Meteorological Organization (WMO) last month to finance its
purchase of weather forecasting equipment, a government official
said here today.
</P>
<P>
Seoul provided the money out of its inter-Korean cooperation
fund on June 18 at Pyongyang's request, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The WMO has also provided 10,000 U.S. dollars out of its
emergency fund to the DPRK's meteorological equipment purchase in
view of the severe flood damage it suffered last year. The
organization also asks other member countries to help the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
Flood damage in the DPRK last year was attributed partly to
poor weather forecasting techniques, the official noted.
</P>
<P>
Seoul and Pyongyang have been exchanging meteorological
information through the WMO and international conferences for
several years.
</P>
<P>
South Korea became a WMO member in 1956 and the DPRK in 1975.

<HEADLINE> Somali Faction Leader Aidid Accuses EU Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mogadishu, July 29 (XINHUA)-- Somali faction leader Mohamed
Farah Aidid last night accused Sigurd Illing, the European Union
Speical Envoy to Somalia, of interferring in the Somali crisis.
</P>
<P>
In a 20 minute speech over the radio, Aidid said Illing was
behind the renewed fighting between his forces and those of his
arch rival, Ali Mahdi Mohamed, in Mogadishu and elsewhere in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Aidid said the EU has facilitated Ali Mahdi for attacking many
districts in Mogadishu, including Wardhigley, Hamar Weyne,
Shingani, Bondhere, Medina and Huriwa.
</P>
<P>
Aidid said the attack on Ballidogle airport by Ali's forces
was part of the EU funded projects to devastate the Somali
people.
</P>
<P>
Aidid commended his forces for defending the Somali people
against the attacks sponsored by the EU and some "foreign-
manipulated elements" in Somalia.
</P>
<P>
He said his forces had inflicted those who attacked the
airport of Ballidogle heavy losses.
</P>
<P>
Speaking about strong rumors circulating in Mogadishu
concerning his health situation, Aidid said no body can kill him
but Allah. "I will die when Allah so desires," he said.
</P>
<P>
Aidid did not mention any wounds concern, but emphasized that
he is safe and sound.
</P>
<P>
The speech on his radio is believed to have been prompted by
strong rumors that he has been wounded in the fighing in Medina
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
However, Mogadishu residents still believe that Aidid is
suffering from injuries, which are not life threatening. enditem

<P>
KUWAIT CITY, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Saudi King Fahd Ibn
Abdul-Aziz has received a letter from Yemeni President Ali Abdul
Saleh which is believed to express the Yemeni attitude to further
relax the strained relations between the two neighbors, according
to the official Saudi Press Agency (SPA) this morning.
</P>
<P>
SPA said the letter conveyed to the Saudi king Sunday night was
delivered by visiting Yemeni Interior Minister Hussein Mohammed
Arab during his meeting with King Fahd.
</P>
<P>
But the reports did not disclose the contents of the message.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia and Yemen signed Saturday a security cooperation
agreement and a cooperation accord as the two countries will work
together on fighting drugs, smuggling and infiltration, and the
handover of criminals.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Interior Minister Nayef Bin Abdul-Aziz and his Yemeni
counterpart Hussein Arab asserted, following the signing ceremony,
that the accords would boost bilateral relations and cooperation,
added the press agency.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe the agreements are expected to push
ahead the ongoing bilateral negotiations on settling the border
dispute between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The Yemeni president visited Saudi Arabia in June last year,
his first visit to the kingdom in five years.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi-Yemeni relations have improved in recent years though
the two countries were long locked over border disputes. They have
 been carrying out border demarcation talks in line with the
Memorandum of Understanding on defusing border disputes signed in
February 1995.

leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The world policeman is challenged at home. The United States
has not checked terrorism during the Olympic Games. Investigations
on Saturday's bombing at the Olympics in central Atlanta favor a
hypothesis of an attack by the American ultra-rightists. After the
TWA Boeing explosion, this attack plunges the America of
liberalism into an endless debate on whether to choose security or
liberty.
</P>
<P>
-- Two people were killed, 87 wounded and 200 arrested after a
week-end of riots by the Opposition in the center of the
Indonesian capital Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The Atlanta Olympics see blood and gold at the same
time. U.S. police believe the Saturday attack on the Olympics was
made by extreme right-wing militias, who are racists and often
ethnocentric whites nebulously organized in loose groups with tens
of thousands of members around the country.
</P>
<P>
-- The investigations of the TWA explosion leans more and more
towards a terrorist act. A bomb could have cut the plane into two
parts with the rear part continuing to fly for 24 seconds before
crashing into the water.
</P>
<P>
-- Argentine President Carlos Menem sacked last Friday Economy
Minister Domingo Cavallo, who was once called the father of the
Argentine economic miracle and once more popular than Menem
himself. Cavallo was the third cabinet minister to be purged in
three weeks.

<HEADLINE> Japan Urges U.S. Policy Change </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Japan has called on the United
States to make a policy change on crude oil shipping, according to
a Kyodo News Service report Monday.
</P>
<P>
So far, the U.S. only allows tankers flying American flags to
carry Alaskan crude oil, the report quoted officials of Japan's
Transport Ministry as saying.
</P>
<P>
Japan made this called in a letter sent to Secretary of
Transportation Federico Pena and acting U.S. Trade Representative
Charlene Barshefsky.
</P>
<P>
The officials said the U.S. in April lifted a ban on exports of
Alaska-produced crude oil, but at the same time enforced a law to
require tankers shipping the oil to be registered in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
Since several Japanese oil importers plan to import Alaskan
crude oil, the letter was sent to spur Washington to change the
law, they said.
</P>
<P>
Washington's policy of imposing nationality restrictions on
ships has become an issue at world marine transportation talks at
the World Trade Organization, said the report.

<HEADLINE> Original Materials Used In 2,000-year-old City Restoration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Chinese experts have found an
effective method for preserving the 2,000-year-old Jiaohe City
Ruins in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The simple solution was clay, the original material used at
Jiaohe, obtained on an islet where two rivers meet.
</P>
<P>
The city, the oldest well-preserved one in the world, with
220,000-sq-m of buildings still standing.
</P>
<P>
To prevent the city from being damaged by weather and other
elements, a restoration project has been under way for three
years, with one million U.S. dollars' worth of financial support
from the Japanese government and one million yuan from the State
Bureau of Cultural Relics of China.
</P>
<P>
Experts have completed work on the western monastery in the
city, a Buddhist monastery built some 1,500 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Tian Lin, an associate research fellow from the regional museum
who was in charge of work on the monastery, says that she first
tried chemical materials, but failed. When she tried adding
calcium to clay obtained near the site, she succeeded, and has
developed many supplementary techniques for use on the city
remains.

MANILA, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The 17 leaders who will attend the
fourth leaders meeting of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation
(APEC) in November in Subic will be allowed to bring their own
security staff, Philippine president Fidel Ramos said on Sunday.

bomb-sniffing dogs.
</P>
<P>
"Each one will be allowed to bring their security but we will
provide close-in security and technical intelligence," Ramos said,
adding he had asked the participating leaders to "support us
through information gathering."
</P>

The Philippine presidential security group, which has direct
control of 2000 personnel, will be in charge of the overall

<HEADLINE> Egypt Encourages Private Investment in Oil: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The Egyptian government is very
flexible in encouraging the Egyptian and foreign private sectors
to promote petroleum activities, Oil Minister Hamdi el-Banbi has
said.
</P>
<P>
The local English-language newspaper The Egyptian Gazette today
quoted Banbi as saying that his ministry's current plans are to
enter the oil industry.
</P>
<P>
Banbi, in a statement included in the Shura (Consultative)
Council Industrial Committee's report, said that the oil industry
is integral for other industries, such as iron and cotton.
</P>
<P>
The report said that many requirements for the petrochemical
industry, which creates many jobs, are available in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
One petrochemical complex creates 500,000 jobs. This coincides
with the government's plans to increase job opportunities to meet
the demands of a growing population and increase the average
income by 150 percent.
</P>
<P>
The report, which called for creating incentives for the
industry to encourage the private sector's positive participation,
said that the added value for one barrel of crude oil when it is
processed into petrochemicals reaches 3,000 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The report included a call on all Arab petrochemical
authorities to establish an Arab union for petrochemical
producers, which aims at coordinating activities of the industry
in the Arab world.

<HEADLINE> Sea Around China Rising Faster Than Elsewhere </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The sea level in coastal waters
off China has risen annually by 1.2 to 2.0 millimeters over the
past half century, faster than the 1.1 to 1.7 millimeters in other
parts of the globe.
</P>
<P>
The find comes from a research project sponsored by the State
Bureau of Surveying and Mapping and the National Oceanographic
Information Center. The conclusion was based on analyses of
monthly data collected from more than 1,500 monitoring sites
around the world.
</P>
<P>
Scholars predict that by the years 2030 and 2050, respective
sea-level rises in China will be: 26cm and 42cm in the Pearl River
Delta; 43cm and 69cm in Shanghai; and 82cm and 130cm at Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
Analyses of sea level changes in offshore areas of China
revealed that climate contributes more to changes in southern
offshore areas than in northern ones.
</P>
<P>
Whenever the El Nino phenomenon is strong, the sea level in the
Sea areas off China in summer is usually lower than that of
average years, and a sea level change is more obvious in southern
areas than in northern ones.
</P>
<P>
The study showed that the sea level in the southern sea areas
off China is higher than that of the northern sea areas, with the
biggest difference being about 70 centimeters.
</P>
<P>
By the next century, there will be a remarkable sea-level rise
in oceans around the world, mainly because of the green house
effect.
</P>
<P>
The changing sea levels in coastal waters off China constitute
an increasing threat to China's economically-booming coastal
regions.

HANOI, July 29 (Xinhua)-- The Vietnamese-language windows'95

It added that the new Vietnamese-language version is fraught
with problems that microsoft has yet to resolve.
</P>

Although programmers hail the Vietnamese version of windows'95
as a necessity cornerstone in setting a standard for Vietnamese

<HEADLINE> Japanese PM Visits Yasukuni Shrine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto today visited Yasukuni Shrine, a Tokyo-based shinto
religious place where memorial services are held for Japan's war
dead, including seven class-A war criminals executed at the end of
World War II.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto was the first serving prime minister in Japan to go
to the controversial shrine since Yasuhiro Nakasone in 1985.
</P>
<P>
Nakasone's official visit on August 15, the day marking the end
of the war, triggered strong protests from Japan's Asian
neighbors, in particular from China and Korea, which suffered
bitterly under the Japanese militarist heels.
</P>
<P>
Asked in what capacity he had signed the shrine visitors' book,
Hashimoto said the question was "ridiculous" and that he had been
true to his own feelings in going, Jiji Press reported.
</P>
<P>
But Hashimoto also said he has always stuck to a policy of
adding his title at the time of a visit, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
"I've always written in my status at the time," he was quoted as
saying, "When I am prime minister, I write 'prime minister'"
</P>
<P>
Visits to the shrine by serving members of the cabinet have
been always criticized by Asian neighboring countries because the
shrine also enshrines such war criminals as Japan's wartime prime
minister Hideki Tojo.
</P>
<P>
In May, when Hashimoto was asked by reporters if he would visit
the shrine on the anniversary of the war's end, the prime minister
from the ruling coalition partner Liberal Democratic Party said he
would refrain from doing so because it would "cause problems for
people," but added that he "might not refrain" from a visit in a
private capacity.

<HEADLINE> Israel Eases Closure on West Bank, Gaza </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Israel this morning eased the
total closure on the West Bank and Gaza Strip, allowing thousands
of Palestinian workers to go back to their work inside Israel.
</P>
<P>
The total closure was reimposed Friday immediately after a
drive-by shooting attack near Beit Shemesh in central Israel, in
which three members of a family were killed.
</P>
<P>
The attack occurred just a week after the Israeli army
implemented limited measures to ease the five-month-long closure
by permitting more Palestinian workers to go into Israel.
</P>
<P>
According to an army announcement, 10,000 more Palestinian
laborers were permitted to return to their jobs inside Israel, in
order to improve the dire economic situation in the Palestinian
autonomous areas.
</P>
<P>
The army's announcement followed Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's visit to Egypt, where he told Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak that Israel had planned to lift some restrictions of
the closure.
</P>
<P>
Israel imposed a total closure on the West Bank and Gaza Strip
following a wave of suicide bombing attacks inside Israel in
February and March, which killed at least 60 people and wounded
more than 130 others.
</P>
<P>
The closure, which barred tens of thousands of Palestinians
from returning to their jobs inside Israel, has caused great
damages to the already troubled economic situation in the
Palestinian self-ruled areas.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli army said in the announcement that the 10,000
Palestinian laborers, who are over 29-year-old and married, are to
be added to the 25,000 already permitted to work in Israel.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, another 500 laborers are to be allowed to enter the
Erez industrial zone between the Gaza Strip and Israel, provided
they are at least 25-year-old and married.
</P>
<P>
The announcement said that 350 more entry permits are also to
be handed out to merchants and that 250 medical personnel are to
be allowed to enter Israel.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Chinese Farmers Becoming Better Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Nearly all farmers in China will
find themselves in a financially comfortable state by the end of
this century, according to experts from the State Statistics
Bureau and the State Planning Committee.
</P>
<P>
About 73 percent of all Chinese farmers were relatively better
off by 1995, say the experts, who conducted a comprehensive study
that covered 16 categories. This includes the farmers' annual
income, living standard, life expectancy, and average use of TV
and electricity.
</P>
<P>
In China, being "well-off" means that the country's overall
economic strength has reached an average level of developed
countries and that people have an adequate supply of food and
clothing -- but they are still quite far away from being affluent,
the experts explained.
</P>
<P>
Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping then drew up the blueprint for
people to substantially increase their earnings by the turn of the
century, with his campaign of reform and opening-up initiated in
the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
So far, about 80 percent of China's urban residents have
reached the living standards of people in low or mid-level income
countries, and the urban population sees no difficulty in reaching
the goal, experts say.
</P>
<P>
So Chinese farmers, who account for 80 percent of the country's
population, now find themselves at the heart of China's drive to
become a well-off country.
</P>
<P>
Per-capital income for rural population is expected to be 1,100
yuan by the year 2000 at 1990 prices, and it will possibly hit
1,043 yuan if their income continues rising at an average rate of
4.27 percent as before, the experts say.
</P>
<P>
According to 16 indexes used by the State Statistics
Bureau, Chinese farmers have reached the standards for being
well-off before the 2000 deadline, in terms of life
expectancy, use of TVs, expanded services, and crime rate for
every 10,000 people.
</P>
<P>
Chinese farmers are not expected, however, to raise the average
education level or the ratio of villages connected by telephone
lines by the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> World's Largest Lotus Nursery In Wuhan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, July 29 (Xinhua) -- A lotus nursery, which is believed
to be the world's largest, has been built in the capital of
central China's Hubei Province.
</P>
<P>
A collection of 301 strains of lotus is reported to be housed
by the nursery, which is located at Donghu Lake, a famous scenic
resort of the city. Work on the one-hectare nursery started in
1991.
</P>
<P>
More than 200 varities of lotus were developed by experts at
the nursery. The effort was sponsored by Wang Qichao and Zhang
Xingyan from the China Lotus Research Center, who came to the
conclusion that the "Chinese lotus originates in China, instead of
being introduced from India", in 1987.
</P>
<P>
Lotuses of all colors from the nursery have won top prizes at
seven previous national lotus exhibitions, attracting buyers from
Japan, the United States, Hongkong, Taiwan, and Macao.

<HEADLINE> China's New Hi-tech Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, July 29 (Xinhua) -- China's goal for hi-tech industrial
sector in the Ninth Five-year Plan (1996-2000) has been
established, according to a senior official.
</P>
<P>
China expects a total income of 600 billion yuan for its
hi-tech industry by the year 2000 with its "Torch Plan", according
to Liu Zhentang, an official with the State Science and Technology
Commission.
</P>
<P>
The remarks came at a hi-tech industrial development strategy
seminar in Jinan, capital of east China's Shandong Province, where
Liu noted that China aims to build a number of hi-tech industrial
development areas by the end of the century with the "Torch Plan".
</P>
<P>
Over the next five years, measures adopted by China to reach
the goal include building 26 hi-tech industrial development areas
with a total income of more than ten billion yuan each, helping
30,000 hi-tech enterprises, developing 50,000 hi-tech products,
and training 500,000 people in development and management of the
hi-tech industry.
</P>
<P>
Over the past five years, the 52 national hi-tech development
areas in China have reported a total income of over 330 billion
yuan, providing the foundation for the country's hi-tech
industrial growth.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The number of telephone users in
China is now more than 56 million, and 17 percent of urban
families have private telephones.
</P>
<P>
In the not too distant past, telephones were considered luxury
items by most Chinese families, but today, the number of
telephones in use in China has reached 56.62 million, an important
indication of the improved life. The national popularization rate
of telephones is 4.66 percent.
</P>
<P>
Experts attribute this to the fast telecommunications industry
growth for the past decade or more. During the 1991-1995 period,
the number of telephone users increased by 37.44 million to reach
44.32 million, including 3.63 million mobile phone users.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey in Shanghai showed that the city's 4.5 million
households made an average of 43 telephone calls to other parts of
the country per household, and four to other countries and regions
in the first half of this year.

HANGZHOU, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Farmers in east China's Zhejiang
Province have found yet another way to increase their wealth -- by
growing Chinese rose for the consumer market.
</P>
<P>
The new desire to express concern and love for others has

</P>
<P>
It is estimated that, on average, every Hangzhou resident buys

While farmers here are trying to meet demand for flowers by
people in the province as well as in other parts of the country,

be a hoax, local news reports said.
</P>
<P>
The airlines' Flight 482, with 139 passengers and five crew

<HEADLINE> No State Can Act Alone to Combat Terrorism: Sri Lankan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Close links between rebel groups,
drug trafficking and illicit arms trade have vested these groups
with an unprecedented capacity to challenge even the most powerful
states and no state can act alone to meet this challenge, a senior
official said today.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka's Minister of Irrigation and Energy and Deputy
Minister of Defense Anuruddha Ratwatte said at the SAARC
Conference on Cooperation in Police Matters, which was opened here
this morning, that the implementation in good faith of obligations
under existing international and regional instruments providing
for cooperation among states is an absolute prerequisite for
effectively countering this threat.
</P>
<P>
In discussing strategies to meet the unprecedented threat posed
to all states by organized international crimes such as terrorism,
drug trafficking and arms smuggling, it is important to take note
of new forms and manifestations which are being resorted to by
criminal groups, he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that the SAARC (South Asian Association for
Regional Cooperation) conventions on terrorism and drug
trafficking provide the legal basis for such co-operation.
</P>
<P>
The SAARC Conference on Cooperation in Police Matters is being
held from July 29 to August 1.

JINAN, July 29 (Xinhua) -- A Sino-Japanese joint venture to
produce motorcycles that have the same quality as Suzuki's, has
been set up in Jinan, capital of east China's Shandong Province.
</P>
<P>
At a cost of nearly 30 million US dollars for the first phase

<P>
By the turn of the century, the joint venture is expected to
produce 200,000 motorcycles a year, earning five billion yuan in
annual output value.
</P>
<P>
In exporting Qingqi-brand motorcycles to more than 50 countries

HAIKOU, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Six companies in Haikou, capital of

</P>

The companies included the Hainan Wangshi Advertising Company,
Hainan Chengye Advertising Company and three other adverters who
were fined 500 to 5,000 yuan (60 to 600 U.S. dollars) each by the
Haikou Industry and Commerce Bureau for hanging advertising

<HEADLINE> Chinese Wire Rod Supply Expected To Exceed Demand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Chinese experts warn that although
output and demand in the domestic wire rod industry are basically
even, new projects in the country will make the business a buyer's
market.
</P>
<P>
China consumed 17.3 million tons of wire rod in 1995, and the
demand is expected to hit 20 million tons this year, the overseas
edition of "People's Daily" reports.
</P>
<P>
To get a bigger market share, nearly all domestic wire rod
manufacturers have turned to cutting their prices and providing
quicker delivery.
</P>
<P>
The price of 6.5-type wire rod stood at 2,960 yuan a ton in the
first half of June, but the selling price fell to 2,668 yuan, the
paper says, and experts predict that the price of wire rod is
likely to drop in the second half of this year.
</P>
<P>
Many giant iron and steelworks with an annual wire rod output
exceeding one million tons have found market sales sluggish as a
result of poor quality and poor after-sale service.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry does not allow sharp
price reductions or hikes, so that it can keep the wire rod market
comparatively stable.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The national executive committee
of the ruling Zambian Movement for Multi-Party Democracy (MMD)
will meet soon to work out the modalities of selecting candidates
for the forthcoming general elections in the country.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by MMD National Chairman Sikota Wina while
opening the Lusaka Provincial MMD leaders meeting on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
''The 1996 elections are crucial. We cannot compare them to
the previous elections which were held under revolutionary
conditions. The party is now at the crossroads and when time is
ripe we shall inform you of the master plan of candidates,'' Wina
told the attendants of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
As for the time to hold the elections, Wina said that
President Frederick Chiluba would call elections anytime when he
felt the party was ready between now and October 31 as ''he is
the only one who knows the date as at now.''
</P>
<P>
There are controvercial views on the holding of the general
elections in the country.
</P>
<P>
A constitution amendment bill was adopted in May, under which
only second indigenous generation Zambians are qualified to be
the presidency. This actually bars former President and Leader of
the opposition United Independence Party (UNIP) K. Kaunda from
running for the presidency in the coming elections as his parents
were immigrants from neighboring Malawi before Zambia won
independence.
</P>
<P>
The MMD maintains that the constitution amendment was adopted
in parliament and signed by the president, so everybody should
abide by it. The UNIP and other opposiion parties, however, argue
that the constitution amendment is not just and this year's
elections should be conducted under the original constitution.

BEIJING, July 29 (Xinhua) -- South China's Hainan Province has
taken the lead in the country's banking industry by issuing a card
for handling medical accounts.
</P>
<P>
Since July last year, the province has introduced a medical
system that requires individuals to pay a portion of their medical
expenses and does not depend solely on the state and enterprises
to cover these.
</P>
<P>
The Social Insurance Bureau is held responsible for the
majority of funding from the state, enterprises and individuals,
and the remainder comes from the individual, mainly for clinical
fees.
</P>
<P>
In addition to containing medical expense data, the new cards
have other new functions for banking and getting funds.
</P>
<P>
People apply for the cards and open medical accounts in the
Bank of Industry and Commerce, the Bank of Agriculture, the Bank
of Construction, and the Communications Bank.
</P>
<P>
Card holders have a limit on accounts, and cannot use the card
for anything other than specified uses.
</P>
<P>
The card reduces the volume of work of the Social Insurance
Bureau, and people do not need to go to the bureau to handle
medical expenses.
</P>
<P>
Space is left on the card for other functions such as old-age
insurance, unemployment insurance, and taxes.

<HEADLINE> Burundian Military Leader to Form New Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nairobi, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Burundi's new President Pierre
Buyoya said Sunday he would form a transition government
this week.
</P>
<P>
Major Buyoya, a Tutsi who ousted Hutu President Sylvestre
Ntibantunganya last Thursday in a bloodless coup, made the
remarks at a press conference in the Burundian capital Bujumbura,
according to a report reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
He said the "broad-based government of national unity" would
include memebers of different ethnic groups and political
persuasions.
</P>
<P>
However, he added they would not be chosen from political
parties suspended indefinitely in the wake of the coup.
</P>
<P>
He confirmed that a transition parliament would be established
and a new constitution drawn up.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Buyoya said his government would not force Rwandese
Hutus to go back to the homeland which they had fled in fear of
retribution for the mass killings of Rwandese Tutsis by Hutus in
l994.
</P>
<P>
"Our government will respect international law, including the
protection of the refugees on our soil," he said.
</P>
<P>
A military operation, backed by former President
Ntibantunganya, was launched before Thursday's coup, forcing
15,000 Hutus to go back to Rwanda from northern Burundi. Now
more than 70,000 Hutus remain in camps in the north.
</P>
<P>
Major Buyoya repeated his opposition to foreign intervention
to end the Burundi crisis.
</P>
<P>
"The intervention of forfeign troops has been very badly
received by the people," he added. enditem

<HEADLINE> Guangdong Real Estate Investment Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 29 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangdong Province
put 16.5 billion yuan (about two billion US dollars) into its real
estate sector in 1995, down 12 percent from the previous year, the
overseas edition of the "People's Daily" reports.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that, although the total floor space of local
commercial housing under construction last year rose 10 percent to
90-million-sq-m, most of it was left over from 1994 and the number
of new projects went down 19 percent.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time in recent years that real estate
investment has fallen in the prosperous province.
</P>
<P>
Overseas investors still attach great importance to the local
real estate market and contributed 16 percent of the province's
total investment in the sector last year.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, nearly 70 percent of the apartments
sold last year were bought by individuals.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Lifts Restrictions on Foreign Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government has
lifted lock-in restrictions on foreign investors in the local
share market with a view to attracting more foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
The restrictions imposed in 1995 barred foreign investors from
selling primary shares within one year. Foreign portfolio
investment has turned out to be negative and the volatility of
foreign portfolio investment has been intensified due to the
restrictions.
</P>
<P>
In his budget report before Parliament Sunday, Bangladeshi
Finance Minister S. A. M. S. Kibria announced the move and said
after the new government took office on June 23, the Securities
and Exchange Commission had decided to lift the restrictions.
</P>
<P>
The share market played an important role in mobilizing
resources for domestic industry and the flow of foreign investment
would increase significantly with the lifting of the lock-in
restrictions, he added.
</P>
<P>
The finance minister, however, said that the existing sale
ceiling of one-third of initial primary offering to foreign
investors would continue in the interest of domestic investors.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 28 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said Sunday that he will discuss with Congressional leaders and the
head of Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) tougher measures
to counter terrorism.
</P>
<P>
"This is a long, hard fight but if we work together, this is a
challenge we can and will meet," Clinton said at the 75th annual
Disabled American Veterans Convention in New Orleans, Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
Clinton flew to New Orleans from Camp David where he was
briefed on developments in the aftermath of the Saturday explosion
at the Olympics Centennial Park in Atlanta, in which two people
were killed and 112 were injured.
</P>
<P>
The president said that he might consider two tougher
measures: increased wiretapping and the use of chemical markers to
track those who make bombs, both of which were cut from the
anti-terrorism legislation he signed on April 24.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to do whatever is necessary to give law
enforcement the tools they need to find terrorists before they
strike and to bring them swiftly to justice when they do," Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
"The aim of the terrorists is to spread fear. We must not let
them do that. Americans must join together to defeat terrorism
wherever it is practiced," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We all are outraged at what happened at Centennial Park. we
all admire the athletes who showed up and said they would not be
intimidated by terrorists and no terrorist could kill the Olympic
spirit," the president added.

<HEADLINE> China to Set up Old Age Insurance System by 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 29 (Xinhua) -- China is expected to set up a
basic old-age insurance system by the end of this century, having
listed the system as the most important supplementary step for its
current enterprise reforms.
</P>
<P>
At an international seminar on social insurance and old age
insurance held here, the Ministry of Labor said that these systems
must meet the needs of the socialist market economy in China.
</P>
<P>
China initiated its multi-level social insurance system five
years ago, and by 1995 there were 87.38 million workers and 22.41
million retired workers who had joined the pension scheme,
constituting 76.8 percent of the country's total workforce,
according to the local Wenhui Daily.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, some 95 billion yuan (about 11 billion US dollars) was
been collected for old age insurance funds, 24.3 billion yuan more
than for 1994.
</P>
<P>
Sources say that the old-age insurance systems will extend
their coverage and some private business owners may be
included. Further controls and improved operations in the
insurance funds have been urged.

MOSCOW, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Russia would do everything to keep
its military capability while cutting down its size, Defense
Minister Igor Rodionov said in a TV interview aired later Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Russia will "ensure that the professional army is lower in

borders.
</P>

He called for his audience to "draw conclusions from history"

former Soviet allies, does not represent any threat to Russia.
</P>
<P>
"These are mere words," he said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Calls for Continued International Presence in Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The international community should
maintain a presence in Bosnia after the peace implementation force
(IFOR) leaves on December 20 this year, U.S. mediator for Bosnia
Richard Holbrooke has said.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the German weekly Der Spiegelto to be
published Monday, Holbrooke, also negotiator of the Dayton peace
accords which ended the war in Bosnia, said that "an international
presence of some form or other must be maintained."
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke, who returned to private life in February from his
post as assistant secretary of state for European and Canadian
affairs, was called back to public duties earlier this month as a
special envoy of the U.S. State Department.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Holbrooke's mediation efforts successfully
forced Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic to step down as
"president" of the Serb-held part of Bosnia and head of the Serb
Democratic Party (SDP).
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke told Der Spiegel that Karadzic and Bosnian Serb army
chief General Ratko Mladic, both indicted by the Hague-based
International Criminal Tribunal for former Yugoslavia for
organizing genocide and crimes against humanity in Bosnia, should
be "taken out of circulation" and sent for trial in The Hague.
</P>
<P>
He said the United States, NATO and the international community
are still ready to take "new measures" against the Bosnian Serbs
over their non-cooperation with the Dayton agreement.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke condemned as a "violation of Dayton" Mladic's
continued role as head of the Bosnian Serb armed forces.
</P>
<P>
He also criticized as a "serious provocation" the reported
remarks by Aleksa Buha, the new leader of the SDP, that Karadzic
will keep a leading role in the Serb entity in Bosnia.

<P>
BONN, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Germany's first digital television
service made its debut today.
</P>
<P>
The new DF-1 digital service was offered by the Kirch Group,
one of German media giants, and costs 20 German marks (13.5
U.S. dollars) a month.
</P>
<P>
Decoder boxes, which was priced at 890 marks (600 U.S. dollars)
each, were needed to receive the new service, but only about 1,000
homes have been equipped with the boxes.
</P>
<P>
It was expected to have 200,000 subscribers for the DF-1
service by the end of the year and 3 million by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Digital technology, which offers movie-quality images with
CD-quality sound, is more efficient than the existing analog
technology.
</P>
<P>
With the digital TV service, German audiences are able to
choose from 17 different channels, including movies, sports,
children's programming, documentaries and music, and the Kirch
Group has planned to offer other services like home banking and
shopping in the future.
</P>
<P>
However, the group has to face competition from another major
German media company, Bertelsmann AG, which expects to launch its
digital television service, Club RTL, this fall.
</P>
<P>
To avoid an expensive battle for market dominance, the two
companies agreed Friday to develop a uniform standard for the
decoders needed to receive the broadcasts. But the agreement also
sound, is more efficient than the existing analog technology.

<HEADLINE> EU to Continue Financial Aid to Bulgaria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) will extend
a financial aid package of 2.4 billion ECUs (about 1.9 billion
U.S. dollars) to Bulgaria by the year 1999, a senior EU official
said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Commissioner Franz Fischler, in
charge of agriculture and rural development, said that under the
EU program known as Phare, the regional alliance will continue the
aid packages to the eastern European countries.
</P>
<P>
Designed to support economic transition in central and eastern
Europe and help "associated" countries prepare for EU membership,
Phare initially provided financial aids to Poland and Hungary.
</P>
<P>
It was extended to Bulgaria in 1990 after the country
established diplomatic relation with the then European Community
and signed a 10-year trade and cooperation treaty with the bloc.
</P>
<P>
So far, Bulgaria has received 42.8 billion ECUs (19.4 billion
dollars) from the plan, among which 56 million ECUs (45 million
dollars) was spent on the agriculture sector.
</P>
<P>
Fischler also said that EU wished to further its cooperation
with Bulgaria, which has become its associated state following
Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
Fischler arrived here for a three-day visit at the invitation
of Bulgarian Minister of Agriculture and Food Industry Kanstiu
Trendafilov.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Government Statement on Nuclear Tests (Full Text-1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The government of the People's
Republic of China issued a statement on nuclear tests here
today. The following is the full text of the statement.
</P>
<P>
Statement of the Government of the People's Republic of China
</P>
<P>
 (29 July 1996)
</P>
<P>
On 29 July 1996, China successfully conducted a nuclear
test. The Government of the People's Republic of China hereby
solemnly declares that it will start a moratorium on nuclear
testing effective from 30 July 1996. Such an important decision
by China is not only a response to the appeal of the vast number
of non-nuclear weapon states, but also a concrete action to
promote nuclear disarmament.
</P>
<P>
Over the past three decades and more since its first nuclear
test on 16 October 1964, China has established a capable and
effective nuclear self-defense force. In a pioneering spirit of
self-reliance, sustaining hardships and personal sacrifices, a
large number of Chinese workers, scientific and technical
personnel, officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army,
as well as all the staff working on the front of national defense
have made strenuous efforts under extremely difficult conditions
in the research, manufacture and development of China's nuclear
weapons. Their indelible historical feats have greatly boosted the
morale of the Chinese people and enhanced China's capability to
safeguard peace. The Chinese Government and people wish to extend
cordial greetings and pay high respect to them.
</P>
<P>
Adhering to its independent foreign policy of peace, China has
always stood for the complete prohibition and thorough destruction
of nuclear weapons. Historical circumstances compelled China to
develop nuclear weapons. For more than a century, the Chinese
nation experienced untold sufferings and scourges of war inflicted
upon by foreign aggressors. After the founding of new China, it
was still subjected to the threat of war, including that of
nuclear weapons. In order to survive and develop, China was left
with no other alternative. Our development of a limited nuclear
capability is not aimed at threatening other people, but is solely
for self-defense with a view to maintaining independence,
sovereignty and territorial integrity, and ensuring a peaceful
life of the people. Moreover, our development of nuclear weapons
is to safeguard world peace, counter nuclear blackmail and nuclear
threat, prevent nuclear war and ultimately destroy all nuclear
weapons.
</P>
<P>
Since the very first day when China came into possession of
nuclear weapons, China has solemnly declared that at no time and
under no circumstances will it be the first to use nuclear
weapons. China has also undertaken unconditionally not to use or
threaten to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear weapon states
or nuclear weapon-free zones. China is the only nuclear weapon
state in the world that has made and abided by such
commitments. China has never deployed nuclear weapons outside its
border, nor has it ever used or threatened to use nuclear weapons
against other countries.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Government Statement on Nuclear Tests (Full Text-2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
China is a peace-loving country and an important force for the
maintenance of world peace and stability. China is in favor of
reaching a comprehensive ban on nuclear weapon test explosions in
the process towards the objective of complete nuclear
disarmament. China has taken an active part in the Comprehensive
Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) negotiations in Geneva, and is striving for
the conclusion, within this year and on consensus basis, of a
fair, reasonable and verifiable CTBT with universal adherence and
unlimited duration. China is ready to work with other members of
the international community to this end.
</P>
<P>
Halting nuclear tests is an important step towards nuclear
disarmament. In order to remove once and for all the threat of
nuclear war hanging over mankind and achieve lasting peace and
universal security throughout the world, the Chinese Government
hereby appeals to all the countries, nuclear weapon states in
particular, for the following:
</P>
<P>
1.Major nuclear weapon states should abandon their policy of
nuclear deterrence. States with huge nuclear arsenals should
continue to drastically reduce their nuclear stockpiles.
</P>
<P>
2.All nuclear weapon states should undertake not to be the
first to use nuclear weapons at any time and under any
circumstances, commit themselves unconditionally not to use or
threaten to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear weapon states
or nuclear weapon-free zones, and conclude, at an early date,
international legal instruments to such effect.
</P>
<P>
3.States with nuclear weapons deployed outside their borders
should withdraw all these weapons home. All nuclear weapon states
should pledge their support to the establishment of nuclear
weapon-free zones, respect their status as such and undertake
corresponding obligations.
</P>
<P>
4.No country should develop and deploy space weapon systems or
missile defense systems undermining strategic security and
stability.
</P>
<P>
5.An international convention on the complete prohibition and
thorough destruction of nuclear weapons should be concluded
through negotiations with the participation of all states.
</P>
<P>
To realize the goal of a nuclear weapon-free world and ensure
the enjoyment of peace, security, stability and prosperity by all
countries is the strong aspiration of all people. We sincerely
hope that there should never be a nuclear war. We are convinced
that with the concerted efforts of all peace-loving countries and
people around the world, nuclear war is preventable. If mankind
can produce nuclear weapons in the 20th century, it can very well
destroy such weapons in the 21st century. The Chinese Government
and people are ready to join the governments and people around the
world for the realization of this lofty goal.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Ruling Party Leader Attacks Economic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, July 29 (Xinhua) -- A senior leader of Nepal's main
ruling party has openly attacked the coalition government's
economic liberalization policy by calling it "alien and
meaningless".
</P>
<P>
Vice President of the Nepali Congress (NC) Party Shailaja
Acharya Sunday at a program in memory of late renowned NC leader
B.P. Koirala said that economic liberalization was incongruous in
a country like Nepal which is based on compassion and cooperation
rather than on competition.
</P>
<P>
The woman NC leader, famous for her outspokenness within the
party, has frequently criticized against the policy and
performance of the three-party government under her party
colleague Sher Bahadur Deuba.
</P>
<P>
She said that the country's economic policy should concentrate
on cottage and agro-based industries.
</P>
<P>
On a hot issue recently in Nepal about women's equal rights for
parental property, Acharya called for a "philosophical clarity"
before introducing any drastic social change.
</P>
<P>
It was expected the government would introduce a bill on
women's parental property rights in the parliament during its
ongoing session.
</P>
<P>
"We should not sacrifice the institution of family on the altar
of property rights," Acharya warned.
</P>
<P>
However, the NC leader stressed the need to incorporate women
into the mainstream of national development, suggesting that 30
percent seats should be reserved for women in local bodies.

<HEADLINE> Philippine House Seeks to Amend Constitution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Philippine House Speaker Jose De
Venecia has instructed members of the House of Representatives to
revive a move to amend the constitution, in response to a call by
Nur Misuari, chief of Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF).
</P>
<P>
Venecia said the call by Misuari and several Mindanao
congressmen to allow regions to elect their senators was a
"legitimate clamor" and he ordered representative Pedro Romualdo
to reconvene the Committee on Constitutional Amendments to proceed
with hearings.
</P>
<P>
"This must be studied. The clamor is genuine," the speaker
said.
</P>
<P>
When meeting with Senator Francisco Tatad at the same day,
Misuari also proposed the granting of autonomy to all 13 regions
in the country within the framework of a federal republic.
</P>
<P>
But analysts said Misuari's call for granting more autonomy
would require the overhaul of the country's 1987 constitution, a
move which would face strong opposition from various sectors.
</P>
<P>
Tatad said Misuari also told him the Indonesian government had
served notice to both the government and the MNLF that if the
talks were not completed by August 9, the next meeting in Jakarta
may not be possible until next year.

<HEADLINE> Sotomayor Fails to Clear 2.32m in Men's High Jump </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Cuba's world record holder and
Olympic champion Javier Sotomayor was knocked out of the race when
the talented high jumper failed to clear 2.32 meters here this
evening at the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
The Cuban, who is holding the 2.45m world record and the only
man in the world to beat the 2.40m barrier, cleared his opening
height on his first leap, but failed to pass the next height of
2.32m with three tries.
</P>
<P>
It is a big surprising defeat for the hottest favourite, who
had jumped over 2.40m early this season. Sotomayor's first big
defeat took place at last year's world championships when the
injured Cuban finished second to Troy Kemp of Bahamas.
</P>
<P>
There are no immediate comments from Sotomayor. Now, Carles
Austin of the United States has cleared 2.35 meters on his first
outing. The competition is still going on.

<HEADLINE> German Cyclist Defends Olympic Title in Men's Sprint </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Defending Olympic champion Jens
Fiedler of Germany sprinted to victory in the men's sprint race
here today to keep his Olympic title at the Stone Mountain
Velodrome.
</P>
<P>
Fiedler edged past Marty Nothstein of the United States in two
consecutive sprints, in a best-two-out-of-three format, to retain
his Olympic championship in the men's individual 200-meter sprint.
</P>
<P>
"When I came here my dream was to catch a medal," Fiedler said.
"In the past I was getting fourths and fifths."
</P>
<P>
After the Barcelona Games, Fiedler slipped to the sixth place
at the 1993 World Cycling Championships in Hamar, Norway. At the
1994 world championships, he finished fourth or three places
behind Nothstein, who captured the gold medal.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, Fiedler beat Nothstein when finishing the fifth at the
Bogota world championships. Nothstein finished the sixth.
</P>
<P>
"My problem was in my head," he said. "But this year I worked
very hard."
</P>
<P>
Fiedler eliminated Garry Neiwand of Australia, the 1993 world
champion, in the semifinals Saturday to enter the gold medal race.
</P>
<P>
"In the first race I used 45 x 30 gear and jumped early," he
said on the two match sprints he won against Nothstein in the
finals. "The tactic was to stay in front. Marty likes to get in
front and I didn't want to let him."
</P>
<P>
Nothstein, who upset 1995 world champion Darryn Hill of
Australia in the quarter finals, received the silver medal for
racing against Fiedler in the gold medal race.
</P>
<P>
Curtis Harnet of Canada, silver medalist at the 1995 World
Cycling Championshis, walked away with the bronze medal, after
beating Neiwand in two consecutive match sprints in the bronze
medal race.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 28 (Xinhua) -- China finished a one-two in the
men's springboard preliminary as Xiong Ni topped the qualifiers'
list with a total of 463.02 points.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>

Olympic Games, turned to springboard after the 1992 Olympic Games
as he finished a disappointing third after his compatriot Sun
Shuwei and Scott Donie of the United States in the platform.
</P>
<P>
Xiong showed his consistency in the preliminary, executing six
high-quality dives to finish well ahead of his rivals. Yu
Zhuocheng once suffered from a slow start but he managed to gear
to form to snatch the second place.
</P>
<P>
Dmitri Saoutine of Russia, world champion of the event, made
some mistakes in the competitions and finished a lowly fifth with
a total of 391.74 points.
</P>
<P>
Americans Mark Lenzi and Scott Donie, who are among the title
hopefuls for the event, failed to match their Chinese counterparts
and collected only 372.03 and 414.03 points respectively.
</P>
<P>
Chinese divers has never won the men's springboard title at
Olympic Games and this time they are favored to win the title.
</P>
<P>
The semi-finals and the final will be held on Monday.

<HEADLINE> Italian Rider Wins Men's Points Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 28 (Xinhua) -- World champion Silvio Martinello
of Italy racked up 37 points in the men's points race here today
to capture the gold medal at the 26th Olympics.
</P>
<P>
"Winning is always emotional," Martinello said after the race.
"I was well trained. I must thank my team. I was ready for a good
performance."
</P>
<P>
Martinello, 33, beat Brian Walton of Canada by eight points in
the 40 kilometer cycling event to capture his first Olympic medal
on his return to the Olympics after missing the past two Games.
</P>
<P>
Martinello first competed in the Olympic Games in 1984 in Los
Angeles, but his best performance was riding as a member of the
Italian squad in team pursuit, which finished the fourth. In the
men's points race, he was the 16th.
</P>
<P>
But he became the world champion in 1995 at the World Cycling
Championships in Bogota, Colombia, upseting Bruno Risi of
Switzerland, who was then the defending world champion.
</P>
<P>
After finally winning an Olympic medal, Martinello said he
would first enjoy the victory and then spend time with his family
and "then I will try to defend my win and prepare for the World
Championships." The world championships is scheduled to start on
August 28 in Manchester, England.
</P>
<P>
Walton snatched the silver medal with 29 points and Stuart
O'Grady of Australia took the bronze with 27 points.
</P>
<P>
"I'm just happy right now," Walton said. "That silver is just
as good as a gold medal."
</P>
<P>
In a point race, points are awarded during lap sprints, which
occur every eighth lap. Five points are awarded to the lap winner,
three points to the second, two to the third place and one to the
fourth.
</P>
<P>
The rider who accumulates the most points or who laps the
field, regardless of his total points, wins the race.

<HEADLINE> China's Wang Junxia Aims to Do a Double in Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 28 (Xinhua) -- China's newly-crowned 5,000m
Olympic champion Wang Junxia said she will win another gold medal
for the women's 10,000 meters in the Olympic athletics
competition.
</P>
<P>
Wang, a clear winner in the 5,000 meters with a time of 14
minutes 59.88 seconds here this evening, said:"I am very happy to
win the 5,000m gold. It is an event that I was not sure to win
before the race, but for the 10,000m, I dare say the winning hope
is bigger than this race."
</P>
<P>
"I have trained very hard for this moment. In order to prepare
the Olympics and hide myself from the world, I gave up the world
championships last year, because I wouldn't want my rivals to know
where I was and how fast I could do," said the 23-year-old who is
keeping the 10,000m and 3,000m world records.
</P>
<P>
The race was a tough one throughout which saw Wang stayed in
the rear and looked not so good. But with five laps to go, the
Chinese world champion quickened her tempo and won the race
easily.
</P>
<P>
Pauline Konga of Kenya took the silver in 15:03.49 in front of
Italy's Roberta Brunet, in 15:07.52.
</P>
<P>
The women's 10,000m final will be held on August 2. Wang said
she will try her best to do a double. She is the season's best
time setter and it is very much likely that she can realise her
goal.
</P>
<P>
Her coach Mao Dezhen told Xinhua:"In the heats, we asked Wang
not to show her strength, so she finished 12th in the 5,000m
qualifying round. In today's race, her tactic was stayed behind in
the first stage, waiting her chance to open her kick. She did it
very well, but I am not satisfied with her result."
</P>
<P>
According to Mao, who took over Wang last August from her
former coach Ma Junren, Wang is a very talented girl. "She trained
very, very hard, didn't have a single lay-off day during the past
year. I think she has no rivals to meet in the 10,000m," the coach
added.
</P>
<P>
It is the first race gold for China, which chalked up four
golds in the 1993 world championships in Stuttgart through Wang
and other Ma's Army grils. Ma Junren didn't come here because his
new runners failed at the Olympic trials last May.

<P>
BEIJING, July 29 (Xinhua) -- People seeking jobs overseas or in
Beijing-based overseas-funded enterprises will have to receive
training before taking the jobs, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
They should first pass specialized courses and schooling
periods in accordance with national standards of vocational
classification, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
China Star Corp for International Economic and Technical
Co-operation (CSCIETC), one of the five government-approved
employment agencies, will cooperate with a skill-training center
under the Ministry of Labor to train those people this autumn.
</P>
<P>
"Such special training courses will be held regularly based on
the Labor Law, and the new Vocational Education Law, which will
become effective in September," said Li Donglin, general manager
of the CSCIETC.
</P>
<P>
Li said that the overseas-funded enterprises in Beijing as well
as overseas employers need employees with professional skills,
such as construction workers, computer software designers, real
estate agents, salespersons, secretaries and household helpers.
</P>
<P>
Two months ago, the Beijing Municipal Government passed a set
of new regulations on overseas firms' hiring of Chinese workers,
which took effect on June 15.
</P>
<P>
The regulation stipulate that Chinese workers in Beijing's
overseas-funded enterprises must be recruited only through
government-approved employment agencies.

<HEADLINE> African Food Increase Needs Better Water Management: FAO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Closing the gap between food
production and consumption in Africa depends on better water
management, said a paper released today by the United Nations Food
and Agriculture Organization (FAO).
</P>
<P>
The paper, prepared for the World Food Summit to be held at FAO
Headquarters here November 13-17, noted that during the past three
decades, African food production has achieved a growth of about 2
percent per year, while population has risen at the rate of 3
percent per year.
</P>
<P>
"If existing opportunities for development are neglected," said
the paper, "the future for Africa, for both the human and natural
environments is grim indeed, and the food crisis and its social
cost will only grow worse."
</P>
<P>
The FAO paper said that in many Asian and Latin American
countries and industrial countries, food production is at a
historic high due to the successful application of agricultural
technologies. In Africa, however, no comparable gains in per
capita agricultural productivity have taken place.
</P>
<P>
To close the African food gap, it is critical to focus on water
and to ensure that this resource, which for too long was
considered cheap and plentiful, is recognized as scarce and
valuable, and managed efficiently, said the paper.
</P>
<P>
The FAO report pointed out that negative effects such as soil
degradation due to salinity and water-logging, and the possible
spread of water borne diseases, cannot be neglected and mitigating
measures should be applied as early as possible.
</P>
<P>
The upcoming World Food Summit is the first-ever head of state
or government gathering on world food security with a theme of
"Food for All."

<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Syria's Ghada Shouaa made history
Sunday by winning her country's first ever Olympic gold medal when
she collected 6,780 points to become the new heptathlon champion
after two days of gruelling competition.
</P>
<P>
Germany reaped five gold medals in rowing, cycling, kayaking
and equestrian sports Sunday, the biggest haul it has ever made on
a single day at the 26th Olympics here.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-seven gold medals were awarded, two less than planned,
as bad weather and heavy rain disrupted or delayed open-air
sports. Several yachting races were postponed.
</P>
<P>
Little-known strongman from Greece Akakide Kakhiashivilis
surprised the weightlifting world and fans by smashing two world
records in one go. He jerked 235kg to better the old mark of 228kg
set by Kazakhistan's Anatoli Khrapatiy in May this year. With a
snatch of 185kg, he set a new record for the two-lift total --
420kg, which is 2.5kg more than the old mark held by Russian
Sergey Syrtsov.
</P>
<P>
So far, 13 world records in weightlifting alone have been
revamped.
</P>
<P>
Spain and Ethiopia also earned their first gold medal Sunday
while Croatia and Kenya each got a silver.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-five-year-old Fatuma Roba from Ethiopia won the first
gold medal for her country at the current Games early this morning
when she beat a strong field including London and Berlin marathon
winner Uta Pippig of Germany to finish first in the 42.195km
women's marathon.
</P>
<P>
Spain's gold came from water polo, the same as Croatia's
silver. Kenya got its medal in the women's 5,000m race.
</P>
<P>
Romania's women rowers paddled to two gold medals while its
gymnasts netted one more.
</P>
<P>
Greek gymnast Ioannis Melissanidis beat China's world and
Olympic all-around champion Li Xiaoshuang and Olympic all-around
silver medallist Alexei Nemov of Russia to win the floor exercise
gold medal, much to the surpise of the audience.
</P>
<P>
A total of 145 gold medals have been decided as the Olympic
Games concluded their ninth day of competition. Eighteen more
titles are at stake Monday.

ATLANTA, July 28 (Xinhua) -- French cyclist Nathalie Lancien
accumulated 24 points to win the first Olympic women's points race
here today at the 26th Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Lancien, who dashed to the finish line along side with Ingrid
Haringa of the Netherland, racked up one more point to beat
Haringa in the 24 kilometer or 96 lap race with 11 sprint laps
during which riders could gain points.
</P>
<P>
"I was a little nervous, but I felt like I knew what I was
doing," Lancien said when asked about her feelings before the
race.
</P>
<P>
Haringa, who accumulated 23 points, won the silver medal and
Lucy Tyler Sharman took the bronze medal with 17 points in the
race, which was delayed by the rain for three hours.
</P>
<P>
The wet track sent at least four competitors crashing out the
race and one was weeping by the track as others sped to take the
medals.
</P>
<P>
Lancien, 26, was the bronze medalist of the event at the 1995
World Championships in Bogota, Colombia. But Svetlana Samokhvalova

competition.

Lancien started to race at the age of 14. "I had many friends
who were bicycle racers, so I decided to go ahead and race
myself," she said. "In my first race, I was racing against boys
and I finished third."
</P>
<P>
Haringa, the bronze medalist in the women's sprint in
Barcelona, missed the gold medal by only one point, but she moved
closer to an Olympic title than four years ago.
</P>
<P>
"I was too far back to get gold. I was really tired, but I had
enough for second place," Haringa said. "I was very pleased with
second."
</P>
<P>
Haringa, 32, a former speedskater, stunned many when she won
the bronze medal in Barcelona after taking up track racing for
barely a year.
</P>
<P>
Lancien said she was planning to compete at the World
Championships next month in Manchester, England. But Haringa
announced that she would not be coming back for the next Olympics.
</P>
<P>
In a point race, the winner of each sprint lap is awarded five
points, the second place is given four points, the third place two
points and the fourth place one point. The rider who accumulates
the most points or laps wins the race.

<HEADLINE> Tests for School Teachers, Lunch Workers in Japanese Sakai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Japan's western city Sakai, which
was hit by an outbreak of food poisoning in recent weeks, has
ordered tests for all school lunch workers and teachers in an
effort to prevent the further spread of E. coli bacteria.
</P>
<P>
The Sakai authority Sunday ordered that all 382 people working
for school lunch program undergo tests for the strain of E. coli
bacteria, known as O-157, which was believed to have caused
sickness, according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Also, the city will run stool tests for 3,851 teachers, who are
now on summer break, and free, voluntary stool tests for its
residents.
</P>
<P>
So far, 6,490 people, mostly school children, have fallen ill
in Sakai, the second largest city in Osaka Prefecture with a
population of 800,000. Of them, 366 children were still in
hospitals, and 38 in serious condition.
</P>
<P>
Health officials suspect tainted school lunches caused the
outbreak of the O-157 E. coli bacteria that has killed seven
people, but they have to find out what food exactly caused the
poisoning.
</P>
<P>
The O-157 coli bacteria, with a week-long incubation period,
causes bloody diarrhea and flu-like symptoms.
</P>
<P>
People carrying the bacteria don't necessarily show symptoms,
but could pass it on to the more vulnerable children or elderly.

<HEADLINE> Overseas Banks in Full Play in Coastal China Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Overseas banks are playing an
increasingly important role in east China Shandong's trade and
economy, a view unanimously expressed by overseas bankers in the
coastal province.
</P>
<P>
The overseas financial organizations completed 400 million US
dollars worth of international settlements for imports and exports
during 1995.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show the total assets of branches of overseas banks
in Shandong climbed to 212 million US dollars by the end of last
year, with banking deposits in forein exchange totaling 44 million
US dollars, bringing in more than 100 million US dollars of
foreign loans.
</P>
<P>
"Overseas banks attracted more overseas investors to set up
joint ventures in Shandong," said Park Ju Heing, Chief
representative of a Republic of Korea (ROK) bank in Qingdao,
adding that his office in Qingdao has introduced 16 ROK companies
which have invested in China.
</P>
<P>
Overseas bankers have set up four branches and seven
representative offices in Qingdao, a city approved in 1992 by the
State Council as one of the province's seven cities open for
overseas financial institutions.

<HEADLINE> Wang Junxia Wins China's First Olympic Running Gold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 28 (Xinhua) -- China won its first ever long
distance Olympic gold medal when world record holder Wang Junxia
took the women's 5000 meters title here this evening.
</P>
<P>
The 1.62-meter Chinese from Northeast China's Liaoning Province
clocked 14:59.88 for the title, beating strong challenger Pauline
Konga, 26, of Kenya to second.
</P>
<P>
Konga took the silver medal with 15:03.49, ahead of Roberta
Brunet of Italy who won the bronze in 15:07.52.
</P>
<P>
The 23-year-old Chinese said: "I'm just surprised the others
ran so badly. I'm not bothered about trying the double. I run
distances like this every day."
</P>
<P>
Reigning 10,000 meters champion Derartu Tulu would not agree.
The Ethiopian gave up her double hopes and slammed the organisers
before the Games over a schedule that included a 5,000m heat and
final on the first and third days of the athletics program,
sandwiching a 10,000m heat.
</P>
<P>
Wang emerged in world long distance races in 1993 when she
stole the show by winning the 10,000 meters title with 30:49.30.
At the 7th National Games less than a month later, she created
wounders by setting two world records -- 8:06.11 in the 3,000
meters and 29:31.78 in the 10,000 meters.
</P>
<P>
For her outstanding achievement, she was awarded the prestige
Jesse Owens International Trophy Award in 1994.
</P>
<P>
However, she did not gain good results and failed to attend the
world championships in Sweden in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Losing to an unknown Jiang Bo at the National Inter-City Games
in Nanjing last October, she has shosen the city as her base for
winter training before the 26th Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Under the individual coaching of Mao Dezhen, an old coach, she
threw all herself into her intensive preparations for the Atlanta
Games.
</P>
<P>
At the national pre-Olympic trials earlier this year, she once
again showed her strength in the women's 10,000 meters
preliminaries, clocking 31:01.76 to create the world's best mark
for the last two years.
</P>
<P>
Before she arrived here she said: "My aim is very clear. I want
to revive my former glory at the Olympics in Atlanta."
</P>
<P>
Today's race showed that Wang did what she said and she fully
recovered to her top form in long distance races.

<HEADLINE> Paintings to Preserve Spectacle of Gorges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The natural scenery of the Three
Gorges may partly disappear after the dam is erected next year,
but a group of artists are trying to preserve some of the beauty
in a series of paintings.
</P>
<P>
According to today's China Daily, nearly 100 painters from all
parts of the country were organized to depict the beauty of the
gorges starting in August 1995, and have now turned out 101 works.
</P>
<P>
The project was sponsored by the China Youth Development
Foundation, China Eastern Airlines, the Chinese Artists
Association and the Chinese Calligraphers Association.
</P>
<P>
The works, collectively named the One Hundred Scenes of the
Three Gorges, will be displayed in the Museum of Chinese Revolution
next month in Beijing and then will go on to be shown in Shanghai,
Guangzhou and Hong Kong. Presently, they are being photographed by
the Palace Museum.
</P>
<P>
The sponsors have insured the paintings for 12 million yuan
through the People's Insurance (Property) Co.
</P>
<P>
The works will be auctioned as one item at the end of the
year. This is to ensure the integrity of the works and to make
sure the works will be able to be viewed at one site.
</P>
<P>
The income from the auction, expected to greatly surpass the
insured amount, will be donated to the education charity Project
Hope.

<P>
ATLANTA, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Conchita Martinez of Spain
advanced into the quarter-finals of the women's singles in the
Olympic tennis tournament at the Stone Mountain Tennis Center here

champion. "I don't think we deserve that. It is a little bit
disrespectful for the players who are there."
</P>
<P>
"They have the right to make their point but it is not our
fault they changed the schedule. It was pretty ugly," she added.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Crystal Spring Water Gushing Out Again in East China City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Jinan, capital of east China's
Shandong Province, is springing to life as water started to gush
from its once popular springs.
</P>
<P>
For centuries people flocked to the city to sample its many
spring waters. But urbanization and a decreasing water line dried
up most of the springs.
</P>
<P>
One of the most famous was the Baotu group of springs which
stopped gushing out water more than ten years ago.
</P>
<P>
Now a number of spring water outlets have been pouring out
water again simultaneously in Jinan's Baotu Spring Park.
</P>
<P>
According to staff at the park it is the first time for more
than ten years that this famous view has appeared.
</P>
<P>
Known as the city of springs, Jinan had 72 famous springs in
the past, among which the Baotu spring became the most prestigious
one. The park, named after the spring, also has a history going
back several hundred years.
</P>
<P>
But with the increase of urban population and the drop of
underground waterline, the springs stopped gushing out one after
another.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the water-saving projects undertaken in Jinan,
the underground water level has risen, and water-pressure has
increased, sparking the reappearance of several of the Baotu group
of springs.
</P>
<P>
"People will see more springs gushing out water in the coming
days", said an official from the Jinan Municipal Government.

<HEADLINE> Orders for U.S.-built Machine Tools Up in 1st Half of 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Orders for U.S.-built machine
tools rose by 6.73 percent in the first half of this year with a
sharp increase of 19.30 percent in June, the U.S. Association for
Manufacturing Technology said today.
</P>
<P>
In its monthly survey, the association reported that orders for
U.S.-built machine tools totaled 2.62 billion dollars in the first
half of this year, compared with 2.45 billion dollars in the same
period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Orders in June totaled 447.75 million dollars while they were
375.30 million in June 1995.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that it is a sign that U.S. manufacturers are
ramping up for an economic expansion.
</P>
<P>
"Orders continue to outpace our expectations," said Albert W.
Moore, president of the trade group, adding that many large
customers had announced major buying programs in the past month, a
sign that capital spending by manufacturers isn't slowing down.
</P>
<P>
The report of machine tool orders is considered a barometer of
how manufacturers see their business faring in the future. Rising
orders for tools suggests customers foresee the need to expand
production capacity because of rising demand for their products.
</P>
<P>
The report also showed rising foreign demand for American-built
machine tools, a sign of economic rebound in Europe and Japan.
</P>
<P>
Export orders totaled 444.4 million dollars in first six month

<HEADLINE> Another Stronger Typhoon Threatens Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 29 (Xinhua) -- Typhoon "huaning" churned closer to
the eastern coast of northern Luzon on Sunday, spawning more rains
and threatening a wide swath still reeling from the pummeling it
received from typhoon "gloring" last week.
</P>
<P>
Weather forecaster Leny Ruiz of the Philippine Atmospheric,
Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration said that
"huaning" should trigger more rains because of its 350-kilometer
radius rain clouds.
</P>
<P>
"The whole rain cloud radius of huaning can reach the whole of
Luzon. huaning is also stronger than gloring," Ruiz said.
</P>
<P>
"Huaning" is packed with maximum sustained winds of 150
kilometers per hour (kph) near the center and gusts of up to 185
kph, compared to gloring's gustiness of up to 150 kph.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the death toll caused by typhoon "gloring" has risen
to 55 persons.

<P>
ATLANTA, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Vengeful Kim Taek-Soo stopped the
singles run of world champion and World Cup holder Kong Linghui
and Johnny Huang upset 1992 Olympic champion Jan-Ove Waldner in
the Olympic table tennis tournament here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean, who made himself a controversial figure after
using a banned glue to stick rubbers to his racket in the world
championships last year, beat Chinese world number one 21-17,
21-18, 20-22, 21-12.
</P>
<P>
Kong failed to deal with the top spin play of the ninth-ranked
Kim, who vowed to beat anyone who had cashed in on his
disqualification at the world championships.
</P>
<P>
"I felt lackluster throught the game," said Kong, who defeated
compatriot Liu Guoliang to win the world crown. "I will do my
best in the doubles event."
</P>
<P>
"I was shocked when I was disqualified last year after beating
Wang Tao and it made me try harder here," Kim said. "I was
determined to beat him as he is a Chinese."
</P>
<P>
Waldner, underprepared after a training injury, lost to
Chinese-Canadian Huang 21-15, 17-21, 21-16, 21-15.
</P>
<P>
Fourth seed Walder, who missed 14 days practice before the
Games because of an injured thumb, failed to find his form and
flair.
</P>
<P>
"I played against a better player today and I did not reach
anywhere near my best," said Waldner. "I thought I had a chance
after winning the second game but I did not play well enough."
</P>
<P>
The 30-year-old Swede said he would continue his career. "I
still want to win the big events and I will be at the world
championships in Manchester next year."
</P>
<P>
Chinese Wang Tao and Liu Guoliang cruised into the top eight.
</P>
<P>
Wang routed South Korean Yoo Nam-Kyu 3-0 while Liu triumped
over Japanese Koji Matsushita in straight sets.
</P>
<P>

Chile 3-0, Belgian Jean-Micheal Saive downed Croatian Zoran
Promorac 3-0, Czech Petr Korbel edged Brazilian Hugo Hoyama 3-2,

clinch the second-place spot in Pool A of the Olympic women's
volleyball event Sunday.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Spain defeated Croatia 7-5 in the
final and got its first water polo Olympic gold medal Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Defending champion Italy took the bronze when it beat Hungary,
a former six-time champion, 20-18 in a wild game that went to
overtime.
</P>
<P>
In the first two quarters of the final, Croatia limited Spain
to one goal, a second-quarter strike by 35-year-old Manuel
Estiarte, with a tough defense.
</P>
<P>
Goalkeeper Jesus Rollan kept Spain in the game with good saves
and Spain finally began finding cracks in the third quarter, when
Estiarte had two goals.
</P>
<P>
Spain even led before Croatian captain Perica Bukic tied the
score at 5-5 with late in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
After Pedro Garcia scored early in the fourth quarter, a
spectacular left-handed backhand goal by Jordi Sans gave Spain a
7-5 lead with 4:55 left. It proved to be the final goal of the
game, as Rollan produced more good saves.
</P>
<P>
Spanish players and their coach Juan Jane, who dived into the
pool, celebrated wildly. Spain took the silver medal at home in
Barcelona four years ago.
</P>
<P>
The Italians have changed most of their squad since Barcelona
and were upset by Croatia in the semifinals. They appeared to be
heading home without a medal when they trailed by four goals,
13-9, early in the final quarter.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Defending champion Germany joined
Spain in the semifinals of the Olympic men's hockey by thrashing
the United States 3-0 in their last group A match here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Any hopes India and Pakistan had of an upset win by the U.S. --
which would have taken either of them into the semifinals instead
of Germany -- were dampened in the first-half.
</P>
<P>
Veteran Carsten Fischer, goal-less in the competition so far,
hit timely form by slamming in the first two penalty corners to
put Germany 2-0 ahead by the 22nd minute.
</P>
<P>
Christian Blunk then shot in the rebound from Fischer's third
penalty corner in the 27th.
</P>
<P>
Assured of a semifinal berth after a bad start when they lost
1-0 to Spain, the Germen team relaxed their grip in the
second-half but did not allow the U.S. to score.
</P>
<P>
Germany ended the preliminary league with seven points, one
behind leaders Spain, and now face the top team from group B --
probably the Netherlands -- in Wednesday's second semi-final.
</P>
<P>
World Cup holder Pakistan, which thumped Argentina 6-2 earlier
in the day, ended their campaign with five points. India has four,
but play their last match against Spain later on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
An Indian win will, at best, help them finish among the top six
and qualify for the 1997 and 1998 editions of the prestigious
Champions Trophy tournaments.
</P>
<P>
The semifinalists from group B will be decided on Monday. The
Netherlands head the table with seven points, followed by
Australia and Britain on five each.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch plays South Africa in their last match, while
Australia and Britain clash with each other.

<HEADLINE> FBI Keeps Tracing for Suspects of Bomb Explosion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 28 (Xinhua) -- As the Centennial Games went on
without interruption, the search for the suspects of the bomb
explosion on early Saturday morning was still on the way, said a
spokesman of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) here Sunday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"We're in the process of valuating the accounts of
eyewitnesses, and we have a number of significant evidences, but
it's premature to reveal whether the suspect was an individual or
a group," said David Tubbs.
</P>
<P>
However, "the search for evidence in the Centennial Olympic
Park has been completed," the FBI spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, concerned authorities announced today that the Park
will be reopened to the public on Tuesday morning by doubling the
security personnel and conducting random bag searches there.
</P>
<P>
In the small hours of Saturday, a home-made pipe bomb exploded
in the Park, claiming two fatalities and injuring 112 others.
</P>
<P>
Among the injuried, 97 were Americans and two Britons. And 60
people were still kept in hospitals in stable conditions, said
A.D. Frazier, chief operating officer of the Atlanta Committee for
the Olympic Games (ACOG).
</P>
<P>
Prior to the explosion, the Atlanta police office received a
911 call from "a white male with indistinguishable accent",
warning that a bomb will explode in the Park in 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
"After the opening of the Games, we received dozens of bomb
calls, and this was just a normal call which only said `there's a
bomb in the Park with no specific location,'" said Beverly
Harvard, chief of police in Atlanta.

"However, we dispatched our bomb team to the Park and it went
off upon the arrival of our team," lamented Harvard.
</P>
<P>
Since the bomb explosion, the Park has been sealed off for FBI
investigation and collection of evidences, including fragments of
the bomb, some were retrieved from 100 yards away.
</P>
<P>
"We have received some 600 hotline calls and a number of video
tapes and photographs from the public, and they could be very
helpful," said agent Tubbs.
</P>
<P>
The 911 caller, which was traced down at the Days Inn hotel
located two blocks away from the Park, could be the suspect of
planting the bomb in the Park. "The assumption is very strong,"
said Tubbs, adding "But it may be a wrong information."
</P>
<P>
The phone and fragments of the bomb which was very crude with
nails and screws attached, have been flown to the FBI headquarters
in Washington D.C. for evaluation.
</P>
<P>
After the explosion, bomb calls to Atlanta police office have
been received at a higher frequecy as many made their calls at the
moment when they spotted any suspicious objects, said Harvard.
</P>
<P>
At present, hundreds of agents from the city, state and federal
government are coordinating in their efforts to trace down the
suspects, said the agent who declined to reveal more details of
their investigation.

ATLANTA, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Augustine Okocha and Celestine
Babayaro scored the goals to lead Nigeria to a 2-0 victory over
Mexico Sunday in Birmingham, Alabama.
</P>
<P>
With the win, Nigeria advanced to the semifinals in the Olympic
men's soccer tournament.
</P>
<P>
Okocha gave Nigeria the lead in the 20th minute and Celestine
Babayaro added the insurance in the 85th.
</P>
<P>
Mexico played the last 45 minutes with only 10 men after Duilio
Davino was red carded during first-half injury time for an
intentional handball.
</P>
<P>
Davino claimed he grabbed the ball after a linesman had
signalled offside, but the referee apparently waved off the call.

<HEADLINE> Kakhiashvilis Wins Weightlifting Gold with World Marks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 28 (Xinhua) -- Akakide Kakhiashvilis of Greece
displayed his prowess in the 99-kg category at the Olympic
weightlifting tournament here on Sunday, winning the competition
with two world records in the jerk and the total.
</P>
<P>
The Greek, who won the 100-kg category at the Barcelona Olympic
Games for the United Team, snatched 185 kilograms and jerked 235
kgs for a combined total of 420 kgs.
</P>
<P>
Anatoli Khrapaty of Kazakhstan lifted the silver medal at 410
kgs, with 187.5 kgs from snatch and 222.5 kgs from jerk.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine's Denis Gotfrid, who led the ranking after the snatch
competition with 187.5 kgs, managed to take the bronze medal at
402.5 kgs after jerking 215 kgs.
</P>
<P>
In the snatch event, Kakhiashvilis, who moved to Greece from
Georgia one year after Barcelona Olympics, seemed to be squeezed
out of the gold contenders with his lifts. The Greek, after making
180 kgs in his first attempt and 185 kgs in the second, failed to
lift 187.5 kgs in the third.
</P>
<P>
While for his arch rivals, Gotfrid and Khrapaty each had 187.5
kgs in the snatch and went into the jerk with much advantage over
him.
</P>
<P>
Kakhiashvilis found back his power in the jerk. After lifting
220 and 225 kgs in his first two trials, the 26-year-old Greek
hoisted a new world record weight of 235 kgs and turned the
weightlifting gymnasium into a boiled pot.
</P>
<P>
"I am happy to win the gold medal," said the Greek.
</P>
<P>
"Before I came here, I knew I had to face many good lifters
from Russia, Ukraine and Belarus, but I believed that I could win
the Olympic title," he added.
</P>
<P>
After eight day competitions in weightlifting, China, Turkey
and Greece each had two gold medals with Cuba and Russia each
taking one.
</P>
<P>
The men's 108-kg category lifts will be held on Monday.

<HEADLINE> Centennial Olympic Park to Reopen on Tuesday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The Centennial Olympic Park will
be reopened on Tuesday morning after a bomb exploded in the wee
hours of Saturday, concerned authorities said here Sunday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"Centennial Olympic Park will be reopened to the public and
additional security measures will be employed in the area
consistent with its status as a place of public access," said A.D.
Frazier, chief operating officer of the Atlanta Committee for the
Olympic Games (ACOG).
</P>
<P>
The law enforcement personnel at the park will be doubled and
random bag searches upen entry to the Park will be conducted,
Frazier said.
</P>
<P>
The park, located in Atlanta downtown close to the Olympic
venues, was sealed off after a home-made pipe bomb exploded in the
wee hours of Saturday, claiming two fatalities and injuring 112
people including six security officers.
</P>
<P>
The combined forces from the Federal Bureau of Investigation
(FBI), Atlanta Police Department and Acog, cordoned off the place
since then for a thorough investigation.
</P>
<P>
"With precautions, we believe and hope the Games go on with no
such an incident," said Woody Johnson, the FBI agent responsible
for the investigation.
</P>
<P>
The Park was conceived by William Payne, ACOG president, as a
free-ticket place for people in their celebration and relaxation,
and will be kept as a memorial venue after the Centennial Games.

<HEADLINE> Australia Ranks Second in Basketball Group B </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 28 (Xinhua) -- With a win of 103-62 over Greece
here on Sunday, the Australian men's basketball team clinched the
second spot in the final group B standings at the Atlanta Games
with a 4-1 record.
</P>
<P>
Greece, finished 3-2 in the six-team group, will join Australia
in the Quarter finals which start on Tuesday at the Georgia Dome.
</P>
<P>
Guard Shane Heal's sharp 3-pointer shooting capped Australians
to an early lead of 20-5 at 13:51. And Greece's sluggish play
enabled the Aussies to a 20 points lead twice, 28-8 and 30-10,
before the Australians built a 22-points lead of 52-30 at the
interval.
</P>
<P>
When starting center Panayotis Fassoulas got injury on his knee
in the mid-way of the second half, Greece never seriously turned
out a threat to Australia in the rest of the game and the
62-points was the lowest total for Greece in the current Games.
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to be excused, but three of our prime players
did't play today," said Greek head coach Makis Dedrinos about the
team's injury problems.
</P>
<P>
"Fassoulas put ice on his injury and we still don't know what
it is."
</P>
<P>
Greece is likely to meet Lithuania in the quarterfinals and the
recent game between the two sides was a warm-up exhibition in
Chicago which Lithuania won by two.
</P>
<P>
Australia will take on Croatia if the European powerhouse loses
to the unbeaten United States late Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the morning, Lithuania tournced China 116-55 in a
one-sided game. Both teams entered the game with an indentical
record of 2-2.
</P>
<P>
With the victory, Lithuania, European runner-up moved to the
second spot and China finished fourth in Group A.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Serbs Ready to Cooperate With Int'l Community </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, July 28 (Xinhua) -- A senior Bosnian Serb official
said today the extradition of Serb citizens is contrary to the
Serb constitution and therefore cannot be carried out before
relevant Bosnian bodies start functioning in line with the Dayton
accord.
</P>
<P>
Bosnian Serb Minister of Justice Mako Arsovic made the
statement at a press conference here today on the eve of his
departure with a Serb delegation for the Hague Monday.
</P>
<P>
Arsovic pointed out that the extradition issue can be regulated
only after elections in Bosnia as the Hague tribunal is in charge
of regulating the practical aspects of such proceedings.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the Serb authorities' readiness to fully cooperate
with all international institutions, including the Hague-based
U.N. tribunal for war crimes in the former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
During its four-day visit in the Hague at the tribunal's
invitation, the Serb delegation will present the Serb government's
stance that all future forms of cooperation must be in line with
the Bosnian Serb constitution, he said.
</P>
<P>
The delegation will also discuss with tribunal representatives
the charges brought against political and military leaders of the
Muslim-Croat federation and the future activities of tribunal
investigators in Serb territory, he added.
</P>
<P>
The international war crimes tribunal has charged more than 70
persons with committing war crimes during the Bosnia civil war.
Most of the wanted men are Serbs and only a few are now under
custody.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Serb Deputy Minister of Justice Goran Neskovic, who
is also in charge of liaison with the tribunal, said at the joint
press conference that the Serb authorities would do all they can
to bring criminals to justice, regardless of their nationality or
religion.
</P>
<P>
Numerous proceedings are under way in Serb courts, both against
persons on the tribunal lists and others, Neskovic said, adding
that the tribunal should draw up regulations on extradition.
</P>
<P>
Bosnian Serb leaders announced in late June that their own
special court would be set up to try alleged war criminals, to run
in parallel with the international tribunal in the Hague.

<HEADLINE> Exhumation of Serbs' Mass Graves in Bosnia Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, July 28 (Xinhua) -- The Bosnian Serb commission for
the exchange of prisoners of war and missing persons said today
the exhumation of bodies of Serb soldiers and civilians from a
mass grave near Glamoc in western Bosnia was postponed once again.
</P>
<P>
The commission said it was informed today by the Banja Luka
office of international High Representative for Bosnia Carl Bildt
that the exhumation in the village of Kamen, three kilometers east
of Glamoc, was due to be resumed next Saturday.
</P>
<P>
This is the fourth postponement since 42 bodies were retrieved
from mass graves there on July 16, the Tanjug news agency reported
from Banja Luka.
</P>
<P>
All subsequent attempts to continue the exhumation were
prevented by Croat police, which banned a team of experts of the
Serb commission from entering the Croat-held Glamoc municipal
area, Tanjug said.
</P>
<P>
Another 65 bodies of Serb civilians and soldiers killed in last
autumn's Muslim-Croat offensive on the western part of the Serb
entity of Republika Srpska remain in the grave, it added.
</P>
<P>
The Serb commission said that it had duly informed in advance
the international police force and the NATO-led peace
Implementation Force of each of its attempts to continue the
exhumation.
</P>
<P>
Muslim authorities have taken a similar attitude at Mt. Ozren
in northern Bosnia which has blocked the Serbs from carrying the
bodies of 23 Serb army soldiers exhumed 10 days ago at Ozren to
Republika Srpska for burial, the Serb commission added.

ATLANTA, July 28 (Xinhua) -- French cyclist Nathalie Lancien
waved to spectators with a big smiling face as she glided on her
bike after accumulating 24 points to win the women's point race
here today at the 26th Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Lancien, who dashed to the finish line along side with Ingrid
Haringa of Netherland, racked up one more point to beat Haringa in

points and the fourth place one point. The rider who accumulates
the most points wins the race.
</P>
<P>
Haringa won the silver medal with 23 points and Lucy Tyler
Sharman took the bronze medal with 17 points in the race, which
was delayed by the rain for more than three hours.

<P>
The wet track sent at least four competitors crashing out the
race and one was weeping by the track as others sped to take the
medals.

Lancien, 26, was the bronze medalist of the event at the 1995
World Championships in Bogota, Colombia. But Svetlana Samokhvalova
of Russia, gold medalist at the 1995 World Championships,
accumulated only 14 points to finish the fourth in today's
competition.

<P>
Haringa, the bronze medalist in the women's sprint in
Barcelona, missed the gold medal by only one point, but she moved
closer to an Olympic title than four years ago. Haringa, a former
speedskater, stunned many when she won the bronze medal in
Barcelona after taking up track racing for barely a year.

<P>
PARIS, July 28 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac had
a telephone conversation this evening with his U.S. counterpart,
Bill Clinton, on terrorism and the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents stressed their will to cooperate in fighting
terrorism, at the wake of the bomb attack on the Olympics Park in
central Atlanta last Saturday and the explosion of a TWA Boeing
747 on July 18 in New York, Agence France Presse (AFP) quoted a
source at the French presidential office as saying.
</P>
<P>
Chirac and Clinton also highlighted the importance of the
conference on terrorism by foreign ministers from the Group of
Seven industrialized nations and Russia to be held Tuesday in
Paris.
</P>
<P>
On the Middle East peace process, the two presidents agreed
that if the process continues to be stuck like it is now, the
risks of a resurgence of terrorism will become larger, AFP quoted
the same source as saying.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents agreed that it is very important to relaunch
the peace process and that France and the United States will work
together for it.

<HEADLINE> Welfare Bill Needs Improvement: White House Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 28 (Xinhua) -- White House chief of staff Leon
Panetta said today that the welfare reform bill now before
congressional negotiators from both chambers must include
improvements that President Bill Clinton wants.
</P>
<P>
On ABC's "This Week With David Brinkley," Panetta said, "I am
not going to tell you what he will sign or what he will veto at
this point, and the reason I'm not going to do it is because my
experience is that, as soon as the president says, `Oh, yes, I'm
going to sign that,' or, `I'm going to veto that,' everybody walks
away from the pressure of trying to improve this bill."
</P>
<P>
"The president has said, and has continued to say, with regards
to welfare reform he wants a bill that's strong on work and
responsibility and protects kids," Panetta said.
</P>
<P>
In an address Saturday, Clinton said there had been
"considerable bipartisan progress" made toward "real welfare
reform," but the measure before Congress needs more work to meet
his approval and he said he would not sign "another extremist
bill."
</P>
<P>
Panetta said today that the measure now before a Senate-House
conference committee contains improvements over two welfare reform
bills Clinton had earlier vetoed.
</P>
<P>
But, he said, "there are still some areas that the president's
expressed some concerns on. One is the cuts with regards to
immigrants, particularly as they affect children and the disabled.
And secondly are the food stamp cuts."
</P>
<P>
Panetta said, "If you want a bill that the president will sign,
then we want to have the improvements that the president's asking
for."
