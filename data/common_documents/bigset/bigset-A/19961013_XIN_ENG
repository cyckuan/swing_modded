<HEADLINE> Syria Calls Weizman's Trip to Arab Capitals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, October 12 (Xinhua) -- As Israeli President Ezer
Weizman is preparing visits to some Arab capitals, Syria came out
to question his political motivation.
</P>
<P>
"Everybody knows that the post of Israeli president is honorary
and has nothing to do with the decision-making in Israel,"
commented Teshrin, one of Syria's most influential newspapers,
today.
</P>
<P>
Weizman, whose role is seen as ceremonial, is scheduled to visit
Cairo next week, which would be followed by a trip to Amman. Egypt
and Jordan are the only Arab countries which have normalized
relations with Israel so far.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian newspaper called Weizman's upcoming tours as
"deceitful political moves" designed to "beautify (Israeli)
anti-peace policies."
</P>
<P>
The Israeli president, former air force commander, met with
Palestinian President Yasser Arafat early this week. He consulted
with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu about his trips to Cairo
and Amman amid mounting Arab criticism of Israel's hardline policy.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government, formed three and a half months ago, has
caused not only an overwhelming Arab wrath but also a European and
American concern and disgust, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The European Union (EU) has voiced concern over the Middle East
peace process, which was at verge of collapse following bloody
clashes in the Palestinian territories in late September. The
15-nation EU vowed to play a greater role in promoting peace in
the region.
</P>
<P>
The latest Israeli-Palestinian confrontation also prompted
Washington to call an emergency summit early this month and send
Secretary of State Warren Cristopher to the region to bring the
Israelis and Palestinians back to the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
However, no tangible headway has been achieved so far in the
resumed Palestinian-Israeli negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian newspaper held the Israeli government responsible
for jeopardizing the Middle East peace process and undermining all
opportunities of establishing peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
"The potential for blowout of the volatile situation in the
region is still there and the tension is likely to escalate as
Israel does not back down on its expansionist settlement activity
and security pretexts," the daily said.
</P>
<P>
It urged the Arab world to keep vigilant at the Israeli
maneuvers aiming to paint Netanyahu in peaceful colors.
</P>
<P>
Syria and Israel failed to reach a peaceful settlement to
their dispute over the Golan Heights in the past four years of
negotiations. Syria asked Israel to return the 1180-square-kilometer
heights seized in 1967 but the latter rejected it until proper
security arrangements are made.
</P>
<P>
The new Israeli government has ruled out the possibility of
pulling out from the Golan Heights, leaving Damascus little hope
for regaining its lost land.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Complaints against Israel's Bombardment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, October 12 (Xinhua) -- A five-nation group overseeing
a cease-fire between Lebanon and Israel is to meet Monday to
consider Lebanon's complaint against the Jewish state over Friday
night's bombardment at southern Lebanese villages.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri announced here today that
his government had filed a complaint to the cease-fire monitoring
committee comprising the United State, Fiance, Syria, Lebanon and
Israel.
</P>
<P>
The state-run Radio Lebanon reported that the committee is to
hold a meeting at the headquarters of the U.N. peacekeeping force
at the southern border town of Naqura at 10:00 a.m. (08:00 GMT)
Monday to consider the complaint.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon lodged the complaint after 12 civilians, including four
women, were wounded by the Israeli bombardment at Safad AL-Batikh
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
The official radio said that the complaint was faxed to the
committee's chairman David Greenlee, a veteran American general,
residing in the U.S. embassy in Nicosia, Cyprus, by Lebanese
representative to the committee Colonel Maher Touteyli.
</P>
<P>
"The complaint contains details of the Israeli aggression
against southern Lebanese civilians, which was regarded (by
Lebanon) as a violation of the April 26 cease-fire
understanding," the radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Brokered by the United States, the understanding put an end to
a 17-day Israeli blitz against guerrillas of the pro-Iranian
Hezbollah, or Party of God, in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Under the understanding, both the Israeli forces and Lebanese
guerrillas are banned from attacking civilian targets or launching
attacks from civilian areas.
</P>
<P>
The bombardment followed a minor armed clash between guerrillas
of the Shiite fundamentalist group and Israeli troops on the
border of the 850-square-kilometer buffer zone self-carved by
Israel in 1985.
</P>
<P>
The cease-fire monitoring committee have met for four times to
consider complaints lodged by Lebanon and Israel against each
other.
</P>
<P>
During its last meeting on September 25, the committee issued a
statement, the first since its establishment, calling on all
parties to stop in all circumstances "indiscriminate shelling" that
puts civilian lives in danger.
</P>
<P>
Hit-and run attacks by Muslim guerrillas and bombardment and
air strikes by Israeli forces have constituted a daily scene on
the last active battlefront of the Arab-Israeli conflict.
</P>
<P>
Twenty Israeli soldiers have been killed by Hezbollah
guerrillas in southern Lebanon since this year.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Delegation Authorized to Continue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 12 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)
authorized today Palestinian negotiators to continue talks with
Israel without conceding any change in the signed agreement.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made during a meeting of the PNA and PLO
executive committee chaired by PNA President and PLO leader
Yasser Arafat in the West Bank town of Nablus.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli and Palestinian negotiators are expected to
continue talks next Monday in Taba of Egypt, despite that the
first week of negotiations failed to produce any tangible results.
</P>
<P>
The current round of talks resumed early this week after
Israeli-Palestinian confrontations killed 75 people late last
month, kindling the worst crisis in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The PNA and PLO ordered no compromise on the accurate
implementation of the interim agreement on Israeli troop
redeployment from the West Bank town of Hebron. Israel has been
demanding security changes to the redeployment, which was
strongly rejected by the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Arafat renewed his warning against new waves of
Palestinian violence if the peace talks failed to succeed. He
said that, if a new intifada, or Arab uprising, breaks out, he
could not stop it.
</P>
<P>
Also today, U.S. peace envoy Dennis Ross held a luncheon
meeting with Arafat in Nablus, during which the two reviewed the
issue of Israeli redeployment from Hebron and the upcoming Taba
talks.
</P>
<P>
Ross was sent by U.S. President Bill Clinton who restarted the
talks after hosting a summit between Arafat, Jordanian King
Hussein and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the
wake of the bloodshed. Ross has been directly involved in the
talks, playing the role as a facilitator.
</P>
<P>
Unconfirmed reports speculated that Netanyahu intended to
complete the talks on Hebron redeployment by November before the
U.S. general elections. But it remains unclear if Israel will
back off its demand for new security arrangements in Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli security forces are bracing for violence by
the extreme right-wing Jewish activists in Hebron, who vowed
today to take violent actions if Palestinian police are deployed
in the town.
</P>
<P>
The activists threatened to attack Palestinians if Israeli
troops are redeployed from the town, where 450 Jewish settlers
live among 120,000 Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Jewish settlers claimed that their safety would be endangered
as the Jewish living quarter is surrounded by Palestinian
neighborhoods. Their security concern increased especially after
armed Palestinian policemen exchanged fire with Israeli soldiers
during the bloody conflicts late last month.
</P>
<P>
Under the Oslo II agreement, Israeli troops should hand over
security control to the Palestinian police over 80 percent of
Hebron, but retain security responsibility over the Jewish
quarter.
</P>
<P>
Hebron has been a hotbed for both Jewish and Palestinian
extremist activities and violence. In a massacre in February
1994, a Jewish settler killed 29 Palestinians praying at a Hebron
mosque.

<HEADLINE> Seven Die of Ebola Disease in Gabon: WHO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Seven people died this month in
northeast Gabon of hemorrhage fever caused by the deadly virus of
the Ebola disease, reported the Brazzaville-based World Health
Organization's African branch today.
</P>
<P>
Cases of the disease were reported in February in Makokou, 100
kilometers southwest of the place where the new cases were
reported, local media reports quoted WHO officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-seven people suspected to have been infected with the
virus, three of whom are in critical conditions, are under medical
supervision.
</P>
<P>
Two medical teams -- one from Zaire where 245 people died of
the disease in 1995, and one from Geneva -- are being dispatched
to Gabon.
</P>
<P>
"This is a zone of equatorial forest in which the virus is
always present and the cases of hemorrhage fever can suddenly come
at any moment," said a WHO spokesman in the Congolese capital.
</P>
<P>
Scientists suspect that the Ebola virus is carried by some
monkeys of Africa.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak: Europe Plays Active Role in Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
said today that Europe plays an active role in the Middle East
peace process, while noting that it will not substitute the major
role by the United States.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak made the remarks to reporters after he inaugurated the Al
Ahram Printing House in the Sixth of October City, some 60
kilometers northwest of Cairo.
</P>
<P>
He said that he welcomes a European role in the peace process,
of which the U.S. and Russia are the co-sponsors.
</P>
<P>
The European Union has been seeking to be more involved in
efforts aimed at pushing forward the regional peace march.
</P>
<P>
Early this week, Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring said during
his brief visit to Egypt that Europe will send a special envoy to
the region to follow up Arab-Israeli peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Spring, whose country holds the rotating presidency of the
European Union, said that the envoy will not participate directly
in the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
French President Jacques Chirac is scheduled to embark on a
Middle East tour later this month, which will take him to Egypt,
Syria, Israel, the Palestinian self-rule areas, Jordan and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
In statements carried by Egypt's news agency MENA, Mubarak also
defended the Egyptian press' attack on the Israeli government
over its hardline policy toward the Arab-Israeli peace process.
</P>
<P>
"The Egyptian press enjoys complete freedom like the Israeli
press which also attacks Egypt," Mubarak was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said that he could not put a muzzle on the press to
force it to keep silent.
</P>
<P>
But he said that he has appealed to the press not to use nasty
expressions.

<HEADLINE> Arab Conference on Industrial Corrosion Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, October 12 (Xinhua) -- an Arab conference
on industrial corrosion attended by senior officials and
specialists from 20 countries was inaugurated here today.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti Minister of Information Sheikh Saud Nasser al-Sabah,
who is also holding the portfolios of oil, education and higher
education prior to the formation of a new cabinet, in his
opening speech at the conference, highlighted the importance of
dealing with technical and operational problems in Arab
industrial establishments in a scientific and objective manner.
</P>
<P>
The conference is jointly organized by the Gulf Cooperation
Council General Secretariat, the Organization of Arab Petroleum
Exporting Countries, the Kuwait Institute of Science and Research,
the Kuwait National Petroleum Company and other Kuwaiti
governmental and industrial bodies.
</P>
<P>
The local press said that Kuwait was chosen to host this
conference because it suffers the most serious corrosion and
therefore it has carried out various researches and studies
dealing with the phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
The corrosion in the oil-rich emirate costs about 320 million
Kuwait dinars (1.056 billion U.S. dollars) annually, press reports
said.
</P>
<P>
Scientific organizations in Kuwait such as the Kuwait
Institute for Scientific Research, Kuwait University, the Public
Authority for Applied Education and Training and the Kuwait
Foundation for the Development of Sciences have all achieved
important results in curbing industrial corrosion.
</P>
<P>
Industries such as oil production and refining, petrochemicals
and desalination in the Arab countries, especially in the Gulf
region, have suffered a lot from corrosion because they are
located near the sea.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, specialists from around 20 countries are
expected to present a total of 60 papers dealing with the
phenomenon, according to sources close to the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The papers to be presented at the conference would focus on the
development of oil and water industries in the Arab world, the
sources said.

<HEADLINE> Northern Ireland on Edge of Abyss, Sinn Fein Warns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams
today called for new all-party talks to pull the troubled Northern
Ireland back from the brink of disaster.
</P>
<P>
"We are at the moment on the edge of an abyss and what we have
to do is try to steer in a very calm, reflective and even-handed
way through this critical point," he said on BBC radio.
</P>
<P>
"What is required is a viable process which people know has all
of the parties to the conflict around the table led by the British
and Irish governments," he added.
</P>
<P>
Britain and Ireland say they will not allow Sinn Fein into
talks until the Irish Republican Army (IRA) removes all threats of
violence by renewing a truce that it broke in February.
</P>
<P>
Adams, head of the IRA's political wing, asked, "How are we
going to get a peaceful conclusion to this conflict if it is not
through sitting around a table and talking?"
</P>
<P>
Since February, the IRA has confined hostilities to a bombing
wave in mainland Britain and one attack on a British army camp in
Germany.
</P>
<P>
A new attack by the IRA on October 7, a double car bomb blast
inside Britain's military garrison near Belfast killing a soldier
and wounding 30 other people, was the first in Northern Ireland
for more than two years.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the attack, British Prime Minister John Major
said that the IRA had "once again spat their hate at the British
nation."
</P>
<P>
Irish Prime Minister John Bruton told parliament in Dublin that
the attack was a Nazi-style betrayal of peace hopes in Northern
Ireland.

LUSAKA, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Zambia will not lift economic
sactions it imposed against Burundi in order to force the
military government to resolve the conflicts between the Hutu and
Tutsi communities in that contral African country.
</P>
<P>
This was stressed by Zambian President Frederick Chiluba at
the Lusaka International Airport upon his arrival from Arusha,
Tanzania, after attending the summit of some African leaders.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said that the Arusha heads of state and government
summit agreed to continue the sactions against Burundi in an
effort to bring peace in that country.
</P>
<P>
While in Arusha, President Chiluba said that his country had
adhered to the sanctions imposed on Burundi. Zambia stopped
exporting sugar to Burundi, from which about two million U.S.
Dollars the country would have earned through this export were
lost, the president added.
</P>
<P>
It was not late for peace to prevail in the region because the
region was still young, Chiluba said.
</P>
<P>
It was reported from Arusha that the summit resolved to
continue with the sanctions against Burundi. The meeting ordered
that negotiations between the warring factions begin within one
month.
</P>
<P>
In a joint communique issued at the end of the one-day summit, the
participants resolved that any faction that would refuse to negotiate
in Burundi should be punished.

<HEADLINE> Israel's Trade Deficit Shrinks by 0.25 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Israel's trade deficit
shrank at a monthly rate of 0.25 percent during the third
quarter of this year, according to a latest report by the
Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS).
</P>
<P>
The CBS figures show a steady drop in imports, excluding
diamonds and fuel, over the recent months, while an average
monthly increase of 0.33 percent was registered in exports, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
Industrial exports increased by some 0.33 percent to 0.5
percent in recent months, after a steady growth in the
first four months of this year.
</P>
<P>
Last month, exports comprised 67 percent of industrial
products excluding diamonds, 31 percent of polished diamonds
and 2 percent of agricultural produce.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, imports of raw materials had largely remained
unchanged since March, with an increase in consumer goods brought
into the country.
</P>
<P>
However, the CBS warned in the report that the deficit
shrinking may not be a long-lasting trend.
</P>
<P>
According to the CBS, the trade deficit for the first
nine months of this year totaled 8.1 billion U.S. dollars,
compared with 7.3 billion dollars in the same period of 1995.
</P>
<P>
The deficit totaled 700 million dollars in September, as
imports reached 2.3 billion dollars and exports 1.6 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with European Union (EU) Ambassador Jean Paul
Jesse last week, Israeli Finance Minister Dan Meridor examined
ways of reducing the trade deficit with the EU, which
stands at 6.5 million dollars in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Iran Continues Mediation in Tajikistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Iran said here today that
it would use its influence to help start peace talks between
warring parties in Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
Iran's Deputy Foreign Minister Mahmoud Vaezi assured Gerd
Merrem, the UN special envoy for Tajikistan, that Tehran will
continue its mediation efforts among the conflicting sides.
</P>
<P>
However, Vaezi said, "the flexibility shown by one party
should be given positive response by the other, because
unilateral concession would not lead to a lasting and just
peace."
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that peace talks would pave the way for face
to face dialogue between President Emomali Rakhmanov and the
opposition union leader Abdollah Nouri in Moscow later this month.
</P>
<P>
Gerd Merrem arrived here Tuesday for a week-long visit in
preparation for the upcoming peace talks between the Tajik
government and the opposition.
</P>
<P>
Merrem was quoted by the official news agency IRNA as
saying "the current situation in the region requires more
mediation efforts to bring peace to the republic."
</P>
<P>
He said the parties concerned should avoid putting forward
their maximum expectations and mutually give concession for the
sake of peace.
</P>
<P>
He said the ceasefire agreement signed in Tehran last year
has laid a solid basis for further peace moves in Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
"The Tajik crisis should be resolved in such a manner
that the interests of the two sides would be guaranteed," he
noted.

Tanzanian president Mwalimu Julius Nyerere on his efforts towards
promoting negotiations between warring factions since the last
regional summit on Burundi.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere told the summit that he had received a letter from the
Burundian military leader, Major Pierre Buyoya, saying he was
ready for peace talks with all the rival parties.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Leonard Nyangoma, chairman of the major rival
Burundian National Council for Defence and Democracy (CNDD), was
reported to deliver a similar message to the summit, saying he
was ready to enter into open negotiations with the Burundian
military junta.
</P>
<P>
A joint communique issued today at the end of the summit held
in Arusha, Northern Tanzania, said a ministerial delegation would
soon be sent to Bujumbura to evaluate the situation and its
recommendations would form the basis for the next move.
</P>
<P>
The official "Daily News" newspaper quoted the communique as
saying that the summit has directed preparatory phase of the
talks to start immediately.
</P>
<P>
The strong-worded communique warned that appropriate measures
would be taken against any group refusing to take part in or
blocking peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The summit, which evaluated the implementation of the
sanctions imposed on Burundi since July 31 this year, lauded the
solidarity shown in the region in economic embargo.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions were designed to avert imminent human disaster,
especially after the July 25 military coup led by Major Pierre
Buyoya, the communique said.
</P>
<P>
The summit, convened by Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa,
was attended by presidents Daniel arap Moi of Kenya, Yoweri
Museveni of Uganda, Pasteur Bizimungu of Rwanda and Frederick
Chiluba of Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Also in attendance were Zairean Prime Minister Kengo wa dondo,
OAU Secretary General Salim Ahmed Salim and Ethiopean Prime
Minister Meles Zenawi.
</P>
<P>
The current OAU Chairman, President Paul Biya of Cameroun, was
represented by External Relations Minister Ferdinand Leopold
Oyono.

Moussa reiterated here today that his country supports the
re-election of U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali for a

<HEADLINE> Hutu Rebels Kill 40 Villagers in Burundi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Hutu rebels killed 40 villagers
in Burundi's southwest province of Bururi Friday, said spokesman
of the Burundian army Lieutenant-Colonel Isaie Nibizi in the
Burundian capital of Bujumbura today.
</P>
<P>
"The attack took place in the commune of Burambi. They killed
and burned the houses. The victims were mostly those who could not
flee, as women, children and the elderly," said Isaie Nibizi
quoted by Agence France Presse (AFP). Burambi is about 50
kilometers south of Bujumbura.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Radio Burundi said that many of the houses in the
village were burned down, and cattle were taken away by the
attackers.
</P>
<P>
Most of the inhabitants of the village have fled to the town of
Rumonge, about 20 kilometers further south, to hide near the
positions of the army, said the radio report.
</P>
<P>
This is one of the most atrocious massacres of civilians by
Hutus rebels that was ever reported by the official radio since
the military coup took place in the tiny central African state on
July 25, which brought to power Major Pierre Buyoya, an ethnic
Tutsi.
</P>
<P>
The army spokesman also confirmed that government troops have
been carrying out a hunting operation against the rebels in the
province since the beginning of this week. But he did not provide
any figure of casualties.
</P>
<P>
"The situation is bad but the province is under control," said
the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The province of Bururi is the native province of most heads of
state who have ruled Burundi since its independence, and it is
also the native province of most Burundian army officers, most of
whom are Tutsis.
</P>
<P>
The announcement of the massacre came on the same day when the
heads of state of the countries neighboring Burundi were holding a
summit in Arusha, Tanzania, to consider lifting or maintaining
their economic sanctions imposed on Burundi since the military
coup.
</P>
<P>
The neighbors of Burundi imposed the sanctions two months ago
to push the Burundian military to return the country to
"constitutional order" and immediately start negotiations with the
Hutu rebels. Major Buyoya was not invited to the summit.
</P>
<P>
At least 150,000 people, most of them civilians, have been
killed in inter-ethnic violences between Hutus and Tutsis in the
past three years in Burundi.

<HEADLINE> Iran Rejects US Charges of Lacking Air Safety </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 12 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian government today
rejected charges by the U.S. Aviation Federation of lacking safety
in Iranian air corridors.
</P>
<P>
Ali Shahcherghi, head of the Iranian Civil Aviation Organization,
said that all Iranian air services are carried out in line
with standards set by the International Civil Aviation
Organization (ICAO).
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Aviation Federation said in an article published by
Herald Tribune International on September 23 that the Iranian
air corridors failed to accord with safety standards.
</P>
<P>
It was said that Iran's national flag carrier faces some
problems in maintaining American passenger jetliners due to
the embargo imposed on the Islamic republic by the United States.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian airline company has to purchase spare parts at
a cost at least two or three times higher than that other clients
in the world usually pay.
</P>
<P>
However, Shahcherghi noted that such baseless charges are
emanated from the U.S. hostile attitude toward Iran.
</P>
<P>
He asserted that the new conspiracy of the U.S. to defame the
Iranian air corridors is doomed as other ones in the past.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian air traffic is controlled by modern and advanced
devices and very experienced and skilled manpower are working to
guide at least 70 international airlines through over 50 air
corridors, the Iranian official said.

BELGRADE, October 12 (Xinhua) -- About 100 U.S. infantry troops
and 28 vehicles on the NATO-led peace Implementation Force (IFOR)
in Bosnia continued their withdrawal into a U.S. army base in
Germany today.
</P>
<P>
The withdrawal of U.S. troops began Wednesday, when the first
200 troops left Bosnia where they had kept peace since last
December.
</P>
<P>
About 400 U.S. troops have left Bosnia this week, the Tanjug
news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
There are more than 15,000 U.S. troops among the 52,000-strong
NATO-led multinational IFOR who were deployed in Bosnia under the
Dayton peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
Most U.S. troops, with their headquarters in the Muslim town of
Tuzla, are deployed in northeastern Bosnia on lines of separation
between the two entities -- Republika Srpska and the Muslim-Croat
Federation.
</P>
<P>
The IFOR's one-year mission is supposed to end on December 20.
NATO officials have favored to keep part of the IFOR in Bosnia
next year to safeguard the fragile peace in the country where
three main ethnic groups are still in deep hostility.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. IFOR spokesman said the troops and equipment would first
go to the U.S. military base in the Hungarian town of Taszar and

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Jordan To Press Israel To Honor Accords </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Jordan has pledged to press
Israel to honor and duly implement all the agreements it has
signed with the Arabs to salvage the faltering Middle East
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's Ambassador to Israel Omar Rifai was instructed to
meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Wednesday to
reiterate his country's uncompromising demand for implementation
of the Oslo accord, signed by Israel and the Palestinians in 1993.
</P>
<P>
He is also expected to convey his country's message to the
Israeli leader that the worst crisis in the Jordanian-Israeli
relations since the two countries concluded a peace treaty two
years ago will not be resolved unless Israel lives up to all its
commitments with the Arabs.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador contributed last month's Israeli-Palestinian
violence which killed more than 70 people to the deteriorating
situation in the Palestinian territories, which are under a
seven-month Israeli tight siege. Israel announced Friday the
closure would be eased as of Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Jordan believes that Israel has continued its policy of
expanding settlements in the Palestinian lands, and violated the
holy Islamic shrine of the Al Aqsa Mosque by opening a tunnel near
it, in addition to its refusal to redeploy troops from the West
Bank town of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Amman has repeatedly rejected Israeli efforts to renegotiate
the accords signed between its previous Labor-led government and
the Arab parties, and demanded that these accords be implemented to
the letter immediately.
</P>
<P>
After Israel opened last month the archaeological tunnel under
the Al Aqsa Mosque compound in Arab East Jerusalem, which
triggered the worst bloody confrontation in 30 years between
Israeli security forces and the Palestinians, Jordan lodged a
strong official protest against the Israeli government for failing
to inform Amman in advance.
</P>
<P>
Under the peace accord signed between the two countries in
1994, Israel recognized the kingdom's "special role" in the
Islamic holy places in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's foreign affairs advisor Dore Gold visited Jordan on
September 23, one day before Israel opened the controversial
tunnel, but did not inform Jordan of the impending tunnel
opening, officials here said.
</P>
<P>
Jordan saw the move as a unilateral Israeli effort to impose
sovereignty over Arab East Jerusalem in violation of the
reached agreements.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein publicly demanded last week that Israel honor all
its agreements with the Palestinians and warned that the Jewish
state's failure to do so would jeopardize all progress
achieved in the Arab-Israeli peacemaking, including the peace
treaties Egypt and Jordan have signed with the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
The king refused to rule out the possibility of renewed
Arab-Israeli hostilities if the peace process remained stalled.
</P>
<P>
"In the current situation, if we do not strive strongly
forward to achieve peace, everything imaginable can happen..."
said the Jordanian monarch.
</P>
<P>
In his strong-worded comments, King Hussein demanded that
Netanyahu treat Palestinian National Authority President Yasser
Arafat as an equal partner in peace and "not one who is of a
lower level that he has to look down upon."
</P>
<P>
During the Washington summit last week, King Hussein
criticized Netanyahu for having shown an "arrogance of power" and
called the crisis triggered by the Israeli moves in Jerusalem "a
success for extremists and warmongers."
</P>
<P>
The monarch, seen as Netanyahu's closest Arab friend, also
said that he was "deeply disappointed" by the Israeli prime
minister's hardline stance towards the Palestinians.

The eclipse lasted for more than two hours starting from 3:31

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Jordan To Press Israel To Honor Accords </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul Karim Kabariti confirmed last
Thursday that "there is a crisis" in relations with Israel.
</P>
<P>
"The situation in the Palestinian territories has grown to a
level where all possibilities are now being considered," the
prime minister warned.
</P>
<P>
"If these possibilities develop into further violence, then
everybody will suffer and will pay the price," he added.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said Israel's failure to implement the
accords it has signed with the Palestinians will "definitely
have a detrimental effect" on all the relations that Israel
has managed to build with its Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Rifai told Jordan Times that the responsibility for
resolving the current crisis in ties falls fully on Israel.
</P>
<P>
"The ball is on the Israeli court," said the ambassador, adding
"Netanyahu has to show sincerity and determination."
</P>
<P>
Other officials here have also indicated that Jordan would
accept nothing but the swift implementation of the
Israeli-Palestinian accords and a quick move to negotiations on
the final status of the West Bank and Gaza Strip as stipulated
in the Oslo agreements.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the getting-tougher Jordanian stance has apparently
worried the Israeli leadership, which met Wednesday to discuss the
brewing crisis with Jordan.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to defuse the crisis, Netanyahu was planning to
send his senior advisor Dore Gold to Jordan to discuss the issue,
reports here said.
</P>
<P>
Political observers here noted that Israel seemed to have
been jolted by the strong reaction from Jordan and was now seeking
to contain the situation.
</P>
<P>
Playing down the rift with the kingdom, Netanyahu said
Tuesday that the differences with Jordan "could happen to
the best of relationship" and described it as "a normal
disagreement between friends such as one finds in every family."
</P>
<P>
Mustafah Hamarneh, director of the Strategic Studies Center at
the University of Jordan, said the kingdom's relations with
Israel would have been seen in a positive sense both domestically
and in the Arab world, had Jordan been able to positively
influence Israel's policy.
</P>
<P>
But it was also believed here that the relations "have become a
burden" on the kingdom regarding the current overall situation in
the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's opposition parties demanded recently that the kingdom
annul the peace treaty with Israel, "kick out" the Israeli
ambassador in Amman and prepare the people for "jihad" (Holy War)
against Israel.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that the more public and intense the
strain becomes in the Jordanian-Israeli ties, the stronger the
opposition in the kingdom will be to the process of normalization
with Israel.
</P>
<P>
They said the continued stalemate on the Palestinian track of
the negotiations will help the opposition in its drive to
slow down if not end the process of normalization.
</P>
<P>
It was believed that Jordan will take advantage of
Israel's keenness on improving its relations with Jordan to
press Israel to go ahead with the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The planned visits to Amman by Israeli President Ezer Weizman
and Netanyahu's advisor Gold will be right forums for Jordan
to exert its influences.

<HEADLINE> Pollution Blamed for Massive Fishkill in Manila Bay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Wanton dumping of garbage and
toxic waste are the principal cause of the recent sudden death of
tons of fish in Manila Bay, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Senator Heherson Alvarez, vice president for southeast Asia of
the Advisory Committee of the Seas, said the contaminants that
killed the fish are possibly chemical effluents discharged by an
industry along a drainage canal that leads to the bay.
</P>
<P>
As a result, a specific geographic area of the bay was
polluted, he said.
</P>
<P>
There are 22 such drainage canals leading to Manila Bay. It
was reported that pollution brought about by these canals has
become very serious in the Philippines, causing fatal diseases
like red tide and dengue fever which have killed dozens of people
in the country this year.
</P>
<P>
"The poisoning of our water bodies comes from the land and
unless we recast the bad community habit of garbage dumping into
our esteros (canals) and bodies of water, our rivers, bays and
inland lakes will continue to be polluted as they already are
slowly dying," Alvarez said.
</P>
<P>
However, the bureau of fisheries and aquatic resources blamed
biological changes in the environment, brought about by the
spillage of toxic chemicals and global warming, for the death of
thousands of fish in the bay. The bureau warned the public
against eating the fish caught in the bay because they might be
toxic.
</P>
<P>
Philippine President Fidel Ramos has ordered government
agencies to investigate the incident and take prompt measures to
solve the problem.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 13 (Xinhua) -- China's aviation industry has
the overseas market in its sight, aiming to realize 1.8 billion US
dollars in export earnings in the year 2000, today's China Daily
reported.
</P>
<P>
"We are concentrating our efforts on the development of
technology-intensive and high value-added products," said Liu
Jingzhang, vice-director of the export office of Aviation
Industries of China (Avic).
</P>
<P>
The state extended five billion US dollars in loans to the
industry, mainly used for technical renovation and product upgrade
in commercial airplane and non-aviation production.
</P>
<P>
Avic, a national industrial corporation under the State
Council, exported 3.5 billion US dollars worth of airplanes,
machinery and electrical products during the past five years.
</P>
<P>
A total of 77 regional, medium-range, transport and general-use
aircraft were delivered to customers abroad, 66 of which were the
multi-purpose Y-12 series aircraft.
</P>
<P>
"It has been hard for us to shift our core business from
military to commercial airplanes," Liu said. "Safety, comfort and
huge capital injection requirements to build civilian-use planes
are much more rigorous than for military aircraft."
</P>
<P>
The two billion US dollars' project to produce a 100-seat
medium-range passenger plane is expected to be initiated soon
after Avic's formal signature of a contract with its Western
partners and Singapore next month.
</P>
<P>
Subcontracted production of aviation components and parts
throughout the last decade has sharpened substantially the
competitive edge of the industry in terms of technical level,
management skills and delivery date.
</P>
<P>
Avic's subsidiaries, which are located in Shanghai, Chengdu,
Xi'an and Shenyang, are likely to win more orders through
specialized production, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
During the past five years, sales of at least 5,000 kinds of
civilian-use products posted a turnover of 51.6 billion yuan (6.2
billion US dollars), contributing 70 percent of Avic's overall
business. Export earnings from them, however, accounts for only 30
percent of the industry's total.

<P>
MANILA, October 13 (Xinhua) -- the following are Philippine
business news in brief:
</P>
<P>
-- Total car sales in the Philippines in the first nine months
of 1996 rose by 26 percent to 65,421 units compared with 51,788
units in the same period of 1995, preliminary data from the
Chamber of Automotive Manufacturers of the Philippines show.
Japanese car assemblers continued to dominate the market, led by
Honda with 15,008 vehicles. This was followed by Toyota Motor
Philippines Corp., with sales of 14,105, Mitsubishi Motors with
11,244 units and Nissan Motor Philippines Inc., with 9,283.
</P>
<P>
-- The Philippine government will not have a problem in
ensuring a healthy fiscal position next year even without the tax
reform program, said a paper prepared by economists of the
university of Asia and the Pacific. The paper said the bulk of
the growth in revenues next year would come from the stronger
gross national product and not from the comprehensive tax reform
program.
</P>
<P>
-- Sales of the Philippines' manufacturing sector for the first
seven months of the year increased by eight percent to 213 billion
pesos (8.12 billion U.S. dollars) from the 198 billion pesos (7.55
billion dollars) a year earlier, records from the Department of
Trade and Industry said.
</P>
<P>
-- The PHilippines' future cement demand will grow at an
average of 19 percent until the year 2000 and will be the
strongest in 1998 when several infrastructure projects are
expected to be in full swing or near completion, according to a
study by Peregrine Securities Philippines Inc.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Official Hope for More Sino-Indonesian Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's ambassador in
Beijing said he is not satisfied with the current level of trade
between China and Indonesia, given the great potential in
bilateral trade, according to today's China Daily "Business
Weekly".
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Juwana noted that Sino-Indonesian trade accounted
for only two percent of China's total trade and four percent of
Indonesia's total last year.
</P>
<P>
Such trade volume does not accord with the massive and
prosperous economies of the two countries, he said, attributing
the low trade figure in part to lack of understanding between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
Although "not as good as expect", Sino-Indonesian trade grew
steadily from 1991 to 1995, with an average annual growth of 16
per cent. In 1991, bilateral trade was 1.88 billion but
jumped to 3.49 billion U.S. Dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Indonesia exports oil, gas, wood, pulp, textiles,
materials, palm oil and rubber to China, while it imports Chinese
iron and steel, chemicals, machinery, vegetables and fruits.

<HEADLINE> Slovakia to Hold Referendum on NATO, EU Membership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, October 12 (Xinhua) -- The Slovak government has
decided to hold a referendum in February next year on the
country's possible admission to the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) and the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here today quoted Vice Chairman of the
National Council (parliament) Jan Luptat as saying that the
decision was made as differences on the issue are growing among
the Slovaks.
</P>
<P>
The three-party coalition government has listed a full
intergation with NATO and the EU as a priority of its
administrative program.
</P>
<P>
However, only one of the three ruling parties, the Movement for
Democratic Slovakia, explicitly supports the government's efforts
in joining the two organizations.
</P>
<P>
Other parties, including the other two ruling parties, the
Slovak Democratic Party and the Workers' Party, are either
ambiguous on or opposed to the admissions.
</P>
<P>
Latest poll shows that Slovaks in general are more interested
in joining the EU than NATO. While 43 percent of those questioned
said they would support a NATO membership, most Slovaks are
strongly against NATO's deployment of nuclear weapons on their
territory.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Intelsat, the world's largest
provider of commercial satellite communication services plans to
increase its business in China, reported today's China Daily
Business Weekly.
</P>
<P>
China had a potentially huge telecommunication market and was
an important customer of Intelsat, said Irving Goldstein,
director-general and chief executive officer of the International
Satellite Telecommunication Organization (Intelsat).
</P>
<P>
He said that China would become the fifth shareholder of
Intelsat after it resumed the exercise of sovereignty over Hong
Kong on July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The latest services of Intelsat for Asia include compressed
digital video and thinroute demand assignment multiple access
(Dama). China has already built some Dama hub stations.
</P>
<P>
In October 1992, the Beijing Trucking, Telemetry, Command and
Monitoring Station and TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access)
Reference and Monitoring Station (TRMS) for the Intelsat system
were completed.
</P>
<P>
As for the co-operation between China and Intelsat on satellite
launching, Goldstein said he was confident that the Long March
problems would be investigated and resolved quickly and hoped that
its market would soon get back on track.
</P>
<P>
Last February, the Long March 3B of the China Great Wall
Industry Corp failed to sent Intelsat's 708 orbitor into orbit.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 13 (Xinhua) -- China National Chemical
Construction Corporation (CNCCC) chose to export technology and
equipment and import of bulk liquefied chemicals and rubber, as
part of its effort to pursue trade efficiency and profits.
</P>
<P>
According to today's "Business Weekly", The company, whose
trade volume ranked 29th among top 500 foreign trade enterprises
in the country last year, however, has been suffering from low
economic efficiency.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of this year, reduction in reimbursement
rates, rise in foreign exchange rates, tight credit policy
implemented in infrastructure construction and inflated prices of
raw materials have combined to impede CNCCC's exports.
</P>
<P>
To tackle the problem, the company tightened imports, used
capital mainly for exports of priority products, and strengthened
management in every step to decrease costs.
</P>
<P>
Acting as import agents for local enterprises has also helped
to increase its market share.
</P>
<P>
In the first eight months of this year, CNCCC managed to
exports 150 million U.S. dollars worth of products and equipment,
of which 12 items exceeded 500,000 U.S. dollars each and five
items worthed one million U.S. dollars each.
</P>
<P>
Over the past five years, the company posted trade volume worth
3.2 billion U.S. dollars, of which exports amounted to 744 million
us dollars.
</P>
<P>
Earnings from overseas contracted projects and labour service
netted 185 million during the same period.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 12 (Xinhua) -- The Russian government is
willing to compromise with the parliament so as to get the 1997
budget passed, Finance Minister Alexander Livshits said today.
</P>
<P>
The State Duma (lower house of parliament) rejected the budget
at the first reading on Friday, on the ground that the budget
revenue and expenditure were not balanced and that the measures
proposed were inadequate to reactivate the industrial and social
programs.
</P>
<P>
Livshits said that while the government is ready to consider
the views of the deputies, it is prepared to compromise only on
some issues and stick to the main targets.
</P>
<P>
The main targets include a 1 percent growth of the gross
domestic product (GDP), a budget deficit equivalent to 3.3 percent
of GDP and a money supply equivalent to 15 percent of GDP.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that a special presidential commission will be
set up to help implement the tax policy. Latest statistics show
that tax payment in arrears by companies totalled 14 billion
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Philippine Gov't to Help Maid in Malaysia Rape Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 13 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government is
ready to help a Filipino maid pursue charges of rape she has filed
in Malaysia against a Croatian diplomat following his reported
dismissal this week, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Oscar Valenzuela, spokesman for the Department of Foreign
Affairs, said that the reported dismissal of Croatian Ambassador
to Malaysia Kresimir Znidaric paves the way for his prosecution.
</P>
<P>
"If the report is true, then it is to our advantage,"
Valenzuela said. But he added that it is still unclear whether the
Croatian government merely recalled Znidaric or totally dismissed
him from the foreign service.
</P>
<P>
Press reports from Zagreb said the Croatian Foreign Ministry
announced the "dismissal" of Znidaric immediately after he was
charged with raping and sexually molesting Filipino maid Ma Fe
Ocampo four times between April 11 and August 23 this year.
Znidaric denied the charges.
</P>
<P>
Ocampo, 27, filed the charges before a Malaysian court earlier
this week and claimed at a press conference that the diplomat
threatened to kill her if she told anyone.
</P>
<P>
The reports said Croatian President Franjo Tudjman planned to
relieve Znidaric of his duties and recall him because of
inefficiency on December 31 this year, but in the light of the
charges against him, the decision takes effect immediately.

<HEADLINE> Finland to Join European Exchange Rate Mechanism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, Oct 12 (Xinhua) -- The Finnish government announced
this evening that the country's currency markka will join the
European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, the EU Monetary Committee meeting in Brussels,
agreed to link Finnish markka to ERM, which is designed to
maintain monetary stability among member states on the way to a
single European currency.
</P>
<P>
This is a move taken by the Finnish government to meet the
fiscal and financial criteria specified in the Maastricht Treaty
for joining the European Economic and Monetary Union.
</P>
<P>
Finland is preparing for entering the third stage of the
economic and monetary union so that it could become the first
group of countries to join the union on the target date of January
1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Entry into ERM, the government said, will help ensure the
country's economic stability, improve employment, enhance the
competitiveness of Finnish enterprises, and attract more
investments.
</P>
<P>
Currency stability is a criterion for the launching in 1999 of
the single European currency. The Finnish markka will be allowed
to fluctuate by up to 15 percent against the other currencies,
which is the normal margin of fluctuation in ERM.

<P>
JAKARTA, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Forty people are now being
interrogated following rioting that killed five in the East Java
town of Situbondo on Thursday, East Java Governor Basofi Sudirman
said in the province's capital of Malang on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"The mass riots last Thursday were a pure ethnic, religious,
racial and inter-group differences case," Antara news agency today
quoted the governor as saying.
</P>
<P>
Some 3,000 people ran amok, damaging offices, schools, shops
and churches.
</P>
<P>
The incident followed a prosecutor's decision to demand five
years imprisonment for a Muslim who was found guilty of making a
blasphemy on Islam. The people who were expecting a death penalty
for him were angered by the decision and took to the streets.
</P>
<P>
Basofi said the situation in Situbondo, some 800 km east of
Jakarta, had been back to normal although several shops remained
closed.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the central government had expressed regret over the
riots and pledged to take measures against those involved in the
riots.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia needs to prepare
industrial design and engineering in anticipation of global
markets, a senior official said.
</P>
<P>
Coordinating Minister for Production and Distribution Hartarto
said Saturday in Bandung, capital of West Java province, that only
with industrial design and engineering, Indonesian businesses
would be able to play an active role in the global markets,
according to reports reaching here today from Bandung.
</P>
<P>
He said the industrial sector, the backbone of the national
economy, must keep up with the developments of applied design and
engineering technology.
</P>
<P>
"Major industries must pay attention to the fact that in global
markets where competition is stiff, efficiency in production is
the key to winning competition," Hartarto said.
</P>
<P>
Hartarto said that out of the 6,000 large and medium-sized
businesses in the country, only about 200 are equipped with
applied research and development centers.
</P>
<P>
He said incentives could help businesses achieve a success in
developing applied research and development centers.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he added, the government would continue to improve
its fiscal policy for the business world along with its
deregulation drive such as tariff reduction and elimination of
tariff and non-tariff barriers.

NEW DELHI, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Four more people have died of

Given the figures available from 17 hospitals, experts have

Delhi Health Minister Harsh Vardhan has said that the
government has taken various measures to deal with the dreaded
disease. More than 200 people have been fined for not cleaning
their coolers. Coolers are considered the favorite breeding haunt

The disease is marked by high fever, which does not come down
for four or five days. Fever accompanies severe ache in the head,
eyes, muscles and joints.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka, Delhi to Hold Ministers' Talks on Water Sharing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh and India will resume
talks on the Ganges water sharing issue at the Foreign Ministers'
level in New Delhi next month, according to informed sources in
the Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The date for the talks is yet to be fixed and they would be a
follow-up of the discussion Bangladeshi Foreign Minister Abdus
Samad Azad had with his Indian counterpart I K Gujral when the
latter visited Dhaka early last month.
</P>
<P>
During Gujral's visit, the two ministers agreed to sign a
permanent agreement on the due share of Ganges water before the
next lean season beginning January.
</P>
<P>
Samad was quoted as saying that there will be no change in the
agreed principle on the sharing of waters between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Joint efforts by India and Bangladesh to resolve the water
sharing issue concerning not only the Ganges but also all other
transnational rivers would continue, said the Foreign Minister.
</P>
<P>
As many as 54 common rivers, including the Ganges, are flowing
between Bangladesh and India.
</P>
<P>
Due to the ever reducing water flow from India, salinity
affected water in the Ganges area has caused significant damage to
crop production, fishery and people's health.
</P>
<P>
Bangladeshi Water Resources Minister Abdur Razzak is also
scheduled to visit India from October 28 and discuss the water
issue with his Indian counterpart.
</P>
<P>
Besides, an India experts' team will visit Dhaka prior to the
visit of Razzak.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine Criticizes Lebed's Remarks on Sevastopol </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine said today that the
remarks on the status of the port of Sevastopol made by Russian
Security Council Secretary Alexander Lebed run counter to his
country's commitments to Ukraine and the norms of international
law.
</P>
<P>
Lebed said in an open letter to the Russian public that
Sevastopol, a port city on the Crimean peninsula, "has never been
ceded to Ukraine and has never lost its legal status of being
Russian," according to reports from UNIAN, a local wire service.
</P>
<P>
Lebed said that as both Russia and Ukraine have territorial
claims on Sevastopol, the negotiations to divide the Black Sea
fleet should be stopped.
</P>
<P>
Sevastopol is the headquarters of the Black Sea fleet shared by
Russia and Ukraine after the former Soviet Union collapsed in 1991.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the Ukrainian foreign ministry said that
Lebed's remarks will further complicate the relations between the
two countries and destabilize the situation in the region.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said the formal stand taken by Russian President
Boris Yeltsin and the Ukrainian foreign ministry should not be
changed, which recognizes the Ukrainian status of Sevastopol and
calls for a constructive settlement of all the problems relating
to the division of the Black Sea fleet.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said it is disturbing that such territorial claims
against Ukraine was made by a senior official in charge of Russian
national security.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Stands For Continued Sanctions on Burundi: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Kenya stands for continued
sanctions against Burundi and does not recognize the military
regime which assumed power after a coup in the central African
country, President Daniel arap Moi said.
</P>
<P>
The President pointed out that it was imperative for
peace-loving people in east Africa to ensure that "unilateral
seizer of power for selfish ends did not succeed."
</P>
<P>
Moi was speaking at the regional summit on Burundi, held in
Arusha of Tanzania on Saturday, the Kenya News Agency reported
today.
</P>
<P>
He noted that though Major Pierre Buyoya of Burundi had lifted
the ban on political parties and restored the National Assembly,
he had not agreed to hold unconditional negotiations with the
rebel Hutu guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
So, Moi stressed, economic sanctions against the military
regime in Burundi must be maintained until the country was
restored to her rightful place among the community of nations.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated Kenya's commitment to the solution of Burundi
problem for sustainable peace to enable its people to rebuild
their own country.
</P>
<P>
Buyoya toppled the legitimate Burundi government on July 25
and its neighbors slammed an economic embargo on it in early
August.
</P>
<P>
The economic sanctions against Burundi imposed by East African
countries had received support from the East African community,
the United Nations and individual countries, the president said.

Chinese society and the country's advancement along economic
reform into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
The CPC released the full text of the Resolutions of the
Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee on Certain
Important Questions on Promoting Socialist Ethical and Cultural
Progress adopted by the Sixth Plenum of the 14th CPC Central
Committee.
</P>
<P>
The resolutions stress that the promotion of ethical and
cultural progress must be effectively raised to a still more
prominent position, and further create a new situation in ethical
and cultural progress under the country's current situation.
</P>
<P>
The document emerged from the Sixth Plenum of the 14th CPC
Central Committee, which was held in Beijing from October 7 to 10.
</P>
<P>
The resolutions comprise seven parts and thirty articles.
</P>
<P>
The seven parts are:
</P>
<P>
-- 1. Promoting socialist ethical and cultural progress is a
task of great strategical importance;
</P>
<P>
-- 2. The guidelines and objectives for socialist ethical and
cultural progress;
</P>
<P>
-- 3. Striving to improve the ideological and ethical quality
of the whole nation;
</P>
<P>
-- 4. Vigorously develop the cause of socialist culture;
</P>
<P>
-- 5. Carrying out mass activities to promote ethical and
cultural progress in an in-depth and sustained way;
</P>
<P>
-- 6. Taking effective measures to increase input in the
promotion of ethical and cultural progress; and
</P>
<P>
-- 7. Strengthening and improving Party leadership over
the promotion of ethical and cultural progress.
</P>
<P>
The resolutions stipulate that promoting socialist ethical and
cultural progress is vital to the all-round accomplishment of the
grand cross-century blueprint, and the prosperity of China's
socialist cause.
</P>
<P>
The document states: "We must effectively raise the promotion
of ethical and cultural progress to a still more prominent
position, earnestly solve a series of present urgent problems, and
further create a new situation in ethical and cultural progress
under the current new situation. This has already become a matter
of utmost importance that has drawn the extremely close attention
of the whole Party, and the people of various ethnic groups
throughout the country."
</P>
<P>
The resolutions define the guiding principle and the general
requirements for promoting socialist ethical and cultural progress
as taking Maxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, and Deng Xiaoping's
theory on building socialism with Chinese characteristics,
upholding the party's basic lines and principles and promoting
science, education, culture and ethical progress.
</P>
<P>
The resolutions call for efforts to be made to arm
people's minds with scientific theory, guide them in correct
public opinion, inspire them with excellent literary works, and
train socialist citizens with lofty ideals, moral integrity, a
good education and a strong sense of discipline. It is also
essential to raise the whole nation's level in the fields of moral
standard, science and culture, and unite and arouse people of
all ethnic groups, to turn China into a powerful, democratic,
civilized and modernized socialist country.
</P>
<P>
The resolutions note that the basic task for ideological and
ethical progress is: adhering to education in patriotism,
collectivism, and socialism, vigorously advancing progress in
social morality, professional ethics, and family virtues, and
guiding people to foster the common ideal of building socialism
with Chinese characteristics, and correct outlooks on the world,
life and values.
</P>
<P>
"We should encourage and support all ideologies and ethics that
are conducive to the emancipation and development of socialist
social productive forces, to national reunification, and unity of
all ethnic groups and social progress, to pursuance of the true,
the good and the beautiful, resistance of the false, the bad, and
the ugly, to the encouragement of healthy trends, and to the
performance of civil rights and obligations and endeavors for a
good life with honest work, so as to unify and guide the Chinese
people to make progress in an active way, and continuously improve
the ideological and ethical quality of the whole nation," adds the
document.
</P>
<P>
The resolutions state that the press should adhere to the
principles of the Party spirit, insisting on seeking truth from
fact, persist in positive publicity in favor of unity, stability
and boosting the morale of the people, and keep firmly to correct
orientation of public opinion. Publishing circles should build,
and perfect management mechanisms, endeavor to raise the quality
of publications, and try to produce more good works, while
preventing the production of bad work.
</P>
<P>
The resolutions suggest that ethical and cultural building
should be taken into account in the overall blueprint of economic
and social development, with a view to the overall situation of
socialist modernization, and with the guarantee of necessary
funds. A regular and effective fund-raising mechanism needs to be
set up in line with demands of the socialist market economy, so as
to gradually form a multi-channel input system for ethical and
cultural construction.
</P>
<P>
The resolutions stress that Party committees at all levels
must view material progress and ethical and cultural progress as a
unified objective of struggle, and draft plans together, implement
the plans together and check implementation together.
</P>
<P>
The resolutions point out that building a socialism with
Chinese characteristics is a great cause, and a new great
revolution, and in this revolution, members of the Chinese
Communist Party and the Chinese people are confident in, and
capable of transforming the subjective world, while transforming
the objective world and building a society with a high degree of
material progress.
</P>
<P>
The resolutions report that the plenum called on the whole
party, and people of all ethnic groups in China, to rally around
the Party Central Committee with President Jiang Zemin at the
core, hold high the great banner of building socialism with
Chinese characteristics, to have one mind by millions of people,
make pioneering achievements, work in a down-to-earth manner and
strive to turn China into a prosperous, democratic and civilized
socialist modernized country.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Bans Beef Imports From Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania has banned
imports of canned beef and other meat products from Britain where
the "bovine spongiform encephalopathy" (BSE) or mad cow disease
exists, according to a local newspaper today.
</P>
<P>
The ban of canned beef and animal feed supplements from five
European countries - Britain, Ireland, France, Switzerland and
Portugal is aimed at guarding the country from falling victim to
the BSE which can spread even through consuming canned beef.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Agriculture and cooperatives recently
directed the National Food Control Commission (NFCC) to destroy
and remove from shelves of supermarkets, all frozen beef and pork
imported from the five countries of the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
The directive said the ban is to try to contain possibilities
of some unscrupulous traders from the UK, using Tanzania and
other developing countries as dumping grounds of the British beef
products, banned too by the EU countries in March.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania's neighbors, Kenya and Uganda, suspended imports of
the beef products from the UK much earlier as a precautionary
measure.

<HEADLINE> World Bank to Continue Support for Nepal's Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, October 13 (Xinhua) -- World Bank President James
Wolfensohn has assured Nepal that the bank will continue its
support for the country's infrastructure development despite its
earlier decision to scrap a major hydro project in Nepal.
</P>
<P>
Winding up a four-day visit to Nepal, Wolfensohn told reporters
here Saturday that his bank would work in partnership with the
Nepali government and fulfill its commitment to the all-round
development of the country.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the funding work for a large-scale hydro power
project in preparation jointly by Nepal and India, the World Bank
chief stressed the role of the private sector, which he said has
become the principal source of financing for such big projects.
</P>
<P>
The 6,480-megawatt Pancheshwar project on Nepal's western
border river with India is expected to cost 10 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
"I will have talks on the matter after I go to India,"
Wolfensohn said before his departure for India Saturday.
</P>
<P>
On the bank's decision in April 1995 to withdraw its support
for the 750-million-dollar Arun III hydro power project in east
Nepal, Wolfensohn said the bank will carry out rural development
programs for the benefit of local residents in the project site,
about 200 km east of Kathmandu.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank had supported the 402-megawatt project for about
seven years from its preliminary stage but suddenly dumped it last
year, citing what it said the project's high financial and
environmental risks.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank president also pledged the bank's support to the
development of various sectors like primary education, health,
agriculture and tourism in Nepal.
</P>
<P>
During his four-day stay in Nepal, Wolfensohn met with King
Birendra, Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba and senior government
and opposition leaders.

<HEADLINE> Science Important for Developing Africa: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 13 (Xinhua) -- There can be no meaningful
discussion of sustainable development in Africa without
emphasizing the pivotal role of science and technology in the
process.
</P>
<P>
The view was expressed by Professor Andrew Siwela,
Vice-Chancellor of the University of Zambia, during the first
anniversary of the Association for Students in Science, Economics
and Commerce in Lusaka, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Siwela noted that Africa is in a development crisis which can
only be contained if the role of science and technology in the
rapid and sustainable development of the continent is recognized.
</P>
<P>
However, he expressed the regret that many meetings have been
held on the role of science and technology for sustainable
development and that some of these fora have been attended by
political leaders and other policy makers and resolutions have
been adopted but there has been no impact on the development of
the continent.

<HEADLINE> Norway Thanked for Aid to Tanzania's Road </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Frederick
Sumaye has thanked Norway for its financial and material support
which he said has immensely improved the road network in
Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said this at the weekend when he officially
inaugurated the 110-kilometer North-East Corridor road network,
linking Same-Himo-Holili and Himo-Marangu in Kilimanjaro Region,
Northern Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
According to a local newspaper today, Sumaye said Norway has
so far donated 81 billion Tanzania Shillings (about 135 million
U.S. Dollars) toward rehabilitation and construction of roads in
several areas of Tanzania since 1991.
</P>
<P>
He said the government would see to it that the roads under
Norwegian assistance are regularly maintained.
</P>
<P>
"This project is only part of numerous landmarks that stand
out as a testimony of cooperation between our two countries,"
Sumaye said, adding, "we value this cooperation and we will
strive to ensure that it continues to grow."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the prime minister urged Tanzanians who have been
working in the project to learn from good workmanship of the road
contractors in order to carry out regular maintenance of the road
project.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, speaking during the occasion, Norwegian Ambassador to
Tanzania Nils-Johala Jorgensen said the 35.4 million U.S. Dollar
road project which was completed in November last year, was the
largest undertaken by Norway through Norwegian contractors -
NOREMCO.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 13 (Xinhua) -- The 15th meeting of a local
Thai-Myanmar border committee has been postponed indefinitely as
the Myanmar side claimed that Thailand failed to submit its agenda
to the meeting, a report said here today.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar authorities in Myawaddy informed their Thai
counterparts of their decision to postpone the meeting before it
was scheduled to take place on Saturday in Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
The two sides had agreed that they would submit their
respective agendas to the committee three days before the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Thailand planned to raise the issue of border incursions by
Myanmar minority armed groups which frequently crossed the
Thai-Myanmar border to carry out raids on Thai soil, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Myanmar authorities have accused Thailand of
allowing the Karen National Union to use Thai territory as a base
for operations to attack their troops.
</P>
<P>
Cross-border trade is also to be discussed if the two sides
re-open their talks.

<HEADLINE> Israel Further Eases Closure on Palestinian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Israel took big steps
today to further ease closure on the Palestinian territories
in an effort to defuse the brewing tension.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with an order given by Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai last week, 25,000 Palestinian workers, 10,000 from the
West Bank and 15,000 from the Gaza Strip, were allowed into Israel
to seek jobs. About 14,000 Palestinians had been allowed into
Israel before the new decision was made.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this morning, Palestinian workers formed long queues
at the Israeli checkpoints waiting for strict security checks
before entering Israel.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai ordered tight security checks to prevent the
infiltration of potential terrorists. Israeli security forces
were keeping high vigilance against possible unrest.
</P>
<P>
The Karni and Sufa Crossings were also reopened in order
to ease the movement of goods in and out of the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
Businessmen, workers for international organizations,
Israel-based diplomats and Palestinian officials were also
allowed to travel between the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the internal closure imposed on West Bank towns
were lifted to allow free flow of personnel and goods,
except for the town of Nablus which was still surrounded by
Israeli tanks.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian authorities in Nablus held talks Saturday with
senior Israeli army commander Uzi Dayan to warn that the
situation was on the brink of explosion because of the
continued closure and presence of Israeli tanks.
</P>
<P>
Israeli tanks were deployed late last month around Nablus
after Palestinian gunmen and protesters killed six Israeli
soldiers who tried to rescue their comrades trapped in the
Jewish holy site of Joseph's tomb.
</P>
<P>
The full closure imposed after the bloodshed late last
month was eased the week before in a good-will gesture to
facilitate the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Israel's new steps were aimed at creating a better
atmosphere for the talks and at easing the worsening economic
situation in the territories, which was one of the main causes
for the recent violence.
</P>
<P>
However, the overall closure imposed in 1994 that has barred
most of the two million Palestinians from entering Israel remains
in place. As a result of the closure, the unemployment rate in
the Palestinian territories is running as high as 50 percent and
the Palestinian fledgling economy suffers a daily loss of six
million dollars.

KUALA LUMPUR, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Alexander Kolukhov, an
Uzbekistan soccer player, was found dead early Sunday on the
pavement in front of the apartment block where he lived in
Malaysia's northeastern Trengganu state, police said.

<HEADLINE> Reserve Armymen Criticize Netanyahu for Destroying </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Thirty three reserve armymen
from Israeli combat units Saturday night sent a letter to Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, criticizing his hardline policies and
warning that they were harming morale of the soldiers, Israel
Radio reported Today.
</P>
<P>
"To our sorrow, since you took office, we get the
impression that you are making every effort to drag us into
an unjustified war and to melt any chance for peace," the
letter said.
</P>
<P>
"In light of the recent developments, we are losing our
fighting spirit, without which we don't see how we can function,"
it added
</P>
<P>
The 33, who signed the letter, said that they were proud
to do their share for the nation's defense, but could only
maintain their morale if they were assured the government was
doing all it could to prevent war.
</P>
<P>
The armymen were of the rank of captain, lieutenant,
staff-sergeant and sergeant. They said they do not belong to
any organizations.
</P>
<P>
In response, Deputy Minister of Education Moshe Peled said
that those, who signed the letter, should give up their
ranks and stop serving in the army, according to the report.

<HEADLINE> All Market Indicators Fall at Dhaka Stock Exchange </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Market indicators at the Dhaka
Stock Exchange (DSE) fell sharply Saturday, the first day of
implementation of the "circuit breaker" system on the fast growing
capital market.
</P>
<P>
A large number of share holders rushed to the DSE to sell their
shares, causing a fall in the all share price index and the market
capitalization, according to DSE sources.
</P>
<P>
The all share price index declined by 106 points to 1,934.40
points from 2,024.43 on Thursday, the closing day of the last
trading week.
</P>
<P>
The market capitalization also dropped by more than 157 million
U.S. dollars and closed at 3.38 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
DSE Chairman Imtiaz Hosain attributed the sudden fall in the
index to the instant reaction of the circuit breaker system
imposed on Thursday by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the
watchdog of this country's capital market.
</P>
<P>
Under the system, the price of any company's share is not
allowed to rise or fall by more than 10 percent compared to the
previous day's closing rate.
</P>
<P>
The government adopted this system following an unprecedented
bullish market in the main bourse. The all share price of the DSE
rose up to more than 2,000 points from 1,000 points just two
months ago.

<P>
TEHRAN, October 13 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian authorities are
planning to file lawsuits against European companies for supplying
Iraq with chemical weapons during the eight-year war between the
two neighbors, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Persian daily Iran quoted Mir-Feisal Bagherzadeh, head of
Iranian MIAs Committee, as saying that the supply of chemical
weapons to Baghdad during the 1980-1988 Iraq-Iran war was
violation of international laws.
</P>

However, the report did not specify the names of the
European companies. Well-informed sources said that two German
companies provided 90 percent of the chemical weapons to
Iraq during the later half of the war.
</P>

Bagherzadeh, also an Iranian brigadier general, said that Iran
is currently involved in determining the number of Western
companies that provided Iraq with chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
He said many Iranian combatants were killed in various
operations in which Iraq used chemical weapons on the
battlefields.
</P>
<P>
Iran accused Iraq of using chemical weapons in the Kurdish
city of Halabja in 1988.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka to Negotiate With IMF for 600m Dollars Loan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh is to start
negotiations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to gain a
balance of payment support worth 600 million U.S. dollars under
the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facilities (ESAF).
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Shah Ams Kibria disclosed this on Saturday
after concluding a visit to Washington where he attended a meeting
of the Board of Governors of the World Bank-IMF group.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh had received 300 million SDR (special drawing
rights), the equivalent of 450 million U.S. dollars, under the
first ESAF in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Kibria said that during his meeting with IMF Managing Director
Michael Camdessus, he had raised the second ESAF issue with him.
</P>
<P>
Kibria said there would be no immediate need to seek a balance
of payment support, but "We are interested to keep our options
open and trying to be prepared for every situation."
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh's foreign exchange reserve now stands at 1.996
billion U.S. dollars and it would reach 2.3 billion U.S. dollars
at the end of the current fiscal year, according to Kibria, who is
also governor of the Bangladesh Bank.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Washington, Kibria also met with World Bank
President James Wolfensohn. Both sides emphasized on project
implementation and increases of aid disbursement, the finance
minister said.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 5.6 billion U.S. dollars in committed aid remained in
the pipe line. "We should now give all our efforts to increase the
disbursement," said Kibria.

<HEADLINE> Higher Risk of Bronchiolitis for Bottle-fed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Bottle-fed babies are
significatnly at higher risk than breast-fed ones for getting
bronchiolitis, a hospital's new research said today.
</P>
<P>
The research was conducted by Dr. Mali Unger in Jerusalem's
Shaare Zedek Hospital under the guidance of Dr. Eitan Kerem of
the pediatric pulmonary unit and Dr. Meir Isaacson of the
infectious diseases unit, according to the hospital's Sha'ar
Patuah newsletter published today.
</P>
<P>
The research team studied 88 young children who reached the
emergency unit and were diagnosed as bronchiolitis.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a similarly sized sample of healthy children
brought to a family health center served as a control group.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Unger looked at a number of variables, including nursing,
smoking or asthma in the family, allergies and birth weight, and
found that the most significant factor was whether the baby was
breast-fed or bottle-fed.
</P>
<P>
Bronchiolitis, a viral infection of the lower respiratory
tract, is a seasonal disease that occurs mainly in infants under
the age of 18 months. U.S. statistics said that 10 out of every
1,000 infants will get bronchiolitis, usually in winter.
</P>
<P>
The symptoms are fever, wheezing, ear infection, cough and a
rapid heartbeat. The chest may appear barrel-shaped and
breathing becomes more shallow.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, bronchiolitis usually passes by
itself untreated in a few days, but in serious cases, the baby
has to be hospitalized for respiratory distress.

seriously and were intensifying security around the embassy which
is located in the 17-storey seaside Dan Hotel in Tel Aviv.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, October 13 (Xinhua) - Japan Broadcasting Corp. (NHK),
Japan's national public television network, has decided to stop
airing street interviews of potential voters ahead of the October
20 general elections.
</P>
<P>
"We have judged it would be undesirable to broadcast opinions
picked up at random on the streets in the interest of fairness,"
said Naohisa Sekimukai, a spokesman for the network.
</P>
<P>
He noted that such opinions did not always reflect the full
picture of voter opinions, according to local news reports here
today.
</P>
<P>
"There are fears that viewers and listeners may get a wrong
impression that NHK is supporting a certain party or candidate,"
Sekimukai said.
</P>
<P>
He said the new policy will also affect the network's radio
broadcast programs.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Thai police are hunting for
more than 10 people suspected of having links to a major
international heroin smuggling ring which was smashed last week
through international coordination.
</P>
<P>
Thai law enforcement officials played a part in the
international operation, which led to the arrests of 34 suspects
in Thailand, Pakistan and the American cities of new York, Chicago
and Detroit, Thai police department sources said.
</P>
<P>
A total of 55 kilograms of heroin, worth an estimated 26
million US dollars, was confiscated from the ring, which was
largely run by women of Nigerian origin.
</P>
<P>
Thai police arrested a few African suspects in Bangkok during
the operation and are looking for more than 10 other members of
the drug trafficking ring who are believed to be on the loose in
the country.
</P>
<P>
Thailand has been a major transit point to the U.S. and Western
Europe of heroin produced from opium poppies grown in the infamous
'golden triangle' which covers some border areas of eastern
Myanmar, northwestern Laos and northern Thailand.
</P>
<P>
In Thailand, hundreds of Africans, including Nigerians, many of
them women, have been arrested and jailed for attempting to
smuggle heroin out of the country.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Consider Cut in Bread Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Jordan could lower bread prices
in the coming few weeks in view of a drop in world wheat prices,
Minister of Information Marwan Muasher said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian government increased the prices of bread by more
than 200 percent in August in line with the economic reform
programs sponsored by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which
triggered the worst "bread riots" crisis in the southern parts of
the Kingdom since 1989.
</P>
<P>
Bread prices went up to 180 fils and 220 fils (about
25.2 and 30.8 U.S. cents respectively) from 85 fils (about
11.9 U.S. cents) two months ago.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government compensated every Jordanian for the
price hikes through cash payments of 15 dinars (21 dollars)
per year.
</P>
<P>
Muasher said Jordan was negotiating a purchase of 15,000 tons
of U.S. grain.
</P>
<P>
When the deal is concluded, the prices of bread could go down
as the government did not set a minimum price for the bread, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the government has set the maximum ceiling for
bread prices at 250 fils (about 36 U.S. cents) per kilo, adding
that the prices will not exceed this figure no matter how high
the prices of grain in the international market could get.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that the government would continue to provide
Jordanians with the compensation even if the prices go down.
</P>
<P>
Since the "bread riots," Jordan has bought 14,000 tons of wheat
at prices ranging from 191 to 206 dollars per ton, a nearly 25
percent drop from 275 dollars per ton in May.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Supply Muneer Suber said that the government would
increase its wheat imports in the coming few weeks if the
prices on the international market keep declining.
</P>
<P>
This move is aimed at building a strategic wheat reserve in
case of any further price fluctuation, he said.
</P>
<P>
Since the bread price hikes, flour consumption dropped 34
percent.
</P>
<P>
Before the hikes, Jordan's wheat imports reached 660,000-680,000
tons a year. Jordan imported 360,000 tons of wheat in the first nine
months of this year.

<HEADLINE> Iran Warns of Strong Earthquake in 10 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Iranian seismological
authorities have warned of a strong earthquake with an intensity
of seven degrees on the Richter scale in the next 10 years, local
press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The warning has alarmed the whole nation, and President Akbar
Hashemi Rafsanjani Saturday called on the people to pay close
attention to alleviate the impacts of the natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
Mohsen Qafouri-Ashtiani, Director of the International
Seismological and Earthquake Engineering Center of Iran, predicted
a strong possibility of a big earthquake to strike Tehran in
the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Persian daily Salam quoted him as saying such "possibility is
69 percent."
</P>
<P>
The specialist said that some 40 major Iranian cities,
including Tehran, Shiraz, Isfahan and Mashhad, are located on
an earthquake belt.
</P>
<P>
He said that Tehran is hit by a strong earthquake every 158
years.
</P>
<P>
Almost all of these cities are extremely vulnerable viewed from
 urban structure, security and resistance capabilities, he added.
</P>
<P>
"If an earthquake with an intensity of seven degrees occurs,
60 percent of all buildings or more in Tehran would be
destroyed," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said, the whole society should pay greater
attention to the construction of basic structures such as factories,
bridges, power stations, water distribution centers and buildings.
</P>
<P>
The specialist called on the central government and related
departments to take immediate action before such disasters happen.
</P>
<P>
Six years ago, a strong earthquake with an intensity above
seven degrees on the Richter scale struck Iran's northern area
of Manjil. killing at least 15,000 people.

<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Foreign direct investments in
South Korea in the first nine months of 1996 rose to 1.87 billion
U.S. dollars, an increase of 32.1 percent over the same period of
last year, the Ministry of Finance and Economy said today.
</P>
<P>
In the period under review, foreign direct investments in the
manufacturing sector jumped by 56.7 percent to 1.04 billion
dollars, while those in the non-manufacturing sector increased by
10.1 percent to 830 million dollars, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Investments from the European Union nations, zooming by 71
percent to 530 million dollars, topped the list, followed by the
United States with 518 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Japanese investments in South Korea declined by 37.5 percent to
185 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The ministry attributed the rise in foreign direct investments
to government efforts to improve the domestic investment climate
and expand investment areas.
</P>
<P>
If the current trends continue, foreign direct investments in
South Korea this year will surpass last year's record of 1.94
billion dollars, a ministry official said.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam's
largest economic hub, has taken the lead in developing information
technology in the country.
</P>
<P>
The city is stepping up investment to develop information
technology, making it one of the leading industries in the city
and keeping up with the vigorous development of computer science
across the world, the Vietnam News Agency (VNA) reported today.
</P>
<P>
The city will increase the import of computers with imports
accounting for 40 to 45 percent of the total number of computers
in the city.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, Ho Chi Minh City imported 18,000 computers worth 75
million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam is estimated to have 63,000 computers worth 100 million
U.S. dollars this year, including 25,000 computers worth 40
million U.S. dollars in Ho Chi Minh City.
</P>
<P>
VNA said Vietnam's computer technology has been left far
behind. Vietnam's ownership rate of computers per 1,000 people is
as small as half of that in China and India, one-eighth of that in
the Philippines and one-eighteenth in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Information technology now makes up only 0.42 percent of
Vietnam's gross domestic product. The Vietnamese ownership index
of software per one million people is 28 as against 995 in China,
the news service reported.

<HEADLINE> Israel's University Population Up 5 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Israel's university
population increased by 5 percent as some 131,000 students today
attended universities at the beginning of the new academic year.
</P>
<P>
Israel now boasts one of the fastest-growing university
populations in the Western world, according to the Council for
Higher Education (CHE).
</P>
<P>
There are 22,000 new students out of a total student body of
98,000 at the prestigious universities, including Hebrew
University, Tel Aviv university, the Technion, Bar-Ilan
University, Haifa University, Ben-Gurion University and Weizman
Institute of Science.
</P>
<P>
The remaining students attend numerous academic colleges
which have sprung up nationwide over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
The CHE has announced that it would allocate 3.8 billion
shekels (about 1.2 billion U.S. dollars) to the universities
this year, as the share of higher education of the Gross
National Products amounts to 1.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
This is the second highest rate in the world, compared to 2.5
percent in the U.S. and 0.8 percent in Britain or Japan.
</P>
<P>
Israeli universities have been playing a leading role in
conducting the scientific research and development which
contributed to the rapid development in agricultural, industrial
and other sectors.
</P>
<P>
Government statistics show that some 30 percent of all
research and development in the natural and technological
sciences, about 45 percent of civilian research and development
in those fields and almost all academic studies in Jewish
history, humanities and social sciences are carried out at the
country's universities.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Israeli universities are leading patentees both at
home and abroad, and the relative size of their patenting
activity far exceeds that of higher education sectors in other
countries. Measured in the expenditures on research and
development, Israeli universities were granted more than twice
as many patents as those in the United States.
</P>
<P>
In keeping with the growing interest in Business
Administration, the Hebrew University will be offering two new
MA steams: an Master of Business Administration (MBA) and an
Master of Administration in Community Organizations and Public
Policy.
</P>
<P>
Bar-Ilan University is running a MBA program for Israeli
businessmen and senior directors. Tel Aviv University will open
an English MBA course to students from China, Egypt, Jordan,
Palestinian areas and the United States.
</P>
<P>
In the first taste of the rapidly expanded high-tech
education, life-science students of Hebrew University no longer
have to grouse about the time it takes to register for
courses: they can now do so using an on-line computer.
</P>
<P>
Hebrew University is the first in the country to introduce
such high-tech registration, which will soon be expanded and
accessible via the Internet.

PARIS, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Twelve Islamic extremists were
killed by Algerian security forces over Thursday night and Friday
morning in an operation outside the Algerian capital Algiers, the
Algerian daily Le Matin reported today.
</P>
<P>
A large number of security forces were deployed to fight the
extremists, who were equipped with heavy weapons, said the

</P>
<P>
The group of extremists was named "Sahraoui" and had been
hunted in the past four years by security forces, who launched the
operation on clues provided by local inhabitants, said the report.
</P>
<P>
This is the second operation launched in two weeks by Algerian
security forces in the capital.
</P>
<P>
In the previous operation staged about 12 days before, security
forces killed eight extremists, including the "Emir of Casbah",
Yacine Napoli, considered to be one of the most dangerous
extremists.
</P>
<P>
At least 50,000 people have been killed since 1992 when Algeria

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Two French paramilitary police
and one villager were wounded during a clash today in the French
South Pacific colony, New Caledonia.
</P>
<P>
The clash started when police tried to remove a road block set
up by local villagers on a main highway on the island to protest
the pollution caused by a nearby French nickel mine, according to
reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
The villagers, who are inhabitants of a hamlet beside
Boulouparis 70 kilometers from Noumea, capital of New Caledonia,
accused the French boss of the mine of failing to fulfil his
promise on environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time in a month for police and villagers to
clash in the area.
</P>
<P>
The Kanak Socialist National Liberation Front (FNLKS), the main
independence movement in New Caledonia, recently asked the French
government to give up a nickel mine it owns in the north of the
island to let local people build a nickel processing factory.
</P>
<P>
It is not known whether that nickel ore and the one under
dispute today are the same.
</P>
<P>
The FNLKS has also asked France to immediately resume
negotiations on the independence process of the island.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Hails IMF Approval of Economic Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 13 (Xinhua) -- The Egyptian finance minister has
hailed International Monetary Fund (IMF)'s approval of Egypt's new
two-year economic reform program as a great achievement.
</P>
<P>
The endorsement of the program would give the government a
chance to concentrate spending on such priorities as education,
health and the bread subsidy, Mohi Eddin el-Gharib said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Egypt expects to save 1 billion Egyptian pounds (290 million
U.S. dollars) a year in interest from a debt waiver tied to the
new agreement with the IMF on the program.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the Paris Club is expected to write off
Egypt's third part of its foreign debts to Western creditor
nations, which is 4 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The sum is also the last part of the 10 billion dollars in
official debt the Paris Club agreed to forgive under an agreement
reached with Egypt after the Gulf war in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The Paris Club had written off some 6 billion dollars of
Egypt's debts.
</P>
<P>
The new debt waiver will cut Egypt's external debt to less than
30 billion dollars compared with more than 40 billion dollars
before the government began serious economic reforms in the early
1990s.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening session of a seminar entitled "Economy
for a Better Arab Future," Gharib said, "We are now on the road to
the real take-off for creating new jobs, increasing investment and
export, which will raise the standard of living of Egyptians."
</P>
<P>
The 1996-98 program, which is the third stage of Egypt's
economic reform since its inception in 1991, was endorsed at a
meeting of the board of directors of the IMF in Washington
Friday.

<HEADLINE> Chad Eyes Beef Market in Southern Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Chad, a major exporter of beef to
Nigeria, is planning to flood the markets in southern Nigeria as
well with cattle, the main source of beef, the Sunday Champion
newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
Chad sells cattle to Nigeria mainly through its herdsmen in
northern Nigeria. But Chadian ambassador to Nigeria, Issa Hasan
Khayar, regretted that this important menu on the taste of
ordinary Nigerians has not been equitably distributed to the
hinterland, especially in the south.
</P>
<P>
He suggested a situation whereby both countries would harmonize
the sale of cattle so that it can penetrate the Nigerian
hinterlands.
</P>
<P>
"If the (cattle) trade between Nigeria and Chad is restricted
to the Borno state alone, it is not profitable for both
countries," he said, adding that his country would like to extend
the trade links with all the states in Nigeria, especially those
in the south.
</P>
<P>
According to the diplomat, thousands of Chadian cattle are
being sold to Nigeria every year.
</P>
<P>
Chad is a landlocked country to the north of Nigeria and has to
transport almost all goods through Nigeria, the diplomat was
quoted as saying.

<HEADLINE> Sichuan to Initiate New Travel Routes Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Sichuan
Province plans to introduce eight specially-designed travel routes
and host four tourist festivals next year as part of a tourism
promotion campaign themed "Visit China '97."
</P>
<P>
The eight routes incorporate most of the province's chief
tourist attractions, such as the Three Gorges area, a trip from
Jiuzhaigou to Huanglong, one from the Big Buddha in Leshan to
Dujiangyan, which includes Mount Emei, and a tour exclusively for
watching giant pandas.
</P>
<P>
Sichuan will also hold four tourist festivals next year,
including a Sichuan Traveling and Shopping Festival, Chengdu
International Giant Panda Festival, Leshan International Tourist
Festival, and the Three Gorges International Tourist Festival, and
a series of other tourist activities.
</P>
<P>
By promoting its tourism businesses through the new routes and
festivals, Sichuan hopes to receive 420,000 overseas visitors next
year, and also earn 150 million US dollars in foreign exchange
from tourism.
</P>
<P>
The travel industry is already a leader in the provincial
economy, bringing in 11.8 billion yuan in 1995. Of that amount,
125 million US dollars were foreign exchange from the 380,000
overseas travelers who visited Sichuan last year.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Expected to Be More Sympathetic to Arabs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian and Arab politicians
have agreed that a U.S. government led by incumbent President
Bill Clinton would be more sympathetic to Arab causes than one
led by Republican Bob Dole.
</P>
<P>
Former Prime Minister Taher Masri, former Foreign Minister
Kamel Abu Jaber and Saudi Ambassador to Jordan Abdullah Sudeiri
have said they thought that a second term would free Clinton from
pressure normally exerted on U.S. presidents by the powerful
Jewish lobby in the United States, the English-language daily
Jordan Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
Masri said that being elected for a second and last term,
Clinton would be more sympathetic to Arab causes and concerns.
</P>
<P>
He said Clinton's policies toward Palestinians were "much more
sympathetic than Dole's, who is biased in favor of Israel."
</P>
<P>
He noted that President Clinton was a witness to the Oslo
accords and the Jordanian-Israeli peace treaty and to the
developments in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"He is in a better position to deal with the issues of
peace in the region in a manner that better serves the
American interests in the region," he added.
</P>
<P>
Sudeiri agreed with Masri, but added that the Arabs must
unify their ranks in order to determine their future.
</P>
<P>
"Arabs should not simply react to U.S. actions. They should
initiate a dialogue with the Americans regardless of the outcome
of the elections," said the ambassador.
</P>
<P>
"If Arabs unify their positions and policies, they will
affect the American policies toward their causes and the Middle
East," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said he thought that any American president who won a
second term would be freer to take decisions without considering
his political future.
</P>
<P>
Abu Jaber did not expect a big difference between the
stands of the two contenders for the U.S. presidency, but said
Clinton would be freed from the pressures exercised by the
Jewish lobby in the U.S. if reelected.
</P>
<P>
He said Clinton was committed to the peace process and the
Arab-Israeli negotiations.
</P>
<P>
He said he thought that the participation of U.S. peace
coordinator Dennis Ross in the negotiations between Israel and the
Palestinians last week was of great significance.
</P>
<P>
In the past, the American coordinator was usually not allowed
to take part in the negotiations directly.
</P>
<P>
But the three statesmen differed on their perception of how
Clinton would deal with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi ambassador did not expect any change regardless of
who wins the next elections. Whether Clinton or Dole is president,
the pressure on Iraq will continue, he said.
</P>
<P>
Masri shared the views, saying that "both (Clinton and Dole) will
have similar belligerent stands toward Iraq."
</P>
<P>
However, Abu Jaber predicted a breakthrough in American-Iraqi
relations if President Clinton was reelected.

<HEADLINE> Rusedski Beats Damm for Beijing Open Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 13 (Xinhua/OANA) -- Briton Greg Rusedski upset
Martin Damm of Czech 7-6 (7-5), 6-4 in the 328,000 U.S. dollars
Beijing Open final Sunday to snatch his third ATP Tour title.
</P>
<P>
Rusedski served 11 aces to Damm's nine on the way to win his
first title this year. He also broke Damm twice in the second set.
</P>
<P>
The 23-year-old Rusedski, a big server, had 64 aces in the five
round tournament while Damm, ranked 72 in the world, had 68.
</P>
<P>
"The key to the match was that I played the big points well,"
Rusedski said after the one hour and 15 minutes match,
</P>
<P>
"I served well and I took chances when I had them. With the way
Martin and I served, I knew it was going to be a mental battle
rather than a physical.
</P>
<P>
"Damm served well, but playing in both singles and doubles made
him really tired."
</P>
<P>
Rusedski became the second player to win the Beijing tournament
out of American world No. 2 Michael Chang, who had won all three
previous meets since 1993 when the tournament started.
</P>
<P>
The Briton player lost to Chang in the final in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The top-seeded Chang here was crashed out by Damm in the second
round Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Rusedski was very excited after his first indoor win, gifting
balls to the clipping crowd for their heartful support.
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to come back. I'v been Beijing twice with one into
final and one victory. It's really good percentage."
</P>
<P>
Rusedski and Damm had met twice before the match earlier this
year, with Rusedski winning in Nottingham, Britain, on grass, and
defeat in Seoul, South Korea, on hard court.
</P>
<P>
Damm, however, got some compensation from doubles when he and
Andrei Olhovskiy of Russia ousted Patrik Kuhnen of Germany and
Gary Muller of South Africa, 6-4, 7-5 to clich the champion.

<HEADLINE> Medical and Housing Reforms Top Chinese Workers' Concerns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Price rise is no longer the
biggest concern for ordinary Chinese workers, and more Chinese are
concerned about medical and housing reforms, a recent survey
showed.
</P>
<P>
Conducted jointly last month by the State Statistics Bureau,
the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the People's Bank of
China and the ministries of labor, civil affairs and public
health, the survey questioned 1,200 workers in Beijing, Dalian,
Shenyang, Harbin, Chengdu, Guiyang and Jiujiang cities.
</P>
<P>
Forty-seven percent of the workers surveyed said that they care
the most about medical system reform, saying that medical care is
becoming more expensive and an even heavier burden for individuals
and their employers.
</P>
<P>
Forty-three percent said that they are primarily concerned with
China's housing reform policies. Traditionally, houses were
provided only with little rent, by businesses or government
institutions. But under the reforms, more and more employees will
have to share part of the cost.
</P>
<P>
Only 38 percent of those surveyed said that their first worry
is inflation, while surveys from the past two years showed that
inflation was the leading area of concern.
</P>
<P>
China's retail and consumer price indexes during the January to
August period rose 6.8 percent and nine percent, respectively, on
an annual basis. The growth rates were two-digit in 1994 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
The survey found that the pension system, salary reform,
employment, low-income jobs, rights and interests of workers and
expenses for children are also troublesome for various groups of
people.
</P>
<P>
What surprised the experts most is that the Chinese workers
showed a virtual indifference to the appreciation of the value of
their assets and properties. Only 0.9 percent of the respondents
showed the strongest interest on this issue.
</P>
<P>
The survey also revealed that people's attitudes toward life
tend to be influenced by their income and age.
</P>
<P>
Low-income workers are inclined to take into account changes in
the medical system reform, while those in a higher income bracket
are more interested in the housing situation.
</P>
<P>
Middle-aged and young workers tend to care more about housing
reform, and the elderly are more likely to worry about the medical
system.

<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, October 13 (Xinhua) -- The growth rate of foreign
trade at the Binhai New Area in Tianjin has registered a 68.9
percent increase so far this year, 46 percent higher than the
average growth rate of Tianjin, the third largest city in China.
</P>
<P>
The new area has exported 800 million US dollar-worth of
products this year, accounting for 40 percent of the city's total.
</P>
<P>
A local trade official said that vigorous export trade from
Binhai has optimized Tianjin's export structure.
</P>
<P>
The ratio of manufactured goods in the city's total export has
risen to 83.53 percent, and that of Binhai climbed to 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
The export values of mobile telephones, pagers, containers,
garments, furniture and radio equipment for cars have surpassed 10
million US dollars each, and some rose to 100 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Rapid growth of the export-oriented industry is a result of the
establishment of 6,000 overseas-funded firms involving a total
contractual investment of six billion US dollars. They contributed
96 percent of Binhai's export value.
</P>
<P>
Customs statistics show that export from processing with
supplied materials and designs in Tianjin totalled 1.7 billion US
dollars, accounting for half of the city's export. While in
Binhai, over 80 percent of the export was processed products.
</P>
<P>
Binhai covers Tianjin Port, Tianjin Economic and Technology
Development Zone, the Tianjin Bonded Zone and five districts in
the eastern part of the city along the bank of the Bohai Sea. It
features metallurgical and chemical industries as well as
commerce, banking and tourism.

<P>
LANZHOU, October 13 (Xinhua) -- To promote its tourism business,
northwest China's Gansu Province plans to introduce three new
travel routes next year that highlight the region's cultural
relics.
</P>
<P>
The new routes will feature the famous Mogao Grottoes on the
ancient Silk Road, as well as local folk customs.
</P>
<P>
Included is a trip along the ancient Silk Road, which served as
a commercial and cultural link between China, west Asia and Europe
in ancient times. There is a tour of the Great Wall, and another
one featuring the folk customs of the various ethnic minority
groups which inhabit the province.
</P>
<P>
Special travel programs will also be launched, including a car
and motorcycle rally along the Silk Road, group tours on bicycles
or on foot, and glider and hot air balloon tours above the Jiayu
Pass - the western end of the Great Wall.
</P>
<P>
Gansu is famous for its cultural relics, which can be
categorized into five types: the relics of the Great Wall, stone
grottoes, relics of pre-historic cultures, colored pottery, and
wooden writing tablets.

<HEADLINE> Daewoo Corporation Eyes Chinese Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, October 13 (Xinhua) -- The Republic of Korea's Daewoo
Corporation is to increase its investment in China to five billion
US dollars over the next three or four years.
</P>
<P>
And the auto and industrial giant is planning to establish its
second world headquarters in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
During a visit to Hangzhou, capital of Zhejiang Province,
Daewoo Chairman Kim Woo Choong said that the increased investment
will bring the number of Daewoo's subsidiary companies in China to
100, and the work force to 40,000.
</P>
<P>
According to Kim, based on its good performance in China, his
corporation set up a subsidiary company in Beijing last year,
designed to become its second headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Kim was the first south Korean to invest in China. In 1988, he
built the first China-ROK joint venture -- the Fuzhou Refrigerator
Factory in Fuzhou, the capital of southeast China's Fujian
Province.
</P>
<P>
Since 1995, Daewoo has increased its investment in large joint
ventures turning out vacuum cleaners, glass and galvanized iron.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with a 70-year agreement signed recently, Daewoo
and the Shanghai-based Xujiahui Commercial Center will jointly
invest 550 million US dollars in building an 89-storey mansion in
Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, Daewoo spent 300 million dollars building a
wholly-owned company, the Daewoo Cement (Shandong) Company, in
east China's Shandong Province. The company is designed to
manufacture 2.4 million tons of high-grade cement annually.
</P>
<P>
Daewoo, with total assets worth 43.2 billion US dollars and a
work force of 100,000, has 18 offices and 30 enterprises in China.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Conference on Avoidance of Ship Collision Held in Dalian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Colliding ships will be one of
the major issues of concern for the International Maritime
Organization (IMO) in the next 10 to 15 years, according to an
international conference held recently in Dalian, a port city in
northeast China.
</P>
<P>
The conference to discuss avoidance of collisions at sea was
jointly sponsored by IMO, Dalian Marine University and Britain's
Southampton University, "China Communications" reported.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 experts from 15 countries and regions including
Britain, the United States, and Japan attended the conference,
conferring on legal and technical issues ranging from crash
investigations, and laws and regulations governing the avoidance
of collisions at sea, to management of ocean traffic.
</P>
<P>
Every three days, a crash between ships above 50,000 DWT
(deadweight tonnage) is reported somewhere in the world, and 50
percent of collisions worldwide occur in the Asia-Pacific region,
according to reports from the conference.
</P>
<P>
The number of colliding ships has been on the rise in China in
recent years, according to the Ministry of Communications; 52
percent of last year's water traffic accidents were collisions.

<HEADLINE> Inner Mongolia City Protects Ancient Stone Pictures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
HOHHOT, October 13 (Xinhua) -- A large number of ancient
petroglyphs have been discovered in recent years in the city of
Wuhai, in north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and will
greatly aid the study of the history and culture in the area.
</P>
<P>
The stone pictures depict the lives of ancient people who lived
5,000-6,000 years ago in the region, which is part of the vast
desertland in southwestern Inner Mongolia.
</P>
<P>
However, local experts are hesitant to continue digging, saying
there is not enough funding to protect those petroglyphs that have
already been uncovered.
</P>
<P>
Wuhai is located in a Karst area, where pictures carved on
limestone are easily damaged by wind, sunlight and rain.
</P>
<P>
"The more pictures we excavate, the more losses we will suffer,"
a local expert noted. For example, he said, a particular series of
star-shaped figures on a large stone would "disappear within a few
years."
</P>
<P>
In response to the call for preservation of the carvings, the
Wuhai city government allocated special funds to build the
"Huoshaogou Stone Picture Museum," which is now open to the public
and has nine employees.
</P>
<P>
There is now sufficient funding to set up storage buildings for
the other four large groups of stone pictures unearthed so
far.

<HEADLINE> China Provides Good Investment Opportunities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 13 (Xinhua) -- China's open market is
maturing, and foreign businesses investing here are seeking new
development opportunities, according to Morris Tabaksblal,
chairman of Unilever.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua in Shanghai, where the company has
its biggest share of operations in the country, Tabaksblal said
that since 1986, Unilever has invested 350 million US dollars in
setting up 11 joint ventures, two independent businesses, and one
stock controlling company. Its products include more than ten
brandnames of washing powder, cosmetics and toothpaste.
</P>
<P>
Unilever's sales volume in China is expected to surpass five
billion yuan this year, according to Tabaksblal.
</P>
<P>
The chairman said Unilever regarded Shanghai as the base for
its business operations in China, because the city has a special
status in China's rapid economic expansion and great potential.
</P>
<P>
Tabaksblal said that after a decade of cooperation, his company
has a deeper understanding of China.
</P>
<P>
He added that the Chinese market is maturing, thanks to the
stability with which the Chinese government pursues the policies
of opening up and developing the market economy. The investment
environment is getting better, and people's living standards are
continually improving, he said.
</P>
<P>
The gap between Chinese and foreign consumers has narrowed, the
chairman observed. Ten years ago, there were few Chinese who would
accept Unilever's products, now they are popular among Chinese
buyers.
</P>
<P>
The time for investment in China is at a peak, Tabaksblal said,
adding that many consortia that share this point of view are
entering China or expanding their existing operations in the
country.
</P>
<P>
He revealed that Unilever has decided to invest at least 100
million US dollars more in China in the next few years to expand
production and increase training for Chinese employees.
</P>
<P>
The chairman pointed out that Unilever has a long-term interest
in China: the company will not only enhance production and
marketing, but also build a research center for basic chemical
engineering in cooperation with Chinese scientists.
</P>
<P>
The Unilever Research Center, jointly run by the company and
Shanghai Institute of Organic Chemistry under the Chinese Academy
of Sciences, was formed on October 7 this year.
</P>
<P>
Tabaksblal denied that the entrance of foreign brandnames will
threaten the existence of domestic labels. He said Unilever
selected brandnames in accordance with local consumer preference.
</P>
<P>
For example, Zhonghua toothpaste, which has been especially
popular in China, has become a major product of Shanghai
Unilever. Since the joint venture was established less than three
years ago, the sales volume of the toothpaste has doubled.
</P>
<P>
Unilever has laid the foundation for its development in China
over the past decade, Tabaksblal concluded, and aims to continue
scoring outstanding achievement in the next ten years.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Sichuan province, in southwest
China, has attained great achievements in attracting funds from
Taiwan, said provincial governor Song Baorui.
</P>
<P>
Over 1,200 Taiwan-funded enterprises have been built in the

US dollars, ranking first in both the central and west areas of
the country.
</P>
<P>
A development zone by Taiwanese investors was set up in

Taiwan-funded enterprises, which generated a total output value of
50 million yuan in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan-funded enterprises have been set up in every city of the
province.
</P>
<P>
The success has been due to the provincial efforts of improving

<HEADLINE> 530 Million-year-old Zoon Important in Study of Evolution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, October 13 (Xinhua) -- A zoon that lived 530 million
years ago in southwest China's present day Yunnan province has
been described as a missing link in the evolution of earth's
living matter.
</P>
<P>
The cell-like zoon has been identified as the oldest
hemi-chordata.
</P>
<P>
A type of living organism between chordata, the origin of
vertebrae, and those without chordates, the Yunnan Zoon makes up a
missing link in evolution, according to a group of Chinese
paleontologist in Xi'an.
</P>
<P>
Professor Shu Degan, a paleontologist in the Department of
Geology in Northwestern University, and his colleagues have
published a thesis on their discovery in the respected
Britain-based "Nature" magazine.
</P>
<P>
Their find is a break from the point of view published by a
joint group consisting of Australian, Swedish, Hungarian and
Chinese paleontologists earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
The joint group thought the Yunnan Zoon was a chordata.
</P>
<P>
But Shu and his colleges discovered, after close study on a
great number of fossils collected from the site of the zoon, that
the structure of the zoon is exactly the same as some modern
hemi-chordates.
</P>
<P>
The site, in Chengjiang county, provided crucial evidence of
early evolution, as it preserved the world's oldest and most
complete group of mollusc.
</P>
<P>
It has been inscribed on the World Heritage List by the United
Nations Education, Science and Culture Organization (UNESCO).
</P>
<P>
Shu and his colleges have also found at the site the earliest
trilobite with a soft body, and the oldest shell zoon which was
previously thought to be 10 million years younger.

ISLAMABAD, October 13 (Xinhua) -- National highways of Pakistan
will be used for international trade among Pakistan, China,
Kirgizstan and Kazakhstan, a senior official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Shahid Aziz Siddiqi, Pakistani Chairman of the National
Highway Authority, expressed the view on his return after
participating in the conference of the Deputy Ministers for
Communications of the above-mentioned four countries held in
Urumqi, capital city of Xinjiang province of China.
</P>
<P>
Siddiqi said that the four countries had agreed on establishing
the system of international road transit permit.
</P>
<P>
The first trial caravan is expected to leave Pakistan for
Kazakhstan's capital of Alma-Ata in November, he said, adding that
China and Kirgiztan will participate in the caravan with their own
trucks.
</P>
<P>
He said that the objective of the Urumqi Conference was to
undertake measures for early implementation of the Transit trade
agreement.
</P>
<P>
He said the working groups of Ministries of Communications of
the four countries reached an agreement at Urumqi, which defines
the details of permit, routes and nature of documents to be
available with each vehicle.
</P>
<P>
An agreement on the unified custom document and visa procedure
has already been reached by the four countries in Islamabad in
June this year, he added.
</P>
<P>
With this agreement, all the major requirements of the
international road transit system between the four countries have
been fulfilled, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that with the start of the transit trade, a new turn
will be given to the economics of the whole region and the peoples

<HEADLINE> Iran to Exports Natural Gas to Azerbaijan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 13 (Xinhua) -- Iran announced here today
that it will export 130 million cubic meters of natural gas
to its northern neighbor Azerbaijan.
</P>
<P>
Gholamreza Shafei, head of the Iran- Azerbaijan Joint Economic
Commission, said that his country has launched a gas pipeline
project for the gas export.
</P>
<P>
The state-run Tehran Radio quoted him as saying that
construction of the pipeline would cost Iran 17 million
U.S. dollars and it would earn about 700 million dollars over a
span of 30 years.
</P>
<P>
However, the minister did not mention when Iran would begin
the gas export to Azerbaijan. The two neighbors have yet to sign
the gas deal.
</P>
<P>
Iran boasts the world's second largest gas reserve, which is
estimated at 2,100 billion cubic meters. It signed a 20
billion dollar gas deal with Turkey in August.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the two countries signed a Memorandum of
Understanding. The two sides agreed to form 12 commissions in
charge of expanding mutual cooperation in the fields of
transportation, industries and mines, energy and power, oil and
gas, commerce and banking affairs, customs affairs and
telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
Shafei said that among other spheres for cooperation, the two
neighbors have reached agreement in agriculture, fisheries and
animal husbandry.
</P>
<P>

AMMAN -- Jordan would lower bread prices in the coming few
weeks in view of a drop in world wheat prices, Minister of
Information Marwan Muasher said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian government increased the prices of bread by more
than 200 percent in August in line with the economic reform
programs sponsored by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which
triggered the worst "bread riots" crisis in the southern parts of
the kingdom since 1989.
</P>
<P>
Bread prices went up to 180 fils and 220 fils (about
25.2 and 30.8 U.S. cents respectively) from 85 fils (about
11.9 U.S. cents) two months ago.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government compensated every Jordanian for the
price hikes through cash payments of 15 dinars (21 dollars)
per year.
</P>
<P>
Muasher said Jordan was negotiating a purchase of 15,000 tons
of U.S. grain.
</P>
<P>
When the deal is concluded, the prices of bread could go down
as the government did not set a minimum price for the bread, he
said. The minister said that the government would continue to
provide Jordanians with the compensation even if the prices go
down.
</P>
<P>
Since the "bread riots," Jordan has bought 14,000 tons of wheat
at prices ranging from 191 to 206 dollars per ton.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Supply Muneer Suber said that the government would
increase its wheat imports in the coming few weeks if the
prices on the international market keep declining.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egypt has hailed the International Monetary Fund
(IMF)'s approval of Egypt's new two-year economic reform program
as a great achievement.
</P>
<P>
The endorsement of the program would give the government a
chance to concentrate spending on such priorities as education,
health and the bread subsidy, Finance Minister Mohi Eddin
el-Gharib said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Egypt expects to save one billion Egyptian pounds (290 million
U.S. dollars) a year in interest from a debt waiver tied to the
new agreement with the IMF on the program.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the Paris Club is expected to write off
Egypt's third part of its foreign debts to Western creditor
nations, which is 4 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The sum is also the last part of the 10 billion dollars in
official debt the Paris Club agreed to forgive under an agreement
reached with Egypt after the Gulf war in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The Paris Club has written off some six billion dollars of
Egypt's debts.
</P>
<P>
The new debt waiver will cut Egypt's external debt to less than
30 billion dollars compared with more than 40 billion dollars
before the government began serious economic reforms in the early
1990s.

<HEADLINE> Iran to Launch Nationwide Arms Search Operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 13 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian security forces
threatened to launch a nationwide arms search operation from
Monday as the deadline for delivery of unauthorized weapons
expires 12:00 p.m. local time (20:30 GMT) today.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made by Hussein Motahar, director of the
Interior Ministry, in a report carried in the Persian-language
evening paper Resalat today.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the Interior Ministry is to launch the
nationwide search operation because some people still refuse to
hand in their illegal weapons and ammunition.
</P>
<P>
The director advised those who hold illegal weapons to take
advantage of the amnesty by Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei
in its remaining hours and turn in what they have.
</P>
<P>
"As of October 14 the government will take necessary steps to
discover and clear unauthorized weapons in suspected regions,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
Motahar was quoted as saying that 75 percent of those who
possess illegal weapons have been identified via reports by the
suspecting public or by the country's security apparatus.
</P>
<P>
He said that the security forces will enhance security check
and random spot searches of automobiles at cities' entrances.
</P>
<P>
He warned that those who possess unauthorized arms and refuse
to deliver them to the government will be treated as criminals by
the law.
</P>
<P>
On February 10, 1996, Khamenei pardoned all those who had
retained unauthorized weapons and ammunition and allowed them
some months to surrender their weapons.
</P>
<P>
Since then, more than 200,000 items of weapons and ammunition
have been handed in to the security departments, according to
official reports.

<HEADLINE> France Wants to Play Bigger Role in Mideast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 13 (Xinhua) -- A special envoy of French
President Jacques Chirac said here today that France and Europe
want to play a larger role in realizing a peace settlement in the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Bertrand du Fourcq, Secretary-General of the French Foreign
Ministry, outlined Chirac's plans while speaking to reporters
following a meeting with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
"Europe is practically the principal donor financially in the
region. We wish also an active political role," he said.
</P>
<P>
Expressing the French concern about the "possible failure of
the peace process and consequent dangers," du Fourcq said, "The
peace process and negotiations must bring speedy results which
lead to a settlement based on agreements reached in Madrid, Oslo
and Taba."
</P>
<P>
Israel has refused to fully accept the land-for-peace
principle, which the Arabs have regarded as the basis for
Arab-Israeli negotiations, since the election of right-wing Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu late in May.
</P>
<P>
Israel has also procrastinated in implementing its agreements
already signed with the Palestinians, including the long-delayed
redeployment of its troops in the West Bank town of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
The French envoy arrived here Saturday night at the start of a
tour which will also take him to Israel and Gaza to arrange for
President Jacques Chirac's planned trip to the region. Chirac,
compelled by his worry about a possible collapse of the Middle
East peace process, will start the visit next Saturday
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa, who attended the meeting
between Mubarak and the envoy, said "when he (Chirac) comes to
Cairo, we will know if there is a new initiative or if efforts
would focus on promoting the present peace process through
convincing the Israeli side of the importance of abiding by the
signed agreements."
</P>
<P>
Moussa further noted that the peace process and the current
perils threatening it will be high on the agenda of future talks
between Mubarak and Chirac.
</P>
<P>
Chirac will visit Syria, Israel, the Palestinian territories
and Jordan before arriving in Egypt in the last leg of his tour
on October 25.

</P>
<P>
