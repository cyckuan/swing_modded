<HEADLINE> Britain for Peaceful Solution to Kashmir Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Visiting British Foreign
Secretary Malcolm Rifkind expressed the hope at a press conference
here today that the long-running Kashmir issue will be resolved
peacefully.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the deletion of the Kashmir issue by the UN
Security Council from its agenda, Rifkind said that the United
Kingdom does not believe that any issue should be removed from the
UN agenda unless the countries most concerned agree to that.
</P>
<P>
"Britain believes that the (Kashmir) issue needs to be
reopened," said the Foreign Secretary, adding that the position
had been made clear by Britain in the UN.
</P>
<P>
Rifkind also said on the occasion that Britain and Pakistan
enjoyed "close, warm and cordial" bilateral relationship and
cooperation, particularly in the economic and trade field.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Britain, the second largest investor after the
United States in Pakistan, had invested more than two billion US
dollars in the country, and was willing to continue its
investment.
</P>
<P>
Rifkind greatly appreciated the achievements made by Pakistan
during the last few years in developing its national economy, and
welcomed the fact that during the last six years, the bilateral
trade between Pakistan and Britain had grown by more than 50
percent.
</P>
<P>
Rifkind, who arrived here today on his first visit as the
British Foreign Secretary, held talks with Pakistani President
Farooq Leghary and Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto on bilateral
issues as well as regional and international issues of common
concern.
</P>
<P>
During his talks with the Pakistani leadership, Rifkind
particularly paid tribute to Pakistan for assisting the United
Nations in the peace-keeping efforts.
</P>
<P>
The British Foreign Secretary is also going to visit India
after completing his Pakistan tour.

<HEADLINE> South Korea Adopts Exclusive Sea Zone Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean cabinet today
adopted a law setting its 200-nautical-mile Exclusive Economic
Zone (EEZ), hoping that it will take effect on September 10 this
year.
</P>
<P>
The law will give South Korea exclusive rights to exploit
maritime and seabed resources in waters up to 200 nautical miles
away from its coast in accordance with the United Nations
Convention on the Law of the Sea, a Foreign Ministry spokesman
said here today.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean National Assembly ratified the law on July 24
this year.
</P>
<P>
The EEZs of Japan and South Korea overlap as the sea between
the two countries isn't wide enough to encompass both zones. The
two countries have been holding talks to come to some agreement
over the issue.

BEIJING, August 27 (Xinhua) -- China will select a second round
of group companies nationally for an experiment with the modern
enterprise system, in a move to improve the state-owned economy's
efficiency through management reform.

<HEADLINE> Top Official in Coalition Likely to Quit to Form New Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The smallest party in Japan's
ruling coalition is likely to split if a one-to-one meeting
between maverick politician Yukio Hatoyama and his party boss
Masayoshi Takemura goes badly, informed sources said.
</P>
<P>
Hatoyama resigned today as general secretary of the centrist
New Party Sakigake, the junior partner in the tripartite
government, paving the way for him to form a new reformist
political party ahead of elections which could come as early as
October.
</P>
<P>
Former finance minister Takemura, who formed Sakigake three
years ago after splitting from the ruling conservative Liberal
Democratic Party (LDP), has been pushing for all 27 lawmakers in
his party to join the new party en masse.
</P>
<P>
But Hatoyama has said he doesn't want Takemura to be among the
founding members of the new party. He has blamed Takemura for
Sakigake's negative public image and believes that the new party
will have more voter appeal without him.
</P>
<P>
His views are supported by two other key figures in promoting
the new party, Hatoyama's younger brother Kunio Hatoyama and
Hajime Funada of the main opposition party Shinshinto (New
Frontier Party).
</P>
<P>
They say Takemura lacks the reformist credentials the new party
would need to attract disenchanted voters to its platform which
calls for a transformation of Japanese society from one led by the
bureaucracy to one led by citizens.
</P>
<P>
Sources say the chances of Hatoyama and Takemura reaching an
accord this evening are slim. Takemura sees little room for
compromise with Hatoyama, they said.
</P>
<P>
About five Sakigake legislators and a member of the Social
Democratic Party (SDP), the second-largest party in the coalition,
are expected to join the new party.
</P>
<P>
SDP Secretary General Kanju Sato predicted today that less than
five members of both SDP and Sakigake will follow Hatoyama if he
quits the party -- far too few to take away the parliamentary
majority held by the tripartite ruling coalition of the LDP, SDP
and Sakigake.
</P>
<P>
Hatoyama's rebellion has angered some members of the coalition
because he has indicated he may cooperate with opposition attempts
to topple the government.
</P>
<P>
But senior politicians have played down the impact of
Hatoyama's new party on Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's
government or the election calendar, saying it is only "a minor
matter".
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto must call a general election by mid-1997.

<HEADLINE> Egypt to Witness Heavest Nile Flood in History </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The Nile River, which provides
Egypt with most of the country's water resources, will have the
heavest flood in history this year, a senior government minister
said here today.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Hadi Radi, Egypt's Minister of Irrigation, Public Works
and Water Resources told a press conference that the flood, which
is expected to begin next month, will bring in no less than 100
billion cubic meters of water.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Nile's excess water will enter the Toshka
Canal, which has never been used since it was dug 30 years ago as
a precaution against massive Nile floods.
</P>
<P>
He added that he expects some four billion cubic meters of water
to enter the canal.
</P>
<P>
The water will be used to irrigate 1,800 feddans (756 hectares)
of land to be planted with wheat and winter crops, Radi said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the level of water in Lake Nasser will reach 179.2
meters in the second half of October. The lake is considered full
at 175 meters, and the extra water will be channeled to the Toshka
Canal.
</P>
<P>
Lake Nasser, some 700 kilometers south of Cairo, is the world's
largest man-made lake. Until the completion of the Aswan High Dam
in 1971, Egypt periodically suffered flooding from the Nile. But
excess water is now held back behind the dam in Lake Nasser. The
Toshka Canal is near the lake.
</P>
<P>
The minister told reporters that the volume of water in the
lake will reach 144 billion cubic meters, its highest level in
history, at the end of July next year.
</P>
<P>
The volume of water at present is 130 billion cubic meters, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Radi described the flood situation in Sudan as dangerous and
said that Egypt is ready to offer any assistance to the
neighboring country.

<HEADLINE> US Banks Tightening Consumer Credit, Fed Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Confronting with rising
losses on credit cards and more customers declaring ban) survey showed that near
ly half of
banks said they have tightened their standards for approving
credit card applications and more than a quarter have done so on
applications for installment loans, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
"The survey results were generally supportive of the view that
banks are pulling back somewhat in their lending to consumers,"
the Fed report said.
</P>
<P>
The real crunch comes mainly on credit card lending and making
installment loans because many American households have a high
level of debt relative to their income, resulting in more
delinquencies on card balances and personal bankruptcies.
</P>
<P>
Two thirds of the respondents to the survey said that losses on
consumer loans of all types were somewhat higher than in the past.
One reason is that accounts are remaining delinquent for longer
that usual. The second is that customers are declaring bankruptcy
more quickly, according to the quarterly survey.
</P>
<P>
But the survey showed that business lending is still strong.
Most bankers reported that their institutions are continuing to
ease the terms of loans to businesses of all sizes.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 27 (Xinhua) -- David Greenlee, chairman of a
five-nation group supervising cease-fire between Lebanon and
Israel, held talks with Lebanese leaders here today.
</P>
<P>
At the end of his talks with House Speaker Nabih Berri, the
U.S. general said that the purpose of his first visit to Beirut
in his capacity as chairman of the cease-fire monitoring
committee was to "explain the aim and work of the committee."
</P>
<P>
Comprising military and diplomatic representatives from the
United States, France, Syria, Lebanon and Israel, the committee
was established under a cease-fire understanding reached between
Lebanon and the Jewish state on April 26.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-brokered understanding put an end to a 17-day
Israeli blitz against Hezbollah guerrillas in south Lebanon,
in which some 200 people, mainly civilians, were killed.
</P>
<P>
Greenlee said that the committee's job was to implement the
April understanding and to review separate reports on any breaches
and violent operations.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters at the end of his meeting with Lebanese
Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri, Greenlee underlined that his
committee "has done a useful work."
</P>
<P>
The April understanding bans the conflicting sides from
attacking civilian targets or launching attacks from civilian
areas. But it does not prevent Moslem guerrillas from raiding the
Israeli forces and their client militia.

HARARE, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The opposition Forum Party of
Zimbabwe today threw its weight behind the country's civil servants
who are striking for better salaries.
</P>
<P>
''They have a valid and genuine case,'' Forum said in a statement.
</P>

Most of the country's 161,000 civil servants went on a strike,
pressing for salary increments of up to 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
Despite being dismissed on Friday, the civil servants today
converged at various venues for the eighth day of the work stoppage.
</P>
<P>
''The government should not use strongarm methods in dealing with
them... Dismissing civil servants who went on strike is no solution
but clearly serves to exacerbate the problem,'' said Forum.
</P>
<P>
The government recently announced that it had awarded civil
servants an average 20 percent increment, but the workers maintain
they only got nine percent.

TOKYO, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Masayoshi Takemura and Yukio
Hatoyama, two key members of Japan's coalition partner New Party
Sakigake, failed to agree today over the party's future and the
composition of a new party Hatoyama plans to establish next month,
Kyodo News Service reported.
</P>
<P>
Former finance minister Takemura, Sakigake's leader, and
Hatoyama, who quit the party's number two post earlier today, only
agreed to meet again Wednesday after three hours of talks at the

Hatoyama is expected to quit Sakigake, the smallest party in

Hatoyama's younger brother Kunio Hatoyama, a former education
minister, said Monday he will quit Shinshinto (New Frontier
Party), Japan's leading opposition party, for the new party, if
his brother leaves Sakigake and launches the new political group.
</P>
<P>
A draft platform for the new party calls for a transformation
of Japanese society from one led by the bureaucracy to one led by
citizens.
</P>
<P>
The new party is likely to be established with at least 10
members.
</P>
<P>
About five legislators from Sakigake, including Susumu Yanase,
Koichiro Genba and Ko Tanaka, are expected to join the new party,
and Hirotaka Akamatsu of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), the
second-largest party in the coalition, may also follow suit.
</P>
<P>
But SDP Secretary General Kanju Sato predicted today that less
than five members of both the SDP and Sakigake will leave the
parties to join the new party.
</P>
<P>
Sakigake and the SDP are part of the tripartite ruling
coalition led by Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, who is
president of the LDP, the coalition's biggest group.

<HEADLINE> Warns Against Extension of UN Mission in Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- A senior official of the United
States warned here today against the extension of the United
Nations peacekeeping mission in Angola.
</P>
<P>
This was declared by Princeton Lyman, the United States
Assistant Secretary for International Organisations, at the
meeting of the Joint Committee of the Angolan Peace Process held
in Angola's capital of Luanda.
</P>
<P>
Lyman said all the impending problems concerning Angola's
peace process should be solved by February 1997 when the mandate
of the U.N. mission expires.
</P>
<P>
He said it would be a wishful thinking that the U.N. mandate
would be extended whether or not the peace obstacles are cleared
by that time.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. official urged the former rebels of the National
Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) to devote more
peace effort so as to achieve a major breakthrough in the
country's peace process.
</P>
<P>
According to the schedule, the UNITA rebels should complete
their disarmament process and a unified armed force should be
established next week.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Lyman said the Clinton Administration, which had
promised a 1.9 million U.S. Dollar aid package to Angola's peace
process, would continue its assistance.

<HEADLINE> Israel, US Play Down Syrian Troop Moves in Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai and U.S. Ambassador to Israel Martin Indyk today
played down the continuing Syrian troop movements in Lebanon in
an bid to calm public concerns in Israel.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in Tel Aviv after a ceremony to mark the
recent successful targeting test of Israel's Arrow 2 Anti-Missile
program, Mordechai said that the Israeli army is following every
activity of the Syrian troops in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Israel has no interests in sharpening
tensions with Syria, or creating situations that would lead to
conflict.
</P>
<P>
Indyk said that the United States believes that the Syrian
troop movements in Lebanon are "purely defensive in nature."
</P>
<P>
Reports from Lebanon have indicated that some units of
the Syrian troops, including tanks, had pulled out of positions
on the Beirut-Damascus highway.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese Newspaper An-Nahar said it appeared that the
movements of the Syrian army were designed to guard against air
raids and were apparently in response to recent "warlike"
statements by Israeli leaders.
</P>
<P>
"The change of positions of the Syrian army in the mountains
and on the Syrian-Lebanese borders follows fears of an Israeli
operation against these forces," An-Nahar quoted sources as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Israeli experts pointed out that the Syrian troop movements
were a pressure tactic aimed at pushing the peace talks with
Israel out of their current stalemate.
</P>
<P>
Ze'ev Maoz, head of the Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies in
Tel Aviv University, said the Syrians wanted to keep the pressure
and they wanted to indicate that "if there is no movement on
the political front, then things might escalate."
</P>
<P>
"In the long run, if the political stalemate continues, the
likelihood of conflict increases," said Maoz in an interview
with The Jerusalem Post.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said
earlier today that there is no change in the government's policy
toward Syria, adding that Israel's sole interest is to defense
itself.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Israel Radio, Netanyahu said that
there is no basic change in the deployment of the Syrian troops
in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Tensions have been escalated between Israel and Syria since the
new Israeli government took office in June, as the peace process
between the two countries came to a deadlock.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Israel and Syria accused each other of preparing
for war.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu called on the Syrians to resume the peace
negotiations with Israel while visiting the U.S. in July, but he
refused to make any commitments regarding an Israeli withdrawal
from the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
Last Wednesday, Israel sent Syria a message via the U.S., saying
it was committed to peace and wanted to open negotiations without
preconditions.
</P>
<P>
However, Syria had rejected Israel's suggestion to renew peace
talks unless the Israeli government changes its policy and makes
concessions on issue of the Golan Heights.

<HEADLINE> Israeli, Japanese FMs Hold Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign Minister
David Levy met today with visiting Japanese counterpart Yukihiko
Ikeda, pledging Israel's efforts to ease the economic hardship of
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The two foreign ministers hailed the continuing development of
the ties between Israel and Japan. Ikeda, who arrived here Sunday
on the third leg of his ongoing Middle East tour, said that
progress in the Israeli-Arab peace process would help "bring the
two countries together."
</P>
<P>
He promised Japan would contribute to the stability in the
Middle East, saying that Japan is interested in participating in
regional economic projects envisioned in a regional economic
summit held in Jordan last year.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting Sunday with Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) President Yasser Arafat, Ikeda agreed to grant 11.6 million
dollars in aid to the Palestinians. The PNA receives about 100
million dollars annually in various forms of aid from Japan.
</P>
<P>
Levy noted that Israel is trying to ease the economic duress
of the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, who have
suffered dearly from the protracted closure of the territories
imposed since late February.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with Israeli President Ezer Weizman Sunday,
Ikeda urged Israel to abide by the the land-for-peace principle in
order to advance the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Ikeda is scheduled to meet with Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu later today. Before his visit to Israel, Ikeda
had already traveled to Egypt, Syria and Jordan for talks on the
peace process and bilateral economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Since the start of the peace process, the Israeli-Japanese
relations have developed rapidly with several high-level visits
between the two sides, including a trip by former Israeli premier
Yitzhak Rabin to Tokyo in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The economic and trade relations between the two countries
have also expanded sharply, with Japan becoming Israel's second
largest trade partner after the U.S.. Last year, Israel's exports
to Japan reached 1.315 billion dollars and its imports from Japan
stood at 938 million dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa will start Tuesday a four-nation tour which will take him
to Syria, Tunisia, Mauritania and Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Moussa will convey a message from Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak to Syrian President Hafez al-Assad during his brief visit
to Syria, the Egyptian Middle East News Agency (MENA) reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The message will deal with the latest developments related to
the Middle East peace process, Moussa was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Also today, President Mubarak telephoned al-Assad and the two
leaders exchanged views on means of pushing forward the peace
process, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Moussa called on Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to
discuss with him the latest developments of the peace process on
the Palestinian track, the MENA said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, who has acted as a mediator in Arab-Israeli peace talks,
has recently intensified its contacts with parties concerned in a
bid to reactivate the stalled peace process.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said that Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy will be in
Cairo Sunday to hold talks with Egyptian officials on the
deadlocked Palestinian-Israeli negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Moussa reiterated that Israel should return to negotiations so
that the Middle East and North Africa Economic Summit would be
successfully held.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Mubarak indicated that he may cancel the summit to
be held in Cairo in November if the Arab-Israeli talks remain
deadlocked.
</P>
<P>
Moussa blamed Israel Sunday for the current stalemate of the
peace process, calling on resumption of peace talks on all tracks
in accordance with the signed agreements.

BRASILIA, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Japan today agreed to grant
Brazil 529 million U.S. dollars to finance its environmental
projects.
</P>
<P>
Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso and visiting
Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto signed an agreement for
the government loan.
</P>
<P>
Cardoso and Hashimoto held a working meeting before signing the
agreement which will facilitate the environmental projects to be
implemented in the Brazilian states of Ceara, Parana, Santa

<P>
Brazilian Foreign Minister Luiz Felipe Lampreia said that the
two leaders discussed bilateral relations, auto trade and the

<HEADLINE> Lebed Comes Under Fire Over Chechnya Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The head of the pro-Moscow
Chechen government Doku Zavgayev today accused Russian Security
Council Secretary Alexander Lebed of handing power in the republic
to "splittists" on August 6.
</P>
<P>
The accusation cast new doubts over the peace process in
war-torn Chechnya initiated earlier this month by Lebed, President
Boris Yeltsin's special envoy to the troubled region.
</P>
<P>
Zavgayev, at a press conference here, blasted Lebed for sending
his aides to secret meetings with Chechen rebels.
</P>
<P>
He said Lebed had conducted a "second coup," following the
first coup in 1991 when Johar Dudayev came to power.
</P>
<P>
However, a spokesman for Lebed dismissed Zavgayev's accusation
as "lies" since President Boris Yeltsin and Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin knew of his proposals for a truce to end the recent
bloody fighting around the Chechen capital Grozny.
</P>
<P>
Analysts attributed Zavgayev's outburst to the fact that he has
effectively been sidelined by Lebed's peace mission.
</P>
<P>
Lebed's peace mission has stopped some of the worst fighting of
the 20-month-conflict which has reportedly killed some 50,000
people.
</P>
<P>
The head of the pro-Moscow government in Chechnya also voiced
his opposition to the setting up of a joint Russian-Chechen army
in preparation for the withdrawal of Russian troops beginning on
August 28 and expected to end around September 1.
</P>
<P>
The commander of Russian troops in Chechnya, Vyacheslav
Tikhomirov, and Chechen rebel chief-of-staff Aslan Mashadov ironed
out their differences and signed a ceasefire agreement in the
Chechen village of Novye Atagi today.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the joint Russian-Chechen army will be
established and deployed around Grozny at about 6 p.m. (1400 GMT)
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In the agreement, the two sides pledge to avoid any further
breakdown in the peace process.

<P>
They said floods can be forecast fairly accurately by means of
radar.

<HEADLINE> UNHCR Ends Repatriation of Rwandan Refugees From </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations High Commission
for Refugees (UNHCR) today completed the repatriation of the last
6,000 Rwandan refugees from Burundi, said Agence France Presse
(AFP) quoting a UNHCR communique issued in Bujumbura.
</P>
<P>
Pirjo Dupuy, head of the UNHCR mission in Bujumbura, described
the repatriation as "extremely well done."
</P>
<P>
More than 250,000 Rwandan Hutus fled to Burundi in 1994 after
the country's Hutu army was defeated by the Tutsi-dominated
Patriotic Front of Rwanda, which has been in power in Rwanda
since.
</P>
<P>
About one and a half million other Rwandan refugees are now
staying in Zaire and Tanzania after fleeing Rwanda following the
1994 genocide, in which half a million Tutsis and moderate Hutus
were killed by the Hutu army and militia.
</P>
<P>
The repatriation of Rwandan refugees from Burundi took place
after Burundi was subjected to an economic embargo by its
neighbors who opposed the military putsch in July.
</P>
<P>
In another development, former Tanzania President Julius
Nyerere will arrive in Rome this evening to meet the leaders of a
Catholic group, the Sant'Egidio, which is trying to mediate
between Burundi's military government and the country's Hutu
rebels.
</P>
<P>
AFP said that Nyerere, who also tries to mediate between the
two warring factions of Burundi, is expected to arrive in Rome
from Zurich.
</P>
<P>
There have been rumors in Bujumbura that the two conflicting
sides of Burundi will meet in Rome to negotiate an end to the
three-and-a-half-year civil war which has killed at least 150,000
people.
</P>
<P>
But the Burundian embassy in Rome said today that nothing has
been programed about the talks, according to AFP.

<HEADLINE> Cambodian Ruling Parties Can End Rows Peacefully: Ranariddh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The two main coalition
partners have pledged to end their political disputes peacefully
and work together again, First Prime Minister Norodom Ranariddh
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The National United Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful
and Unificative Cambodia (Funcinpec) and the Cambodian People's
Party (CPP) are to "resolve political differences through
negotiations, not resort to force," said Ranariddh, also the
leader of Funcinpec.
</P>
<P>
"The partners in the Royal Government of Cambodia are working
together well again after a few glitches and differences,"
Ranariddh said in a statement at the opening ceremony of a
three-day International Conference on Peace and Cooperation in
Asia and Europe.
</P>
<P>
"Samdech Hun Sen (the leader of CPP) and I share a common
vision for Cambodia... and we are prepared to work for a
peaceful... and stable nation." he said.
</P>
<P>
"We will do our best to find a solution to political
differences so as to bring stability and prosperity to the
well-deserved people of Cambodia." he said.
</P>
<P>
Funcinpec beat the CPP in the 1993 elections and agreed to a
union to avoid renewed strife, but tension mounted when Ranariddh
recently threatened to pull out of the cabinet and parliament if
the CPP continued to refuse his party a fairer share of power in
the provinces.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen had rejected the demand and threatened force against
any bid to dissolve parliament before the 1998 national
elections.

<HEADLINE> UK Small Businesses the Most Confident in W.Europe: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Small and medium-sized businesses
in Britain are currently more optimistic about commercial
prospects and the economy than their counterparts in the rest of
Western Europe, according to a business survey published today.
</P>
<P>
The survey, the European Enterprise Index, compiled twice a
year by the 3i European Enterprise Center, found that although the
overall outlook throughout Europe remained uncertain, optimism
about the commercial environment had soared among British
entrepreneurs in the first six months of this year.
</P>
<P>
Of the five countries covered by the survey, British
entrepreneurs are most positive about the future performance of
their businesses and expect to increase their spending on
marketing, research and development, and training. They also
expect wages to continue to rise.
</P>
<P>
The index was compiled from a survey of 459 companies with
fewer than 500 employees, across Britain, France, Germany, Italy
and Spain.
</P>
<P>
The UK survey results contrast sharply with most of those from
the four other countries covered, with the French the most gloomy.
Small businessmen in France have replaced their German
counterparts as the most pessimistic about the state of the
economy.
</P>
<P>
The economic index in France has slumped by nine points to -64,
which compares with a 7-point improvement to -17 in the UK.
</P>
<P>
French confidence about the prospects for businesses is the
lowest of any of the five countries, slipping from 10 to just four
on the index, whereas in the UK there was a rise of 14 points to
22.
</P>
<P>
Among other findings, small and medium-sized businesses in
Germany, France and Italy expressed most concern about how they
will perform over the next six months.
</P>
<P>
Spanish entrepreneurs, however, were relatively optimistic.
Like their British counterparts, they expect to increase spending
and investment and they believe performance will improve.
</P>
<P>
Charles Richardson of 3i said, "The falling confidence levels
in France and sustained pessimism in Germany and Italy indicate
clearly that recovery is far from complete across Europe as a
whole."

<HEADLINE> More German Couples Divorce in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Germany's divorce rate continued to
rise last year as nine out of every 100 marriages ended in
failure, the Federal Statistical Bureau said today.
</P>
<P>
Some 170,000 couples divorced last year, leading to a nine
percent divorce rate, up two percentage points over 1994, figures
released by the Wiesbaden-based bureau showed.
</P>
<P>
The number of children falling victim to their parents' divorce
rose 5 percent to 142,300.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the bureau said that the country's divorce rate
has been rising since divorce laws were reformed in 1977.
</P>
<P>
He also said that divorce rates were much higher in the western
part of the country than in the east. Of the 170,000 divorced
couples, 148,000 were from the west, a record high.
</P>
<P>
Though the east's rate increased by 2.3 percentage points in
1995, it is still satisfactorily low compared with the high
divorce rates seen in the former East Germany which had a divorce
rate of 50 percent between the mid-1970s and late 1980s.

<HEADLINE> Japan Calls For Continued Attention to Epidemic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Although the incidence of a food
poisoning epidemic caused by the O-157 strain of E. coli bacteria
is declining, Japan's Health Ministry today warned people of
continued possibility of being infected with the disease.
</P>
<P>
As sporadic outbreaks continued, people still need to watch out
and take precautions against the epidemic, Health Minister Naoto
Kan told a cabinet meeting, Kyodo News Service reported.
</P>
<P>
But Kan said that since August 8, Sakai city of Osaka
Prefecture, center of the recent epidemic, had not registered any
new cases.
</P>
<P>
The epidemic had claimed 11 lives and infected almost 10,000
people across the country.
</P>
<P>
The Osaka prefectural government said it found seven more
food-poisoning patients who had eaten "kaiware daikon," or white
radish sprouts, shipped by the Minamino Farm in Habikino in the
prefecture, which the Health Ministry had suspected to be the
source of the disease in Sakai.
</P>
<P>
According to the ministry's latest nationwide food inspection,
seven out of 4,400 samples, or 0.2 percent, were found
contaminated with O-157 bacillus, with none of the cases in sea
food, vegetables, eggs or bean curd.
</P>
<P>
Of the 3,167 voluntary checks at slaughterhouses, only one
O-157 contamination case in a beef sample was found.
</P>
<P>
In September and October the state will launch more thorough
sanitary checks on school lunches, the major source of the recent
spread of food poisoning, Kan said.

<HEADLINE> S.Korea Leads Asia in Investments to Transition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- A study of the U.N. Economic
Commission for Europe (ECE) has found that South Korean
manufacturers are the most active Asian investors in the central
and east European transition economies, more active than Japanese.
</P>
<P>
According to the lastest issue of the East-West Investment News
released by the ECE today, South Korea became in 1996 the biggest
foreign direct investor in Poland with the car maker Daewoo's
planned investment of 1.1 billion U.S. dollars in the country.
</P>
<P>
This new foreign direct investment (FDI) will account for more
than one fifth of total FDI stock accumulated in Poland since
1989.
</P>
<P>
Kia Motors Corp., another major South Korean car maker, will
also invest a total of 1 billion U.S. dollars during the next five
years in Russia to produce passenger cars.
</P>
<P>
The presence of South Korean transnationals is also
increasingly evident in other transition economies, not only in
central Europe, but also in the former Soviet republics,
especially in Uzbekistan where Daewoo will invest 2.5 billion by
2010 to build up its telecommunications networks.
</P>
<P>
The ECE report stated that South Korean FDI in the transition
economies can be seen as the beginning of a new economic
cooperation between the transition economies and East Asia.
</P>
<P>
According to the ECE, a number of signs seem to indicate that
investments from Japan and other Asia countries may start to
arrive in the transition economies.
</P>
<P>
Japan's Matsushita Electric has, for example, recently decided
to invest in a television plant in the Czech Republic for its
Panasonic subsidiary. Sony Corporation also plans to build an
electronics factory in Hungary.
</P>
<P>
Also according to the ECE, Singapore and China were ranked the
third and fourth biggest investors in Russia as of January 1995,
following Switzerland and the United States respectively.
</P>
<P>
This means that since the transition process began, Singapore
has invested more in Russia than Germany or France, the ECE said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 28 (Xinhua) -- China exported 11.45 million
tons of coal as well as 3.42 million tons of coke and semi-coke in
the first half of 1996, down 13.2 and 14.8 percent, respectively,
compared with the same period in 1995, the "China Chemical
Industry News" reported.
</P>
<P>
Because there has been a shortage of coal and electricity
supplies at home, southeast China's coastal provinces imported raw
coal from abroad to make up for the domestic deficiency.
</P>
<P>
Customs statistics show that China spent 70 million US dollars
importing 1.51 million tons of coal in the January-June period, up
120 percent and 40 percent, respectively, from the corresponding
period of 1995.
</P>
<P>
Rising import and decreasing export have made China's net
export volume drop from 12.5 million tons to 9.94 million tons in
the first half of 1996, compared with the same period of last
year.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The MORO National Liberation
Front (MNLF) and the Philippine government agreed here today to
integrate 7,500 MORO troops to the Philippine armed forces and the
regional security forces, an official said.
</P>
<P>
Hasan Wirayuda, chairman of the fourth round of peace talks
between the MNLF and the Philippine government, said some 5,750
members of the former MORO military forces will join the
Philippine armed forces while 1,750 others will join the regional
security forces.
</P>
<P>
He said both sides at today's talks also agreed that MORO
troops who could not be integrated into the armed forces and the
regional security forces will be trained and employed as civil
servants.
</P>
<P>
"Both sides agreed that (the MORO troops) will be trained and
employed in the civil and economic sectors," said Wirayuda, who is
also director of international organizations at the Indonesian
Foreign Ministry, after chairing the first day's talks today.
</P>
<P>
"We should settle all problems today so that we could endorse
what we have achieved today on Thursday," he said.
</P>
<P>
The agreement will be initialed in the presence of Indonesian
President Soeharto on Friday before the formal signing ceremony in
Manila on September 2, he added.
</P>
<P>
Wirayuda said today's meeting has been grouped into three
commissions to have discussions on integrating the MORO troops
into the Philippine armed forces and regional security forces, on
drafting the final agreement, and on the role of the Organization
of Islamic Conference (OIC) during the transitional period.
</P>
<P>
During the fourth round of the talks, both sides will discuss
the details of how the MORO troops will join the armed forces, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia had chaired a meeting of the six members of the OIC
to broker the peace talks to end 25 years of fighting between MORO
rebels and Philippine government troops, which has cost 125,000
lives in southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia, the world's largest Muslim country, has hosted three
formal peace talks between the MNLF and the Philippine government
since 1993.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Defense Minister Leaves for Yemen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, August 28 (Xinhua) -- A high-level Saudi
delegation led by Second Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of
Defense and Aviation Prince Sultan Ibn Abdul-Aziz left Riyadh
today for Sanaa, reports reaching here from the Saudi capital said.
</P>
<P>
In the first such visit to Yemen by senior Saudi officials in
six years, Prince Sultan will meet Yemeni President Ali Abdullah
Saleh and hold talks with parliament speaker Abdullah Al-Ahmar on
security matters and bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The visit came as part of the consultations of the two
countries' Supreme Joint Committee in accordance with a
Sanaa-Riyadh memo of understanding, which was concluded in
February, 1995.
</P>
<P>
Means of bolstering the work of the sub-committees under the
Supreme Committee to solve the long-standing border issue,
including border demarcation, is expected to be high on the agenda
of talks between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The visit was considered to be very important by both countries.
Saudi officials said it would help solve the problems that had
strained bilateral relations for the past few years.
</P>
<P>
Saudi media, which usually reflect the government opinion,
highlighted the visit even several days before the event took
place today. They said the visit was an indication of the Saudi
desire to enhance ties and cooperation on a solid brotherly basis.
</P>
<P>
They said the two countries needed no mediation to solve their
differences because both sides knew how to deal with each other.
</P>
<P>
Yemeni people attach great importance to the visit, according
to the media.
</P>
<P>
The two neighboring countries had been locked in a 60-year-old
tension before they signed the Memorandum of Understanding on
solving the controversial border issue last year.
</P>
<P>
The two countries also signed two agreements last month, one
for security cooperation and the other for combating illicit
drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
Yemeni Parliament Speaker Abdullah Al-Ahmar visited Saudi
Arabia earlier this month.

Abdul-Aziz arrived here today, leading a high-ranking government

<HEADLINE> Hatoyama Quits Coalition Partner to Form New Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 28 (Xinhua) -- New Party Sakigake, the smallest
member of Japan's ruling coalition, was today set to split up as
its former number two Yukio Hatoyama quit to form a new reformist
political group and its leader Masayoshi Takemura said he would
resign as party president.
</P>
<P>
In a joint press conference with Sakigake President Masayoshi
Takemura after a marathon five-hour meeting, Hatoyama announced he
was leaving the party.
</P>
<P>
Takemura, who founded Sakigake in 1993, failed to resolve a
dispute with Hatoyama over the future of the party. He wanted
Sakigake's lawmakers to join the new political group en masse
along with like-minded Social Democrats, the second largest party
in the tripartite coalition.
</P>
<P>
But Hatoyama publicly opposed Takemura as a founding member of
the new group, as many of his prospective allies considered the
Sakigake leader tainted by his senior role in the coalition
government which is dominated by the conservative Liberal
Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
Takemura, finance minister until the beginning of this year,
helped pass an unpopular plan to use taxpayers' money to wind up
failed housing loan firms which ruined his reputation as a
reformer.
</P>
<P>
Takemura told the press conference, "Given the situation that
Mr. Hatoyama and his colleagues have gotten together (to form a
new party), I've realized that we could not find a third way. We
have to allow him to leave the party with a feeling of great
regret."
</P>
<P>
He said he intended to resign as party boss to take
responsibility for the confusion and to try to keep the party
together.
</P>
<P>
Hatoyama, who quit as the three-year-old Sakigake's secretary
general the previous day, said the party's principles and policies
"were not erroneous."
</P>
<P>
But he wanted to create a new, liberal reformist party "to
further develop Sakigake's line."
</P>
<P>
The new party wants to attract disenchanted voters to its
platform which calls for a transformation of Japanese society from
one led by bureaucrats to one led by citizens.
</P>
<P>
Hatoyama and six other legislators, including his younger
brother Kunio Hatoyama, a senior member of the leading opposition
party Shinshinto (New Frontier Party), have agreed to launch the
new party in mid-September and expect some 20 lawmakers, mainly
from Sakigake and the SDP, to join.
</P>
<P>
But the new political grouping is unlikely to immediately
destabilize the government, whose largest coalition partner is the
Liberal Democratic Party led by Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that the number of lawmakers likely to quit their
parties for the new group will fall far short of the 50 lawmakers
needed to topple the eight-month-old government.
</P>
<P>
However some media reports say Hashimoto, who must call a
general election by mid-1997, may dissolve parliament soon after
it reconvenes in early October.

<HEADLINE> Premier On Reconstruction Work In Flood-stricken Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, August 28 (Xinhua) -- China's Premier Li Peng
today urged local officials and residents in flood-stricken Hebei
Province to step up the reconstruction work in their areas.
</P>
<P>
Li began a two-day inspection tour of Hebei yesterday, visiting
areas that suffered from the torrential rainfalls and flooding
earlier this month, and expressed his sympathy for the local
people.
</P>
<P>
After listening to reports from the provincial government
officials, Li said that the central authorities are very concerned
about the disaster in Hebei, which surrounds the nation's capital.
</P>
<P>
In the past several weeks, local officials and residents have
made considerable progress in their struggle against the effects
of the worst flooding since 1963, and in protecting Beijing and
Tianjin. These efforts also paid off in protecting trunk
transportation and telecommunications lines.
</P>
<P>
Residents trapped by flooding were evacuated safely and their
daily lives are taken care of for the time being, while service
from a number of major facilities, such as power and
telecommunications that were damaged by the flooding, was promptly
restored.
</P>
<P>
Local governments and residents in the province have worked hard
to keep losses to a minimum and public order has been
maintained.
</P>
<P>
The premier asked local governments to continue to work hard to
ensure that there is adequate food and clothing for residents, and
to prevent the occurrence of epidemic diseases, with the winter
season coming on.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out that lessons should be learned from the
disaster, even if the nation has made great progress in improving
water conservation in the past few decades.
</P>
<P>
"For the Chinese nation, the danger of flooding has not been
removed and improving water controls is still arduous work," Li
pointed out, calling for an increase in water conservation. "We'd
rather have more water control projects than have some other
industrial projects."

<P>
Arafat left Gaza this morning for Ramallah aboard a Palestinian

legislative council, the Executive Committee of the Palestine
Liberation Organization (PLO) and members of the Palestine

position of last week on denying permission to Arafat's flight
from Gaza to Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, chaired by Arafat, will discuss the Israeli
expansion of Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza, which
is viewed as an offensive against Palestinian rights there.
</P>
<P>
The participants will also examine the recurring aggressions
against Arab inhabitants and properties in East Jerusalem, the
lastest case of which taking place Tuesday when Israelis tore down
a youth center in East Jerusalem, claiming that it was built
illegally with funds from Arafat's Palestinian Authority.
</P>
<P>
The agenda of the meeting also include the future of Jerusalem
and Israeli violation of the peace agreements between Israel and
the PLO.
</P>

Netanyahu of violating autonomy agreements and stalling
negotiations for a permanent peace agreement.

<HEADLINE> Major Reshuffle for Slovak Cabinet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Three key Slovak ministers were
replaced Tuesday in what's being seen as a bid to step up the
country's diplomatic and economic performance, local press
reported today.
</P>
<P>
President Michal Kovac replaced Economics Minister Jan Ducky
with Karol Cesnek, Foreign Minister Juraj Schenk with Pavol
Hamzik, and Interior Minister Ludovit Hudek with Gustav Krajci in
the country's first major cabinet reshuffle since the current
government came into power in December 1994.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference Tuesday in Bratislava, the Slovak capital,
Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar said Schenk's resignation for
"health reasons" had been accepted, but he did not specify the
reason for Ducky's resignation.
</P>
<P>
He said Hudek had been dismissed because of unrest among the
police, indicating a far-reaching reform of the force is imminent.
</P>
<P>
Karol Cesnek, 49, is a former general director of the state
power producer Slovenske Elektrarne, and Hamzik, 42, is the
current ambassador to Germany. Both of them, like the three
outgoing ministers, are members of Meciar's ruling Movement for
Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) party.
</P>
<P>
Krajci, 45, is an executive of the Bratislava branch of the
HZDS party.
</P>
<P>
While ruling out any further ministerial replacements, Meciar
predicted a reshuffle at the state secretarial level soon.
</P>
<P>
The moves were expected to breathe new life into the
ministries, which had been widely attacked for failing to boost
Slovakia's overseas image and poor economic and public security
performance.

<HEADLINE> Pakistani President Asks U.S. to Play Role in Afghan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani President Farooq
Leghari said today that the United States can play an important
role for an equitable solution of the Afghan problem and early
return of peace in the country.
</P>
<P>
Talking with visiting U.S. Congressman Dana Rohrabacher at the
Presidential House here, Leghari said that "the peace and
stability in Afghanistan will also immensely benefit the American
businessmen and investors from mega development projects."
</P>
<P>
The projects include oil and gas pipelines, the rail and road
links between the Central Asia and the rest of the world through
Afghanistan, he added.
</P>
<P>
The president said that the Afghans had suffered enormously
during the past 18 years and now they deserve peace and
development.
</P>
<P>
He said that "after Afghanistan, Pakistan has suffered most on
account of the Afghan war as we are left with massive arms
proliferation, fastest growing drug culture and about 1.4 million
Afghan refugees in Pakistan."
</P>
<P>
He also asked the U.S. to buy back its previous military
assistance to Afghanistan in an organized manner, in a bid to

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 28 (Xinhua) -- A seminar on economic
co-operation between Beijing and Taiwan was held today in Beijing,
with five hundred academics and industrial and commercial people
attending.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Premier Li Lanqing spoke at the opening ceremony, saying
that the two sides have had smooth economic relations in recent
years, and that cross-straits economic co-operation is in the
basic interest of the Chinese nation and is a common desire of the
industrial and commercial sectors on both sides.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that China's opening policy will not change, and
that the policy of promoting cross-straits economic co-operation
will also be carried out.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that President Jiang Zemin explained the Chinese
government's policy on this issue in his important speech in
January of last year.
</P>
<P>
Li said that this year is the first year of the Ninth Five-Year
Plan and the long-term plan for the Year 2000, and Taiwan business
people are welcome to participate in economic development in
inland areas.
</P>
<P>
In referring to the future development of cross-straits
relations, he said the basic principle of "peaceful reunification,
and one country, two systems" will still apply, and that he hopes
Taiwan's authorities will comply with the will of the people and
open direct postal, trade, shipping, and air links as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
He also assured Taiwanese investors that their legal rights
will be protected on the mainland, as a law on the protection of
investment of Taiwan compatriots has been passed by the National
People's Congress, and that specific rules of implementation are
being discussed.
</P>
<P>
Li Qiyan, mayor of Beijing, also spoke at the seminar, which

<HEADLINE> hke - Egypt Says Paris Meeting Explores New Ideas for Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 28 (Xinhua) -- A senior Egyptian diplomat said
here today that a meeting on Tuesday evening between Egypt, Israel
and the United States explored new ideas on how to move the Middle
East peace process forward.
</P>
<P>
But Oussama El Baz, political advisor to Egyptian president
Hosni Mubarak, stopped short of saying any "progress" was made on
re-starting the stalled peace process.
</P>
<P>
And he would not confirm whether Mubarak intended to carry out
his threat to cancel the international economic conference on the
Middle East and North Africa scheduled for November in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
"That remains to be seen," he said when asked whether the
conference would still go ahead.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian president has threatened to cancel the conference
if Israel does not take concrete steps to pursue the peace process
which has virtually come to a standstill since hard-liner Benjamin
Netanyahu was elected Israeli prime minister in May.
</P>
<P>
Dore Gold, political advisor to Netanyahu, and Dennis Ross,
U.S. Special Coordinator for the Middle East peace process, also
attended the meeting at an undisclosed Paris address.
</P>
<P>
El Baz said, "We explored our points of view and discussed all
subjects concerning the peace process, including Syria's role."
</P>
<P>
Peace negotiations between Israel and Syria have been stalled
for several months. An Israeli proposal to withdraw its troops
from south Lebanon in exchange for peace moves by Syria has been
rejected by Damascus.
</P>
<P>
El Baz also said that Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy will
go to Cairo on Sunday to meet his Egyptian counterpart, Amr
Moussa, who has just visited Damascus where he talked with Syrian
president Hafez El-Assad about the current situation in the Middle
East.
</P>
<P>
Israeli diplomats said Tuesday's meeting in Paris confirmed the
necessity of maintaining "periodic and in-depth dialogue on all
levels" between Israel and Egypt, although such dialogue is in its
initial stage.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The 15-year-old fairytale turned
nightmare marriage of the Prince and Princess of Wales ended today
after a London divorce court issued a decree absolute, Buckingham
Palace announced.
</P>
<P>
The decree absolute, which cost 20 pounds (30 U.S. dollars),
ends the marriage just six weeks after the pronouncement of the
initial decree.
</P>
<P>
The British heir to the throne married Lady Diana Spencer in
1981 after a romance which captured the hearts of the nation. But
within a few years the marriage had soured and after both partners
publicly confessed to infidelity after the breakdown of their
marriage, the Queen intervened and urged them to divorce.
</P>
<P>
The Prince and Princess, who have two sons, William and Harry,
had been separated for more than two years before their divorce.
</P>
<P>
The final divorce settlement remains confidential but is
thought to include a financial package worth at least 15 million
pounds (22.5 million dollars) for the Princess. But as part of the
deal, Diana was stripped of her title "Her Royal Highness."

<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Switzerland's population grew by
only 0.6 percent last year, to about 7 million, the weakest growth
since 1990, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
A 60 percent decline in the number of immigrants over the past
five years was the main factor behind the slowdown in population
growth, which fell from 1.3 percent in 1991 to 0.9 percent in
1993, the latest figures from the Federal Statistics Bureau show.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, 67.7 percent of Swiss people lived in
urban areas. But over the past five years, average population
growth of 1.6 percent in rural areas outstripped that of 0.6
percent in urban areas.
</P>
<P>
About one third of Switzerland's population lived in the five
big cities -- Zurich, Basel, Geneva, Berne, and Lausanne -- at the
end of 1995, official figures showed.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese investment in
Pakistan, which registered 30.5 million US dollars in 1993-94, has
increased by more than 100 percent in 1995-96.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed here today at a meeting of the
Pakistan-Japan Forum for Industry and Technology.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was informed that during this year Japanese
companies had invested 95.4 million dollars, out of which 82.1
million dollars came in as direct investment.
</P>
<P>
Increased flow of investment from Japan indicates the keenness
of the Japanese companies to take advantage of the
investor-friendly regime of Pakistan which has been aggressively
marketed through investment conferences, seminars and
international print media.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistan-Japan Forum is playing a major role in encouraging
Japanese investors to increase their investment in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting today, Federal Minister for Investment Asif Ali
Zardari expressed his keenness to have close working relationship
with the Japanese companies to attract more investment from the
country.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Pakistani government was ready to solve all
kinds of problems to satisfy foreign investors in Pakistan.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Cars to Be Asked to Install Additional Brake Lamps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 28 (Xinhua) -- A new regulation is to be
introduced in China to help reduce the number of accidents caused
by tailgating - driving too close to vehicles in front.
</P>
<P>
China's ministries concerned are drafting a regulation
demanding the installation of higher-position brake lights on
smaller motor vehicles. The aim is that drivers will indicate more
clearly to following motorists that they are braking.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Machine-Building Industry, Ministry of
Communications, Ministry of Public Security and State Science and
Technology Commission are speeding up the introduction of the
regulation, which is expected to be issued by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
All motor vehicles that carry less than eight people will be
required to be equipped with another tail lamp in the back-window
in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the State Science and Technology
Commission has listed a newly developed hi-tech electronic light
emission brake lamp into its 1996 high and new technology
promotion program.
</P>
<P>
The hi-tech lamp, jointly developed by Shanghai Automotive
Company, Shanghai N.S. Structure Company and Shanghai
N.S. Electric Engineering Company, has passed the appraisal of
State Science and Technology Commission and will soon go into mass
production.
</P>
<P>
At present, tailgating accounts for a high percentage of
traffic accidents on China's expressways and viaducts.
</P>
<P>
In Shanghai, 167 accidents on viaducts were reported in May
this year, and 50.8 percent of them were blamed on
tailgating.

Peace in the former Yugoslavia is also weak and threatened,

He said that "some people have tried to look for other ways and
to imagine alternatives. But there is no alternative. Any
alternative to the peace process means tensions and, perhaps, new
tragedies, tomorrow," he said.
</P>

On Bosnia, de Charette said that France will take new
initiatives to promote peace in the war-ravaged country, starting
with a ministerial conference to discuss the implementation of the

<HEADLINE> EDS-more details added Chinese President Meets With Nepalese King </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 28 (Xinhua) -- China's President Jiang Zemin
said here today that China and Nepal should have multi-faceted
economic and trade cooperation in various forms and at various
levels.
</P>
<P>
The remark came during a meeting here this evening with King
Birendra Bir Bikram Shah Dev of Nepal. Jiang said that the two
countries have maintained good political relations, and that
cooperation will benefit the two peoples.
</P>
<P>
Jiang welcomed the Nepalese King and Queen, who arrived in
Beijing at noon today from Chongqing in Sichuan Province, saying
that he is glad to meet with the King again, and noted that the
King has always given much attention to bilateral relations and to
promoting bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said he is convinced that the King's visit will improve
mutual understanding and friendship, and enhance bilateral
cooperation in various fields.
</P>
<P>
Birendra expressed his pleasure at visiting China again and at
meeting with Jiang, saying that the Chinese people's achievements
in building the country have once again given him with a wonderful
impression.
</P>
<P>
Jiang noted that China and Nepal are friendly neighbors with a
long friendship, who have no unresolved problems, and that
relations have developed smoothly since the two sides set up
diplomatic relations in 1955.
</P>
<P>
Jiang went on to say that China's Tibet Autonomous Region and
Nepal are neighbors, and it is pleasant to note that during the
past few years, there have been more exchanges and cooperation
between Tibet and Nepal, and expressed his appreciation for
Birendra's long and clear support for China's position on the
Tibet issue.
</P>
<P>
Birendra said that Nepal wants to see China prosperous and
strong, and hopes that China can play a bigger role in
international affairs.
</P>
<P>
In briefing the King on China's foreign policy and views on
international relations, Jiang said that China believes that all
countries, big or small, poor or rich, strong or weak, are equal
members of the international community.
</P>
<P>
He said further that each country's internal affairs should be
up to its people to decide, and that important world affairs
should be solved by all countries through equal consultation on
the basis of mutual respect.
</P>
<P>
Birendra said that it is necessary to establish a new
international relationship since the world is accelerating its
move towards multi-polarization, as Jiang often says, and that
Nepal and China can exchange views often and strengthen their
cooperation in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen was
present at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Jiang hosted a dinner in honor of the
Nepalese visitors.
</P>
<P>
The Nepalese King and his party visited Lhasa, the capital of
the Tibet Autonomous Region, and Chongqing before coming to
Beijing on his unofficial visit as Jiang's guest.

<P>
"The National Unification Board originally requested that the
cooperation fund be increased by 244 million dollars but at
yesterday's budget meeting between the administration and the
ruling (New Korea) party, it was increased by 122 million
dollars," the official said.
</P>
<P>
But another 122 million dollars will be added to the fund,
which currently totals 280.6 million dollars, at the end of this
financial year.

infrastructure projects in the Democratic People's Republic of
Korea.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, the fund has given more than 9 million
dollars to the DPRK -- 3 million dollars in food aid, 6 million

<HEADLINE> 7,000 Zimbabwean Civil Servants Dismissed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean Minister of Public
Service, Labor and Social Welfare Florence Chitauro said here
last night that about 7,000 civil servants will be given notices
of dismissal for failing to comply to orders to return to work
last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Chitauro said in a statement that heads of ministries, in
consultation with the Public Service Commission, spent the whole of
Tuesday serving notices of dismissal to the civil servants who had
been identified as having taken part in the recent strike.
</P>
<P>
The civil servants have been on strike for the past eight days
pressing for salary increments of up to 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday Chitauro ordered the strikers back to work while
negotiations were taking place, saying failing to do so they
would be fired. However, the civil servants defied this call.
</P>
<P>
President Robert Mugabe on Sunday criticized the strike action
and said this might be the government's chance to trim the civil
service which has about 180,000 people. enditem

<HEADLINE> 13th International Congress on Archives to Be Opened </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The 13th International Congress
on Archives, the last grand gathering of top world archivists this
century, is scheduled to open next Monday in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Over 2,600 archivists from more than 130 countries and regions
have entered their names for the 6-day congress, the first ever
held in a developing country since the founding of the
International Council on Archives (ICA) in 1950.
</P>
<P>
"Archives at the End of the Century - Reviewing the Situation
and Looking into the Future" is the theme of the congress, which
is expected to have a record number of delegates, half coming from
outside China.
</P>
<P>
Luo Gan, the Secretary General of the State Council and also
chairman of the Organizing Committee of the Beijing congress, said
that the congress will have a positive and profound impact on
protecting the world's archival heritage, maintaining real
historical features of mankind, exploiting archival information
resources, and promoting world peace and development.
</P>
<P>
Jean-Pierre Wallot, chairman of ICA, said that the reason the
ICA choose Beijing as the meeting-place is that China has made
great achievements in aspects of economy, society and protection
of archives in the past years.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that China was devoted to archives protection
more than 4,000 years ago, and now it boasts some one million
archivists, the largest number for a single country. China has the
world's only professional newspaper on archives, the "China
Archives News". All these make China's archival work occupy an
important role in global archival circles.
</P>
<P>
The congress will be attended by the most outstanding archival
experts from around the world, who are to discuss the history and
future of archival work in various countries, global trends in
legislation on archives, the development strategy of international
archival circles and other important issues.
</P>
<P>
A series of academic activities will be held around the theme
of the congress, and these will include wide-ranging discussions
on the four principal papers and 15 subsidiary papers.
</P>
<P>
During the congress period, 11 exhibitions are scheduled to be
held and the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications will issue
four commemorative stamps on archives.
</P>
<P>
In 1980, China joined the International Council on Archives,
which now has more than 1,500 members from over 150 countries and
regions.
</P>
<P>
In 1988, China obtained the right to host the congress. It
promulgated and put into operation the Archives Law of the
People's Republic of China that year.
</P>
<P>
Currently, China boasts of over 70 kinds of professional
publications and 3,574 archives at various levels, containing 176
million volumes.

<HEADLINE> Major Reshuffle for Slovak Cabinet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Three key Slovak ministers were
replaced today in what's being seen as a bid to step up the
country's diplomatic and economic performance, local press
reported today.
</P>
<P>
President Michal Kovac replaced Economics Minister Jan Ducky
with Karol Cesnek, Foreign Minister Juraj Schenk with Pavol
Hamzik, and Interior Minister Ludovit Hudek with Gustav Krajci in
the country's first major cabinet reshuffle since the current
government came into power in December 1994.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference today in Bratislava, the Slovak capital,
Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar said Schenk's resignation for
"health reasons" had been accepted, but he did not specify the
reason for Ducky's resignation.
</P>
<P>
He said Hudek had been dismissed because of unrest among the
police, indicating a far-reaching reform of the force is imminent.
</P>
<P>
Karol Cesnek, 49, is a former general director of the state
power producer Slovenske Elektrarne, and Hamzik, 42, is the
current ambassador to Germany. Both of them, like the three
outgoing ministers, are members of Meciar's ruling Movement for
Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) party.
</P>
<P>
Krajci, 45, is an executive of the Bratislava branch of the
HZDS party.
</P>
<P>
While ruling out any further ministerial replacements, Meciar
predicted a reshuffle at the state secretarial level soon.
</P>
<P>
The moves were expected to breathe new life into the
ministries, which had been widely attacked for failing to boost
Slovakia's overseas image and poor economic and public security
performance.

the second of a five-phase election, which began on August 18 in
Mount Lebanon to choose 128 members to the

political parties, such as the Christian mainstream Phalange
Party, the Arab Socialist Baath Party and the National Syrian
Social Party.

and another led by his cousin Ahmed Karami.

Pro-government candidates scored a crushing victory over
oppositions by winning 32 of 35 seats in the predominantly
Christian Mount Lebanon, and among the winners are five cabinet
ministers.
</P>
<P>
Three remaining rounds of elections are to be held in Beirut on
September 1, in southern Lebanon on September 8 and in the Beqaa
on September 15.

<HEADLINE> New Population Float Trend: Through A Young Girl's Whistling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Yang Tao, 23, from southwest
China's Sichuan province, leaned against a tree in Beijing's
Chang'an Avenue, looking quietly at the city before her.
</P>
<P>
She had seen the city hundreds of times on the television
screen. But when she first arrived in Beijing she felt as though
she was standing in a picture or a dream.
</P>
<P>
In fact her journey to China's capital was probably her dream
fulfilled.
</P>
<P>
Her thoughts turned to a remarkable talent which she had
taught herself - whistling. She was able to produce amazing
sounds, just with her mouth.
</P>
<P>
Yang Tao wondered whether there were any world records about
whistling, and she pondered on entering the record books with her
own skill.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that Beijing will welcome people who have some kind
of talent, I also believe that Beijing is just the place for me to
develop my future," she told her friends when she decided to leave
her hometown, Leshan city in Sichuan province.
</P>
<P>
Ten years ago, large numbers of her townsfolk, just as young as
Yang, made the journey of hope to Beijing, just like she did.
They came to Beijing because they had relatives or friends in the
city, and they worked as pedlars, or housekeepers to earn a modest
living.
</P>
<P>
Ten years later Yang Tao has come to Beijing. Not like those
before her, she came here to realize her dream, but in Beijing she
had no one to turn to.
</P>
<P>
In Beijing Yang is still a non-local. In the statistics she is
among the thousands of "floating population" currently living in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
But she is not like the women who came from Anhui province some
years ago who everyday sat by the side of the Third Ring road
repairing shoes for passers-by.
</P>
<P>
Neither is she like the girl came from Hebei province some
years ago who spends every day selling "the newest" map of Beijing
under the flyover near the World Trade Tower.
</P>
<P>
She belongs to the group of young singers, painters, writers
and actors who have come from other wide and far in China to
develop their talents and fame in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
A scholar who has studied urban problems for more than ten
years recently made the following comment:
</P>
<P>
"After more than 10 years of reforms, and with more and more
high buildings going up, Beijing is now saying goodbye to the
time when there was a huge immigration of low quality laborers."
</P>
<P>
Yang Tao, who came to Beijing to develop her talent heralds the
a new trend of a higher quality immigrant population with her
skill at whistling, the scholar added.
</P>
<P>
After eight months Yang's whistling has at last won fame all
over the city through the airwaves of Beijing Music Radio and
other media.
</P>
<P>
A report from the Music Life News describes her ability: "the
whistling of this young girl has astonished many ears of both
Beijingers and outsiders".
</P>
<P>
One French businessman pleaded with her: "Yang, I will take you
to Paris to produce a special tape of your whistling."
</P>
<P>
She rejected the offer, insisting that "Beijing is also an
international cultural center, and new masterpiece of art will
also be produced in Beijing".
</P>
<P>
The Beijing TV Station is now considering producing a TV
program featuring Yang.
</P>
<P>
For Yang Tao, Beijing has "accumulated enough earth" for her
"to grow" and, Yang and those young singers, painters, writers as
well as performing artists will hopefully realize their dreams in
a more prosperous Beijing.

government will stick to the practice, he said.
</P>
<P>

non-alliance and opposing foreign interference, as well as its
efforts to spur the economic development in the Latin-American
region, cement the unity and cooperation of developing countries,
and safeguard peace and development in the world.
</P>
<P>
Hu also extended his thanks for Colombia's support to China in
international affairs.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the CPC attaches great importance to its
friendly ties with the Liberal Party and other friendly parties in
Colombia, and would like to enhance Sino-Colombian ties by
strengthening relations between parties.
</P>
<P>
Lebolo said that the current China visit is aimed at learning
China's experience in developing its economy.
</P>
<P>
Lebolo and his party are here at the invitation of the
International Department of the CPC Central Committee.

<HEADLINE> APEC Energy Ministers' Conference Opens In Sydney </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The Asia Pacific region is set
to be the main driver of global economic growth into the next
century, while energy is the key to the region becoming the main
driver of global economic growth.
</P>
<P>
This was stated by Australian Minister for Resources and
Energy, Warwick Parer, while opening the inaugural meeting of the
Energy Ministers from 18 member economies of the Asia Pacific
Economic Co-operation (APEC) in Sydney today, a media release
said.
</P>
<P>
"Economic growth is forecast to average 3.3 percent compared to
2.5 percent for the OECD, and will be even higher for the newly
industrialized economies of Southeast Asia".
</P>
<P>
However, as the APEC leaders identified at a meeting in Osaka
last November, energy was a potential bottleneck to sustainable
economic growth. Parer said, energy sector is very fertile ground
for mutual benefits through co-operation, "our resource endowment
and energy needs differ, our economic characteristics differ, this
presents opportunities for trade, investment and co-operation to
the benefit of all".
</P>
<P>
In today's conference, the ministers decided to work towards
cutting red tape involved in tendering and approval processes for
electricity projects in the region.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, they also agreed to consider cutting energy
subsidies and introduce pricing practices to reflect the economic
costs of energy supply.
</P>
<P>
The conference will continue tomorrow.

<HEADLINE> No Worry About Slowdown in Asian Export Growth: Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 28 (Xinhua) -- There is no evidence of common
trends pointing to a long-term loss of external competitiveness
nor is it the beginning of the end of the exports-driven era of
fast growth in Asia's economies, according to Salomon Brothers,
one of the world's leading investment banks.
</P>
<P>
Andrew Freris, Salomon's chief regional economist, said that
the current decline in export growth in Asia's economies reflects
a series of cyclical and country-specific developments.
</P>
<P>
He added that contrary to interpretations by some observers
that the region's exports competitiveness is being eroded or there
are underlying structural problems.
</P>
<P>
He said that as some developments in 1996 reflect cyclical
forces, rather than structural changes, 1997 should offer
opportunities to re-examine the prospects for Singapore and South
Korea, both of which are currently experiencing cyclical
slowdowns.
</P>
<P>
He said that the slowdown in exports for many economies in 1996
was due to a number of factors, with a slowdown in intra-regional
trade playing an important role.
</P>
<P>
Asian intra-regional trade, which accounts for about 35 percent
of all imports and exports, has impacted overall exports growth as
a number of the large Asian economies experiencing recessions over
1995-96, he said.
</P>
<P>
The slowdown in GDP growth in a number of Asian economies,
which is a result of restrictive fiscal and monetary policies
designed to rein in inflation or cap widening current account
deficits, reduced also the rate of import growth.
</P>
<P>
Thailand and Malaysia are expected to see GDP growth fall from
8.6 percent in 1995 to eight percent in 1996 and from 9.5 percent in
1995 to 8.5 percent in 1996 respectively.
</P>
<P>
In Hong Kong, partially as a result of the slowdown of
re-exports to and from the Chinese mainland, total export growth
fell to 4.4 percent in the first half of this year, down from the
18.2 percent growth registered in the same period in 1995. Total
imports growth also fell to 3.1 percent from 15 percent from the
same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
South Korea has experienced an investment-driven period of high
growth which started to end as the semiconductor cycle peaked.
Salomon Brothers expects the South Korean economy to grow by eight
percent in 1996, decreasing from the nine percent growth in 1995.

<P>
Guangzhou, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Guangdong Province, south
China, has adopted a new regulation to curb the overuse of farm
land for development of new cities.
</P>
<P>
The regulation stipulates that land in farm land protection
areas is not allowed, in all cases, to be used by any units or
individuals.
</P>
<P>
If a non-agricultural construction project needs to use a

<P>
The province will also regulate the use of land for various
kinds of development zones and township enterprises.
</P>
<P>
In the past decade or so, the province has added 12 cities at

have occupied more than 800,000 hectares of land, half of it
farmland.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Russian Olympic swimming champion
Alexander Popov was recovering stably after being stabbed in a
street row, an official said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The 24-year-old Popov, whose sprint freestyle victories in
Atlanta gave him recognition as the world's fastest swimmer, was
in a stable condition, said Russian Swimming Federation President
Gennady Aleshin.
</P>
<P>
Popov has been transferred to a clinic which treats top
officials. He was initially operated on in Hospital No. 31 after
being stabbed in the abdomen late on Saturday in an argument with
roadside watermelon sellers in south-west Moscow.
</P>
<P>
The wound had affected one of his lungs and a kidney.
</P>

In Atlanta last month, the Russian swimmer became the first
swimmer to retain the Olympic 50 and 100 meters freestyle titles.
</P>
<P>
Police said on Wednesday that they had detained two suspects in
connection with the stabbing, but the knife-wielder was still at
large.

<HEADLINE> COSCO Holds First Crew Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The first meeting of crew
members of China Ocean Shipping (Group) Corporation, the country's
national flag carrier, was held today in Beijing, with more than
400 delegates from COSCO's branches represented.
</P>
<P>
The contradiction of supply exceeding demand is being
intensified in international shipping markets, with an estimated
ten percent surplus in shipping capacity for the coming few years,
said Lei Hai, deputy president of COSCO.
</P>
<P>
In addition, shipping companies from Europe, America, and Japan
are squeezing into Chinese market, which was opened only a few
years ago, posing a threat to state-owned COSCO, he warned.
</P>
<P>
The crew meeting was aimed at informing COSCO's employees about
the situation, and efforts that need to be made to tide over the
difficulties, Lei said.
</P>
<P>
According to Lei, COSCO's fleet, one of the world's largest
shipping businesses, has increased to nearly 600 vessels, from
only four vessels when it was founded, and its number of employees
has risen to more than 47,000, from several hundred in the
beginning.
</P>
<P>
He said that COSCO will gradually improve treatment for its
crew, strengthen management and training for them during the Ninth
Five-Year Plan (1996-2000).
</P>
<P>
COSCO will set up special companies to take charge of
management of its crew at its headquarters and branches. The
companies will run themselves and provide a paid service, Lei
said.
</P>
<P>
China's vice-minister of communications Liu Songjin was
present at the meeting.

<HEADLINE> Regulations On Direct Shipping Cause Concern in Fujian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Two sets of regulations on the
management of direct shipping across the Taiwan Straits have drawn
wide repercussion in east China's Fujian province, which faces the
island.
</P>
<P>
The set of methods on the handling of shipping was issued by
the Ministry of Communications, and another that oversees cargo
transport agents was handed down by the Ministry of Foreign Trade
and Economic Co-operation.
</P>
<P>
After the regulations were published, Chinese mainland
businesses and others from Taiwan said they wanted to open direct
shipping service as early as possible. They asked the provincial
authorities if there will be specific rules on the service.
</P>
<P>
The regulations designated Fuzhou and Xiamen, both major port
cities in the province, as the mainland ports open to direct
shipping business across the straits.
</P>
<P>
The two ports are among the top ten in China. They can easily
accommodate direct shipping service between the mainland and the
island, as they have a handling capacity of 500,000 TEU of cargo
containers each and have built wharves for passenger traffic,
according to port authorities.
</P>
<P>
More capital will be injected into improving basic facilities
at the two ports, said an official with the provincial transport
authorities. And the customs, commodities inspection and port of
entry departments will formulate specific measures to service
direct shipping across the straits.
</P>
<P>
Tang Hanqing, deputy director of the Transport Administration,
said that the ten-plus ports in the province specially for trade
across the straits will maintain their present status.
</P>
<P>
He added that the special policies granted to these ports will
not be affected by the new regulations, nor will Fujian's status
as the leading area for indirect shipping between the Chinese
mainland and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Direct cargo shipping service will boost trade along the
Straits, said some Taiwanese businesspeople stationed in
Fujian. And Taiwanese businesses can save large amounts on
transport cost and time, and enhance the competitiveness of their
exports.
</P>
<P>
Direct shipping services will also create more business
opportunities for both Fujian and Taiwanese shipping companies.

<HEADLINE> US Says Singapore Has World's Most Open Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The United States has praised
Singapore for having one of the world's most open investment
regimes, Singapore Television reported today.
</P>
<P>
It said that a report, which was prepared by the US Embassy
here and released today, said that Singapore's economy is based on
free enterprise with strong government participation and guidance.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the US Embassy report said that Singapore's
investment policies are transparent. Last year, the US investment
accounted for 43 percent of the foreign commitments and were
mainly in the petroleum, chemical and electronics industries.
</P>
<P>
The report noted that in Singapore, there are no taxes on
capital gains and no restriction on foreign ownership of
businesses. Now there are some 1,200 US companies operating in
Singapore, with a combined cumulative assets worth some 9.51
billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
They, like multinationals of other countries, value Singapore
as a gateway to the fast-expanding South and East Asian markets,
it said.
</P>
<P>
The report also noted that in Singapore, investment
restrictions were limited to armament manufacturing, news media,
telecommunications, broadcasting, property ownership and domestic
banks.
</P>
<P>
Except for these areas, the report said, the Singapore
government does not restrict or discourage investments to protect
local industries or for any other reason.
</P>
<P>
The US report also praised Singapore for its excellent
labor-management relations, corruption-free administration, and
its regulatory environment characterized by clarity, fair
competition and sound business practice, the television said.

<HEADLINE> S. African Police Chase UFO Over Pretoria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 28 (Xinhua) -- An unidentified flying
object (UFO) over Pretoria was chased by a police helicopter
until it disappeared in the early hours of today, police
spokesman Captain Dave Harrington said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in Pretoria this morning, Harrington
said the strange object with a greenish glimmer, was first
spotted hanging about 30 meters above the ground at about 4 a.m.
by police from Adriaan Vlok police station in Centurion south of
Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
''It was a bright light surrounded by a circle of red dots,''
said Harrington, adding the object was also noticed on radar
screens at Johannesburg international airport and Waterkloof air
base near Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
''The police chase the object by car for about 100 kilometers
in the direction of Cullinan, northeast of Pretoria,'' Harrington
said. ''It kept on moving away from them, and they alerted other
police vehicles by radio, which joined in the chase.''
</P>
<P>
By about 5.30 a.m., a police helicopter was dispatched. It
approached the object where it had come to a standstill over
Cullinan before gaining height and moving away again.
</P>
<P>
At about 9,000 feet the helicopter gave up the chase as the
object disappeared at dawn.
</P>
<P>
Harrington also said the police helicopter pilot had confirmed
with Waterkloof air base that a strange object had been noticed
on their radar screens.
</P>
<P>
However, he added it was a moonlit night, and there could be
many explanations for the object.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an air traffic control spokesman at Johannesburg
international airport said he was not aware of any strange
objects having been picked up on radar screens.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Opens New Chang'an Theater </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The Chang'an Theater, one of the
most famous theaters in Beijing, has reopened again among a
cluster of modern buildings after it was demolished six years ago.
</P>
<P>
Several noted theaters in the Chinese capital were demolished
and relocated one after another over the past six years.
</P>
<P>
With an area of 20,000 square meters, the new Chang'an Theater
is equipped with state-of-the-art lighting and audio equipment and
has more than 800 seats.
</P>
<P>
These theaters were relocated because most of them were
dilapidated and they stood in the way of urban development,
according to Pan Hongye, who is in charge of the new theater's
management.
</P>
<P>
But the demolition meant that the theaters were resurrected
from oblivion, he said.
</P>
<P>
The theater will go into formal operation in September. Beijing
(Peking) opera as well as some other local operas will be staged
at the new Chang'an.

<P>
BEIJING, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Heads of the world's national

PARIS, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The Organization for the Security and Cooperation in Europe
(OSCE) has decided to postpone the municipal elections in Bosnia
scheduled for September 14 because of irregularity in the
registration of Serb voters. Six other elections required by the
Dayton peace agreement are to be held as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
-- In Bosnia, two in three people have changed their living
places since the out-break of the war. The former owners of
houses and apartments are afraid that their properties will be
confiscated and arbitrarily attributed to others by the new
government yet to come out of future elections. Moreover, 60
percent of the houses were damaged by the war, and 20 percent
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
-- In Chicago, the Democratic Convention is being held near the
ghetto but far from the poor. About 150,000 of a population of
2.7 million of the metropolis are living in ghettos which look
like the bombed cities of Europe in 1944. The inhabitants of the
ghetto are expecting nothing from the presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- President Jacques Chirac Tuesday returned to the Elysee
Presidential Palace after having a two-week vacation. The
president is faced with two toughest problems: illegal immigration
and separatism in Corsica.
</P>
<P>
-- The World Congress Against Commercial Sexual Exploitation of
Children, which is being held in Stockholm, is stressing this
fact: Many of the rich in the world are viciously abusing the
poor by paying a new global cartel of child sex which is
victimizing one million children around the world each year.
</P>
<P>
-- In Bangkok and other cities of Thailand, there are 800,000
to two million children who are being abused in an immense child
sex market. The sex industry has an impact on neighboring
Myanmar, from where children are being smuggled on the same route
as drugs.

<HEADLINE> Zambian President to Meet Opposition Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba is intended to meet opposition party leaders on a
one-on-one base soon to discuss various issues affecting the
country.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by Richard Sakala, presidential aide for
press and public relations, here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Sakala said that he is communicating with leaders of various
opposition parties to range meetings between them and the
president.
</P>
<P>
''The president will first meet leaders of these parties at
State House individually before we could possibly convene a
meeting where all of them can come together and discuss,'' Sakala
said.
</P>
<P>
He noted, ''we feel bilateral dialogue is important at the
moment before other formats can be considered. We want to give
opposition leaders premium so there could be mutual understanding
by ensuring they are not tied to specific issues.''
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that Chiluba will meet one president of a party
as soon as formalities for the meeting are finalized. but he
declined to say who will be the first one to meet Chiluba.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that there will be no agenda or any
conditionality to the meetings to ensure all leaders of the
parties are given a chance to discuss various issues with Chiluba
and there is no time table for the talks.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba announced on August 25 that he will meet Kenneth
Kaunda, leader the country's major opposition United National
Independence Party (UNIP) and former state president, and leaders
of other opposition parties to promote dialogue and ease tension
before the forthcoming general elections scheduled later this
year.
</P>
<P>
The UNIP and other major opposition parties have all taken a
positive response to Chiluba's initiative, hoping solutions will
be found out to the present political strife over a controversial
constitution amendment which actually bars Kaunda from running
for the presidency. enditem

<HEADLINE> Release of Opposition Leaders Demanded in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's opposition Inter-Party
Alliance demanded on Tuesday immediate release of eight
opposition leaders before a proposed dialogue between President
Frederick Chiluba and opposition leaders, the Post newspaper
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Inter-Party Alliance made the demand at a meeting here of
secretaries of eight opposition parties, which include the
biggest opposition United National Independence Party (UNIP) led
by former President Kenneth Kaunda.
</P>
<P>
Afther the meeting, senior UNIP official Mwangala Zaloumis
said that ''if President Chiluba means well, he should release
the eight UNIP leaders accused of treason before the talks
commence.''
</P>
<P>
But Michael Sata, Minister without Portfolio and National
Secretary of the ruling Movement for Multi-Democracy, described
on Tuesday the demand as ''childish''.
</P>
<P>
He said ''the demand is obnoxious, vexatious and a
non-starter.''
</P>
<P>
Chiluba announced last Sunday that he will meet Kaunda and
other opposition leaders to discuss the country's political
matters.
</P>
<P>
The eight UNIP leaders were arrested last June on charges of
involvement in the bomb blasts and being behind a terrorist
group. enditem

<HEADLINE> China Has 1,700 Children's Libraries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 28 (Xinhua) -- More than 1,700 children's
libraries have been built in China.
</P>
<P>
There are more than 350 million children in the country and
over 200 million of them can read.
</P>
<P>
Children's libraries began to flourish in China in the early
1980s. In 1980, China issued a document requiring that children's
libraries must be built in all medium-sized cities and above, and
districts in major cities.
</P>
<P>
Many of the libraries are equipped with audio-visual equipment,
and even computers. The Hunan Provincial Children's Library in
central China and Shenzhen Children's Library in south China, both
under construction, each cover an area of more than 12,000 square
meters.
</P>
<P>
For Chinese parents who are convinced that books are the way to
their children's success, the libraries have opened a new horizon
to complement families and schools.
</P>
<P>
The development of children's intelligence at an early stage is
becoming a vogue. Many children's libraries are open to infants
and their mothers.
</P>
<P>
An increasing number of mobile libraries enable children in
remote areas, welfare institutions and reformatories to have
access to books.

<HEADLINE> African Countries Urged to Fight Child Labor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian Minister of
Labor Sebastian Kinyondo on Tuesday urged African governments,
employers and workers to take measures to prevent employment of
children in their respective institutions.
</P>
<P>
Opening a four-day sub-regional techinical workshop on child
labor in Dar es Salaam, the minister said although the family was
primarily responsible for the welfare of children, governments
must provide the enabling economic and social environment.
</P>
<P>
"Employers may facilitate the combat against child labor in
commercial agriculture by building day-care centers on
plantations which will tend to children while their parents work
on the farms," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kinyondo said workers' organizations should advocate strongly
against the employment of children while trade unions might
integrate the aspect in their workers' education programs.
</P>
<P>
The minister said due to various developments taking place in
the agricultural sector throughout the world, children were now
exposed to dangerous machinery and chemicals which were unknown
to them a few years ago and could put them under risk.
</P>
<P>
"In most cases they are not provided with protective gear
which is usually statutory provided to adult workers in the same
sector and for the same job," he said.
</P>
<P>
He told the workshop a recent survey on child labour in sugar
plantations of eastern Tanzania revealed that about 40 percent of
primary school age children were working part-time on the
plantations under hazardous conditions and with little pay.
</P>
<P>
"If we are to acknowledge this fact then we should not allow
these children to work in hazardours or unsafe conditions,"
Kinyondo stressed.
</P>
<P>
An expert of a child labour elimination program from the ILO
office in Geneva, Philipe Egger, said that an international labor
conference in 1998 would eleborate on a new standard on the
elimination of the most intolerable aspects of child labor.
</P>
<P>
He named these aspects as employment of children in slave-like
and bonded conditions, children's employment in hazardous
environments, exploitation of very young children and commercial
sex exploitation of children.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the workshop is to compare experience of
various countries in combating child labor with a focus on
commercal agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Countries represented at the meeting include Sudan, Kenya,
Uganda, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Ethiopia, Mozambique, South Africa and
the host Tanzania.  enditem

<HEADLINE> Legislators Hear Reports on Economic Situation, Draft Laws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The current 21st session of the
Eighth National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee held
its plenary meeting in Beijing today. It heard a report on the
enforcement so far this year of the annual plan for the national
economy and social development.
</P>
<P>
The latest revisions to three draft laws, expected to be
adopted tomorrow, were also tabled for further deliberation.
</P>
<P>
Chen Jinhua, minister in charge of the State Planning
Commission, said in his report that due to efforts by various
departments and localities to transform the economic structure and
mode of economic growth for the establishment of a market
economy and more profits, rein in on inflation, the country has
continued to maintain an excellent trend in economic development,
and the macro-level economic environment has been further improved
this year.
</P>
<P>
The value of national domestic production in the first half of
1996 was 9.8 percent higher than the same time in 1995, hitting
2,975.6 billion yuan (358.5 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Summer crops yielded 114.1 billion kilograms, a new record of
its kind for the country, according to Chen. The increase rate in
retail sales price in the first seven months was curbed at 6.9
percent over the same 1995 period, and consumption price growth
rate was at 9.1 percent, both controlled to single-digits for nine
and seven months respectively.
</P>
<P>
Investment, consumption, financial and international
expenditure and incomes have basically stayed within the limits of
the annual macro-economic plan, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Xue Ju, chairman of the NPC Law Committee, said that the three
draft laws -- protecting the rights and interests of old people,
amendments to the law on mineral resources, and a new law on the
coal industry -- are basically feasible.
</P>
<P>
He told the meeting of further changes to the three drafts,
taking in revisions following opinions by the legislators.
</P>
<P>
An addition has been made to the draft law on the elderly, saying
that the state shall increase pensions for the retired linked to
economic development and increases in incomes.
</P>
<P>
The draft also decided that elderly people in difficult
financial circumstances may obtain legal assistance if they want
to take out a lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
However, the latest draft cancelled articles declaring
September 9 in the Chinese lunar calendar as "Senior Citizens'
Day," as well as abolishing a duty included in the first draft
requiring children-in-law to support the elderly, for the
country's marriage law does not offer them the right of
inheritance.
</P>
<P>
However, the draft still says that the practice of family
support for the elderly should still be promoted as a "fine and
excellent" Chinese tradition.
</P>
<P>
The latest draft on the amendments to the law on mineral
resources, and the draft law on the coal industries, added many
stipulations on giving further protection to the resources, the
environment and the safety of workers.
</P>
<P>
Qiao Shi, chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, attended the
meeting today, which was presided over by vice-chairman Tomur
Dawamat.

<HEADLINE> China Plans Largest Library for Blind in World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The China Library for the Blind
is vying to become the largest of its kind in the world within 15
years.
</P>
<P>
The library, opened two years ago, plans to realize the goal by
setting up a borrow-and-lend network, involving 100,000 blind
people, or one percent of the country's total, and mailing them
books they need free of charge, according to curator Song
Jianmin. He is also head of the Braille Publishing House of China.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that only 21 percent of the 770,000 blind
people in China have received a primary school education or
above. The Braille Publishing House of China, set up in 1953, is
far from meeting the needs of blind people. Although special
reading rooms have been opened for the blind in many cities, they
are not fully utilized.
</P>
<P>
According to Chinese regulations, braille publications are
exempted from mail charges.
</P>
<P>
At present, 4,000 blind people have joined the network.
</P>
<P>
Song predicted that the variety of braille publications in
China will reach 50,000 in 15 years and total 2.5 million
copies. Electronic technology and improving living standards will
also give blind people more access to speaking books and
computer-aided reading facilities.

<HEADLINE> Australia's Foreign Debt Rises in 1995-96 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Australia's net foreign debt
rose to a new high of 187.8 billion Australian dollars (146.5
billion U.S. dollars) in the 1995-96 fiscal year, the Australian
Bureau of Statistics (ABS) said today.
</P>
<P>
According to an ABS survey of international investments in the
country, the net foreign debt rose by 1.4 percent in the June
quarter, from 184.8 billion Australian dollars (144 billion U.S.
dollars) in the March quarter.
</P>
<P>
The main contributor to the higher foreign debt result was an
increase in foreign borrowings by the private sector, said the
ABS.
</P>
<P>
The increase would have been larger but for an improvement in
the exchange rate, with the stronger Australian dollar shaving
1.554 billion Australian dollars (1.2 billion U.S. dollars) from
the net debt result.
</P>
<P>
The ratio of the net foreign debt to the gross domestic product
(GDP) for the year ending June 1996 was 38.6 percent, 1.3 percent
lower than in the 12 months to the end of June 1995.
</P>
<P>
The country's public sector debt accounted for 36.8 percent of
the net foreign debt, down from 37.8 percent in the March quarter,
and 39.2 percent in June 1995.
</P>
<P>
Underlying the increase during the June quarter was an increase
in foreign investment in Australia which rose by 6.5 billion
Australian dollars (5 billion U.S. dollars).

He also listed a number of problems that have cropped up in
economic operations, including lower economic returns, difficulty
in the operation of some state-owned enterprises, serious flooding

He urged that close attention be paid to solving the problems,
efforts be made to accelerate the pace of reform and more
effective measures be taken.
</P>
<P>
He said that in the remaining months of this year a good job

</P>
<P>
-- Concentrating on stepping up the undertaking of priority
construction projects and technological upgrading projects;
</P>
<P>
-- Continuing to curb inflation;
</P>
<P>
-- Speeding up the shift of the operational mechanisms in
export-led enterprises and manufacturers, lowering their
production costs, stimulating the increase in exports, and
continuing to utilize foreign funds effectively; and
</P>
<P>
-- Launching the "re-employment" project, training more
laid-off workers and guiding redundant rural laborers to move in
an orderly manner, and introducing in major cities a minimum wage
system, and a system under which the government provides
allowances or subsidities to those whose living expenses are below
the government-set ceiling.

The slope is located five km south of Anyang City in central

</P>
<P>
Scientists have been trying to explain the phenomenon, but to
no avail.
</P>
<P>
When it gets warm in March on the Chinese lunar calendar, a
spring at the back of the slope begins to ice up. While the
temperature rises, the ice grows thicker and covers an area of 600
square meters in midsummer.
</P>

When it turns cold in mid-autumn, the ice begins to melt. While
the earth is covered with ice in the winter time, the spring

<HEADLINE> UN Helps 500,000 Chinese Farmers Escape Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
TAIYUAN, August 28 (Xinhua) -- A U.N.-assisted agricultural
development project has helped more than 500,000 farmers in the
middle section of the Taihang Mountains escape poverty.
</P>
<P>
Development of the area is being financed by the International
Agricultural Development Fund and the provincial government at a
cost of 280 million yuan (about 33.7 million US dollars), half of
which comes from foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
Local people have used these funds to build water conservation
facilities, improve medium- and low-yield farmland, and accelerate
construction of facilities to ward off natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
Last year, grain production in the area rose 55 million
kilograms. Each person's average annual income increased more than
200 yuan, despite a severe spring drought, autumn floods and an
early frost.
</P>
<P>
Over the past five years, the project has greatly improved
local agricultural production conditions. An official from the
fund, an organization of the U.N. World Food Council, said that he
has visited more than 100 agricultural development projects in 40
countries, but none of them has been as successful as the Taihang
project.
</P>
<P>
In Yushe County, construction of a 54-km-long river dyke is
completed, and high-efficiency ecological farmland has been
developed, with surrounding irrigation channels, water supplies,
woods and roads.
</P>
<P>
Local officials said their success lies in the development of
agriculture through the promotion of natural advantages in the
mountains. By increasing the planting area of mulberry orchards
from 1,100 to 3,300 hectares, cocoon production in Xixian County
has risen to one million kg annually. Cocoon-silk trade has become
a leading industry of the county.
</P>
<P>
By introducing fine varieties of seeds, efficient methods for
raising cocoons and water-saving methods, the project has helped
to spread the use of science and technology among farmers and
given a shot in the arm to agricultural development there.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Supreme Court Upholds Renewing U.S. Base Leases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The Supreme Court of Japan today
rejected an appeal by Masahide Ota, Governor of Okinawa, and
ordered him to sign documents for renewing the leases of U.S.
military bases on the Japanese island.
</P>
<P>
The top court's decision upheld a ruling by the Fukuoka High
Court last March, which Ota had refused to comply with and made an
appeal to the Supreme Court, according to a court official.
</P>
<P>
At least 35 landlords who owned the land leased to the U.S.
military bases had refused to renew their land.
</P>
<P>
Governor Ota supported the idea, saying that the forced leasing
violated the owners' property rights and the constitution.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government would make further decision if Ota did
not want to change his mind.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. troops stationed in Japan leased a total of 35,000
square meters of land, including an air base, a marine base, three
communications sites, an air force ammunition store and naval port
facilities. Most of them will expire in May next year.
</P>
<P>
Outrage broke out after a 12-year-old Japanese girl was raped
by three American soldiers in September last year, making many
Okinawan landowners who had been long opposing the U.S. military
presence decline to renew their leases.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Police Increase Protection of Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Israeli security services have
tightened round-the-clock protection of Supreme Court President
Aharon Barak after he received death threats from radical Jews,
reports said today.
</P>
<P>
"You will rot next to (Yitzhak) Rabin's grave, then you'll
understand," a man was quoted by local media as making a late
night call to Barak recently. Rabin is the former premier who was
assassinated last November at a Tel Aviv peace rally by a radical
Orthodox Jew.
</P>
<P>
The General Security Service has ordered renovations at
Barak's home to increase security and stepped up protection of
the justice, who is the central target of a recent hatred campaign
launched by the Orthodox religious Jews, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Barak was branded as "the great enemy of Judaism" by several
Orthodox run newspapers in recent days. He was blamed for issuing
two injunctions to keep open Jerusalem Bar Ilan street on Shabbat,
the Jewish weekend, despite their loud protests. The street is a
main traffic route in northern Jerusalem which cuts through an
Orthodox-dominant residence area.
</P>
<P>
Secular groups have vehemently opposed the closure of the
street and won several legal battles in the court so far. So the
Orthodox section has outpoured its anger on the Supreme Court,
which was denounced as an anti-religious tool used by the secular
side.
</P>
<P>
The latest uproar surrounding the attacks against the Supreme
Court has shocked the whole Jewish state, arousing fears about
the renewed blood-letting drive among the Jews.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the state, including President Ezer Weizman, Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Knesset (Parliament) Speaker Dan
Tichon and Finance Minister Dan Meridor, all came out to defend
the authority of the justice system and called for calm on the
part of the religious camp.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the opposition Labor and Meretz parties have revived
the memory of Rabin's tragic murder as a result of a similar
hatred campaign launched by the rightist and religious parties and
groups. Rabin, chief architect of the peace process, was often
branded as a "traitor" for trading land for peace with the Arabs.
</P>
<P>
The Orthodox religious section, riding on the newly-found
strength from the May elections, is escalating a battle for a
wider control of the mostly secular and open society.
</P>
<P>
Four Orthodox parties have gained 25 seats in the 120-member
Knesset and taken control over major cabinet posts, including the
interior, transportation, education and religious affairs
portfolios. They are demanding a greater say in both the political
and social fields.
</P>
<P>
The Bar Ilan battle was in fact escalated on July 10, when
Transportation Minister Yitzhak Levy, from the Orthodox National
Religious Party, issued an unilateral order to close down the
street during Shabbat.
</P>

<HEADLINE> 7,000 Zimbabwean Civil Servants Dismissed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean Minister of Public
Service, Labor and Social Welfare Florence Chitauro said here
last night that about 7,000 civil servants will be given notices
of dismissal for failing to comply to orders to return to work
last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Chitauro said in a statement that heads of ministries, in
consultation with the Public Service Commission, spent the whole of
Tuesday serving notices of dismissal to the civil servants who had
been identified as having taken part in the recent strike.
</P>
<P>
The civil servants have been on strike for the past eight days
pressing for salary increments of up to 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday Chitauro ordered the strikers back to work while
negotiations were taking place, saying failing to do so they
would be fired. However, the civil servants defied this call.
</P>
<P>
President Robert Mugabe on Sunday criticized the strike action
and said this might be the government's chance to trim the civil
service which has about 180,000 people. enditem

<HEADLINE> Indian MPs Accuse U.S. of Economic Terrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Indian parliament members K.R.
Malkani and Biplab Dasgupta have expressed serious concern over
what they called the United States' interference in a bilateral
commercial deal on India's urea import from Libya, the local press
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Raising the matter during the question hour in the Upper House
of parliament here Tuesday, Malkani accused the U.S. of "indulging
in economic terrorism" against India by pressuring New Delhi not
to make payment to Libya.
</P>
<P>
India's Minerals and Metals Trading Corporation has placed an
order with Libya for 50,000 tons of urea at 2.5 million U.S.
dollars, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, with much of its foreign exchange reserves held in
American banks in the U.S., India cannot make the payment to Libya
because of the U.S. pressure, he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the U.S. unilaterally enacted a law to impose economic
sanctions on those multinationals who would invest in Libya and
Iran. The bill has been widely protested by European and other
countries.

<HEADLINE> China Reports Good Summer Grain Harvest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese farmers reaped a record
summer grain harvest this year despite serious flooding, a senior
government official announced today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a meeting of the Standing Committee of the National
People's Congress, Chen Jinhua, minister in charge of the State
Planning Commission, said that in the absence of serious natural
disasters in the remainder of this year, farmers will harvest more
grain in 1996 than last year.
</P>
<P>
In his report on the implementation of the plan for China's
economic and social development, Chen said that with increased
investment in the farming sector, and higher purchasing prices for
grain, farmers have shown a greater initiative for growing grain
crops.
</P>
<P>
Government statistics show that summer grain crops were planted
on an extra 660,000 hectares throughout the country earlier this
year. As a result, production of such crops amounted to a record
114.1 billion kilograms, 7.2 billion kg more than in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The acreage for early rice increased 77,300 hectares. But
because of serious flooding in major rice producing areas of Hunan
and Hubei provinces, early rice production is only expected to
match or slightly exceed last year's level.
</P>
<P>
Chen Jinhua said, "Supply of capital goods for agriculture,
such as chemical fertilizers and pesticides, are better than last
year. In particular, production and imports of such fertilizers
have increased."
</P>
<P>
The tendency towards excessive price increases in chemical
fertilizer has been halted, he said, adding that farmers are
enthusiastic about buying farm machines.
</P>
<P>
"All this has paved the way for a good harvest this year," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He urged that efforts be made to combat and reduce disasters
and repair water conservation facilities, lighten farmers'
financial burdens and aid the poor more effectively.

sides of the Taiwan Straits were urged today to increase
co-operation to accelerate mutual economic development.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, Jing Shuping, chairman of the
All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, said the rules for the
promotion of direct shipping links between the two sides, issued by
the Ministry of Communications and the Ministry of Foreign Trade
and Economic Co-operation, have demonstrated the mainland's efforts
and sincerity in this regard. They have also provided
opportunities for business sectors on both sides.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the "three direct links" of mail, trade,
air and shipping services, will help to save costs, transportation
expenses and time, and finally benefit businesses on both sides.
</P>
<P>
He said the mainland has made many efforts on this issue, and
he hoped the Taiwan authorities will take into account the strong
aspiration of business people on the island and take practical
measures to promote the "three direct links".
</P>
<P>
There are large areas of co-operation for business circles of
the two sides, Jing said.
</P>
<P>
Co-operation in the agriculture sector, hi-tech exploration,
traditional industry transformation and exploration and
exploitation of the resources in the country's central and western
areas are all good prospects, he added.

<HEADLINE> Foreigners Killed over gold mining in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 28 (Xinhua) -- An unspecified number of
foreigners were killed by warriors in the Karamoja area,
northeastern Uganda, in the last few weeks.
</P>
<P>
The warriors accused them of plundering their gold wealth,
reported the local newspaper the People today.
</P>
<P>
However, the paper could not ascertain how many foreigners
were killed and what their countries of origin were.
</P>
<P>
The foreigners, who had been mining gold in what is believed
to be the world's second largest gold mine, were lynched by angry
warriors, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The warriors have of late been bitter following perpetual
exploitation of the gold without the beneficiaries remitting
taxes to their local governments, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The warriors were also wary that the foreigners had destroyed
huge chunk of land, depriving their cattle of pasture and water,
the paper added.
</P>
<P>
The public here have only known that a South Africa-based
company is mining in Karamoja and the Ugandan government does not
receive any tax from the firm, which claims it is only doing
exploratory work.
</P>
<P>
The Uganda government disclosed last December that the gold
deposits in Karamoja were second to Australia's in the world and
the deposits would be mined for 50 years with an annual yield of
three metric tons. enditem

<HEADLINE> Water Saving Increases Shandong's Agricultural Output (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The use of water saving facilities
has enabled east China's Shandong Province to increase its grain
output by 1.2 billion kilograms a year.
</P>
<P>
Water saving facilities have been introduced into 3.3 million
hectares of farmland in the province, accounting for more than 70
percent its total.
</P>
<P>
The province currently leads all parts of China in terms of
water saving facilities in farmland irrigation. saving 4.5
billion cubic meters of water annually.
</P>
<P>
The amount of freshwater resources for both local residents and
farmland in the province - an agricultural giant - account for
only one sixth of the country's average level.
</P>
<P>
The province, which lacks 10 billion cubic meters of water
annually, began to explore water saving measures for high-yield
agriculture ten years ago.
</P>
<P>
By shortening the length of a piece of farmland from 100 meters
to 50 meters, and narrowing the width, farmers in the central
plain of the province have saved 30 percent of water in
irrigation. At present, Shandong farmers have applied the method
to more than 1.3 million hectares of farmland.
</P>
<P>
For centuries many farmers in the province wrongly believed
that as long as they kept their wheat land wet they would have
high yields. In some areas farmers watered their wheat cropland
seven times during the growth period of the crop. But after they
followed advice by water conservancy experts that irrigating three
times is enough, farmers have not only saved more than 6,000 cubic
meters from the irrigation of each hectare, but also have raised
their per-unit yield.
</P>
<P>
Farmers in Huantai County have adopted the irrigation method
and have made the per-hectare wheat output exceed the 7,500
kilogram mark.

<HEADLINE> Water Saving Increases Shandong's Agricultural Output (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In some relatively affluent areas, farmers have introduced the
technologies of trickle and sprinkler irrigation. In Yantai City
automatic pipeline irrigation controlled by computer has been
introduced into orchards. Whenever orchards are short of water,
water is suplied automatically through pipelines.
</P>
<P>
Compared to uncontrolled irrigation, pipeline irrigation can
save 80 percent of water and also increase output of apples by
7,050 kilograms per hectare. Investments in orchards can be
recovered in a year.
</P>
<P>
Pipeline and trickle irrigation are already put into use in
nearly 20 million hectares of farmland, accounting for one third
of the country's total. And by the end of last year, low-pressure
pipeline irrigation had been introduced to more than 1.7 million
hectares of farmland, accounting for about one half of the
country's total.
</P>
<P>
In recent years Shandong also imported foreign irrigation
technology. Zhaoyuan City has introduced sprinkling irrigation
technology from the United States, while Weihai City has adopted
Israeli and Australian water-saving technologies.
</P>
<P>
Over the past decade, the province has invested 4.5 billion
yuan (about 542 million US dollars) in popularizing water saving
technologies, and most investments were made by farmers themselves.
</P>
<P>
For many years Shandong's grain output have been kept at a high
level of 40 billion kg, with each person having an average of
nearly 500 kg of grain. The grain self-sufficient province exports
some two billion kg of grain to other parts of China annually.

<HEADLINE> Xiamen Glad to Be Pilot Port for Direct Shipping Across Taiwan Strait </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The recent decision by the
Chinese Government to open Xiamen and Fuzhou as two pilot ports
for direct shipping between the inland area and Taiwan region has
been greeted with a strong response.
</P>
<P>
"Xiamen has made huge preparations for direct mail, trade, and
air and shipping services between the two sides of the Taiwan
Straits, becoming qualified as a port for the shipping link", said
Zhang Zongshu, Xiamen's vice mayor.
</P>
<P>
"We are waiting for the Taiwan authorities to conform to the
will of the people and give favorable responses," he said.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the country's Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation and Ministry of Communications issued regulations on
managing cargo transport agents and on managing direct passenger
and cargo shipping business across the straits.
</P>
<P>
In response, port authorities in Xiamen called a series of
meetings to discuss the regulations.
</P>
<P>
Experts in Xiamen hold that now there are specific measures to
govern links across the straits, things will depend on the
attitude of the Taiwan authorities to realize the direct shipping
link.
</P>
<P>
Facing Taiwan, Xiamen Port now has a dozen 10,000-ton wharfs,
13 berths of more-than-3,000-ton, together capable of handling 20
million tons of cargo a year. This year, the port expects to
handle 350,000 standard containers.
</P>
<P>
The city is also a leading location for Taiwan investment on
the inland area, with the number of Taiwan-funded enterprises
reaching 1,271 and investment topping 2.75 billion US dollars in
1995.

<HEADLINE> Floral Fence in Qionghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, August 28 (Xinhua) -- A sweet-smelling fence made of
tens of thousands of potted flowers stretches for miles in
Qionghai, a city in south China's island province of Hainan.
</P>
<P>
The floral fence is kept fresh everyday, thanks to the efforts
of florists and local students who like to tend flowers during
their holiday breaks.
</P>
<P>
An endless stream of pedestrians and vehicles pass by the
flowery structure every day, leaving it undisturbed. Six years
ago, the same site was occupied by an iron fence, which
pedestrians often climbed or jumped over.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, an idea occurred to the Qionghai authorities: why not
change the iron fence into one made of flowers?
</P>
<P>
"For the sake of safety, we only placed hundreds of potted
flowers on the fence line at the start, as we were not confident
enough it would not be harmed," said Han Zhizhong, mayor of
Qionghai.
</P>
<P>
The fact that no flowers were lost or damaged during the first
two months encouraged the municipal authorities to complete the
project with thousands more blossoms.
</P>
<P>
"We realized that we could expect better mode of behavior from
the people of Qionghai," said the mayor.
</P>
<P>
Now, pedestrians are rarely seen climbing or jumping over the
floral fence, and none of the flowers has been stolen.

<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Wuhai, a coal-producing city in
North China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, has invested 450
million yuan in city construction over the past five years.
</P>
<P>
Wuhai was a wasteland before 1958. With the opening of the
Baotou-Lanzhou railway, the area has developed into a
coal-producing base. In 1976 it became a city.
</P>
<P>
By the end of the 1980s, the city had opened major chemical and
building materials industries.
</P>
<P>
However, inconvenient transportation routes made it difficult
to ship the coal to other provinces and regions. During the past
five years, the city has built more than 40 infrastructure
projects, including a new railway station, three fly-overs,
supermarkets, hotels, and irrigation facilities, and also
installed a program-controlled telephone network.
</P>
<P>
The local government also implemented a nine-year compulsory
education system to enhance the quality of people.

<HEADLINE> Pollution-Control in Huaihe, Chaohu Valleys Fruitful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The official said that the Anhui provincial government will
spend 25 million yuan on a project to control pollution of the
Huaihe River, which flows through Bengbu.
</P>
<P>
This is one of the projects launched in Anhui to control the
pollution of the Huaihe River and the Chaohu Lake. The water
impurity is caused mainly by wastewater from factories and
sewage.
</P>
<P>
The factories' pollutants have caused the river valleys to
suffer from serious contamination, with losses estimated at more
than 100 million yuan a year.
</P>
<P>
The two regions account for 54 percent of Anhui's landmass and
66 percent of the province's population, and contribute 60 percent
to Anhui's annual gross domestic product -- the value of goods and
services produced.
</P>
<P>
Since 1988, the province has spent 1.12 billion yuan to reduce
pollution by building pollution-control facilities and drainage
works.
</P>
<P>
In 1994-1995, 119 factories, including small paper mills,
chemical plants, electroplating factories, tanneries, and
breweries, were shut down for causing serious pollution.
</P>
<P>
By June 30, 1996, 246 sets of equipment for making paper pulp,
with an annual production capacity of up to 5,000 tons each, were
closed.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the provincial government has prohibited the
installation of the same equipment and the construction of paper
mills and other small factories that will cause serious pollution.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government plans to apply to the World Bank for a
50 million US dollar loan for the construction of pollution
control pilot projects.
</P>
<P>
The Asian Development Bank has included in its 1997 fiscal year
plan a 137 million US dollar loan for controlling pollution in
the Chaohu Lake Valley.
</P>
<P>
The Standing Committee of the Anhui Provincial People's
Congress, the provincial legislature, has promulgated the
Regulations Concerning the Protection of Water of the Chaohu Lake
and the Regulations on Controlling Water Pollution in the Huaihe
River Valley.
</P>
<P>
By the end of this century, the water of the Huaihe River and
Chaohu Lake is expected to be clear, according to the officials.

<HEADLINE> China Makes Progress in Inflation Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 28 (Xinhua) --- China will be able to limit the
range of retail price increases to within targets set at the
beginning of this year, a senior government official announced
today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a meeting of the Standing Committee of the National
People's Congress, Chen Jinhua, minister in charge of the State
Planning Commission, said, "China has made successes in curbing
inflation in the first seven months of this year."
</P>
<P>
In his report on the implementation of the plan for China's
economic and social development, Chen said that the index of
retail prices rose by 6.9 percent, and the index of consumers'
cost of living by 9.1 percent, in the first seven months of 1996
compared to the same period in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The range of increases in retail prices has been kept to one
digit since November 1995, and that of the increase in consumers'
cost of living has also been a one digit figure since January 1996.
</P>
<P>
Chen Jinhua said that markets across the country have not
experienced sharp fluctuations since prices of railway freight,
electricity and grain were raised earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
The nation's market for capital goods such as coal, iron, steel
and cement currently maintains a near balance between supply and
demand, he said, adding that prices of such goods are roughly the
same as in the same period in 1995.
</P>
<P>
He warned against the relaxation of efforts to curb inflation,
saying that pressures from rising demands and production costs are
still there.
</P>
<P>
He urged that efforts be made to tighten supervision and
control over market prices, keep grain prices largely stable,
strictly control the approval of new prices increases, and ensure
market supply and production and supply of vegetables in autumn
and winter.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investment to Israel Up in First Half of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Foreign investments to Israel
stood at 1.4 billion U.S. dollars in the first half of this year,
a 25 percent increase over the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
According to an announcement by the Bank of Israel, some 57
percent of (0.8 billion dollars) this figure comprised real
investments, with the remainder financial investments.
</P>
<P>
The financial investments were predominantly in Israeli firms
traded abroad, particularly following the floatation of company
shares in the U.S. in the second half of last year.
</P>
<P>
An additional 0.2 billion dollars was invested in securities on
Israel's secondary market, similar to the sum placed in the Tel
Aviv Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, private sector foreign currency investments
decreased by 3.3 billion dollars in the first half of 1996
compared to the same period last year, the bank reported in the
announcement.
</P>
<P>
From January to June such investments totaled 2 billion
dollars, said the announcement, adding that the trend was caused
by the reduction of bank credit on short-term foreign currency
accounts for Israeli citizens.
</P>
<P>
Foreign-currency denominated credit borrowed from local banks
by Israeli residents fell sharply over the same period, from 3.4
billion dollars to 0.6 billion dollars, while foreign-currency
denominated bank deposits rose over the first half of the year by
0.4 billion dollars, to an unspecified level.
</P>
<P>
Total foreign investments to Israel in 1995 rose to 2
billion dollars from some 90 million dollars four
years ago, the announcement said.

<HEADLINE> Road Accidents Claim More Casualties in Singapore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, August 28 (Xinhua) -- More people were killed or
injured on the roads in Singapore in the first six months of this
year, compared with the same period last year, the Straits Times
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Citing police statistics, the report said that there were more
accidents of all types, with the total number rising from 2,507 in
the first half of last year to 2,797 this year.
</P>
<P>
Statistics showed that motorcyclists and their pillion riders
remained the most vulnerable, accounting for about a half of the
3,859 people killed or injured in road accidents in the first six
months of 1996.
</P>
<P>
The report said that police are considering a ban on new riders
carrying passengers, because motorcyclists with less than one-year
experience and their pillion riders made up a quarter of the 48
motorcycle deaths, although they accounted for only five percent
of all riders in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
The statistics also revealed that more children and elderly
people were involved in accidents while crossing the road,
resulting in 47 pedestrian deaths, compared with 38 in the first
half of last year. Three of this year's victims were children
aged 14 or younger and 20 were above 60 years of age.
</P>
<P>
Speeding accounted for about a half of the 131 fatal accidents
in the first six months of this year, while 20,513 motorists were
booked for speeding, down from 32,696 in the corresponding period
last year, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Seeks to Strengthen Research Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Singapore government agencies
will provide more than 92 million U.S. dollars to start up three
new research institutes at the National University of Singapore
(NUS) to strengthen the country's position in the world technology
race, the Straits Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
These institutes, the Data Storage Institute, the Institute of
Materials Research and Engineering, and the Medical Informatics
Program, will focus on long-term research projects to help
Singapore take the pole position in the technology race, said the
report.
</P>
<P>
It quoted NUS Vice-Chancellor Lim Pin as saying that these
institutes would do research work long before industry needs it.
</P>
<P>
While such work might not reap immediate commercial benefits,
it would help NUS researchers find faster solutions in other
research projects. "The two types of research will feed each
other," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Data Storage Institute will do research work related to the
hard disk drive industry. The National Science and Technology
Board (NSTB) will provide about 21 million U.S. dollars for its
construction work and pump in about 39 million U.S. dollars over
the next three years for its research.
</P>
<P>
The NSTB will also provide about 35 million U.S. dollars to the
Institute of Material Research and Engineering to help it do
research work on materials such as plastics, chemicals and
semiconductors.
</P>
<P>
With about five million U.S. dollars from the NSTB and the
Education Ministry, the Medical Informatics Program will enable
doctors, scientists and engineers to work together on the use of
computer technology in health-related projects, the Straits Times
said.
</P>
<P>
Professor Lim Pin said that these research efforts would
further enhance reputation of the NUS in the world.

BANGKOK, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Dust levels in some parts of

<HEADLINE> Lufthansa Considers Suspension of Nepal Operations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Lufthansa, the German national
flag carrier, might suspend its flights to Nepal from next year
due to the declining number of passengers and increased landing
charge, according to a local press report today.
</P>
<P>
Analyzing its profit ratio of the last few years, the German
airlines decided to take "timely measures" to stem the losses,
official newspaper "The Rising Nepal" reported by quoting an
airline representative here.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, Lufthansa's profit margin in recent
years has gone below the break-even point due to the declining
number of tourists coming to the country.
</P>
<P>
Local tourism industry sources said that if Lufthansa suspends
its flight operation to Nepal, the country's fledging tourism
industry will suffer major setbacks.
</P>
<P>
Nepal has planned to attract 500,000 tourists in 1998 through
a promotion program called "visit Nepal year 1998".
</P>
<P>
The Lufthansa official also disclosed that the airlines' review
over its Nepal operations stemmed partly from the Nepali
government's recent decision to increase landing charge by 50
percent to 1,500-1,600 U.S. dollars per
flight.
</P>
<P>
Lufthansa started its Frankfurt-Kathmandu flight operations in
1987. It flies three passenger flights every week at present, two
of them via Karachi, Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
An earlier report here said that the airlines might stop its
flights to Kathmandu as Pakistan will not allow it to pick up
passengers in Karachi from May 1997.

TOKYO, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Japan's economic prospects
worsened with a key business confidence gauge expanding the minus
figure, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) said in a quarterly report today.
</P>
<P>
The closely watched "Tankan" survey of business conditions said
its key diffusion index (DI) measuring the sentiment of corporate
executives dropped to minus 7 for major manufacturers in August
from minus 3 registered in the previous survey in May.

The index -- the percentage of companies saying their business
climate is improving minus those reporting worsening conditions --
recovered, however, to minus 4 from minus 9 for major
nonmanufacturers, the central bank said.

BANGKOK, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government has given
green light to carry out a consultancy study on a nationwide
four-route high-speed train network, according to a Government
House press release available today.
</P>
<P>
The project, with an estimated cost of 20 billion U.S. dollars,

routes.
</P>
<P>

<P>
YANGON, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar leader Lt. Gen. Khin
Nyunt said foreign media have been making wrong assessments on
Myanmar in their writings and broadcasts based on false news
reports, official daily The New Light of Myanmar said today.
</P>
<P>
Those news agencies under the Western influence are trying to
impose pressure on Myanmar on the pretext of democracy and human
rights, Khin Nyunt, first secretary of the State Law and Order
Restoration Council, said at a coordination meeting Tuesday of the
Information Policy Committee and the Information Committee.
</P>
<P>
"In spite of totally different positive developments in Myanmar
at present compared with that in 1988, certain news agencies
influenced by the West are disseminating false news," said Khin
Nyunt, also chairman of the Information Policy Committee.

<P>
He said that internal groups opposing the government and
expatriate groups who fled the country are concocting false news
about Myanmar and sending them to foreign news agencies.

<HEADLINE> Italy Supports Yugoslavia's Move to Normalization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Italy will spare no efforts in
supporting Yugoslavia's move towards "normalizing" relations with
the international community, says Lamberto Dini, Italy's Foreign
Minister.
</P>
<P>
Meeting his Yugoslavian counterpart, Milan Milutinovic, Dini
said he hoped normalization would be achieved soon.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers were holding "positive and rewarding" talks
in Rome on the Bosnian situation and on the bilateral relations of
the two countries, the Italian Foreign Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Both parties saw the Bosnian situation as generally stable,
paving the way for the September 14 general election which was
expected to be held in a "peaceful and orderly" environment.
</P>
<P>
Dini believed the forthcoming election symbolized a great
transitional moment for a new system.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia has appealed for the economic sanctions, imposed on
it by the United Nations in April, 1993, to be lifted after the
election.
</P>
<P>
Both ministers referred to bilateral relations as being
generally good, but said both countries should make efforts to
strengthen them, and bilateral trade ties.
</P>
<P>
Dini said Italy would increase trade and economic exchanges
with Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Milutinovic said: "We would like to push up our bilateral
relations to the level before the Bosnian crisis."
</P>
<P>
He said he hoped Italian President, Oscar Scalfaro, and Prime
Minister, Romano Prodi, could accept President Slobodan
Milosevic's invitation to visit Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
A report said the two ministers met later on the same day at
Prodi's residence.
</P>
<P>
Milutinovic echoed Dini's view of the Bosnian election saying
it was an important election and would create a new era in the
Bosnian peace process and economic construction.
</P>
<P>
Milutinovic expressed Yugoslavia's intention to be back as soon
as possible on the international stage, and to enter the process
of approaching Europe and the European Union.

<HEADLINE> Austrian Leaders Reiterate Position on Neutrality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Austrian Federal Chancellor Franz
Vranitzky and Vice Chancellor Wolfgang Schussel said today that it
is not the time at present for Austria to discuss whether to give
up its neutrality to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
</P>
<P>
They made the remarks at a press conference in response to a
proposal made by National Council President Heinz Fischer for a
referendum on whether Austria would join NATO and give up
neutrality.
</P>
<P>
Vranitzky stressed that the question for Austria to consider at
present is how to build a common security system with other
countries and not whether to join NATO.
</P>
<P>
The chancellor said that he personally believes that Austria
should strengthen its partnership for peace with NATO and
enhance cooperation with other neutralized countries.
</P>
<P>
Vice Chancellor Schussel, who is also the foreign minister,
said that whether to join NATO depends on the development
orientation of the organization, which he said could be clear at
least a year later.
</P>
<P>
For more than a month, the NATO issue has become a hot issue in
Austria's politics. A major NATO advocate is Defense Minister
Werner Fasslabend of the People's Party.
</P>
<P>
But the statements by Vranitzky and Schussel indicated that
neither the People's Party nor the Social Democratic Party, the
two partners of the coalition government, wants the NATO issue to
affect the forthcoming elections of the European Parliament and
the Vienna municipal elections.
</P>
<P>
Vranitzky mentioned today that the People's Party has requested
its members to stop debating on the NATO issue.
</P>
<P>
In Austria, most NATO supporters come from the People's Party,
while a few are from the Social Democratic Party. But most voters
are opposed to Austria's NATO membership.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Six percent of Thai workers in
factories using asbestos as a raw material suffer lung diseases
that could develop into cancer and asbestosis, according to an
official survey released today.
</P>
<P>
Of the 2,600 workers in 80 factories in 38 Thai provinces, 168
suffer lung problems, said the survey conducted by the Thai Public
Health Ministry's Occupational Health Division.
</P>
<P>
The survey is part of an asbestosis monitoring program of the
division.
</P>
<P>
The use of the substance has been banned or restricted in most
industrialized countries since 1982, but manufacturers continue to
use it in less developed countries.
</P>
<P>
In Thailand, asbestos is used to produce cement pipes,
heat-resistant materials and textiles, piles, brake and cloth
linings for motor vehicles, and several other products.

<P>
BRASILIA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Brazil today resumed its
suborbital space program and launched a Sonda II rocket from a
space center in the northeastern part of the country.
</P>
<P>
A Sonda II rocket, measuring 4.5 meters long and weighing 383.5
kilograms, was launched from the Natal base and reached an
altitude of 87.4 kilometers before splashing down into the
Atlantic Ocean.
</P>
<P>
Mauro Melo Dolinsky, who is in charge of the Sonda II project,
said that the launch was aimed at perfecting the launching and
tracking skills of ground staff at the Alcantara center.
</P>
<P>
Though it is being used for training purposes for the time
being, the center is capable of launching bigger rockets.
</P>
<P>
Two to three Sonda II rockets are planned to be launched from
Natal each year in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
Sonda II rockets were last launched in Natal two years ago.
</P>

<HEADLINE> U.S. Democrats Strong on Policing, Child Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chicago, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Community policing, child
protection and neighborhood security will be strengthened under
the 1996 Democratic Party platform.
</P>
<P>
The Democrats' National Convention, entering its second day
here, also gives crime fighting priority in the platform, and
states that violence and youth crimes will be met with tough
punishments.
</P>
<P>
The platform was adopted today.
</P>
<P>
Stressing "opportunity, responsibility and community", the
document lists the Democrats' achievements during the past three
years and their future plans.
</P>
<P>
It praises the current administration for having created more
jobs, raised the minimum wage to 5.15 dollars per hour, and forced
a welfare overhaul bill through the Republican-controlled Congress.
</P>
<P>
But it also admits that welfare reform goes too far in cutting
nutritional assistance for poor families with children and
reducing aid to legal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
The platform also takes credit for the recent legislation on
health insurance reform that prevents insurance companies from
denying coverage to families with a pre-existing medical
condition, and allows workers to carry their insurance to new jobs.
</P>
<P>
The influence of special interests with big money will be
limited and that of the common people be expanded, the document
says.
</P>
<P>
Immigrants' contributions to the country should not be
overlooked, although illegal immigration cannot be tolerated and
must be stopped.
</P>
<P>
Deploring the recent wave of burnings that have targeted
Afro-American churches in the south, the document calls for a
fight against racial discrimination.
</P>
<P>
The platform is "something of a balanced act", "a careful
blueprint for a middle-of-the-road campaign" by incumbent
President Bill Clinton, analysts here say.

<HEADLINE> Many Australians Support New Budget: Polls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The Australian federal
government received more post-budget good news today with the
release of the Morgan-Poll result, which showed that nearly one
third of people surveyed believed the budget was good.
</P>
<P>
According to the result published in The Bulletin magazine
today, 31 percent of the people surveyed in the poll rated the
budget as good -- the highest satisfaction rating recorded by
Morgan since it began surveying budget attitudes in 1978.
</P>
<P>
The good news followed two newspaper polls released Tuesday,
with The Australian's Newspoll finding that 59 percent of the
voters believed the budget would be good for the economy and The
Sydney Morning Herald's AGB McNair Poll revealing that 54 percent
believed it was fair.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister John Howard applauded the polls, saying that
"they knew we had to take some difficult decisions, but they see
the decisions as having been fairly spread across all sections of
the Australian community."
</P>
<P>
The budget, released last week, nevertheless received criticism
from all corners of the country as its cost-cutting measures
seriously hit health, aged care and university students, which are
related to almost everyone.
</P>
<P>
As the latest Morgan Poll showed, 71 percent of those surveyed
said increased charges for prescription drugs were too high or
should not have been made, while 70 percent opposed cuts in
university funding.
</P>
<P>
Changes in the Higher Education Contribution Scheme and
employment programs also received negative responses from about 60
percent of those surveyed.

<HEADLINE> South Philippine Residents Threaten to Sue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Christian residents in Mindanao
in southern Philippines said they would sue the government at the
Supreme Court over its plan to set up a Muslim-led transitional
administration in the region, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Political leaders and some 5,000 Mindanao residents attended a
one-day "Mindanao Congress" in Zamboanga city Tuesday to highlight
their opposition against the peace deal between the government and
the MORO National Liberation Front (MNLF).
</P>
<P>
The peace deal calls for the creation of the Southern
Philippines Council for Peace and Development (SPCPD) as a
transitional body to oversee the peace and development of 14
provinces and 10 cities in Mindanao and its nearby areas.
</P>
<P>
Protesters said President Fidel Ramos and his peace negotiators
exceeded their mandate by proposing to set up the council. They
said they would take the issue to the Supreme Court as soon as
Ramos orders the implementation of the peace deal.
</P>
<P>
They warned that they would resort to a "people's initiative"
if the Supreme Court rejected their petition.
</P>
<P>
Also on Tuesday, the government and the MNLF opened the final
round of their formal talks in Jakarta, Indonesia, which are
expected to lead to the initialing of the peace accord on August
31 and the formal signing in Manila on September 2.
</P>
<P>
The Ramos administration expressed confidence that the final
round of talks would have a "very positive" result and said that
it can clearly justify its legality to set up the SPCPD before the
Supreme Court.

<HEADLINE> China to Invest Heavily in Inter-Province Water Diversion Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BEIJING, August 28 (Xinhua) -- China plans to launch a
multi-million-dollar water project to quench the thirst of a major
city in the northwest.
</P>
<P>
Jinchang, on the southern borders of the Badain Jaran Desert
and Tengger Desert, has suffered from a serious water shortage in
recent years due to the rapid industrial development in the area,
"China Mining News" has reported.
</P>
<P>
Drought has brought losses to both industry and
agriculture. During dry seasons, agricultural production was
forced to stop to give way to industrial development.
</P>
<P>
Jinchang has been listed by the state as a city in severe need
of water. In order to ease the water problem, the city has built
three reservoirs, but they cannot eliminate the shortage.
</P>
<P>
The city appealed to the central authorities to divert water
from other reaches 15 years ago, and recently received funding
approval, the Beijing-based newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
With support from the State Planning Commission, a project to
divert water from Menyuan County of Qinghai Province will start
soon.
</P>
<P>
An 8,855-meter water-diversion tunnel will be dug through the
Lenglong (Cold Dragon) Hill of the Qiliang Mountains from the
south to the north in four years.
</P>
<P>
About 230,000 cubic meters of soil will have to be excavated
for the tunnel, the first in the hill. The digging will require an
investment of 198 million yuan (about 23.9 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
By the year 2000, 40 million cubic meters of water will flow
into Jinchuanxia Reservoir in the city each year.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Apartment Buildings to Occupy 40-sq-km Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BEIJING, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Residential construction in
Beijing will maintain its strong momentum in the next 15 years,
and now officials want to develop housing in the city's outlying
areas, "China Land News" has reported.
</P>
<P>
Beijing plans to provide each resident a living space of 16.5
square meters by 2010, which means in the next 15 years,
residences need to be constructed on a 40-square-kilometer area,
the Beijing-based newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
At present, 20 square kilometers have been set aside, and
10.55 sq-km of that land is being developed, according to the
Beijing Real Estate Administration.
</P>
<P>
The downtown areas do not have spare space for residential
construction. But in the city's suburbs, such as Huilongguan,
Beiyuan, Wangjing, Dongba, Dingfuzhuang, Fatou, Nanyuan and
Fengtai, there are vacant lots.
</P>
<P>
Housing development in these areas, however, is restricted by
limited infrastructure facilities, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
In the near future, waterworks in the urban area will not
be able to provide an adequate supply to Fengtai, Nanyuan and
Fatou, because of water shortages. And exploitation of water wells
in these areas will worsen the sinking of the ground.
</P>
<P>
No new projects will be arranged in south Fengtai, where
underground water has almost run dry, before the country
implements the water diversion project from the south to the
north, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the city will focus on housing development in
Huilongguan, Lishuiqiao, Beiyuan, Wangjing, which are close to
water sources, it added.
</P>
<P>
The city will also develop Dingfuzhuang, because it is near
the Beijing-Tongxian expressway, which allows for easier
development. A water pipeline will be laid for the area soon, it
said.

HELSINKI, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The Bank Commission of the
Finnish Parliament decided today to lower the primary interest
rates of the Finnish Central Bank from 4.5 percent to 4 percent
from September 16.
</P>
<P>
This will be the second time the central bank has lowered its
primary interest rate this year. Since february 1, the rate has
dropped from 4.75 percent to 4.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
A low inflation rate, which was estimated to be around 1
percent to 2 percent in recent years, provided the opportunity for

<P>
SEOUL, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Former South Korean Presidents
Chun Doo Hwan and Roh Tae Woo said that they would not lodge
appeals to a higher court against the sentences handed down on
Monday, a Seoul daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
The two were sentenced to death and 22-and-a-half years in
prison respectively by a Seoul court for mutiny, treason and
corruption,
</P>
<P>
Chun told lawyers and close aides Tuesday that an appeal would
serve no other purpose but to disturb public opinion, the daily
Hankook Ilbo said.
</P>
<P>
Chun was also quoted as saying that it would be better
to ''sacrifice only myself than file an appeal against the case."
</P>
<P>
Roh, Chun's army colleague and successor as president, also
told his close aides Tuesday that he would not lodge an appeal to
a higher court, the daily said.
</P>
<P>
''It is meaningless to lodge an appeal as I had said before
that I am prepared to bear all responsibilities.''
</P>
<P>
A defense lawyer for Chun said that a final decision on the
matter will be made within two or three days, even though the
basic position of the lawyers is not to pull out the appeals, the
daily said.
</P>
<P>
Chun and Roh have until September 2 to appeal against their
sentences.

CANBERRA, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Australian basketball star
Shane Heal Tuesday night received a one-game suspension for
abusing a referee, a report said from Sydney Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Heal walked out of the hearing after being found guilty of the
charge, describing his one-game penalty as a "disgrace."
</P>
<P>
Heal, who signed a three-year deal with the Minnesota
Timberwolves after starring at the recent Atlanta Olympics, was
reported to the tribunal by referee Graham Clarke.
</P>
<P>
Clarke alleged that Heal had grabbed him by the wrist and swore
at him during a game last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Heal pleaded not guilty to the charges, claiming he was
suffering from a concussion at the time. But the tribunal
dismissed his defense because he had no medical support to back it
up.

<HEADLINE> Pingxiang Coal Administration Walks Out Of Difficulty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BEIJING, August 28 (Xinhua) -- The money-losing Pingxiang Coal
Administration has begun to show a profit for the first time in 24
years after introducing reform policies.
</P>
<P>
By the end of July, the century-old coal mine had earned a
profit of more than two million yuan (about 24 million US
dollars), according to a report by the China Coal News.
</P>
<P>
Since 1972, the administration, in east China's Jiangxi
Province, has depended on state subsidies and loans. In 1992, the
administration's losses ran as high as 120 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
To change this situation, the adminstration has cut 18,000
employees over the past three years, helping to improve its crude
coal mining by 38.5 percent, the Beijing-based newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The administration has also developed non-coal
industries. After raising 200 million yuan, the administration
launched over 200 factory companies and other economic entities in
three years, it said, so that last year, the output value from the
diversified economy was 650 million yuan, accounting for
two-thirds of the administration's total. The non-coal industries
have also provided jobs for 20,000 people.
</P>
<P>
The administration has adopted measures to establish ore
effective management, removing managers of four units from their
offices for failing to meet economic quotas, the newspaper said.

WASHINGTON, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Mike Tyson said he was fit

heavyweight championship.
</P>
<P>
"I'm just in great shape," Tyson was quoted as saying in Los
Angeles Tuesday. "I'm ready to fight. I'm prepared."
</P>
<P>
But promoter Don King hinted that Lennox Lewis might be in
Tyson's future. King will promote the September 7 matchup between
World Boxing Council champion Tyson and World Boxing Association
champion Bruce Seldon.
</P>
<P>
The fight will be the first matchup of world heavyweight
champions since WBA and WBC champion Tyson beat International
Boxing Federation champion Tony Tucker in 1987 to unify the titles.
</P>
<P>
Tyson (44-1 with 38 knockouts) and Seldon (33-3 with 29
knockouts) will meet at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas. They were to
have fought on July 13 but the bout was postponed when Tyson
developed bronchitis.
</P>
<P>
Only Seldon's WBA title is at stake. Britain's Lewis has a
court order requiring he will be the next challenger for the WBC
crown. He was paid four million dollars to drop any legal
challenge to the Tyson-Seldon fight.
</P>
<P>
Tyson, 30, was expected to win the WBA title, then drop the WBC
crown to avoid a fight with Lewis. Keeping both titles would force
a matchup with Lewis before Tyson could fight for the IBF title
held by Michael Moorer.
</P>
<P>
Seldon, 29, spent four years in prison for armed robbery. He
has vowed to upset Tyson in honor of his mother, Joan Graham, who
died of a heart attack in 1993.

<P>
MEXICO CITY, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Mexico will launch a new
scientific satellite in early September, sources of the National
Autonomous University of Mexico said today.
</P>
<P>
The satellite, Unamsat-B, with 90 percent of its parts built by
Mexican engineers, will be launched by the Russian Lavochkin
company between September 3 and 5 with a cost of 120,000
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Unamsat-B is a twin of the Unamsat-1 which was lost on
March 28, 1995, from Russia's Plesetsk Base when it disintegrated
in the dense layers of the atmosphere after an explosion of the
Russian rocket, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The new satellite has a 28 x 28 centimeter cube which weighs
10.7 kilograms and carries 600,000 active transistors and 2,800
mechanical parts.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the university's Space Research and Development
Program, the body responsible for the satellite research, said
some Mexican scientists were in Moscow to prepare for the
launching of the satellite.

<HEADLINE> Japan Offers 600 Million Dollars in Loans to Peru </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto today signed agreements offering as much as 600 million
U.S. dollars in loans to Peru.
</P>
<P>
The loans will be used for the construction of a hydroelectric
plant, road reconstruction and improved drainage system for the
capital city.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto, who arrived here Monday on a three-day visit, signed
the agreements with Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori, himself a
son of Japanese immigrants.
</P>
<P>
But the Japanese visitor said that Peru should improve its
infrastructure and investment environment to make the South
American country more attractive to foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
"The countries of Latin America hold the key to the world's
development in the 21st century," Hashimoto said at a joint press
conference with Fujimori.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto's South American tour has taken him to Mexico, Chile
and Brazil and he is scheduled to go to Costa Rica before winding
up the trip.
</P>
<P>
Japan has become Peru's second largest trade partner after the
United States, with a 1995 total of 490 million dollars of
exports from Japan to Peru and 455 million dollars the other way
around.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto's visit was the second to Peru by a Japanese prime
minister following Zenko Suzuki's trip 14 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe that Hashimoto's visit is also aimed at
soliciting support for Japan's efforts in seeking a permanent
membership on the U.N. Security Council.

<P>
SANTIAGO, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Chile invested 8.6 billion
U.S. dollars overseas from 1990 to July 1996, Economic Minister
Alvaro Garcia announced here today.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking at a seminar entitled "Foreign Investment in
Latin America".
</P>
<P>
The sectors that had channeled the largest volumes of
investment were: energy with 37 percent, manufacturing industry
with 29 percent, financial and banking services with 7.6 percent
and commerce with 4.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Chile has investments in 38 countries with 613 projects at

In the past, Chile has adopted a policy of promoting economic
and trade ties with the region's major partners, as well as with
North America, Europe and Asia, said the economic minister.
</P>
<P>
"This policy proved to be correct since we have been able to
move forward with an uninterrupted growth that has lasted for more

<HEADLINE> Airlines Strive For Higher Sky (1) by Xinhua writer Xu Xiaoting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 28 (Xinhua) -- A longtime favorite of the media
as a showcase of China's modernization and a bridge that links
China with the world, the air transport industry has again caught
the public's attention as two major airlines and two airports
initiated a program to improve service standards this month.
</P>
<P>
Air China -- the national flag carrier, Shanghai-based China
Eastern Airlines, Gaoqi International Airport in Xiamen, and
Jianqiao Airport in Hangzhou, are the pioneers in this new
campaign called "Promised Services," which was launched by the
Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC).
</P>
<P>
"The new move is aimed at projecting Chinese airlines into
taking further steps to meet international service standards,"
said Bao Peide, spokesman and a vice director of CAAC.
</P>
<P>
The "Promised Services" will cover ticket sales, baggage
delivery, and handling of complaints.
</P>
<P>
"To heighten the overall service standards of the whole
industry, the Promised Services Plan will be joined by other
carriers and airports throughout China," Bao noted.
</P>
<P>
The administration and the businesses alike have been diligent
in improving the image of the industry.
</P>
<P>
In the past three years, CAAC has sponsored a special program
to select the airlines and airports with the best service, on the
basis of ratings given by passengers and experts, and on the
number of complaints received for each carrier or airport.
</P>
<P>
CAAC has also invited people from all circles of society to act
as special supervisors over the service quality of the airlines
and airports.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, CAAC issued a set of rules on service
standards. The rules stipulate that carriers must provide food and
accommodation to passengers in case of flight delays, and
passengers who want to cancel flights at the last minute are
entitled to refunds or scheduled changes.
</P>
<P>
The endeavors have already paid off.
</P>
<P>
While most of China's main public transport systems are
constantly attacked for their over-crowding, an unsavory
environment and poor service, travel by plane is favored by most
people as because it involves high speed, a clean environment,
delicious food and friendly flight attendants.
</P>
<P>
Air traffic has grown more than 20 percent each year, twice
China's GDP growth, and almost four times the world's
average. Ticket sales are generally favorable, with Yunnan
Airlines scoring the highest -- 78 percent -- on average last
year.

<HEADLINE> Airlines Strive For Higher Sky (2) by Xinhua writer Xu Xiaoting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
However, the carriers with the highest passenger rates mainly
focus on domestic services. On the international side of the
business, the story is slightly different.
</P>
<P>
There are flights such as those between China and South Korea
which yield huge profits for carriers. On the other hand,
instances of suspended services because of losses rather than
gains are not unusual.
</P>
<P>
The unsatisfactory performance on some international routes
stems more from the fact that the general public is unfamiliar
with China's air transport business, industrial experts pointed
out. It is a fledgling business compared with many established
airlines throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
There is an inaccurate public image of low service quality or
poor safety record.
</P>
<P>
Burt Pinoli, General Manager of US Northwest Airlines in China,
observed that services by Chinese airlines, such as Air China,
have improved substantially in recent years, and some service
items have already met international standards.
</P>
<P>
"The biggest problem with Chinese airlines is not with safety,
but rather with the customers' perceived impression," noted Pinoli.
</P>
<P>
Chinese airlines have retained a nearly impeccable safety
record in terms of international service, and that of domestic
flights has also been greatly improved, evidenced by the fact that
the carriers have not reported accidents involving casualties for
25 consecutive months.
</P>
<P>
Pinoli recommended that Chinese airlines improve their
publicity efforts and form broader and closer ties with travel
agents, in an attempt to promote themselves among the public, both
in China and abroad.
</P>
<P>
Experts agree that China's air transport market is becoming
highly competitive, as almost all of the world's leading airlines
having started services in China and passenger rates are generally
reported to be satisfactory.
</P>
<P>
To increase the carriers' competitive edges in the
international market, the CAAC announced last month that Chinese
airlines will give discounts ranging from 15 to 20 percent to
group travelers (ten persons and above) coming to China on their
flights; fares for flights within China will remain at the present
level.
</P>
<P>
This new promotion drive was coordinated with the national
tourism authorities' efforts to promote China's tourism industry
worldwide, as it greets the coming year with the theme of Visit
China '97.

NANJING, August 28 (Xinhua) -- Long-distance bus passengers
traveling in eastern China can now enjoy a more comfortable trip
-- but have to pay 50 percent more for a ticket.
</P>
<P>
The trip is made possible by a newly-opened Sino-US bus
company, the first of its kind in China.
</P>
<P>
The Nanjing Starley Bus Transport Co. Ltd. is now operating ten
American-made MC-9 style vehicles on three routes that link
Nanjing, the capital of Jiangsu Province with Hefei, the capital

also connect with Nantong, another port city in Jiangsu.
</P>
<P>
The luxury bus is equipped with 47 adjustable seats, reading
lamps, six television sets, and a toilet.
</P>
<P>
The venture is jointly funded by Nanjing Long-distance Bus
Company and the Motor Coaches Industries-China, Inc. with a total
investment of 4.28 million US dollars. The Chinese side holds 30
percent of the equity, and the American side, 70 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Primary and secondary school
teachers and university professors in Uruguay today declared
strike in support of the students who have been occupying 28
educational institutions since August 15.
</P>
<P>
On Monday evening the teachers declared a 48-hour strike in
primary schools and in the Universidad del Trabajo de Uruguay, a
72-hour strike in secondary schools and a 24-hour strike in the
Universidad de la Republica.
</P>
<P>
The students of 25 Uruguayan secondary and technical schools
have been occupying campuses in demand of a bigger education
budget and a suspension of the educational reform of the Central
School Board (Codicen).
</P>
<P>
However, Codicen has rejected the students' and teachers'
request that the reform be halted and submitted to a nationwide
debate.
</P>
<P>
Codicen and the Council of Secondary Education also said they
would not reply to a letter presented Monday by the students
because they felt that the students used an "intimidating" tone.
</P>
<P>
Codicen councillor Jorge Carbonell said Tuesday the presence of
"outside" people in the takeovers presented an obstacle to a
possible dialogue between the students and the authorities.
</P>
<P>
But they would not force the students to leave the occupied
premises if they were not willing to. They are keeping in contact
with the students and teachers and will try to find an appropriate
solution, said Codicen sources.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Publisher Tries to Strip Johnson of Fastest Man </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- A newspaper publisher from Canada
is trying to strip American Michael Johnson of his title as the
world's fastest man.
</P>
<P>
Ian Oliver, publisher of the Oakville Beaver near Toronto,
said on Tuesday he would start publishing ads in the USA Today
newspaper to push his view that Canadian runner Donovan Bailey is
actually the fastest man alive, a report from Toronto said.
</P>
<P>
Bailey, who comes from Oakville, won his record-beating victory
in the 100-meter at the Atlanta Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Johnson, from Dallas, took the 200- and 400-meter races,
setting a new world record in the 200 meters.
</P>
<P>
Oliver said he became angry when NBC television commentators
began calling Johnson the world's fastest man, a title he said
traditionally goes to the winner of the 100-meter race, according
to the report.
</P>
<P>
Oliver said so far he has received C$7,000 (5,147 U.S. dollars)
in donations and thousands of calls and letters in support of his
campaign. The first advertisement will run in the Dallas edition
of USA Today this week, with another in the New York regional
edition next week.
</P>
<P>
The bill for both advertisements will be about $48,000 (35,112
U.S dollars) but Oliver said he was sure the mounting donations
would cover the cost.

<P>
NEW YORK, August 27 (Xinhua) -- World top-ranked Pete Sampras
took first step in defending his U.S. Open champion, advancing
into the second round with a win over Jimy Szymanski of Venezuela
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Joining him were fellow American Olympic gold medalist Lindsay
Davenport and world co-number one Monica Seles, both of whom met
little trouble through.
</P>
<P>
But women's fifth seed Iva Majoli of Croatia and No. 14 men's
seed Alberto Costa of Spain were not among them.
</P>

lost to Bohdan Ulihrach of the Czech Republic 2-6, 6-4, 7-6 (7-2),
3-6, 6-1.
</P>
<P>
Sampras, also top-seeded in the year's final Grand Slam
tournament, brushed aside Szymanski 6-2, 6-2, 6-1 in one hour, 27
minutes, 16 minutes shorter than it took Wiesner to topple Majoli.
</P>
<P>
Third-seeded Thomas Muster of Austria also gained a
second-round berth in straight sets, routing Argentina's Javier
Frana 6-1, 7-6 (7-2), 6-2.
</P>
<P>
Davenport, who followed up her gold-medal performance at the
Atlanta Games and a surprise win over Steffi Graf in Los Angeles,
took only 46 minutes to down Italian Adriana Serra-Zanetti 6-2,
6-1.
</P>
<P>
Seles, second-seeded here, dominated her opener throughout,
needing only 55 minutes to crush fellow American Anne Miller, 6-0,
6-1.
</P>
<P>
In Tuesday's other early women's matches, Paola Suarez of
Argentina defeated Ameican Marianne Werdel Witmeyer 6-4, 6-3;
Italy's Rita Grande downed Alexia Dechaume-Balleret of France 6-3,
6-0; Nathalie Tauziat of France stopped Mexico's Angelica Gavaldon

<HEADLINE> U.S. Democrats Pledge Strengthened Ties With Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHICAGO, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Democrats today
reaffirmed their will to strengthen ties with Europe and work for
an earlier NATO enlargement.
</P>
<P>
"Today's Democratic Party knows that the security of Europe
remains a vital American interest, and that we must remain engaged
in Europe," said the Democratic Platform which was adopted on the
second day of the four-day National Convention.
</P>
<P>
"It is our vision to see, one day, a community of free,
democratic, and peaceful nations, bound by political, security,
cultural, and economic ties, spanning across North America and
Europe," said the document entitled "Today's Democratic
Party: Meeting America's Challenges, Protecting America's Values".
</P>
<P>
It applauded U.S. President Bill Clinton's efforts to foster a
peaceful and undivided Europe.
</P>
<P>
The efforts included expanded support for the market economy
reforms in Russia, increased assistance to the Ukraine and the
sponsorship of the NATO's Partnership for Peace program with non
NATO-member states in Central and Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
The Democrats pledged that they would continue to push for the
eastward enlargement of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization "in
the near future".
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration has hinted that Poland, Hungary and
the Czech Republic would be the first nations to be accepted by
NATO.
</P>
<P>
But no decision would be taken until early 1997 when senior
defense officials of the NATO countries met to discuss vital
issues concerning the future of the 16-member alliance.
</P>
<P>
The platform for action also said that it would support the
Clinton administration's efforts to solve regional disputes such
as the one between Greece and Turkey, both NATO members and
located in the alliance's southeastern flank.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey have been at odds for decades over
territorial waters and space on and over the Aegean Sea area.

<HEADLINE> Guangdong to Speed up Development of Petrochemical Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, August 28 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangdong
Province is speeding up the development of its petrochemical
industry to make itself a driving force in the local economy.
</P>
<P>
The move comes at a time when the province's light industry
goods are gradually losing their advantages in the midst of fierce
competition from other parts of China.
</P>
<P>
Light industry goods, such as garments, household electric
appliances, and electronics, have been the big-selling products in
the province, since China introduced policies of openness and
reform 18 years ago.
</P>
<P>
However, the province lacks heavy industries.
</P>
<P>
"If Guangdong will not adjust its industrial structure, the
speed of its economic growth speed will be sure to slow down," an
economic analyst warned.
</P>
<P>
To change this situation, the province is focusing on the
development of the petrochemical industry to improve its
industrial structure and maintain its economic development growth
rate.
</P>
<P>
Over the past five years, Guangdong's investments in fixed
assets totalled 20 billion yuan (about 2.4 billion US dollars). A
number of petrochemical projects was launched or went into
operation during this period, which have greatly improved the
province's production capacity of petrochemical products.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong is presently a vital oil refining and exporting
base. It is capable of refining 13.7 million tons of oil annually,
accounting for one-tenth of the country's total. And it can
process more than 180 oil products.
</P>
<P>
Experts pointed out that the shortage of petrochemical products
in China will last for a long time.
</P>
<P>
The province predicts that by 2000, it will raise its oil
refining capacity to 38.5 million tons, and ethylene production
capacity to one million tons, both of which rank first in the
country.
</P>
<P>
By that time, Guangdong may become the country's largest
petrochemical-producing province.

SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Colombian President
Ernesto Samper will travel next month to the United States to
attend the annual United Nations General Assembly, said foreign
ministry sources today.
</P>
<P>
As a head of state, Samper does not need a visa to attend the

<P>
On July 11, the United States revoked the Colombian president's

President Samper will travel to New York as head of state and
president of the Nonaligned Movement Countries.
</P>
<P>
Julio Londono Paredes, Colombia's ambassador to the United

<HEADLINE> Shanghai to Promote Social Security System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 28 (Xinhua) -- A new type of social security
system with basic insurance and social assistance in China's
largest city is providing financial help for low-income families.
</P>
<P>
The system covers more than 450,000 people in Shanghai,
including retired workers and jobless who account for three
percent of the total population, most of whom can hardly support
themselves or pay for medical bills.
</P>
<P>
Through the local social security departments, the city
established a "help the poor" system several years ago to provide
pensions and unemployment insurance for poorer residents. This now
covers 90 percent of the retired and 95 percent of the unemployed
people.
</P>
<P>
Many enterprises and governmental departments have also set up
foundations, which have collected a total of 500 million yuan in
recent years, to donate money or daily-use items to the poor
residents.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai's government has also granted many poor workers
special cards that allow them to get a certain amount of food for
free.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the city's social security departments provided 130
million yuan in pensions for 13,000 retired workers from 96 local
enterprises.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Consumer Confidence Posts Six-Year High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Consumer faith in the U.S.
economy surged in August for a second straight month, hitting a
new six-year high and raising doubts that the economy is headed
for a slowdown.
</P>
<P>
The Conference Board, a private business research group based
in New York, said Tuesday its Consumer Confidence Index rose 2.4
points to 109.4 this month, following a 7-point rise in July.
</P>
<P>
Most economists, who had expected a decline to about 105, said
news of the unexpected optimism could give the Federal Reserve
Board more reason to raise interest rates by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
Consumer confidence is watched closely for indications of
consumer spending, which accounts for about two-thirds of the
nation's economy.
</P>
<P>
The Conference Board also reported that consumers' opinion of
current business conditions rose 2 points and their expectations
for the next six months climbed 3 points.
</P>
<P>
They were the highest confidence levels about current and
future business conditions since the Consumer Confidence Index,
which is a composite of the two measures, hit 110.6 points in
March 1990.
</P>
<P>
Economists said the surge in consumer optimism, if confirmed by
further signs of economic strength, could derail a predicted
slowdown in the second half of the year. That, in turn, could
prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates as early as its
next policy-making meeting on Sept. 24.

CHICAGO, August 27 (Xinhua)-- The U.S. ruling Democratic Party
today said that they are committed to continuing efforts for a
lasting and comprehensive peace solution to the long-standing
Middle East conflicts with all parties concerned.
</P>
<P>
More than 4,000 Democratic delegates from across the United
States have been gathering in this northern U.S. big city since
Monday for a four-day National Convention to officially nominate
incumbent President Bill Clinton as the party's candidate for the
next U.S. President.
</P>
<P>
While applauding the Clinton administration's achievements in
promoting the Mideast peace process in the past few years, the
delegates said in their national platform that they are determined
to help Clinton to build his administration's record in the Middle
East.
</P>
<P>
The platform alleged that the U.S. Democratic Party "remains
committed to America's long-standing special relationship with
Israel, based on shared values, a mutual commitment to democracy
and strategic alliance that benefits both nations."
</P>
<P>
"The United States should continue to help Israel maintain its
qualitative edge," the 33-page platform said.

Meanwhile, the Democrats said that they are also "committed to
working with our Arab partners for peace to build a brighter, more

NEW YORK, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Stocks on Wall Street moved

The Dow Jones industrial average was up 17.38 at 5,711.27.
</P>

Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by 8 to 5 on the New

shares, up from 281.38 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index rose 1.26 to 357.15, and the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index rose 2.51 to 666.39.

<P>
The Nasdaq composite index rose 7.62 to 1,146.84, and the
American Stock Exchange's market value index rose 1.43 to 562.05.

Both stocks and bonds opened stronger but dipped around 10
a.m., after the The Conference Board business research group said
its Consumer Confidence Index rose 2.4 points to 109.4 this month
after rising 7 points in July. Most economists had expected a
decline to about 105.
</P>
<P>
The Consumer Confidence report reinforced investors' fears that
the economy is growing at an inflationary pace. Investors worry
that a consistent stream of robust economic data will prompt the
Federal Reserve to raise interest rates.

The yields of the 30-year Treasury bond declined slightly to

<HEADLINE> U.S. Democrats Urge Increases of U.S. Foreign Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHICAGO, August 27 (Xinhua)-- The U.S. Democratic Party today
urged the U.S. Republican-controlled Congress to increase
America's foreign aid and pay dues to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
"There is a price to be paid for America's security and its
leadership in world affairs," the Democrats said in their 1996
platform for Presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
The 33-page platform was adopted here at the second day of the
four-day Democratic National Convention to formerly nominate Bill
Clinton as the party's candidate for the next four-year U.S.
president.
</P>
<P>
The United States has been widely and sharply criticized for
its reducing aid to foreign nations in the past few years and
owing more than 1.5 billion U.S. dollars to the world body. The
current U.S. foreign policy spending accounts for less than one
percent of the federal budget.
</P>
<P>
The Democratic platform blamed the Republican Party controlling
both the U.S. Congress and Senate for slashing U.S. assistance to
the poorest and most vulnerable populations on earth and pushing
the United States "to dead last among developed nations in the
global fight against starvation, infant mortality, natural
disasters and environmental degradation and other worldwide
problems."
</P>
<P>
"The Democratic Party is committed to resist these
irresponsible cuts that undermine our security and America's
ability to lead," the platform stressed.

<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian Serbs said on Tuesday
they were unhappy with a decision by OSCE to postpone municipal
elections from September to next April or May and would go ahead
with the elections as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
Serb parliament Speaker Momcilo Krajisnik expressed his deep
disappointment with the decision taken Tuesday by the Organization
for Security and Cooperation in Europe to postpone the local
elections, Tanjug news agency reported from Serb administrative
center Pale.
</P>
<P>
OSCE mission head in Bosnia Robert Frowick announced in
Sarajevo earlier in the day he decided, as chairman of the OSCE's
Provisional Election Commission, to postpone municipal elections
in Bosnia because of voter registration irregularities.
</P>
<P>
Krajisnik said he did not know the reasons for this decision
but expressed concern at seeing that "one side (Muslims) can make
OSCE mission chief Frowick change his earlier decision."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Serb deputy prime minister Miroslav Vjestica said
the Serbs would hold full elections, including municipal ones,
despite of the OSCE decision.
</P>
<P>
Bosnian Serb news agency SRNA quoted Vjestica as saying that
the decision was "undemocratic and "the government of the Bosnian
Serb republic will, in keeping with a decision by the national
assembly, hold full elections -- meaning also municipal -- as
envisaged by the rules of the organization for security and
cooperation in Europe."
</P>
<P>
The Serb government "has firmly decided to hold integral
elections and in this respect has already issued orders to
municipal election commissions," SRNA said.

LONDON, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Leading European stock markets
ended mixed today, with British shares recovering most of its
early losses although Wall Street failed to continue its strong
opening performance.
</P>
<P>
London stock market performed badly early this morning after a
three-day holiday although it had hit a series of records last
week, sparked by a wave of interest rate cuts in several European
countries, but later on it recovered most of its losses and closed
only slightly lower.
</P>
<P>
Of the three major European markets, Frankfurt was the only one
which ended higher. But dealers said that shares were moving
sideways in initial dealings in the absence of new market-moving
factors. The ongoing weakness of the dollar was also blamed.
</P>
<P>
Frankfurt's DAX-30 shares ended floor trading up 0.25 percent
and the computerized IBIS index surged 0.4 percent, pushed by the
performance of chemical shares.
</P>
<P>
The Paris bourse finished slightly lower as dealers felt
worried about the government's Autumn budget.
</P>
<P>
The Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 leading British
shares ended 1.8 points down at 3,905.7. Frankfurt's DAX-30 shares

WASHINGTON, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Nation of Islam leader
Louis Farrakhan is waiting for U.S. government's permission
to let him travel to Libya to accept an international
humanitarian award named after Moammar Gadhafi, reports say here
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Farrakhan, also the organizer of last year's Million Man March
in Washington, visited Libya last January and met with Libyan
leader Gadhafi.
</P>
<P>
During their meeting, Gadhafi pledged $1 billion to the Nation
of Islam, a religious organization, to mobilize "oppressed
minorities to play a significant role in American political life",
according to Libya's news agency.
</P>
<P>
The Humanitarian award includes a $250,000 cash prize in
recognition of Farrakhan's "role as being a fighter for justice
in calling for the Million Man March in Washington, D.C.", the
Final Call, Nation of Islam's newspaper, said.
</P>
<P>
Farrakhan said he would use the money to mobilize black voters
and promote economic opportunity for blacks by building schools
and factories, and for charitable purposes.
</P>
<P>
Nation of Islam filed a formal application with the Treasury
Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control last week, asking to
be permitted to accept the money offered by Libya as a humanitarian
gesture, but no response has yet received.
</P>
<P>
Since 1986, the federal government has barred Americans from
most business transactions with Libya as it is on the U.S.
blacklist.

<P>
WASHINGTON, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Two Japanese companies and
the New Jersey subsidiary of a Korean company agreed today to
plead guilty to conspiring to fix worldwide prices for an animal
feed additive, according to an AP report.
</P>
<P>
The three companies and their executives also agreed to pay 20
million dollars in fines for the price-fixing.
</P>
<P>
The guilty plea agreements were the first charges in the U.S.
Justice Department's investigation of price-fixing in the food and
feed additive business, which also has targeted the giant American
food processing company, Archer Daniels Midland (ADM).
</P>
<P>
No charges were filed against ADM yet. But the U.S. government
said its investigation was continuing against companies it would
not name.
</P>
<P>
"All of the corporate and individual defendants already have
begun to cooperate with the government's ongoing investigation,"
said U.S. Deputy Assistant Attorney General Gary R. Spratling,
head of the antitrust division's criminal enforcement.
</P>
<P>
The case involved lysine, an amino acid used to ensure proper
growth of swine and poultry and a 600 million dollars industry in
itself.
</P>
<P>
A criminal felony case was filed in U.S. District Court in
Chicago today charging that the six defendants conspired among
themselves and with unnamed others to suppress and eliminate
competition in the lysine market from June 1992 through June 27,
1995. It charged a violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act.
</P>
<P>
Those charged were Ajinomoto Co. Inc. of Tokyo and its former
general manager of the feed additives division, Kyowa Hakko Kogyo
Co. Ltd. of Tokyo and its former general manager of the
agricultural products department and Sewon America Inc., N.J., and
its president. Sewon America is a subsidiary of Sewon Company Ltd.
of Seoul, South Korea.

<HEADLINE> Final Verdicts on Ex-presidents By April 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The final verdicts on South Korean
ex-presidents Chun Doo-hwan and Roh Tae-woo will be made by the
end of April 1997 at the latest, court officials said here today.
</P>
<P>
Chun was sentenced to death and Roh to 22 and a half years in
prison yesterday by the Seoul District Court on charges of mutiny,
treason and corruption.
</P>
<P>
But lawyers for the two former heads of state are likely to
appeal against the sentences as the defendants have refused to
accept the verdicts.
</P>
<P>
An appeal trial has to be completed within four months of the
initial sentencing. A final decision by the Supreme Court must be
made within four months following the completion of the appeal
trial, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that the prosecutors assigned to the first trial
will continue their work in the appeal trial, while the same
heavyweight lawyers will defend their clients in the forthcoming
trial.
</P>
<P>
The mutiny and treason charges against Chun and Roh stem from
their roles in the military coup on December 12, 1979, and a
subsequent crackdown on a civil uprising in Kwangju, capital of
South Cholla Province, on May 18, 1980.
</P>
<P>
Chun, who masterminded the coup, seized power on August 27,
1980, and ruled the country until February 1988 when Roh took
over. Roh stepped down in February 1993 after a presidential
election which saw his fellow party-member Kim Young-sam take
power.
</P>
<P>
The court also fined Chun 282 million U.S. dollars and Roh 355
million dollars, representing the bribes they allegedly
accumulated while in office.
</P>
<P>
Many South Koreans, however, believe that Chun and Roh will be
granted amnesties by current president Kim Young-sam. A survey by
the independent Hankyoreh newspaper said 69 percent of Koreans
believe the two will be pardoned.

<HEADLINE> France to Hold International Photojournalism Festival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Images through the lenses of the
world's top news photographers will be on display at an
international photojournalism festival in southern France next
month.
</P>
<P>
The eighth "Visa pour L'Image" festival from August 31 to
September 15 in Perpignan will have 35 exhibitions of photos taken
by news photographers around the world and will award five prizes
to outstanding photo-journalists.
</P>
<P>
Jean-Francois Leroy, founder of the festival, said that the
event is aimed at showing the value of a profession which is "too
much maltreated by the media."
</P>
<P>
"While dozens of photographers risk their lives to cover the
major events without saying how they did it, it is the others who
use their coverage," said Leroy, who has received 600,000 visitors
and organized 240 exhibitions over the past seven years.
</P>
<P>
Among the photographs to be displayed are those reflecting the
desperate attempt by Mexicans to cross the American border taken
by Patrick Bard, war pictures of Chechnya by Stanley Green, the
AIDS disaster in Uganda by Paolo Pellegrin, and "Inheritors of the
year 2,000" by Francesco Zizola on the hazards faced by children
across the world.
</P>
<P>
"Visa pour L'Image" is financed by the local government of
Perpignan, Paris-Match magazine, Photo magazine, Kodak, Cannon and
various other French news institutions.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa To Continue With Restrictive Monetary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The increasing deficit on
the current account of the balance of payments and the decline in
capital inflows dictate the need to continue with restrictive
monetary policy and high interest rates in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed today by South Africa's Reserve
Bank Governor Chris Stals at the bank's annual general
meeting in Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the Reserve Bank will persist "on its current
course of responsible monetary restraint."
</P>
<P>
Stals said the bank is under pressure from certain sectors of
the private sector to relax monetary policy and to engineer lower
interest rates in order to support economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The Reserve Bank is aware of the adverse implications of high
interest rates, but has to be objective and maintain its policies
in the interest of medium-term financial stability, said the
governor.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out that the maintenance of the excessive
credit extended to the private sector and the country's large
current account deficit, "dictates the need to continue with the
restrictive overall monetary policy."
</P>
<P>
In terms of the figures given by Stals, the capital inflows in
the first six months of the year was sharply reduced to 2.7
billion Rand (about 0.6 billion US Dollars) from 11.2 billion
Rand (about 2.49 billion US Dollars) in the second half of 1995.
</P>
<P>
While the account deficit has increased over its already high
12.7 billion Rand (about 2.82 billion US Dollars) recorded last
year.
</P>
<P>
However, Stals stressed that he did not believe a hike in
interest rates at this time will mean investors return to the
country.
</P>
<P>
The economic situation at the moment is finely balanced and
does not warrant an immediate bank rate hike, he added.

<HEADLINE> Israel, PNA Agree to Reconvene Joint Economic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Finance Minister Dan
Meridor and his Palestinian counterpart Maher Masri today agreed
to reconvene on a monthly basis the joint economic committee,
which has not met for nine months, in a bid to ease the economic
hardship of Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
This is the first meeting between the two ministers and the
second bilateral high-level talk following the meeting between
Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy and Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat in late July.
</P>
<P>
After a one-hour closed-door meeting held at the Israeli
Finance Ministry, the two ministers announced they had agreed on a
program for future economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Meridor described the meeting as a "good meeting," saying that
the two sides shared "common interests" in improving the economic
situations in the Palestinian self-rule areas.
</P>
<P>
While acknowledging the existence of different opinions between
the two sides, Meridor said he and Masri would meet again to "try
to solve them in a most beneficial way" before a meeting of donor
countries on aid to the Palestinians will be held in Washington on
September 5.
</P>
<P>
PNA Minister of Trade and Economy Masri demanded Israel to
refrain from giving all its considerations to the security issue
while forgetting the important economic question. He urged Israel
to take concrete steps to ease the economic difficulties in the
territories, warning that "economic hardship creates serious
problems."
</P>
<P>
The Economic situation in the Palestinian self-rule areas is
becoming bad to worse as a result of a five-month long crippling
closure of the territories by Israel following a series of suicide
bombings inside Israel by Islamic militants between late February
and early March, killing about 58 people.
</P>
<P>
According to a U.N. report, the closure has cost the
Palestinian economy about 600 million U.S. dollars. The annual per
capita income has dropped by half to about 800 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Despite the partial easing of closure after the Likud
government took office in June, the unemployment rate stands
respectively at 40 percent and 50 percent in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip. The PNA is also reportedly burdened by a budget
deficit of 127 million U.S. dollars as few of the promise of aid
by international donor countries has realized.
</P>
<P>
Meridor said that it's high time for Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu to hold the long-delayed meeting with PNA leader Yasser
Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu is facing increasing pressure to hold a meeting with
Arafat. According to an earlier report, the Israeli premier would
meet Arafat "in the next couple of weeks."

<HEADLINE> Canadian Banks to See Profits Rise 13 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- As big Canadian banks begin
reporting third quarter profits today, analysts here believe the
reports will show the rapid earnings growth this year is beginning
to slow.
</P>
<P>
The six major banks of Canada are expected to deliver third
quarter earnings 13 percent above the 1 billion U.S. dollars they
made in the third quarter of last year, said local media reports
today.
</P>
<P>
However, profits are likely to grow little from the 1.1 billion
U.S. dollars earned in the second quarter of the year.
</P>
<P>
Bank of Montreal and Bank of Nova Scotia will release their
results today for the quarter ending July 31.
</P>
<P>
Toronto-Dominion Bank and National Bank of Canada report theirs
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Canada's two biggest banks, Royal Bank and Canadian Imperial
Bank of Commerce, will report next week.
</P>
<P>
The earnings of Canadian banks have been surging since 1994
when much of the country's economy was sluggish and consumers were
struggling with heavy debts.
</P>
<P>
The main reasons for the big profits are lower loan-loss
charges and better results at the banks' investment-dealer units,
powered by continued active stock and bond markets, according to
the media reports.

ADDOS ABABA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Water Resources
Minister Shiferaw Jarso said today that about 30,000 people have
so far been evacuated from the flooded areas in a life-saving
campaign since the Awash River bursted its bank.
</P>
<P>
Shiferaw, a memebr of the newly established National Committee
in charge of disaster prevention, said there is no fear that the
overflowing of Awash River will flood areas neighburing Wonji.
</P>
<P>
The Wonji Town, 90 kilometers south-east of Addis Ababa, was
flooded by the overflow of Awash River last Friday night and more
than 20,000 residents of the town were evacuated to nearby four
temporary camps set for them by the government.
</P>
<P>
Shiferaw said preventive activities will be undertaken in a
consolidated manner as there will not be heavy rainfalls until
the coming Wednesday, according to meterological predictions.
</P>
<P>
Strengthened efforts are being undertaken to prevent floods
from damaging standing crops in the flooded areas.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that numerous members of the Ethiopian
National Defence Force are making dikes to help prevent the
overflow fo the Awash River.

<HEADLINE> Premier: Jordanian-Iraqi Trade Ties Not to Be </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul
Karim Kabariti said here today that the Jordanian-Iraqi economic
relations will not be affected by the events happened in the
kingdom in the past week.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said Jordan will remain as "the lifeline" of
the Iraqi people while meeting today with Ahmed Al Lawzi, speaker
of the Senate and Saad Hail El-Sorour, speaker of the Lower House
of the Parliament.
</P>
<P>
His remarks, political analysts here said, aimed at dispelling
fears among Jordanian businessmen that the government's accusation
of Iraqi instigating the so-call "bread riots" in southern parts
of the kingdom several days ago and this week's expulsion of two
senior Iraqi diplomats would damage the economic ties between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
Violent protests broke out in Kerak in southern Jordan on
August 16 after the government announced a 117 percent hike in
bread prices in line with an economic reform program launched in
1989 under the supervision of the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
Two Iraqi diplomats were ordered to leave Jordan for allegedly
being involved in activities "incompatible with their diplomatic
status."
</P>
<P>
Baghdad, which is under a U.N. trade embargo following its 1990
invasion of Kuwait, was Jordan's once biggest trade partner. It
met Jordan's needs of oil, half of which is free and the other
half at a very low price.
</P>
<P>
Jordan also pinned high hopes on the Iraqi-U.N. oil-for-food
deal signed in May to resume its slack economy and reduce its high
unemployment rate.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Not Heading for Economic Recession: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Although the relatively
strong upswing in economic growth over the past two years in
South Africa is losing momentum, the economy is not heading for
recession, Reserve Bank Governor Chris Stals said today.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference prior to the Reserve Bank's annual
general meeting in Pretoria, Stals said the expansion in the
country's gross domestic product is still on course to achieve
about three percent growth this year.
</P>
<P>
Stals said the main impetus of the growth is a recovery from
the agricultural sector, following adverse conditions in 1994 and
1995.
</P>
<P>
According to figures released by the Central Statistical
Service, the economy grew at a strong 3.5 percent in the second
quarter of the year, up from 3.3 percent in the first three
months.
</P>
<P>
Gross domestic expenditure has fallen from 5.5 percent growth
last year to an average annualized rate of 3.5 percent, while
real gross domestic fixed investment dropped to six percent from
more than 10 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
However, Stals said the slowdown in economic activity and the
lower underlying economic growth are part of the normal business
cycle, and not cause for great concern.

PARIS, August 27 (Xinhua) -- France is preparing a law to
counter the U.S. Helms-Burton law and D'Amato-Kennedy law to
protect French enterprises from U.S. sanctions, said French
Foreign Minister Herve de Charette today.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the daily Echos to be published Wednesday,
de Charette said that the two U.S. laws are "above the red line
and testify a unilateral step of the Americans" and are "a
distinguished violation of the rule of world trade."
</P>
<P>
While the European Union is considering collective
counter-measures, France is working on a national law "which will
allow us to react to the Helms-Burton law by installing... the
possibility of recourse for our companies harmed by American
sanctions," said de Charette.
</P>
<P>
But he said that France does not want to wage a trade war with
the United States.
</P>
<P>
De Charette also said that the French government is launching
an economic diplomatic offensive to help the small and
medium-sized enterprises of the country export their products.
</P>

All the French ambassadors stationed abroad are now meeting in
Paris to discuss ways to help French small and medium-sized
enterprises enter the market of the countries they are working in.

<HEADLINE> Liberia's Taylor Orders Disarmament of 500 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Liberia's warlord Charles Taylor
has ordered to disarm 500 fighters from his National Patriotic
Front of Liberia (NPFL) within two weeks to show the faction's
commitment to disarmament.
</P>
<P>
Taylor also said that 3,000 other NPFL fighters will be
demobilized over the same period, a report obtained here said
today.
</P>
<P>
"The initial disarmament of the fighters is meant to
demonstrate to the world and the Liberian people that the NPFL is
committed to disarmament in compliance with the recent Abuja
peace agreement," the report quoted Taylor as saying on Monday on
his private and state-run radio stations.
</P>
<P>
Liberia's warring factions signed a revived peace deal on
August 17 in Abuja, capital of Nigeria, promising to disarm and
demobilize their fighters to pave the way for restoring peace in
the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
Taylor said he will invite soldiers from the west African
peacekeeping force known as ECOMOG which is responsible for
disarming some 60,000 combatants from various warring factions
"to receive the arms".
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> US Training Troops for "Covering" Mission in Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The United States is training
a fresh force of roughly 5,000 army troops in Germany, which is
expected to be deployed to Bosnia this autumn to provide extra
security during the pullout of the NATO-led peacekeeping force,
U.S. officials said today.
</P>
<P>
Pentagon spokesman Lt. Col. Rick Scott said he could not
discuss details, but confirmed that troops in Germany "are
undergoing training" in anticipation of a formal decision to send
them as a covering force for the U.S. withdrawal from Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The NATO-led peacekeeping mission is scheduled to end in
mid-December. No decision has been made on whether to keep a
restructured international force in Bosnia beyond December.
</P>
<P>
It is said the final decision will not be made by the NATO
council until the Bosnian elections, scheduled for September.
</P>
<P>
Scott said he could not confirm any timetable.
</P>
<P>
NATO announced several weeks ago that Gen. William Crouch,
commander of U.S. Army Europe and chief of NATO's Allied Land
Forces Central Europe, will go to Bosnia this autumn to assume
control of the peacekeepers' withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
There are about 16,000 American troops in Bosnia.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian FM: Syria Prepared to Resume Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa said here today that Syria is determined to pursue the path
of peace within the context of the approved commitments and
principles.
</P>
<P>
Moussa added the Syria is prepared to resume the Middle East
peace process and the Syrian-Israeli meetings in Washington,
considering that numerous issues have been agreed upon and basic
principles, particularly the land-for-peace principle and the
Madrid peace conference resolutions, do exist on the ground.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian minister made the remarks before he left here this
evening for Tunisia, the second leg of his Arab-African tour that
will also take him to Mauritania and Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said that on the basis of the Madrid resolutions and the
land-for-peace principle, Syria is ready to resume negotiations
with Israel from where they have stopped and on the same level.
</P>
<P>
This attitude, he said, reaffirms Syria's support of the peace
process in order to reach a peaceful settlement through
negotiations on the basis of the Madrid resolutions.
</P>
<P>
On the upcoming visit to Cairo by Israeli Foreign Minister
David Levy, the Egyptian minister said discussions during the
visit will cover the Israeli freeze of the peace process, the
issues of Jewish settlements, the freezing of negotiations on the
Syrian and Lebanese tracks, and Israel's failure to implement the
Palestinian-Israeli agreements on redeployment and withdrawal from
Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Moussa underlined that progress of the peace process hinges on
the Israeli attitude toward the resumption of negotiations and
the boosting of the peace process, and on Israel's commitment to
the Madrid principles which were approved by the previous Israeli
Labor government.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq al-Shara said that
Syrian-Israeli negotiations which had stopped in February ought
to start again from the point they had reached, on the basis of
legitimate international resolutions and the land-for-peace
principle.

<HEADLINE> (Updated) OSCE Decides to Delay Bosnia's Municipal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) decided today to postpone
municipal elections in the post-war Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Robert H. Frowick, head of the OSCE mission in Bosnia, said,
"In face of widespread abuse of rules and regulations... I have
made a chairman's decision therefore that it is not feasible to
hold municipal elections on the 14th of September."
</P>
<P>
Frowick is also chairman of Bosnia's Provisional Election
Commission which is made of representatives from all three
factions of Bosnia as well as from the international community.
Under the Dayton accord, he has the final say when the commission
fails to reach a consensus.
</P>
<P>
The decision to delay municipal elections came after the Muslim
side threatened to boycott the whole elections if the OSCE did not
annul the so-called P-2 form, which originates from the Dayton
accord and allows refugees to choose wherever they wish to vote.
</P>
<P>
Serb authorities have reportedly mobilized refugees to vote in
such strategical towns as Brcko and Srebrenica, where Serbs were
the minority before the war, in order to legally control those
municipal governments after the elections.
</P>
<P>
"The electoral guidelines drawn from the (Dayton) general
framework agreement for peace were meant to enable individual
voters to decide for themselves where they wish to reside and
vote, but they have been seriously distorted at the municipal
level," Frowick said.
</P>
<P>
But Frowick said that his decision is not only based on
irregularities on Serb territory, but also on those which had
occurred in the Muslim- and Croats-controlled towns.
</P>
<P>
The retired American diplomat said that elections for the
cantonal, entity and central governments will proceed as scheduled
and the officials of the contact group for Bosnia will meet early
next month to decide a later date for the municipal elections.
</P>
<P>
The contact group consists of Britain, France, Germany, Russia
and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Frowick suggested that the municipal elections be postponed
until April or May of 1997.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Assistant Secretary of State to Visit Balkan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 27 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Assistant Secretary of
State for European and Canadian Affairs John Kornblum is scheduled
to visit Belgrade, Zagreb, Sarajevo and Banja Luka from Wednesday,
the State Department announced today.
</P>
<P>
During his 4-day trip, Kornblum, chief U.S. mediator for the
Balkans, will attend a Federation Forum Meeting in Sarajevo and
will meet with Biljana Plavsic, the acting president of the
Bosnian Serb Republic in Banja Luka.
</P>
<P>
He is also going to meet Tudjman in Zagreb, with Serbian
President Slobodan Milosevic in Belgrade and hold talks in
Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital, as well.
</P>
<P>
His trip is designed to make sure the Bosnian Croats are
fulfilling a pledge made two week ago by Croatian President Franjo
Tudjman to dissolve their separate government offices and blend
them into a federation with Muslims.
</P>
<P>
The trip coincided with a decision this morning by Robert
Frowick, head of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe (OSCE), to postpone municipal elections in
Bosnia-Herzegovina.
</P>
<P>
Frowick's decision resulted from what Kornblum said "fairly
clear and massive registration irregularities, particularly in the
Serb side."
</P>
<P>
"The United States supports this decision," Kornblum said.
</P>
<P>
He said this decision does not effect the overall election
process.
</P>
<P>
Under the Dayton peace accord reached last November, free and
fair, internationally supervised elections will be conducted
within six to nine months for the Presidency and House of
Representatives of Bosnia and Herzegovina, for the House of
Representatives of the Federation and the National Assembly and
presidency of the Bosnian Serb Republic, and, if feasible, for
local offices.
</P>
<P>
National presidential and parliamentary elections are set to
be held Sept.14.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Urges US not to Block Implementing MOU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 27 (Xinhua) -- The Iraqi permanent
mission to the United Nations today appealed the United States to
stock its interventions and obstructing the way of implementing
the oil-for-food formula.
</P>
<P>
In a press release, the Iraqi mission accused that the U.S.
continued obstructing the implementation of the Memorandum of
Understanding (MOU) between Iraq and the United Nations on
oil-for-food formula.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations imposed economic sanctions on Iraq after
its invasion of Kuwait in August 1990. The 6-year sanctions have
crippled Iraqi economy and resulted in tremendous hardships of
its people.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council adopted resolution 986 in April 1995,
allowing Iraq to export oil worth 2 billion dollars in six months
to import food, medicine and other necessities so as to alleviate
the severe humanitarian situation.
</P>
<P>
"In each and every time the U.S. put obstacles in the way of
the process, it forwards baseless justifications and pretexts,"
the mission said.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. delegation delayed the adoption of expedite
procedures in the Sanctions Committee. By doing so, the U.S. stood
alone against the other 14 members of the Sanctions Committee and
provoked astonishment of the international community," the mission
added.
</P>
<P>
The mission said that the U.S. continued to hinder the process
for implementing MOU through their insistence to impose
exaggerated number of international staff in contradiction with
what had been agreed upon between Iraq and the U.N. Secretariat.
</P>
<P>
It noted that the amount of money allocated for the exaggerated
number of international staff surpassed the amount for five
humanitarian sectors: electricity, water, sewers, education and
agriculture.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. position is not only unreasonable, but also
contradicts with all humanitarian considerations and with
resolution 986," the Iraqi mission stressed.
