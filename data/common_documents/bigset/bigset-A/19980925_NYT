<P>
   CLINTON-POLL (Undated) _ President Clinton's standing with
Americans has rebounded widely in the days since the release of his
video-taped testimony before a grand jury, and, in fact, people are
so exasperated with the Lewinsky scandal that there are stirrings
of a backlash against the Republican-controlled Congress as it
presses forward with an impeachment inquiry, the latest New York
Times/CBS News Poll shows. By Richard L. Berke.

   CLINTON-ASSESS (Washington) _ Ask in Foggy Bottom, ask in
Whitehall, ask on the Quai d'Orsay, ask at the Kremlin, and you get
the same deeply discreet answer: No, of course, Bill Clinton's
personal and political troubles have not impaired the capacity of
the United States to conduct foreign policy. But scratch a little
deeper, push a little harder, and you discover that diplomats and
politicians in most of the world's major nations are worried sick
by the spectacle of a distracted president in Washington at a
moment when, in their view at least, bold American leadership is
all but indispensable. By R.W. Apple Jr.

   CLINTON-COUNTERATTACK (Washington) _ When the report of Kenneth
Starr, the Whitewater independent counsel, landed like a bombshell

done everything they can to refocus the spotlight onto
congressional Republicans. By Alison Mitchell.

   CRASH-AFTERMATH (Peggy's Cove, Nova Scotia) _ The pattern of
life traditionally followed by the 60 residents of Peggy's Cove was
shattered on a clear night at the beginning of the month when a
huge jet tumbled out of the sky and slammed into the Atlantic with
enough force to make earthquake detector instruments quiver. And
while Peggy's Cove is returning to some kind of normalcy, what
everyone wants to know is if it can ever be the same again. By

legislators around the country are passing an increasing number of

by a consortium of banks and brokerages to save a large investment
fund from collapse was designed to bring stability to world
markets, it is not yet working. By Gretchen Morgenson.
</P>
<P>
   HEDGEFUND-TEAM (New York) _ When Salomon Brothers was raking in
the money, investors would grin at one another and say, ``J.M.'s
done it again.'' ``J.M.'' is John Meriwether, who turned huge
profits by using complex trading strategies and huge amounts of
capital to exploit price discrepancies in the world's bond markets.
Now, in perhaps the clearest sign to date of the current fragile
state of global financial markets, Meriwether's latest bubble has
burst. No longer at Salomon, he is at the center of a $95 billion
storm that led to this week's $3.7 billion bailout of his hedge
fund orchestrated by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. By Peter

COURIER ON BENCH AS FAST-RISING GAMBILL MOVES IN 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ROBIN FINN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE _ When the time came to unveil the identity of the
U.S. Davis Cup squadron that will battle Italy in the semifinal
here this weekend, the hot hand won out over the old hand during a
chilly outdoor draw ceremony a few blocks from the designated
battlefield, a semi-sluggish indoor hardcourt at the Milwaukee
Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Tradition practically mandated that Tom Gullikson, the U.S.
Davis Cup captain, turn to Jim Courier, a veteran so reliable that
he has never been on a losing team, to back up Todd Martin in
singles. But Gullikson gave the second singles slot to 21-year-old
Jan-Michael Gambill, a Jaguar-driving, cellular phone-toting ``Star
Trek'' groupie from Spokane, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   In the first of two singles matches scheduled for Friday,
Gambill, who jumped from 227th to 50th in the ranking this season,
makes his Davis Cup debut against Italy's top player, 47th-ranked
Andrea Gaudenzi. The Italian defeated him in their only encounter,
a rain-plagued meeting on Austrian clay, earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   In the second match, the 28th-ranked, 28-year-old Martin faces a
backup singles player for Italy by way of UCLA, Davide Sanguinetti.
For Saturday's doubles, Martin and another Davis Cup neophyte,
Justin Gimelstob, tackle Gaudenzi and Diego Nargiso, a veteran
whose specialty is doubles. The singles pairings are reversed on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't come here thinking I wouldn't play,'' Courier said,
``but once I was here I kind of got the feeling that that was the
way Gully was leaning.''
</P>
<P>
   Now ranked 72d, Courier developed a chronic and puzzling case of
``dead arm'' around 18 months ago. ``It's an ongoing battle,''
Courier said of the arm trouble, which he has traced to his biceps
and likens to the plight of a pitcher who has thrown one fastball
too many. ``I don't think the human arm was designed to do what I
asked mine to do.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been five years since the former No. 1 captured the last
of his four Grand Slam titles. Consecutive opening-round losses in
summer hardcourt events prompted him to withdraw from the U.S. Open
and take six weeks off until he reconsidered his position on the
sideline and, aware that Pete Sampras, Andre Agassi and Michael
Chang had said no to this semifinal, volunteered for duty.
</P>
<P>
   Gullikson said current form, rather than current sentiment, took
precedence in Gambill's selection.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just basically an issue of match toughness,'' Gullikson
said. Gambill, who notched victories over Agassi and Courier this
year and took the French Open champion, Carlos Moya, to a fifth set
at the Open two weeks ago, has it; Courier does not.

MAN FULFILLS DREAM BY SINGING ANTHEM AT 30 MAJOR LEAGUE PARKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY BETH BARRETT  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For once, the record-setter in the Los Angeles
Dodgers outfield was the guy singing the national anthem.
</P>
<P>
   The last word, ``brave,'' faded into the autumn air as it has
thousands of times in North America this year.
</P>
<P>
   Only this time, it really meant something.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Reiman, who at 44 seems too young and full of life to be
struck with incurable Lou Gehrig's disease, set out from his home
north of Seattle five months ago with a dream to sing the anthem in
all 30 major league baseball parks by season's end.
</P>
<P>
   In Dodger Stadium he completed the cycle.
</P>
<P>
   Reiman walked off the field grinning and slowing shaking his
head in a kind of wonder. ``The end is kind of bittersweet,'' he
said. ``Baseball season is ending and I'm a baseball fan. But
mostly, it's been really sweet. I've lived a Reiman Field of Dreams
this season. I feel nothing but having been blessed and humbled.''
</P>
<P>
   The journey hasn't been about fame, though the national The ALS
Association in Los Angeles will seek a notation in the Guinness
Book of World Records to commemorate Reiman's feat.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, Reiman's has been a quest to honor and express in the
best way left his respect and love for a game his father taught him
to revere.
</P>
<P>
   Each stop also has been a salute to Lou Gehrig, the legendary
New York Yankee who after acknowledging he had ALS, or amyotrophic
lateral sclerosis, in 1939 declared himself ``the luckiest man on
the face of the Earth.''
</P>
<P>
   Reiman is determined to show the 30,000 people with ALS in the
United States the same example of living in courage and in faith.
</P>
<P>
   As such, the trek has been one of hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since I sing the anthem because of my illness, there is a very
intimate and personal connection for many people who are watching
from the stadium and often those people come to find me.''
</P>
<P>
   They shake his hand, tell him their stories, share hugs. Some
are suffering from ALS, others aren't.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was truly unexpected was the overwhelming response in all
the cities,'' said Michael Havlicek, president of The ALS
Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adversity is a common human experience,'' Reiman said.
``People kind of feel encouraged and inspired to keep on going.''
</P>
<P>
   It all started April 4, when Reiman and his wife, Julie, set out
for Shea Stadium in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ``We grinned and waved goodbye to our 17-year-old twins,''
Reiman noted in a journal he keeps and posts on the Internet.
``Could this really be happening to us?''
</P>
<P>
   It had been almost seven years since he first noticed a slight
weakening in his thumb and spasms in his left arm. ALS is a
neurological disease that eventually destroys all the body's
voluntary muscles.
</P>
<P>
   Since that day in 1991, one physical skill after another has
vanished: the strength to run and bicycle, the endurance to teach
and counsel young people, the dexterity to play the piano and the
guitar. Even the coordination to perform such mundane tasks as
lifting grocery bags is gone.
</P>
<P>
   His college wrestler's physique has wasted away until his wife
now helps him with his socks and cuts up his spaghetti.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was scared and unsure of what it all meant, and later I was
angry. And I cried. In fact, sometimes I still do. It took six
months to figure out how to start fighting,'' Reiman wrote in his
manuscript, ``Through the Perilous Fight.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I want my body back the way it was,'' he wrote at one point.
</P>
<P>
   But at Shea the meaning of his long journey through grief and
sadness to acceptance and finally to appreciation crystallized in
the faces of ``a lovable old man in a wheelchair'' and of a mother
and son each with the disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is my job to be their voice and presence to a nation for
the next six months, to tell their stories and compel a nation of
people to listen, care and respond. A great honor. A wonderful and
great responsibility,'' Reiman wrote then.
</P>
<P>
   Again he was reassured that the disease meant something, and
that by fighting and living with it each day he was receiving more
than he had lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had to give back everything that's happened to me just to
give the ALS back, I wouldn't do it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He paused, reflecting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would never go backwards. I prefer the gifts, the spiritual
ones, that I have now. The rest is temporal. It's passing.''
</P>
<P>
   Reiman's chronicle of the tour, or ``Season For Hope,'' is a
cross between a wide-eyed kid in a baseball field of dreams and a
mature man's reflections on life.
</P>
<P>
   At the Kingdome in Seattle, where 300 friends and family heard
him sing early in the tour he got to sit in the dugout.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dugout!! Me, sit in the actual Mariner's dugout ... next
to the bats? For probably the millionth time in three weeks, I said
softly, `Oh wow!'''
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City tested his humor. Given the honor of throwing out
the first pitch, he hit the photographer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Luckily I can't throw faster than a 5-year-old on a good day
and he was wearing a long, flowing raincoat. No harm done, except
to my ego.''
</P>
<P>
   Always on the tour, Gehrig was in his thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   At Boston's Fenway Park, he sat in the visitors dugout where
Gehrig would have sat as he played in one of his 2,130 consecutive
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, it was like flying to the moon, stepping out onto that
alien surface and putting your own feet in Neil Armstrong's dusty
boot prints. He had been here.''
</P>
<P>
   At Camden Yards, Baltimore Oriole third baseman Cal Ripken, who
shattered Gehrig's consecutive-game record, said he would be
honored if Reiman would wear his jersey while he sang the anthem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was nearly overwhelmed with emotion and thoughts raced
through my head. He's honored if I wear his jersey? No, no, that's
backwards. I'm the one who's honored. This is too much. Tears began
to well up under my eyes as I clutched the black and orange number
eight to my chest.''
</P>
<P>
   The cathedral in Reiman's pilgrimage was Yankee Stadium earlier
this month.
</P>
<P>
   He asked to be taken out to Monument Park behind center field
where the old, bronze plaques of Yankee legends stand immortal, the
``icons of the saints.''
</P>
<P>
   Gehrig's marker is among three that stand alone.

shattered Gehrig's consecutive-game record, said he would be
honored if Reiman would wear his jersey while he sang the anthem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was nearly overwhelmed with emotion and thoughts raced
through my head. He's honored if I wear his jersey? No, no, that's
backwards. I'm the one who's honored. This is too much. Tears began
to well up under my eyes as I clutched the black and orange number
eight to my chest.''
</P>
<P>
   The cathedral in Reiman's pilgrimage was Yankee Stadium earlier
this month.
</P>
<P>
   He asked to be taken out to Monument Park behind center field
where the old, bronze plaques of Yankee legends stand immortal, the
``icons of the saints.''
</P>
<P>
   Gehrig's marker is among three that stand alone.

MALONE HIRES AN ASSISTANT
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Kevin Malone didn't fire anybody at Thursday's
annual meeting of department heads at Dodger Stadium, but the new
general manager did hire another former colleague from the Montreal
organization, Ed Creech, to be his assistant on the Los Angeles
Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Malone brought in Bill Geivett to be his assistant last week,
then made him farm director when Charlie Blaney was let go
Wednesday. Creech, scouting director for the St. Louis Cardinals
this past year, could move into that role here after a decision is
made on the Dodgers' Terry Reynolds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terry Reynolds is still the scouting director,'' Malone said,
``but he is still being evaluated.''
</P>
<P>
   During the meeting, no decisions were made on the future of
manager Glenn Hoffman or his coaching staff. Malone said he has not
interviewed any managerial candidates. If Hoffman is not brought
back, as expected, Malone said a decision on his replacement could
come after the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the Dodgers have made front-office decisions (i.e.
bringing back manager Tom Lasorda for another year) on the Tuesday
after the season ends.
</P>
<P>
   Malone will attend the World Series, which begins Oct. 17, to
talk to other general managers about potential deals and free
agents.
</P>
<P>
   He said again Thursday that he does not expect to enter the
bidding for No.1 starters Kevin Brown (San Diego) and Randy Johnson
(Houston), both free agents.
</P>
<P>
   Creech, 45, was in his first season with the Cardinals. Before
joining St. Louis, he spent 25 years with the Expos. He was
selected by Montreal in the second round of the June 1974 draft and
played six seasons in the minors.
</P>
<P>
   He retired in 1978 and returned to the Expos as a coach at
Triple-A Calgary. He also managed in the low minors and was the
East Coast scouting supervisor. Malone, the Expos GM in 1994-95,
hired Creech to be his scouting director.
</P>
<P>
   __ A good year: Jeff Cirillo, the Providence High School and USC
product, is having another outstanding season. Not only did he
enter Thursday's game with a .325 average and 97 runs for the
Brewers, he is second in the league with a .369 average with men on
base.
</P>
<P>
   Cirillo, an All-Star in 1997, also is third in the NL with a
.332 average against right-handed pitching. He leads the NL with a
.300 average with two strikes.

YANKEES TOP DEVIL RAYS, 5-2 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ An American League scout lounged in the stands at
Yankee Stadium on Thursday night, in his second week of trailing
the Yankees for a potential playoff opponent.
</P>
<P>
   The scout feels he knows how to pitch Chuck Knoblauch
effectively, how to beat Orlando Hernandez. But he acknowledged he
knows almost nothing about Shane Spencer, the late-season call-up
who continued his rampage by bashing a grand slam in the Yankees'
5-2 victory over Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   The victory was the Yankees' 111th in 159 games, surpassing the
club record of 110 set by the 1927 Yankees, who played 154 games.
The Yankees have matched the American League record set in 1954 by
the Cleveland Indians, who also played a 154-game season.
</P>
<P>
   The achievment prompted a congratulatory statement from the
Yankee owner, George Steinbrenner: ``From the time I was a kid
growing up, all I ever heard was how great the '27 Yankees were.
That's why this means so much. Joe Torre, his coaches and players
deserve all the credit. You all know winning is important to me.
But it is second _ first is breathing.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre, in his third year as Yankee manager, said of the team's
milestone: ``It feels enormous. We've made our place in history.''
</P>
<P>
   David Cone agreed, saying of the accomplishment of tying the
record of the '27 Yankees: ``Around here, it almost feels like
you're trying to compare yourself against ghosts, with all the
legends and all the stories.''
</P>
<P>
   Spencer is creating his own legend. The Yankees trailed Wilson
Alvarez of the Devil Rays by 2-0 after five and a half innings on
Thursday night, but scored a run in the sixth and loaded the bases
with nobody out for Spencer. The burly right-handed-hitting slugger
reached out and smashed a change-up over the wall in right-center
field, setting off an explosion of cheers from the crowd of 24,555
at Yankee Stadium. For the second time in two nights, Spencer was
shouted out of the dugout for a curtain call.
</P>
<P>
   Spencer has 5 homers and 6 other hits in his last 17 at-bats,
with 14 runs batted in, and he has 8 homers in only 57 at-bats for
the Yankees this season. Spencer, according to a member of the
Yankee organization, has not only made a case for winning a spot on
the post-season roster, but also may well persuade Torre to start
him in left field in the playoffs, particularly with both Tim
Raines and Darryl Strawberry recovering from minor leg injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to have a hot streak,'' Torre said, ``now's
the time to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   If Spencer does play in the post-season, at least one scout says
he does not yet know how to counter Spencer. ``He's hit everything
they've thrown him _ up and down, inside and outside, fastballs and
soft stuff,'' the scout said. ``I saw him swing at one changeup in
the dirt, and besides that, he hasn't taken a bad swing.''
</P>
<P>
   Spencer will get three more games to prove himself to Torre, and
other Yankees will have three more games to achieve personal goals.
</P>
<P>
   Bernie Williams shares the American League lead in hitting with
Mo Vaughn of Boston, at .334. Derek Jeter ranks third at .324 and
Paul O'Neill, who did not play on Thursday night, is ninth at .318.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be great preparation for the playoffs,''
Williams said. ``It's going to be very exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams needs one more run scored and six more driven home to
achieve 100 in each of those categories. Jeter needs one more hit
to reach 200.
</P>
<P>
   Needing one victory to reach 20, Cone has one more start
remaining, against Tampa Bay on Saturday. But Torre is not sure
Cone will have a chance to pitch the five innings to qualify for
the victory. Rather, Cone will be working with a limited pitch
count of 70 to 80.
</P>
<P>
   ``That could take him to a chance to get his 20th,'' Torre said,
``but that's not our focus. If we take him out with the lead,
you'll see our best guys out there following him.''
</P>
<P>
   Cone has had two shots at 20 and lost both games, and he
acknowledged part of him feels as if he has already missed his
chance. ``I may get another shot,'' Cone said, ``but that's not my
No. 1 priority.''

ETHICS INVESTIGATION OF HOLBROOKE IS NEARLY OVER, HIS LAWYER SAYS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs 8th and 9th grafs to correct spelling of Salomon Brothers)  (sw) 
 By PHILIP SHENON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The lawyer for Richard Holbrooke, whose
nomination as the American representative at the United Nations has
been sidetracked by a federal ethics investigation, said on
Thursday that the inquiry was nearly over and that investigators
had found nothing that should stop the nomination from proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer, Richard Beattie, said the Justice Department had
advised him that the investigation focused solely on whether
Holbrooke had benefited from illegal contacts with his former State
Department colleagues after he left in 1996 to become vice chairman
of Credit Suisse First Boston, a New York-based investment banking
firm.
</P>
<P>
   Beattie said a Justice Department official in Washington had
assured him in a telephone call on Thursday that the investigation
of Holbrooke, the veteran diplomat and architect of the 1995 peace
agreement in Bosnia, was expected to end within a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Beattie would not name the Justice Department official with whom
he spoke. A Justice Department spokesman, John Russell, had no
comment on the timetable for the inquiry, nor would he predict its
outcome. President Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright have pledged their continuing support for the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're confident that this investigation will end without any
finding of wrongdoing and that Mr. Holbrooke will be nominated and
confirmed in due course to serve this country,'' Beattie said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials say the investigation began
with an anonymous letter last summer to the State Department's
inspector general asserting that Holbrooke may have had a ``quid
pro quo'' with the Credit Suisse while he still worked at the State
Department.
</P>
<P>
   The detailed contents of the letter were disclosed on Thursday
by the Washington Post, which did not report how it had obtained
the letter.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke's lawyers acknowledged that in March 1995, when
Holbrooke was assistant secretary of state for European and
Canadian affairs, he helped Credit Suisse by contacting the
American ambassador in Hungary to ask the American embassy there to
withdraw its exclusive support for a different investment banking
firm, Salomon Brothers, for a multimillion-dollar consulting
contract with the Hungarian government. The ambassador agreed, and
Credit Suisse went on to win the contract.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, the Ambassador at the time, Donald Blinken,
said that Holbrooke had done nothing wrong in seeking to help
Credit Suisse and another investment banking firm, Goldman Sachs,
which were in competition with Salomon Brothers to advise the
Hungarian government on the privatization of a state phone company.
</P>
<P>
   He said that Holbrooke argued that although Credit Suisse First
Boston is owned by a Swiss banking group, it is largely managed and
staffed by Americans and was entitled to some assistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Holbrooke was a very hands-on assistant secretary, which was
good, and I think he was acting based on complaints that were made
to his office by C.S. First Boston, which is that they weren't
being treated in an even-handed way,'' Blinken said. ``I came to
see that there was a good case to be made for including them,
considering that they have a lot of American employees and are
obviously an important player in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he understood that Holbrooke's office had been lobbied
intensively by Credit Suisse First Boston for help in obtaining the
Hungarian contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were camping out at the State Department,'' Blinken said,
adding that Holbrooke's later employment by Credit Suisse was
``just one of those strange quirks of fate _ I think it's
coincidence really.''
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke has declined to be interviewed about the
investigation. But friends and advisers say that when he began
weighing job opportunities on Wall Street toward the end of 1995,
he never considered Credit Suisse as a potential employer.
</P>
<P>
   Beattie said that he had been assured by the Justice Department
on Thursday that it was not pursuing the assertions involving the
Hungarian government contract.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving the State Department, Holbrooke was appointed the
special unpaid State Department envoy to the Balkans, a post that
required him to meet repeatedly with foreign leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Beattie said that in the meetings, which are the subject of the
Justice Department inquiry, Holbrooke was always careful to focus
on either his work for the Clinton administration or on his work
for Credit Suisse _ but never the two together. ``He was always
very careful to avoid conflicts of interest,'' the lawyer said.

COLLINS: TEAM HAD WRONG IDEA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.1998 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND _ The Anaheim Angels arrived in Oakland early Thursday
morning with a Texas-sized hangover, a result of the Rangers'
three-game sweep that all but ended the Angels' hopes for their
first division title since 1986.
</P>
<P>
   It appeared the pressure got to the Angels, who were outscored
by a combined score of 25-3 in the three games. The Angels, though,
said throughout the series that they felt no pressure because no
one expected them to be there.
</P>
<P>
   But manager Terry Collins now says that was the wrong approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I plan on being in the same situation next September _ in a
pennant race,'' Collins said. ``One thing I learned from this is
don't hide from the pressure. Embrace it. You don't think there's
pressure? You're kidding yourself. You're playing in the big
leagues. There's a lot at stake. When there's pressure, you have to
raise your concentration level.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter how badly the Angels played in the series, they also
must give credit to the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They totally dominated us in every phase of the game,''
shortstop Gary DiSarcina said. ``They shook the total foundation of
everything we had built the entire year. That's the most
frustrating thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Though some players talked about the season in the past tense
even before Thursday's game, Collins said he would implore the team
not to quit.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing that's certainly going to be discussed between
myself and the players (Thursday) is that we're not dead yet,''
Collins said. ``Certainly the lights are pretty dim. But one thing
I don't want to do is have anyone think for one second we're not
still in it.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Nothing's easy: The trip to Oakland didn't get off to such a
good start. The team flew from Burbank to San Francisco, got off
the plane and waited for the bus to the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   The players watched as the bus drove onto the tarmac, then into
a stationary plane, the wing crashing through the windshield of the
bus. After the airport police came to investigate, then a quick-fix
using duct tape to cover the hole in the window, the Angels were on
their way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never a dull moment,'' Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Lineup switch: Collins said he would make some changes in the
lineup Thursday and he was true to his word. The most notable
change was moving DiSarcina up from No. 9 in the batting order to
No. 2. It was the first time DiSarcina has hit second since June 1,
1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty similar to hitting ninth,'' DiSarcina said.
``Hitting ninth you try to get guys over for the top of the order.
I hit second for three weeks in '95. I don't think it's a big deal.
I'm happy to hit anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Velarde absent: Second baseman Randy Velarde left the team to
be with a relative who is ill. Velarde was expected back late
Thursday night or today.

   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ USC's game with Florida State was on as of
Thursday evening, but Trojans athletic department officials were

Florida and toward the Gulf of Mexico, although it is also expected
to travel through the Florida panhandle and could hit Tallahassee,
which is in the northern part of the state.
</P>
<P>
   Florida State was scheduled to be begin issuing hurricane
updates this morning but had not mentioned any plans concerning the
football game.

CAN TROJANS COPE WITH FSU DEFENSE?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ It took three games, but John Fox finally
might have found a reason to be happy he's no longer playing
quarterback for USC. He only has to think back to last season's
game against Florida State. After just a couple series, Fox figured
out his options against the Seminoles' swift defense were severely
limited.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like, I wanted to take seven steps to drop back and
pass, but I'd get five and get killed,'' said Fox, who is now a
tight end. ``You either get the ball off and get killed or wait to
throw a bad ball and still get the heck beat out of you.''
</P>
<P>
   USC never solved Florida State's defense, as the Trojans netted
a paltry 184 yards offense against the Seminoles and 25 yards
rushing in their 14-7 loss last season.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the 18th-ranked Trojans can muster any more points
Saturday remains the key issue is this year's matchup with the
10th-ranked Seminoles.
</P>
<P>
   USC is 3-0, but the offense's inconsistency produces doubts
about how the Trojans will crack a defense that is probably faster
than any they will face this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were the fastest defense I've ever seen. Their defensive
tackles run like linebackers,'' offensive lineman Travis Claridge
said. ``They whipped our butts.''
</P>
<P>
   Free safety Rashard Cook remembers being on the sideline,
marveling at the Seminoles' ability to shut down plays that
initially seemed successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looked like on a play, somebody was open and then they
would only get two yards,'' Cook said. ``They were all over the
place. When they tackled you, you were down.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the dilemma facing the Trojans' offense, which other
than tailback Chad Morton (95 yards per game), has not really found
its identity. And it has not had to flourish on the road or against
a top-notch opponent.
</P>
<P>
   That all changes Saturday at Doak Campbell Stadium. Will this be
a repeat performance of last year? Although the players vividly
remember being outclassed by Florida State's defense, some changes
give them reason to expect better success.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first reasons is Morton, who is faster than anyone
Florida State saw in last season's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we open up a hole, Chad will see it,'' Claridge said.
``That didn't happen last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Tailback Delon Washington gained 16 yards in 18 carries in last
year's contest, and Fox passed for just 159 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember everything about them. They were so fast,'' wide
receiver Mike Bastianelli said. ``If there's an opening, they close
it in a split-second.''
</P>
<P>
   Another major change is quarterback Mike Van Raaphorst, who has
shown better poise than Fox. Perhaps more important, Van Raaphorst
won't be making his first career start as Fox did a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stuff's open, you just have to capitalize on it,'' Fox
said.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's new coach Paul Hackett, who is supposed to be
an offensive wizard. Right? Hackett has been trying to get passes
off quicker in practice, to avoid succumbing to Florida State's
stifling pass rush.
</P>
<P>
   ``Speed. Speed. Speed. They run by everybody,'' Hackett said.
``You need to slide around and make some plays. Pass protection in
combination with getting rid of it quickly. Or they're going to get
at you.''
</P>
<P>
   Easier said than done, especially when USC's offensive line has
been its weak link this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have to really wire in,'' Claridge said.
``Their defensive tackles are something. I don't think I've ever
faced a guy better than (defensive tackle) Jerry Johnson.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Johnson dominated the line of scrimmage with seven
tackles. Also back is linebacker Lamont Green, who racked up 10
tackles. But their importance underscores another reason the
Trojans might be more optimistic this time. The Seminoles return
just five starters on defense. Gone are defensive end Andre
Wadsworth and linebackers Sam Cowart and Daryl Bush.
</P>
<P>
   That's the good news, although USC players were hardly
encouraged after watching game films this week. And yes, they are
aware the Seminoles were upset by North Carolina State 24-7.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're faster than any team we'll face this season by far,''
Bastianelli said. ``They might not be quite as fast as last year,
but they're still Florida State, so they will be fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Another crucial factor is whether the Trojans are able to hold
on to the ball. Hackett was upset after the Oregon State game by
the number of dropped passes, and he wasn't just referring to usual
suspect R. Jay Soward.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very disturbed by the number of drops in a game. You
can't have four, five, six drops in a game,'' Hackett said. ``One
of our biggest disappointments last week was when the the turnovers
and field position came to our offense, our offense was not able to
score touchdowns. We had to kick field goals, and if you kick field
goals against this team, you probably will come out on the short
end.''

   MIAMI _ As the death toll from Hurricane Georges's rampage
through the Caribbean rose to nearly 200, the storm crossed Cuba
Thursday, turned northward and took aim at southern Florida, where
750,000 people were advised to evacuate mobile homes and low-lying
coastal areas.
</P>
<P>
   At least 125 of the deaths were reported in the Dominican
Republic, where workers recovered 76 bodies Thursday from a river
in San Juan de la Maguana, 120 miles west of the capital, Santo
Domingo. Earlier, at least 45 people in the town of San Cristobal
were killed when the walls of a school being used as a shelter
collapsed in flood waters.
</P>
<P>
   In the Dominican Republic and Haiti, which share the island of
Hispaniola, hundreds of people were missing and feared dead. Leonel
Fernandez, president of the Dominican Republic, said the storm had
left more than 100,000 people homeless and severely damaged sugar,
banana, rice and coffee crops that were nearly ready for harvest.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a national tragedy,'' Fernandez said in a
televised address to the country's 7.5 million people. ``We face a
titanic task.''
</P>
<P>
   As Hurricane Georges moved back over open water, its winds
reached 90 mph late Thursday night and they were expected to reach
105 mph on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The airport in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, was closed
because of damage to the control tower and terminals. It was
uncertain when it would reopen, but the earliest estimate for
restoration of jet traffic was Sunday, American Airlines said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 3.8 million residents of Puerto Rico were reported
still to be without electricity and water. The local telephone
company said 339,000 of its customers had no long-distance service,
making communication with relatives in the continental United
States difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Some shops and restaurants have reopened, using generators as
their power source, and the government said it hoped to restore
power to half the island by the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   In Cuba, officials reported two dead from the hurricane, both
electrocutions because of downed power lines. Civil Defense
officials warned residents to expect mudslides and coastal flooding
in the eastern part of the island up to Cayo Coco, a small island
popular with tourists north of Ciego de Avila in central Cuba, and
urged them to avoid the streets.
</P>
<P>
   About 370,000 people had been evacuated to safer areas in the
eastern provinces, but some had begun returning home Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Government television showed some rivers overrunning their banks
after seven hours of rain, cutting off some municipalities and
flooding nearby housing. Power was out in many areas.
</P>
<P>
   Early Thursday, the energy expended by Hurricane Georges in its
four-day rampage across Puerto Rico, Hispaniola and Cuba appeared
to have exhausted the storm. But as the hurricane moved back out
over the warm waters of the Caribbean, it gained force, and
meteorologists warned that it could strengthen to a Category 3
storm, with winds over 125 miles per hour, by the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   With the storm gaining speed and strength as it moved toward the
Florida Straits, forecasters predicted that the eye would strike
the Florida Keys early Friday. From Miami to Tampa, millions of
residents rushed to complete their storm preparations in
anticipation of that landfall and the flooding and destruction that
are expected to accompany it.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1992, we weren't as ready for Hurricane Andrew as we should
have been, and I vowed not to let that happen again,'' said Lisa de
Grandy as she loaded plywood into a van outside a home-supply store
here this morning. ``It's tense in there, like a scavenger hunt,
and this is not something I really want to be doing again, but we
want to suffer as little damage as possible this time.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The course Hurricane Georges is thought most likely to follow in
the coming days would take it directly over the lower Keys early
Friday and on into the Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of both Miami and Fort Lauderdale awoke Thursday to
find that a hurricane warning had been issued for their
communities. By late Thursday, warnings were posted for 5 million
people in eight counties _ Monroe, Miami-Dade, Broward, Collier,
Lee, Charlotte, Sarasota and Manatee.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may become a major hurricane, and we need to be ready for
that,'' Jerry Jarrell, director of the National Hurricane Center
here, cautioned Thursday, after radar images indicated the eye of
the storm was reorganizing. ``People really need to count on it
being bad.''
</P>
<P>
   As Hurricane Georges was regrouping, Alex Penelas, the mayor of
Miami-Dade County, which has 2 million residents, issued a decree
for the evacuation of Miami Beach, Key Biscayne and other
communities on barrier islands facing the Atlantic. But the
directive was strictly voluntary, and many residents, especially
young people and those who did not experience Hurricane Andrew,
said they had no intention of complying.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been in a hurricane before, but I'm not
panicking,'' said Carolina Aguirre, a 32-year-old teacher and Miami
Beach resident. ``It's more dangerous to leave than to stay, so I
will stay.''
</P>
<P>
   Residents of mobile homes and trailer parks, many of whom
experienced the full force of Hurricane Andrew and its 150 mph
winds, seemed to be treating a mandatory evacuation order for them
more seriously.
</P>
<P>
   At Fowler's trailer park in southern Miami-Dade County, Xiomara
Lopez, 44, and her family of five were loading an air-conditioner
and clothes into a truck and preparing to leave for a relative's
house.
</P>
<P>
   ``This trailer survived Andrew, but we're not taking any
chances,'' said her daughter, Ayza Corujo, 23. ``We're lucky,
because a lot of the people here are poor and don't have anyplace
to go. We're just praying that our home is still here when we come
back, because we don't have any insurance.''
</P>
<P>
   The evacuation directive also applied to Homestead and Florida
City, both of which were leveled by Hurricane Andrew.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are extremely concerned because of the extensive flooding
we believe will be associated with this hurricane,'' Penelas said
Thursday afternoon in explaining the measure and announcing the
opening of public shelters across the county.
</P>
<P>
   James Witt, director of the federal Emergency Management Agency,
said: ``It is the storm surge coming behind the Keys that will have
a lot of the force. We're worried about flooding and crop damage.''
</P>
<P>
   Key West, through which the eye of the storm is expected to
pass, was reported Thursday to be virtually a ghost town, with
tourists having fled and hotels, bars and boutiques along normally
bustling Duval Street closed. The airport was closed this morning,
and a 9 p.m. curfew was ordered for the city and all the rest of
Monroe County.
</P>
<P>
   At Cape Canaveral, the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration initially ordered the space shuttle Discovery rolled
back to its hangar, three and a half miles from the Atlantic, but
decided Thursday evening to keep it on its seaside launching pad.
The shuttle had been moved to the pad on Monday for next month's
flight with Sen. John Glenn.
</P>
<P>
   Hotels in nearby Orlando were filling rapidly with residents
fleeing threatened areas further south, and MacDill Air Force Base
in Tampa was ordered evacuated.

SMITH, WILDCATS RACE PAST AZTECS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Summer turned to autumn in the time it took Arizona
to stay unbeaten.
</P>
<P>
   And unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a season changes into a challenge that is sure to change
the Wildcats, too.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats said so long to a sweet September and awaited an
uncertain October with a 35-16 victory Thursday night over San
Diego State.
</P>
<P>
   The win, itself, was predictable. But unpredictable was what it
said about the rest, the real, part of Arizona's season.
</P>
<P>
   It's either an Octoberfest, or the unmasking of a team
masquerading as a rising contender in the national polls. The party
starts on Oct. 3 at Washington. By then, Hawaii, Stanford, Iowa and
San Diego State will look a lot like stops on a rendition of what
the Wildcats did on their summer vacation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to start playing some of the best teams in the
country,''said Arizona coach Dick Tomey, whose Wildcats follow the
Washington date against Pacific-10 Conference favorite UCLA.
``We'll see if we belong.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, most of the numbers seem to say yes. The Wildcats are
4-0. They are No. 16 in both the Associated Press and USA
Today/ESPN polls.
</P>
<P>
   Their 19-point victory over San Diego State on ESPN's national
telecast could land them enough votes for a boost up the ratings
ladder to somewhere between tenth and 15th.
</P>
<P>
   But there are reasons for caution. So far, Arizona has compiled
its unbeaten record against teams with a cumulative mark of 2-9.
</P>
<P>
   Of those, San Diego State might rank as the worst. The Aztecs
are 0-3 without many apparent prospects at a winning season, much
less a victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arizona is a very talented team,'' said San Diego State coach
Ted Tollner, who saw a few during his days as the head coach at
Southern California.``They just jumped all over us.''
</P>
<P>
   After giving up a field goal to San Diego State in the opening
minutes,the Wildcats struck hard and fast with their wide array of
talent.
</P>
<P>
   In the first quarter, the Wildcat blitz accounted for two
touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Strike one: Dennis Northcutt jumped out from behind a jarring
block by Chris McAlister and raced 51 yards on a punt return. On
the next play, quarterback Keith Smith hooked up with Jeremy
McDaniel for a 19-yard TD pass.
</P>
<P>
   Strike two: Linebacker Scotter Sprotte got the first of his two
interceptions, this one at the Aztec 39. Five plays later, Smith
rolls right and races 20 yards into the end zone with Aztec
defenders chasing after him as though he were a runaway
rollerblader.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats, playing their second game within a week, _ got it
all done within a handful of plays. Total elapsed time for both
scoring drives: 62 seconds, 14 for the first and 48 for the second.
</P>
<P>
   Anybody got a stop watch?
</P>
<P>
   By then, it was abundantly clear that the Aztecs were just
interactive spectators among the gathering of 23,811 at the
strangely named Qualcomm Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats put another seven points on the stadium's computer
board when senior running back Jim Wendler scored for the first
time in his career on a five-yard run.
</P>
<P>
   Wendler's debut in the end zone was set up by a 40-yard pass to
Kelvin Eafon from Ortege Jenkins, who came on in relief of Smith in
the second quarter of Arizona's eighth straight victory of a streak
that dates back to last season.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins ran right and threw left, across his body and the field,
to a wide-open Eafon. The play was a thing of beauty.
</P>
<P>
   It defined Arizona's dynamic potential. Tomey has an aerial
circus at his disposal. But this circus is like a lot of them.
Arizona's high-wire act does not include a net. The Wildcats are
often plagued by inconsistency and mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   The offense lost its sharp edge in the second half, despite a
10-yard TD strike from Jenkins to McDaniel in the third quarter.
That, in part, was rooted in an abridged playbook that was scaled
down at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   ``By then, we didn't want to show everything we had,'' said
Smith, who didn't mention Washington and didn't have to.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcat defense also let the Aztecs score two TDs after
halftime: one on a five yard pass from Brian Russell to Jim Ange
and the second on a 3-yard run by Larry Ned, who rushed for 144
yards.
</P>
<P>
   The first Aztec TD hurt. Frustration was evident in the face of
secondary coach Duane Akina.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was angry,'' said Akina, a former Washington quarterback who
will undoubtedly use some of that anger in preparations next week
for Arizona's first test. &QL;

GREEN'S ARDUOUS TREK LANDS HIM WITH DEVILS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB COHN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - That's one small step for a football player,
another giant leap for Gerald Green.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've come a long way,'' Green said, not referring solely to
his climb up the Arizona State depth chart to No. 2 tailback.
</P>
<P>
   Making second team normally is little cause to stop and take
note, but Green is not a normal person, nor athlete. Which is why
backing up J.R. Redmond this week looms as large as, say, someone
bigger and stronger with a more conventional background making
All-American.
</P>
<P>
   By now, Green's story has been well-chronicled _ how he
surmounted a horrific childhood and a learning disability; how,
with his mother in prison, he lived five years in a Mesa home for
neglected and abused kids; how he attended two high schools and two
junior colleges and went mostly unrecruited beyond that; how his
old junior high coach and special education teacher got married and
became his guardians even though he is Black and they are White;
how he walked on at ASU this summer and forced a scholarship when
everyone realized this 5-foot-8, 190-pound bundle of sunshine and
energy could play.
</P>
<P>
   A junior, Green began fall camp as essentially fourth-string
behind Redmond, redshirt freshman Davaren Hightower and Marlon
Farlow, who was battling academic problems but whose status was
still up for grabs. Farlow never made it back, and Hightower, who
missed all of last season because of a broken leg, suffered a knee
sprain last week against North Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Redmond missed Tuesday's practice to attend a funeral, meaning
Green was the ``No''.``'' ``1'' tailback for a day. But Redmond,
who has a sprained toe, will carry most of the load Saturday at Sun
Devil Stadium against Oregon State. Green, who is not listed in the
team media guide, stands ready if needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's done everything we've asked him to do,'' running backs
Coach Cornell Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said he knew nothing about Green's history or
attention-deficit disorder until he read about it. To Jackson,
Green was simply a friendly, upbeat kid who worked ceaselessly in
the weight room, watched a lot of tape, quickly picked up the
complicated blocking schemes (playing at pass-oriented Mesa
Community College last season helped) and ran hard despite his
purported lack of size.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I knew,'' said Jackson, ``was that here was a guy
determined to be a football player at Arizona State.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wouldn't put him out there if he didn't have the ability.
He's got the ability to carry the football, to block if the
linebacker comes. He's got good vision and quick feet. Good hands.
We're glad to have him.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson sometimes teases Green, reminding him that he worked his
way up ``by default.'' But Jackson knows that really isn't true,
that even though the problems of others have created the
opportunity, Green still had to seize it.
</P>
<P>
   Green knows that, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I could make it,'' he said. ``And here I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Green made his ASU debut last week, playing mostly in a mop-up
role against North Texas and rushing nine times for 35 yards. After
getting up from the pile left by his first carry, he looked around
at the gold-shirted home crowd and thought, ``I'm a Sun Devil. This
isn't a dream. It's real.''
</P>
<P>
   If Green knows anything, it's what's real. And the reality is,
Redmond is the man. But Green wouldn't mind getting a little
quality time in relief. He figures his size is an asset, given that
teammates on defense have complained about locating him among the
mass of large bodies.
</P>
<P>
   But Green doesn't need to hide behind anyone. He has good speed
and loves contact. He enjoys blocking, especially when he gets to
``truck'' someone.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say the smallest guys pack the biggest punches,'' he
said. ``If you're willing to stick your head in there, you can do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Anything that happens on the football field is a joy compared
with what Green had to endure most of his life, to ``all that
commotion,'' as he calls it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever you want,'' he said, ``you have to go through a lot
to get it.'' &QL; 
Note &QL; 
Starting tight end  &UR; Kendrick Bates remains questionable for the
Oregon State game with a shoulder injury suffered in practice. Look
for  &UR; Matt &UR; Cercone and first-year freshman  &UR; Todd Heap to get play
more. &QL;

ART OF THE PEP TALK

By VINCENT BONSIGNORE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In the middle of a dreary, winless football
season, a desperate coach tried to inspire his players before a
game a few years ago. Nothing seemed to work with this group.
Screaming fell on deaf ears. Encouragement was useless. This time
he used an example.
</P>
<P>
   The coach told the team about Larry Csonka, a hard-running
fullback who played for the Miami Dolphins in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Larry Csonka was just a tough SOB,'' the coach started off.
``He didn't care about stats. He didn't care about getting hurt. He
didn't care about himself. All Larry Csonka cared about was
winning. And that's how he played, to win.''
</P>
<P>
   For 10 minutes the coach talked about his hero, Larry Csonka:
Larry Csonka did this. Larry Csonka did that. Maybe if
!ital!we!off! played more like Larry Csonka, we'd win a ballgame.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's all I have to say,'' the coach said, wrapping things
up. ``We have to play more like Larry Csonka.''
</P>
<P>
   With that, the coach left the locker room. The room fell quiet.
Nobody spoke as the players pondered what the coach said.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, after a few silent minutes passed, a big lineman
sitting in the corner said: ``Man, f--- Larry Csonka.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardly inspired, the team went out and got crushed.
</P>
<P>
   The art of inspiration
</P>
<P>
   Pep talks are as much a part of football as tackling. At the
right moment, when delivered by the right coach, a well-crafted
speech can motivate a team to play beyond its ability. Others, like
the one about Larry Csonka, couldn't rouse a dog from its sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Some pep talks challenge players, others calm them. The
objective is to provoke teams to a proper level of intensity,
although the tricky part is not pushing players past that point.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then they're liable to go out there and do stupid stuff,''
Newbury Park coach George Hurley said. ``You need to know how to
get them fired up but also when to rein them in.''
</P>
<P>
   Some coaches find that the fire-and-brimstone, ``It's us against
them'' speeches work best, but a case can also be made for control
and confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to remind them about who they are, what their
responsibilities are and what's at stake,'' Sylmar coach Jeff
Engilman said. ``They have pride, they know that they're playing
for themselves and the guys that have been here in the past and
built this program up.''
</P>
<P>
   Choosing your words carefully
</P>
<P>
   There are two talks a coach gives his team. One before the game,
the other at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, just a few prudent words can do the trick before
a game. A wise coach understands that his players have built up
enough emotion through the course of the week. By game time, a
simple reminder of what lies ahead is more effective then a
contrived, chest-thumping sermon.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you aren't pumped up by the time of the game, then
definitely some yelling and screaming is needed,'' Agoura wide
receiver Garrett Lepisto said. ``But most of the time, we're ready
to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, a coach can make the difference.
</P>
<P>
   That happened in the early 1960s when Glendale hosted Crescenta
Valley in the Falcons' first varsity game. Crescenta Valley was the
new school in town, and a number of Falcons players attended
Glendale before moving on to Crescenta Valley.
</P>
<P>
   In those days, Glendale was coached by the legendary Roy
Vujovich, an imposing figure who spoke with a booming voice.
Vujovich made his players sit in a dark room before games to
visualize making big plays and key tackles. After a half-hour,
Vujovich would speak.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Crescenta Valley game, Vujovich stood in the doorway
as he spoke to the Dynamiters. The Glendale players barely made out
his silhouette as he talked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Men,'' Vujovich said, his voice deep and steady. ``Two years
ago we gave those guys over there some helmets and shoulder pads
and wished them good luck with their program. Tonight, they're
back.''
</P>
<P>
   That was all Vujovich needed to say. The Dynamiters ran out of
the room ready to beat the Green Bay Packers. Crescenta Valley
never had a chance.
</P>
<P>
   Not that a well-planned speech doesn't work also.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago Newbury Park was playing a team many considered
superior to the Panthers. George Hurley finished his own pregame
talk and then turned things over to assistant Jack Willard.
Willard, now the coach at Channel Islands, was wearing a
button-downed dress shirt and tie as he spoke. He started his
speech under control, but that didn't last long.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next thing you know he climbs on top of a table,'' Hurley
remembered. ``Then he rips open his shirt, buttons are flying
everywhere, and he's wearing a blue shirt underneath with a big red
S on it. He starts screaming `If we play like f------ Superman we
can win this f------ game. Now let's go out there and get after
it!!!'''
</P>
<P>
   Hurley doesn't remember who won the game, but he knows this
much: The Panthers were ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``Heck, I was ready to run out of that room and play,'' Hurley
said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the more colorful stuff takes place at halftime when
games are hanging in the balance and emotions are high. That's when
coaches challenge players, appealing to their pride and toughness.
But it can also get dicey. Coaches have been known to turn over
tables, punch lockers and attack chalk boards, all in the pursuit
of motivation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year one of our coaches, and it wasn't me, hit a table
full of water cups and the water went all over a poor kid sitting
nearby,'' said Canyon coach Larry Mohr. ``You've got to be careful.
You may end up punching something and coming to practice Monday
wearing as cast.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there is also the zany, when a coach simply losses
it. Such was the case a few years ago when the coach of a winless
team went off on his players at halftime of the last game of the
year. He was tired and disgusted and let his players know it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what's sad?'' the coach asked. ``It's sad that the
only thing that motivates you guys is fear. The fear of me kicking
your f------ a-- at practice on f------ Monday after you've played
like s--- on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``But guess what? There are no more f------ Mondays, so I can't
kick your f------ a-- anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who were there remember that players chuckled to
themselves during the rampage, which was delivered in a calm,
almost scary voice. When the coach left the room, the players burst
out laughing.
</P>
<P>
   Be yourself
</P>
<P>
   For coaches, the key to pep talks is, as coaches are fond of
saying, staying within themselves. Some have the ability to weave
an inspiring speech, then deliver it smoothly and effectively.
Others trip over themselves when they say anything more then ``Go
get them, boys.''
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing worse then listening to a tongue-tied coach
spin a shaky speech. And the minute players sense a phony, they'll
tune him out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some coaches will sit there and b.s. you and say all kinds of
stuff,'' said Westlake wide receiver Travis Campbell. ``When all
they need to do is tell the truth. Our coaches just say, `It's
gametime, guys. Either put up or shut up.''

MANNING'S PROGRESS SURPRISING  
 SUNS FORWARD AIMS TO PLAY BY DECEMBER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - When the NBA owners and players finally settle their
differences and decide to play basketball again, the Suns may have
a pleasant surprise awaiting them.
</P>
<P>
   Forward Danny Manning, who underwent the third reconstructive
knee surgery of his career in April and was thought to be out for
most of next season, may be ready to play as early as December.
</P>
<P>
   It would be a huge boost for the Suns.
</P>
<P>
   Manning won the NBA's Sixth Man of the Year award last season,
despite missing the last six regular season games because of the
knee injury. He averaged 13.5 points and 5.6 rebounds a game while
shooting 51.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Manning is one of only three players currently under contract
with the club, along with Jason Kidd and Mark Bryant. Knowing that
Manning will be available for most of the season will make it a lot
easier for the Suns to determine which free agents they want to go
after when the lockout ends.
</P>
<P>
   Manning needed almost a year to come back from each of his two
previous surgeries, but he's cautiously optimistic about a much
quicker return this time.
</P>
<P>
   The difference is the type of surgery. Instead of having a third
of his patella tendon removed and used to replace his anterior
cruciate ligament, the ligament of a cadaver was implanted.
</P>
<P>
   Because Manning's patella tendons had been used in the two
previous procedures _ the first on his right knee during his rookie
season of 1988-89 and the second on his left knee in February 1995
_ the patella transplant wasn't an option this time.
</P>
<P>
   The risk of using a cadaver's tissue is that a person might
reject the ligament, and thorough testing has to be done to make
sure there is a match and that there is no chance of contracting a
disease from the donor.
</P>
<P>
   Manning said if his body was going to reject the ligament, it
already would have happened.
</P>
<P>
   The big advantage of the procedure is that it allows ``a more
aggressive'' rehabilitation process, according to Manning, his
personal trainer, Karl Horne, and Dr. Richard Emerson, the club's
orthopedic surgeon who teamed with Dr. Stephen Lomardo of the
Kerlan-Jobe Clinic in Los Angeles on the surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had known then what I know now, and if they had the same
thorough testing available, I would have done it this way the first
two times,'' Manning said. ``It is a quicker process, but a lot of
it still depends on the person and what they're going to do, how
hard they're going to work at the rehab. I've been through this
three times now. I pretty much know what has to be done. I just
have to get my work done every day.''
</P>
<P>
   While it seems that Manning is far ahead of schedule, this is
apparently what the Suns and Manning hoped for when the cadaver
option was considered.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's doing very well,'' said Emerson, who is allowed to work
with Manning despite the lockout. ``I'd say his rehabilitation is
progressing very well. If everything keeps going as well as it has
been, we would anticipate that he would be activated, possibly by
the end of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   Horne said that's the target Manning has been shooting for, and
Manning has responded to the more aggressive approach. But Manning
has enough experience in the process to be patient.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could go out tomorrow and aggravate it,'' Manning said.
``Right now, it's going very well. But there's a fine line there
between doing too much and not doing enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``First, it has to get strong enough to take the pounding from
running. Then you have to start doing the basketball things, like
cutting and jumping. But as much as you work out, there is no way
to simulate NBA-level competition and the demands of practicing and
playing every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Manning could have retired and avoided all the
rehabilitation work. He never seriously considered it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know why I'm doing this,'' he said. ``I'm doing it because I
want to, because I still believe I can play.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And,'' Manning added with a smile, ``even if I'm not quite as
quick as I was before, I'm still 6-10.'' &QL;

<P>
   EL PASO _ The Diamondbacks continued their quest to become
``Mexico's favorite major league operation'' by announcing Thursday
that the Texas border town of El Paso will become the franchise's
first Double-A affiliate.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks signed a four-year working agreement with the
Texas League team, and held dual news conferences in El Paso and
across the border in neighboring Juarez, Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are so close to Mexico in Phoenix, in our Triple-A team in
Tucson and now in El Paso, we would like to become Mexico's
favorite major league operation,'' Senior Executive Vice President
Roland Hemond said. ``We have a working agreement with Monterrey,
and we work closely with Hermosillo in the Mexican Pacific League
in winter ball.''
</P>
<P>
   When its 18-year relationship with the Milwaukee Brewers ended,
six major league teams, including the Diamondbacks, expressed
interest in El Paso, which is about six hours southeast of Phoenix
along I-10.
</P>
<P>
   El Paso is the westernmost Double-A franchise, and Arizona
competed with Anaheim, Colorado, Seattle and Oakland for the right
to call the city home. But El Paso, looking to expand its own
horizons, saw Arizona as an opportunity to cash in on the market
across the Rio Grande.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only is it geographically desirable for us,'' Diablos
President Rick Parr said, ``but we want to build a friendly
relationship with our fans across the border. Once you're a friend,
you're family for life. The Diamondbacks have already started that
relationship, and we're going to ride those coattails.''
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks have moved to spark interest among Mexican fans
with a Triple-A team in Monterrey of the Mexican League and by
arranging travel packages from Mexican cities such as Nogales.
</P>
<P>
   The addition of El Paso in its minor league ranks gives Arizona
yet another bridge to the Mexican market. Without professional
baseball for nine years, since the Mexican League's Juarez Indios
folded, Juarez is starving for the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks hope to draw the attention of the Hispanic
market by staging player appearances, exhibition games and more in
El Paso and Juarez.
</P>
<P>
   El Paso, known as the Diablos for 25 years, will not change its
team name, but a new logo was revealed Thursday incorporating the
Diamondbacks' recognizable ``A'' in the word ``Diablos.''
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks also announced Thursday that Manager Don
Wakamatsu, pitching coach Dennis Lewallyn and hitting coach Ty Van
Burkleo will move from High Desert to El Paso for the 1999 season.
Wakamatsu was the California League's Manager of the Year after
leading High Desert to an 82-58 mark and a second-half title. &QL;

SEARCHING FOR SENSE OF HUMOR MIGHT BE DIFFICULT IN NEBRASKA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Having seen the movie ``Fargo,'' I have some anxiety
about the Midwest passion for woodchipper justice.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, I will sojourn to the heartland this morning,
laptop holstered, eyes squinted for trouble, ready to meet the Big
Dread . . . er, Red.
</P>
<P>
   Ostensibly, my purpose in going to Lincoln, Neb., is to write
about Saturday's Washington-Nebraska college football game. My real
goal was larger _ to find the continental drain.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, before the Husker-Husky game in Seattle, I wrote
that there was not much to recommend Nebraska and its team, other
than as an ideal site to draw down any oversupply of national
liquids. Which was just one of several sensitive and helpful
thoughts I offered that day.
</P>
<P>
   The local paper, the Lincoln Journal Star (Motto: ``Nebraska
Football, and the Rest of the World on Page B-20''), ran the
column, which provoked a wounded wail among the citizenry the likes
of which I have never heard in my time as a paid keyboard slapper.
</P>
<P>
   Among the hundreds of letters, faxes, e-mails and packages from
grumpy Nebraskans (state motto: ``Boy, do we have a lot of free
time'') was a notable scold from Gov. Ben Nelson, who took a moment
from a press conference to upbraid the scoundrel from Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   When I responded that it was surprising the gubernatorial
bloomers were bunched as tightly as the rest of Nebraska's
citizens, the governor, with a politician's sixth sense about bad
PR, reversed course.
</P>
<P>
   He invited me to be his guest for the Washington-Nebraska
rematch. Get to know us, he said in a letter. He even promised to
supply the overalls.
</P>
<P>
   Having never been to Nebraska _ really, who has? _ the
temptation was strong. I wanted to find out if these people have so
much chaw in their cheeks they don't know there is room for tongues
in there too.
</P>
<P>
   So I accepted.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the bad news.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a scoop for you,'' Diane Gonzolas, the governor's
public affairs director, said by phone earlier this week. ``We sold
the continental drain rights to Oklahoma.''
</P>
<P>
   Argh. What a loss, for my column and Nebraska. I'll find
something else to write about, but now the state really must be
down to one thing, and one thing only _ Husker football.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as Washington coach Jim Lambright put it succinctly in his
Monday press conference, ``The program runs the state.''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks, Lambo _ I needed a buddy in the dungeon with me (not
that dungeons and Nebraska can be easily distinguished . . . ah,
jeez, there I go again).
</P>
<P>
   Really, I'm going to make my best effort to be open-minded. The
governor's office sent me piles of wonderful visitor information
about Nebraska, and I've read all of it. Did you know that tourism
is Nebraska's third-largest industry? (No. 1, of course, is
offensive linemen with size-22 necks, and No. 2 is red textiles.)
</P>
<P>
   Details about the tourism industry were scant, so I don't know
if they were counting the cross-country drivers who stop for gas.
It's a long state, so a dried-out burrito under a mini-mart heat
lamp is almost a mandatory tourist purchase.
</P>
<P>
   But is there tourism other than for Big Red football? Not if you
judge by the other great piece of literature from Nebraska _ the
university's football media guide (price, $13; weight, 3.1 pounds;
words, 6.2 million, give or take a hosannah in front of the name
Tom Osborne).
</P>
<P>
   The creation of this work must occupy the rest of the state not
engaged in the top three industries. The detail is breathtaking.
Did you know that this year's team lost 435 pounds of fat, gained
145 pounds of muscle and improved 161 inches in the vertical jump?
</P>
<P>
   As an investigator of the obscure and pointless, Ken Starr, you
are a dilettante compared to these people.
</P>
<P>
   At least in regard to the notion that too much is never enough,
perhaps Nebraskans are little different from other Americans, who
are scrupulously loyal to the cultural mandate that I believe is
somewhere in the Constitution: nothing succeeds like excess.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing unusual about Nebraskans is that when the fact is
pointed out to them, they forget to laugh.
</P>
<P>
   So in the absence of a continental drain, I will search instead
for a sense of humor. I've been promised a tour of the Capitol, a
visit to the annual meeting of the state's political, business and
community leaders, and a tailgate lunch Saturday at the governor's
residence.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere in these red-festooned throngs must be someone who
isn't dead-serious about Nebraska and its football team, someone
who doesn't have a welcome mat at the foot of the woodchipper.

PADRES' FUTURE UNCERTAIN  
 WEST CHAMPS ARE DEPENDENT ON FREE AGENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The San Diego Padres will part ways with the Diamondbacks on
Sunday, headed to a far better place _ the exciting and
nerve-racking world of the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   Underscoring how difficult it is to advance, San Diego has
qualified for the playoffs for only the third time in its 30-year
history. Even though this is the second time in three years that
the Padres have reached this level, their future appears tenuous.
</P>
<P>
   Four key members of the team are potential free agents. All-Star
pitcher Kevin Brown, who could have been a Cy Young Award candidate
with any kind of run support, heads the list.
</P>
<P>
   Third baseman and former Most Valuable Player Ken Caminiti,
center fielder Steve Finley and first baseman Wally Joyner also
will be free agents after this season.
</P>
<P>
   What was perceived as a dogfight for the division title quickly
turned into a runaway this summer, with San Diego grabbing an early
lead and pulling away, which had to come as a surprise to General
Manager Kevin Towers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's got a feeling that we've got our work cut out for
us,'' Towers said during spring training. ``Three or four clubs (in
the NL West) could be close to 90 wins. I really think this is a
division that's going to be played out in September. Nobody's going
to run away with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, the Padres did run away. Now the attention turns to the
postseason and what San Diego will do in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
   The team's core could be missing next year, and the Padres can't
expect some of the other potential monsters in the National League
West to keep making blunders.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the big-money franchises in Los Angeles and
Colorado are sleeping giants that could awaken at any moment,
especially the Dodgers, who just hired the highly respected Kevin
Malone as their general manager.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco has a new ballpark on the way, a fact that could
easily translate into streams of revenue flowing into the Giants'
budget. And if the Diamondbacks' inaugural season is a fair
barometer, then they will shoot into the elite when it comes to the
ability to spend.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves San Diego, which is anxiously awaiting the results
of a November referendum for a new downtown park. The Padres' front
office has made not-so-subtle remarks concerning the club's future
in San Diego if voters fail to support the measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state of the Padres is, I guess the fairest way to put it
is, uncertain,'' club President Larry Lucchino said earlier this
season. ``We are proud of what we are doing and trying to do. And
this is an important time for the franchise, as it is for the city
and the whole county.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are determined to make baseball solid, stable, competitive
and anchored in San Diego for a long time to come, if humanly
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Which all points to what an important postseason this will be
for the Padres, who enter this weekend having won just nine of
their past 24 games. Another sweep in the first round of the
playoffs, like the one St. Louis handed San Diego two years ago,
could be devastating.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres will do everything they can to keep Brown in the
coming years, but the reality is that they may not be able to
compete with some of the offers Brown is expected to receive,
specifically anything in the $50 million to $70 million range.
</P>
<P>
   Brown has been everything San Diego expected, posting an 18-7
record with a 2.36 ERA, the tiniest in the NL. Padres pitching
coach Dave Stewart has said Brown has pitched well enough to have
won at least 24 games.
</P>
<P>
   Over a recent 10-game stretch, the Padres averaged 1.4 runs when
Brown pitched. He pitched nine scoreless innings in his last start
but got no decision when San Diego lost, 1-0, in 11 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will take Kevin Brown head to head with Randy Johnson in any
game,'' Towers told the ``San Diego Union-Tribune.'' ``On
AstroTurf, cement, asphalt, grass, you name it. I'll take my
chances with Kevin Brown anywhere, I don't care where it's at.''
</P>
<P>
   Towers may very well get his wish. Houston and San Diego are
potential first-round playoff partners. &QL;

NFL IS DOUBLING AS SENIOR QB TOUR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL MULLER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Though I somehow missed the press release, the NFL apparently
decided to honor the past Sunday with its first unofficial
old-timers day.
</P>
<P>
   Playing for the Jets,  &UR; Vinny Testaverde used his long years of
experience to toss four touchdown passes against the Colts.
 &UR; Randall
 &UR; Cunningham (still scrambling, slowly) helped the Vikings beat the
Lions with five (yawn) field goals, and Denver dusted off  &UR; Bubby
 &UR; Brister's old bones to euthanize the Raiders.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere,  &UR; Joe Theismann is warming up.
</P>
<P>
   I think more than one fan thought  &UR; Boomer Esiason could have
sprinted straight from the ``Monday Night Football'' booth and done
a better job than  &UR; Danny Kanell against the Cowboys. I'm sure
Boomer did.
</P>
<P>
   I mean, is Kanell from the Planet Earth? He has at least heard
of
 &UR; Deion Sanders, right?
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, all these old fogies are fighting their way into
the lineup because NFL quarterbacks have the life expectancy of a
Mediterranean fruit fly these days.
</P>
<P>
   For fantasy owners, it's time to take stock of the quarterback
position. If you drafted  &UR; Brett Favre,  &UR; Steve Young,  &UR; Mark Brunell
or
 &UR; Drew Bledsoe, you're grinning a big grin about now.
</P>
<P>
   We are not amused.
</P>
<P>
   Well, I guess things could be worse.  &UR; Dave Brown could be
starting somewhere. Still, as disasters go, it's right up there
with ``Black'' ``Sunday''.
</P>
<P>
   In Baltimore,  &UR; Jim Harbaugh is essentially a large welt, meaning
always-the-bridesmaid  &UR; Eric Zeier is the answer. The question: How
will the Ravens lose 10 games this year?
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde's solid performance against the Colts makes the Jets
quarterback situation a mess for fantasy owners. Amazingly, Coach
 &UR; Bill
 &UR; Parcells is more worried about winning games that having one
quarterback with good statistics. Parcells reportedly has invested
in a giant cane that he'll use to yank  &UR; Glenn Foley at the first
sign of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile,  &UR; Charlie Batch (Charlie Batch?) is starting for the
Lions, but for how long is anyone's guess. He did an incredible
 &UR; Scott
 &UR; Mitchell impression Sunday (40 attempts, 20 completions, two picks
and no touchdowns), much to the chagrin of  &UR; Bobby Ross.
</P>
<P>
   The young guys haven't done much better. Chargers quarterback
 &UR; Ryan
 &UR; Leaf is scanning the schedule for Oregon State, and Indianapolis
quarterback  &UR; Peyton Manning has finally realized the significance
of wearing a horseshoe on your head.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, you're going to get stepped on.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a glimmer of hope. A few quarterbacks who probably
went undrafted in your league are putting up decent numbers.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington,  &UR; Trent Green looks like he'll hold on to the
starter's job for a while. Cunningham should produce solid numbers
while  &UR; Brad
 &UR; Johnson is on the mend. And  &UR; Tony Banks always has the potential
for a big day in St. Louis, though  &UR; Isaac Bruce has been plagued by
a bad hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, in Dallas, there's  &UR; Jason Garrett, whose SAT
scores were waaaay higher than yours. &QL; 
Tip of the week &QL; 
Denver is riding high and headed for a letdown Sunday in
Washington. Green,  &UR; Terry Allen and  &UR; Michael Westbrook might just
be worth starting. Cincinnati quarterback  &UR; Neil O'Donnell should
have a bounce-back game against Baltimore. &QL; 
Waiver wire &QL; 
The running back situation is a mess. In Baltimore,  &UR; Jay Graham
and &UR; Errict Rhett have been benched in favor of obscure backup
 &UR; Priest
 &UR; Holmes. In Dallas,  &UR; Sherman Williams or  &UR; Chris Warren will start if
 &UR; Emmitt Smith can't go. In St. Louis,  &UR; Greg Hill's broken leg means
more time for  &UR; Robert Holcombe. In Jacksonville,  &UR; James Stewart is
done for the year, meaning  &UR; Fred Taylor will start. &QL; 
One-hit wonder &QL; 
This week, it's Jets running back  &UR; Leon Johnson, who scored three
touchdowns against the Colts. He shall be Leon, and he shall be a
flash in the pan. &QL; 
Bill Muller's Fantasy Football notebook appears every Friday. He

SANDERS, BRUCE REUNITE SUNDAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, ARIZ. -  &UR; Frank Sanders used to be the best blocking tight
end at Fort Lauderdale Dillard High School.
</P>
<P>
   The 1989 Florida Class 5A state champions didn't need to throw
him the ball. They had two 1,000-yard rushers and a wide receiver
who would end up being one of the best in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine the high school secondary trying to cover Sanders and
 &UR; Isaac
 &UR; Bruce, the St. Louis Rams wide receiver who leads the NFL in
receiving yards with 323 and is second in catches with 21.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders and Bruce will be together again Sunday when the
Cardinals play the Rams at the Trans World Dome in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was smooth,'' Sanders said of Bruce. ``Now, he has become
more explosive. When I watch him (on film), I say, `This is Isaac?'
''
</P>
<P>
   Fort Lauderdale Dillard lost only one game in 1989 when Sanders
was a junior and Bruce was a senior.

   ``Nobody stopped us,'' said Sanders, who began his high-school
career as a left-handed quarterback. ``We had 90 players, and the
starters were out by halftime.''
</P>
<P>
   After Bruce graduated, Sanders was moved to wide receiver. He
caught 33 passes for 704 yards and 10 touchdowns for another team
that lost only one game. &QL; 
Nervous times
</P>
<P>
   Sanders and offensive tackle  &UR; Lomas Brown, a native of Miami,
Fla., have been concerned about Hurricane Georges, which is headed
for the Florida Keys.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother and father have been here and were going to go back
to Miami Friday,'' Brown said. ``Now, they will wait through the
weekend to see what happens. But they forgot to (put) boards up or
storm shutters, and there's no one there who can help them. I
understand what they're going through. I lost a home there to
(Hurricane) Andrew six years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Rookie defensive linemen  &UR; Andre Wadsworth, a native of St.
Croix, Virgin Islands, and  &UR; Jomo Cousins, who grew up in Jamaica,
said they also have talked to their families to make sure they're
OK. &QL; 
Stealing signs
</P>
<P>
   Rams middle linebacker  &UR; Eric Hill, who spent nine years with the
Cardinals, acknowledges that he knows most of his former team's
defensive signals. But Cardinals Coach  &UR; Vince  &UR; Tobin said he
doesn't expect to change them for Sunday's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We holler in a lot of our signals, anyway,'' Tobin said.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals expect Hill to be psyched and play well despite
having a broken hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the last of a dying breed,'' center  &UR; Mike Devlin said.
``He'll hit you in the mouth. Eric would rather run through you to
make a play than run around you. When you're going against him, you
know it's going to be physical. You have to hit force with force.
If he smells any back-off on you, it's going to be a long, long
day.'' &QL; 
Happy returns &QL; 
Second-year cornerback  &UR; Ty Howard, who has been inactive the first
three games, will replace injured  &UR; J.J. McCleskey.
</P>
<P>
   McCleskey underwent arthroscopic knee surgery Thursday and will
be out about four weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ty's finally back healthy,'' Tobin said. ``He was a good
training camp until his knee started bothering him. Now, he's back
to where he was before he got hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard said he didn't lose confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been down,'' he said. ``My goal still is to be a
starting corner. But I have to take small steps before the giant
one.'' &QL; 
New look &QL; 
A new short-arm cast was placed on the injured left wrist of
linebacker  &UR; Jamir Miller, who practiced Thursday but still doesn't
know if he'll play Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It depends how I feel,'' Miller said. ``I felt pretty good,
but a cast is a very restrictive thing. Still, it's not that bad. I
can still use my hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver  &UR; Rob Moore (hamstring), running back  &UR; Larry
Centers (hamstring) and offensive guard  &UR; Lester Holmes (ankle)
didn't practice. Only Moore should miss the game.
</P>
<P>
   Punter  &UR; Scott Player, slowed by a calf injury, is expected to
test the leg today. He hasn't punted this week because of the
injury. &QL;

 EX-QUARTERBACK FINDS SUCCESS ON DEFENSE

<P>
   TEMPE, ARIZ. - Your son, the prep All-American, has been a
starting quarterback at Clemson for 2{ years. He comes to you at
semester break and says he plans to tell his coaches that he wants
to be a linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   Chances are _ shriek! _ you react the same way Patrick Sapp's
parents did.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody was like, `No, you shouldn't do it,' '' Sapp said.
``Even my coaches were sort of against it when I told them. But it
was my decision. I told them I had given them three years at
quarterback and now it was time that I gave myself my best
opportunity to make it into the league (NFL).''
</P>
<P>
   For most people, one spring training and a summer wouldn't be
enough time to gain the needed ``good'' bulk to play the position,
but in Sapp's case, he had been a 240-pound wishbone quarterback
and had to put on only 10 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt good about the decision,'' he said. ``I was benched
halfway through my junior season at quarterback. We had a new
coaching staff and the new system better fit the guy who replaced
me. Most of our linebackers were graduating, so I thought I had a
good chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you, after the first play I lined up at linebacker,
I knew I'd made the right decision. It helped going from
quarterback because I had read defenses and it helped me understand
them. Also, it helped me recognize what the offense was trying to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a credit to his rare athletic ability that his gamble paid
off. He not only made the transition, but is playing his third
season in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   His rookie season in San Diego was spent mostly on special
teams, and he started nine games during his second year before
coming to the Cardinals in the big trade in which the Cardinals
swapped No. 1 draft positions with the Chargers and came away with
Eric Metcalf and the Chargers' No. 1 pick in the 1999 draft.
</P>
<P>
   Even though he was basically considered a throw in, Sapp's
acquisition paid dividends last week when he filled in for injured
Jamie Miller and acquitted himself well.
</P>
<P>
   This Sunday in St. Louis, unless Miller can play with his
dislocated left wrist in a cast, he will be starting.
</P>
<P>
   ``He played OK,'' defensive coordinator Dave McGinnis said of
Sapp's play against the Eagles. ``I wasn't displeased. He made a
big play on the one fumble. He's not a finished product by any
means, and he can't afford to become complacent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an ongoing process. He has great intelligence and
athletic ability. His biggest thing is intensity and playing at a
high intensity level for a complete game.''
</P>
<P>
   But is he ready to start if Miller can't go?
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, we're hitting the beach; it's not about whether he's
ready or not,'' McGinnis said. ``We want results. He's getting paid
and he's wearing the uniform. We're not interested in progress. We
want results. We can worry about progress in camp, but we're not in
camp any longer.''
</P>
<P>
   Sapp knows what the situation is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm ready,'' he said. ``You practice every week like
you're going to be thrown in there, but it's kind of hard because
it doesn't always happen. On that day, I was ready and made some
plays that helped us win, and I feel good about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's different this week and so is my approach. I'm feeling
confident coming off last week and I've been working some with the
first group and playing at their tempo. I haven't played a whole
game yet, and maintaining the intensity and concentration level you
need for that many snaps is my biggest challenge.'' &QL;

RANGERS CLOSE IN ON TITLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The American League West cannot be won until tonight.
</P>
<P>
   July 31, though, likely will be viewed as the afternoon the
Rangers captured the division title.
</P>
<P>
   Third baseman Todd Zeile and shortstop Royce Clayton, whom
general manager Doug Melvin acquired in trades along with
right-hander Todd Stottlemyre on July 31 before the trade deadline,
served as the catalysts during the Rangers' 9-3 victory against the
Mariners last night at the Kingdome.
</P>
<P>
   The victory kept the Rangers three games in front of the
second-place Anaheim Angels, who defeated Oakland, 10-6, and
reduced their magic number to one with three games remaining. The
Rangers will lay claim to their second AL West title in three
seasons with one more victory in Seattle or one loss by the Angels
during the season's final three days.
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Aaron Sele got his 19th victory, giving up three
runs, eight hits and five walks in six innings.
</P>
<P>
   Zeile and Clayton played significant roles during the Rangers'
decisive three-run second and third innings last night. The two
infielders went 3-for-3 with two runs batted in and scored three
times as the Rangers erased a 1-0, first-inning deficit.
</P>
<P>
   Zeile and Clayton also helped propel the Rangers to five
consecutive victories against the Angels since Sept. 16, and
Stottlemyre defeated the Angels twice in his two starts Monday and
Sept. 16.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made moves,'' Rangers manager Johnny Oates said, ``that
really didn't benefit us until the last few days.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels noticed the difference those three players made
during their recent five games with the Rangers. The Angels,
recall, failed to make a significant addition before or after the
trade deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not supposed to be here,'' Angels shortstop Gary
DiSarcina told reporters after the Rangers' 9-1 victory Tuesday in
Anaheim. ``Everyone is hurt, and we didn't make a damn move at the
trading deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ``Strange how those three guys helped beat us in the last two
games. Clayton had a great game \RMonday\S. Todd hit a homer
against us, and Stottlemyre pitched two great games.''
</P>
<P>
   Zeile served as the second-inning catalyst with his two-out
double against Mariners right-hander Mac Suzuki (1-2) and scored
the tying run on Clayton's single.
</P>
<P>
   Clayton advanced to second on the throw to the plate and later
scored on Tom Goodwin's triple that eluded the glove of Mariners
right fielder Ryan Radmanovich, who was bidding for a sliding catch
on the Kingdome's artificial surface. Left fielder Rusty Greer
later collected the Rangers' fourth two-out hit of the inning with
a run-scoring single to center field.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers built a 6-1 lead in the third inning. First baseman
Will Clark led off the inning with a double and eventually scored
on a triple by designated hitter Lee Stevens.
</P>
<P>
   Zeile drew a one-out walk, and Clayton followed with a
run-scoring single that chased Suzuki from the game. Zeile later
scored his second run in two innings on an error charged to
Mariners catcher Dan Wilson.

SEAHAWKS MUST CATCH THE BUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIRKLAND, Wash. _ Jon Kitna has been Kordell Stewart for all of
two days. But the Seahawks' scout-team quarterback has taken enough
snaps as the Pittsburgh Steelers' starter to figure out the best
way to stop Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   With Stewart making only his 24th NFL start in Sunday's marquee
matchup at Three Rivers Stadium, the Seahawks need to treat him the
same way they have three other young quarterbacks this season.
</P>
<P>
   Which is, rudely and aggressively.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's still young,'' said Kitna, who is running the Steelers'
offense against the Seahawks' defense in practice this week. ``I'd
come after Kordell and make him prove that he's going to beat you.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a defensive coordinator,'' Kitna added, ``but I'd come
after him.''
</P>
<P>
   Not a bad read by Kitna. Pressuring Stewart into another poor
performance is exactly what the Seahawks would like to do.
</P>
<P>
   One small problem. Actually, make that one very large problem:
Jerome Bettis, the Steelers' battering-ram of a running back.
Stopping the Steelers starts with slowing down the player they call
The Bus.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to know at no point will they abandon the running
game. That's why they have the big backs. They want to wear you
down,'' said linebacker Chad Brown, who played with the Steelers
for four seasons before signing with the Seahawks last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``So what if you stop them in the first quarter, second quarter,
third quarter? You can't last,'' he said. ``They're going to run
the ball and keep pounding on you and hope that you break. They
start every quarter running the football. In the fourth quarter, if
you start to bend, they'll break you.''
</P>
<P>
   Detouring this Bus will take the same kind of swarming defense
that has helped the Seahawks dominate three lightweights from the
NFC East in their first 3-0 start since 1986. The 250-pound Bettis
is not the kind of back who can be tackled by one player.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerome is a load. That's why they call him The Bus,''
defensive tackle Cortez Kennedy said. ``He's tough to bring down.
We've got to gang-tackle him. That Bus gets rolling, then he turns
into a big ol' semi-truck when he gets into that secondary.''
</P>
<P>
   Translation: 180-pound cornerback Willie Williams one-on-one
with Bettis in the open field is not a matchup the Seahawks want to
see.
</P>
<P>
   Therein lies the secret, but also the trick, to stopping Stewart
and the Steelers. If a defense becomes too preoccupied with the
smash, the flash can burn them. If all the efforts are centered on
containing the dash, there's not enough left to counter the bash.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing these guys is like facing three different offenses,''
defensive tackle Sam Adams said. ``They're capable of running trick
plays very well. They've capable of throwing the ball if they
really want to. And, of course, they've very capable of running the
ball.''
</P>
<P>
   As Kitna said, the Seahawks need to back Stewart into a
we-dare-you-to-beat-us corner. Dangerous? Yes. Stewart ran and
passed for 32 TDs and nearly 3,500 yards of offense last year. But
that's the A side. The B side to the egnamatic Stewart was being
intercepted twice while throwing into double- and triple-coverage
in the Steelers' loss to the Denver Broncos in the AFC Championship
game.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Stewart has thrown six interceptions in three games,
completed 45.7 percent of his passes and his quarterback rating is
the lowest in the league (38.0). In last week's 21-0 loss to the
Dolphins, Stewart was 11 of 35 for 82 yards, with three
interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks, meanwhile, lead the NFL with 19 sacks, are second
in the league with six interceptions and tied for third with four
fumble recoveries.
</P>
<P>
   These contrasting numbers add up to a mismatch. But the looks on
the faces of the Seahawks' defenders say, ``Yeah, right.''
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker Darrin Smith played Stewart and the Steelers in Super
Bowl XXX while with the Dallas Cowboys. He has seen how the player
who was once called Slash for his versatility can turn a broken
play into a big play.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to keep him in the pocket. You let Kordell get
outside the pocket, he's got too much speed,'' Smith said. ``They
can use him like a running back because of his speed and his
vision.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hate to play quarterbacks like that who are so mobile.''
</P>
<P>
   HAWK TALK: LB Dean Wells returned to practice Thursday and moved
well enough that he should be able to play this week, coach Dennis
Erickson said. Wells has missed the first three games with a pulled
right calf. . . . Also returning to practice were WR Joey Galloway
(sprained ankle) and DE Phillip Daniels (concussion). Galloway
still was limited, but Daniels worked with the No. 1 defense . . .
CB Shawn Springs passed out chocolate bars to celebrate the birth
of his twins. The wrapper reads ``Here They Are.'' On the back, it
says, ``Manufactured by Shawn and Ellie.''

THOMPSON RETURNS HOME FOR WSU PAC-10 OPENER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANGELO BRUSCAS  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ For Washington State, Saturday's game against Cal in
Berkeley is the Pac-10 opener. For Cougar safety Lamont Thompson,
it's homecoming.
</P>
<P>
   The East Bay sophomore, who is on pace to shatter every WSU
record for interceptions, grew up just 15 minutes from Memorial
Stadium and starred as a defensive back and wide receiver for
nearby El Cerrito High, a small city north of Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   But Thompson, with the nonchalant manner in which he takes his
football accomplishments, shrugs off the importance of playing a
major-college football game in his old neighborhood for the first
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``This game probably won't be any different than any other
game,'' said Thompson, reflecting on how far he has come in his two
Cougar seasons. ``I'm adapting pretty good to Pullman. This is my
home now.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I go on vacation to my other home, it's like I'm going
there to visit.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson is more worried about keeping Cal quarterback Justin
Vedder out of the Cougar end zone than how many friends and family
members will be there to watch him. The scrambling Vedder, third in
the Pac-10 last year in total offense with 249.4 yards a game,
presents the Cougar secondary with its biggest challenge so far
this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a quarterback of his caliber, you have to stay in
coverage a little longer because he can run,'' Thompson said.
Although Vedder's favorite target last season, Bobby Shaw, is gone
after catching 75 passes in 1997, Thompson believes the Cal
receivers ``have more speed than they had last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson also has other things on his mind. He is rumored to be
a secret weapon on offense that WSU coach Mike Price might unveil
at wide receiver. The 6-foot-1, 204-pound free safety has
scrimmaged at receiver and Price this week wouldn't say whether he
would be deployed both ways against Cal.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson is willing to do anything to help the Cougars win, and
pass-catching makes him better at defending against the pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just catching the ball in general helps me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And that's why Price is considering him as a receiver as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like he just makes casual plays but they are spectacular
catches,'' he said of Thompson's interceptions. ``He is something.
He's our Charles Woodson. Lamont Thompson can play both ways.''
</P>
<P>
   As a member of last year's Pac-10 championship team, Thompson
knows how important the Cal game is if WSU (3-0) is to be
considered a serious contender for to play in back-to-back bowl
games for the first time in the history of the school.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole team is anxious to win our first Pac-10 game,''
Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson started the final three games and the Rose Bowl last
year as a true freshman after senior Duane Stewart was injured and
the secondary was picked apart against Arizona State in WSU's only
Pac-10 loss. He had three interceptions (tying a school record)
against Washington and ended the year with six, which tied him for
the Pac-10 lead.
</P>
<P>
   With two interceptions, including a touchdown-saving pick, in
WSU's 24-16 win over Idaho, Thompson now has nine for his career,
just five short of WSU's all-time leader, Rick Reed, who had 14
from 1966-68.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson doesn't pay too much attention to records.
</P>
<P>
   ``Satisfaction-wise, me, I'm never satisfied,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He's too busy fielding punts, chasing down passes on offense and
concentrating on his college career to keep count of his
interception total. He wants to earn a degree in communication and
has a serious side that admires poetry and the works of Maya
Angelou. But he doesn't write much poetry anymore, unless it's on
the football field.
</P>
<P>
   ``In high school, I took a couple of poetry classes, but I kind
of got away from that now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson is now a veteran with two full years of eligibility
ahead of him. He can relate to the experience that defensive tackle
Joey Hollenbeck is going through as a freshman called on to step in
for an injured senior captain, and offers this advice:
</P>
<P>
   ``Just keep doing what you're doing and never be satisfied with
what you did the previous week. Just come out and practice harder
and be the player that you want to be.''

RAIDERS' NEW ERA OFF TO FALSE START
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The head coach is new. The problems are old ones. And the
freshly installed offensive scheme appears to be swirling in their
heads like some bad '60s trip.
</P>
<P>
   The Oakland Raiders, who come calling on the Cowboys Sunday, are
1-2, which goes to show that a ``commitment to excellence'' doesn't
go as far as it used to.
</P>
<P>
   The Raiders are having trouble drawing 42,000 to 63,263-seat,
once-loyal Oakland Coliseum. The great unwashed that does go to see
Al Davis' team have been treated to familiar old Raider
idiosyncrasies, such as scattershoot quarterbacking and a weekly
maelstrom of penalties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the way our team is fighting,'' said first-year coach
Jon Gruden.
</P>
<P>
   In the old days, we knew what that meant.
</P>
<P>
   But lately, Gruden's team has just been fighting to hang on. The
Raiders have been roundly outplayed by two fill-in quarterbacks,
Kansas City's Rich Gannon and Denver's Bubby Brister.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to build on the positive,'' Gruden, 35, repeated at
his weekly news conference this week. ``For three straight weeks,
our team has been fighting in the fourth quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's the trouble. The old Raiders would have been biting
and eye-gouging.
</P>
<P>
   For the Cowboys, therefore, Week 2 of the Jason Garrett ``Home
Alone'' show might not be the test of mettle that we originally
thought. The NFC East smells like a bad cheese. A guy in a do-rag
who skipped most of training camp just hypnotized the New York
Giants.
</P>
<P>
   Was I reading this right? The division's five quarterbacks of
record last week were Garrett, Danny Kanell, Trent Green, Bobby
Hoying and Jake Plummer?
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, we find ourselves singing the Cowboys' praises.
They're 2-1. But by mere glimpse at the apparent NFC food chain, we
see they could win eight, nine games, if Deion Sanders and Richie
Cunningham merely show up.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys, who desperately needed a jackrabbit start, appear
capable of concocting one at the expense of the Giants, Redskins,
Bears, Eagles and, yes, even the AFC Raiders.
</P>
<P>
   Some new head coaches never recover from poor starts (See
Wannstedt, Dave). But others, like the Cowboys' Chan Gailey, can
turn a few quick victories into a locker room full of converts.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys needed somebody to believe in. Somebody who cared
about how hard they worked and how deeply they were committed.
Coaching does matter, contrary to what the mantra was around here
for four years.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys aren't any better than they were 12 months ago. But
they're playing better. And Gailey has given them a fresh start and
a new offense to believe in.
</P>
<P>
   Contrast that to the Raiders, who remain as fresh as an old
Grateful Dead album. They are on their third alleged ``new''
offensive system in three years, but their three-week output this
season: only three field goals and three touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   The Raiders committed 15 penalties in a season-opening loss to
the Chiefs and 16 in their lone victory the next week over the
Giants.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, they can't seem to keep quarterback Jeff George on his
feet. In three games, George has been sacked 19 times, second-worst
in the league.
</P>
<P>
   Defenses have been preying on the Raiders' unfamiliarity with
Gruden's system, which is supposed to be his own but, on second
glance, has the oily fingerprints of owner Al Davis all over it.
Can bomber George even run Gruden's ball-control passing game
offense?
</P>
<P>
   So teams blitz. And George's feet freeze. The Chiefs reportedly
blitzed George on 51 of 62 plays in the season opener.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until we prove that we can handle the blitz,'' Gruden said,
``we're going to continue to see the blitz.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys, rest assured, will not hesitate to blitz.
</P>
<P>
   In Oakland, they're talking about bringing in fullback Craig
``Ironhead'' Heyward, who was last spotted being ousted from the
Rams camp and weighing in at 5-foot-11 and 300 pounds. They're
wondering how long will it be before Davis impatiently starts
tweaking with what Gruden is trying to get started.
</P>
<P>
   It's all a tale of two franchises. Two owners. Two new head
coaches.
</P>
<P>
   All this, Cowboys fans, and you also get the NFC East.

TKACHUK: ONLY NEW DEAL WILL END HOLDOUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Holdout left wing  &UR; Keith Tkachuk said for the first
time publicly that he won't report to the Coyotes unless he
receives a contract extension that makes him one of the NHL's
highest-paid players.
</P>
<P>
   But its doubtful the team's captain and leading scorer will have
his wish granted anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   General Manager  &UR; Bobby Smith has continued maintain that all
negotiations are off indefinitely and that he expects Tkachuk to
honor the final two years of his contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I'm not going to do that,'' Tkachuk said from his home
near Boston when asked whether he will consider returning to the
team without a new deal this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't even thought about doing that, and I'm ``not'' going
to think about that. What I expect is a new contract, something
they promised to give me this summer. Hopefully, they'll be able to
hammer something out, it'll get done, and I'll be able to start
practicing with the team again.''
</P>
<P>
   Tkachuk already has forfeited $132,353 of his $2.8 million
salary this season after being suspended by the club Sept. 12 for
refusing to report to training camp. He is scheduled to earn $3
million in 1999-2000.
</P>
<P>
   He and his agent, Bob Murray, have been seeking a new deal that
calls for a three-year extension worth about $41 million over the
next five seasons _ an average of more than $8 million per year.
</P>
<P>
   But after Smith flatly rejected two proposals the day before
camp opened, he said he had nothing else to talk about and
suspended negotiations. The two sides have not talked since, and it
apparently has affected some of their memories.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still waiting to hear from them,'' Tkachuk said. ``The
ball's in Bobby Smith's court with that last offer we sent to
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Tkachuk, 26, said he was referring to the two offers Murray made
to Smith on Sept. 10.
</P>
<P>
   Reminded that Smith rejected both offers, calling them
``outlandish and offensive,'' Tkachuk said, ``Well, you've got to
get both sides talking. This is a tough thing to get done.''
</P>
<P>
   Tkachuk said he will not instruct Murray to make another pitch
to Smith. Teams sources have said that management is prepared to
let him sit all season if he doesn't honor his contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the next week to 10 days are pretty pivotal,'' Tkachuk
said. ``There's only so much time left, and I need a certain amount
of time to get ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough not being there, working hard with the other guys
on the team, but we've felt all along that a promise was made to us
that a deal would get done. Time's running out, but I'm still
hopeful that eventually, we'll get something worked out and I'll be
there.'' &QL; 
Loose pucks &QL; 
Smith and Coach  &UR; Jim Schoenfeld are expected to pare the training
camp roster significantly after Saturday night's home preseason
game against the Los Angeles Kings.
</P>
<P>
   Players on the bubble include defensemen Gagnon,  &UR; Richard
Lintner,
 &UR; Brad Tiley and former No. 1 draft pick  &UR; Dan Focht, veteran forwards
 &UR; Joe
 &UR; Dziedzic,  &UR; Louie DeBrusk,  &UR; Barry Niekar and  &UR; Ron Murray, and goalie
 &UR; Scott
 &UR; Langkow, who probably will start the season in Las Vegas of the
International Hockey League.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Coyotes sent rookie left wing  &UR; Adam Dewan back to
his junior team in Peterborough, Ontario, this week, they are
trying to sign the non-drafted training camp free agent to a
contract. &QL;

DISNEY FALLS ON MODEST 4TH QUARTER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Shares of The Walt Disney Co. fell 3.5 percent
Thursday as Chairman Michael Eisner threw cold water on Wall
Street's expectations for the current quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Eisner, on tour in New York to promote the release of his
autobiography, ``Work in Progress,'' said the results for Disney's
fourth quarter ending Sept. 30 represent a ``speed bump'' rather
than a ``sinkhole.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A year of modest growth is not the end of the world,'' he
said, referring to the certainty that the entertainment giant won't
match its goal of 20 percent annual earnings growth.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Disney were down 93.75 cents to $25.875 and are off 39
percent from their all-time high set May 4.
</P>
<P>
   Burbank-based Disney announced Sept. 14 that it expected
fourth-quarter earnings to come in at 15 or 16 cents a share, well
below Wall Street's consensus of 21 cents, due to Asia's economic
turmoil, slack demand for consumer products, rising film costs and
a downbeat performance by ABC.
</P>
<P>
   Eisner said Thursday that earnings performance also has been
held back by major investments in new ventures such as the Animal
Kingdom theme park, DisneyQuest interactive play parks and ESPN
restaurants, along with soaring prices for professional football
and hockey broadcast rights.

MCGUIRE GOES HOMERLESS IN CARDINAL WIN OVER EXPOS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Maybe it's the claustrophobia in Mark McGwire that
has turned him into a man who seems to be desperately searching for
an air pocket as everything closes in on him: the season, Sammy
Sosa, the news media, zealous fans, everything.
</P>
<P>
   As the feel-good home run spectacle nears its conclusion this
weekend, McGwire spends his days milling around the luxury hotel he
calls home during the season, rarely venturing out beyond the short
ride he takes to Busch Stadium. Once tucked in the Cardinals'
clubhouse, he is hardly seen and barely heard, choosing to hang out
in the back rooms instead of facing a crush of questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's just a little tired of it all,'' said catcher Tom
Lampkin, a close friend of McGwire. ``I think he's looking forward
to getting away from everything and just relaxing in the off
season. The focus on him has been endless.''
</P>
<P>
   Just three more games. This is what McGwire has left after
failing to break his 65-homer stalemate with Sosa on Thursday
night, going 1 for 3 with a walk and a strikeout in the Cardinals'
6-3 victory over the Montreal Expos.
</P>
<P>
   As much of a relief as this finish must be for McGwire, who has
had a draining season decorated by the emotional 62d home run he
hit to surpass Roger Maris, the pressure is still squarely on his
Atlas-like shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   What would it be like to be showered in glory for breaking
Maris' record only to see the Cubs' Sosa end up with his name in
the history books as the supreme single-season home run hitter?
</P>
<P>
   ``He has told me he doesn't care,'' Lampkin said. ``Something
may be there deep inside, but all I can go by is what he says. He
says it doesn't matter who has the most home runs when it's all
over.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone who has seen McGwire in the on-deck circle lately
agrees that he is this indifferent. There have been no signs of a
letup as he prepares to face pitchers. He still closes his eyes,
visualizes the pitches he will see, and comes out swinging. Just as
he has all year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a politically correct society we're in,'' the Houston
ace Randy Johnson said after facing McGwire on Wednesday night.
``He may say he doesn't care. But I think he's just being
politically correct.''
</P>
<P>
   After all, McGwire has not exactly stepped back and watched Sosa
take over the race. Each time Sosa has tied him, McGwire has
supplied a swift reply, usually within a day or two. On Thursday
night, McGwire, whose home run total of 65 was tied by Sosa on
Wednesday, had an edge. The Cubs had the night off, meaning an idle
Sosa, while McGwire faced the young Expos starter Javier Vazquez
(5-15).
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to walk him like cowards,'' Expos Manager
Felipe Alou said before the game. ``We're not going to put it on a
tee for him, either. We're going to pitch him like we did Mike
Piazza in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Expos did not intentionally walk him, the 22-year-old
Vazquez appeared to shake a bit in McGwire's presence, and walked
him on four nervous pitches, drawing boos. In the third, Vazquez
came back to strike out McGwire, who later singled and had a
tap-back to the mound.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Mark is geared to go through this thing to Sunday,''
Cardinals Manager Tony La Russa said after the game. ``Mentally,
he's ready, but he's just a little frustrated because the pitching
has been good.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the night, the home run race stood even.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two players say they aren't in a race, but the people seem
to think they are,'' Alou said. ``I think there's a race going on.
They haven't stopped hitting home runs, so something is going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Not for long. On Sunday, everything will come to a close.
Perhaps when it does, McGwire will have some room to breathe again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been an unreal year for him, and I think he has deserved
all the attention he has gotten,'' Lampkin said. ``But I think
he'll be kind of glad when it's over.''

THOSE WHO KNOW OATES BEST SAY MANAGER SHOULD RETURN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ It is not, by any stretch of the imagination, a
scientific poll. Margin of error could be estimated at plus or
minus 50 percentage points, give or take 10 or 20.
</P>
<P>
   But the three guys I questioned before the Rangers and Mariners
opened a four-game series that, at some point, should include a
champagne celebration for the Texans, all give manager Johnny Oates
a thumbs up.
</P>
<P>
   Two thumbs up each, in fact. That's six in all, if you're
counting, Mr. Hicks.
</P>
<P>
   For whatever that's worth.
</P>
<P>
   You already know how I feel, but something tells me that's not
worth all that much or this wouldn't even be a subject for
discussion.
</P>
<P>
   Oates, in fact, prefers not to discuss it at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are more important issues to take care of before we
worry about that,'' Oates said yesterday at the Kingdome. ``We've
still got a job to do, and hopefully that'll take another month or
so.
</P>
<P>
   If the Rangers are still playing in late October _ or even
clinch their second division title in three seasons sometime this
weekend, as expected _ then the issue of Oates' future should
immediately become a moot point.
</P>
<P>
   Not that it should be in question at all. Meanwhile, he remains
quietly unperturbed by rumors and speculation that the Rangers must
at least win the A.L. West to guarantee his _ and his coaches' _
job security.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm extremely proud of the job my coaches have done,'' Oates
said, ``but all of us are only as good as the players.''
</P>
<P>
   That's been plenty good when it counted most. The Rangers, who
beat the Angels five in a row, arrived at the Kingdome with a
three-game lead over Anaheim and a magic number of ``2'' after
gaining 6 1/2 games in the standings since Sept. 6.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' emotional state for the five games against the
Angels, particularly the three-game series just concluded, was
perfect, and Oates, who knows when to push, when to prod and when
to plead, deserves credit for his team's ``relaxed intensity.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what I call it. Oates' brief pregame meeting before Game
1 in Anaheim produced the perfect blend of confidence and
concentration. His players say he's even better in one-on-one
situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's excellent,'' said former Rangers catcher Dave Valle, now
a radio analyst with the Mariners. ``He has such a respect for the
players and the privacy of that communication, that it's never
spoken about.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a player leaves his office, he feels like there's a true
concern there for you as an individual. It goes beyond \ROates'\S
concern for you as a player.''
</P>
<P>
   Oates' greatest overall strength as a manager, said Valle, who
played a critical role as a team leader in the Rangers' drive to
the '96 division flag, is his consistency.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what to expect every day,'' Valle said. ``There are
no surprises. That's really a great asset because consistency is
what this game demands from a player, too. When you're on his team,
it's good to know that he's at the helm of the ship.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, so maybe you'd prefer current players. Let's try pitcher
John Burkett, who says Oates' even-handed approach is perfect for a
veteran team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because he's not overemotional, he's a good match for the team
we have here,'' Burkett said. ``Plus, he has a lot of patience with
people. He showed it with me, and he stuck with Fernando Tatis
early in the season when a lot of managers would have buried him on
the bench.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there's John Wetteland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Johnny's not only a good manager, he's a good person,''
Wetteland said. ``He and his coaches do a great job. Sometimes I
feel sorry for them when we're playing bad. I feel like I ought to
go out there and tell the fans, `This is not how they're teaching
us to do this.'''
</P>
<P>
   So that's three players, one former and two current, who will
happily stand up for Oates. They understand that whatever problems
this team _ which is about to take on the Yankees in the playoffs _
may have, they don't include the man in the manager's office.
</P>
<P>
   We can round up more, if needed, but it'll just get boring.
We're all prejudiced. It's a natural byproduct of hanging around
the guy for a good part of the last four years.

ANGLES' GOOD NIGHT IS TOO LATE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.1998 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND _ Anaheim Angels manager Terry Collins sat in the dugout
Thursday afternoon at the Oakland Coliseum and still had no answers
for why the Angels offense could do nothing in losing three to the
Texas Rangers, scoring only three runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just didn't hit, we absolutely just didn't hit,'' he said.
``For whatever reason.''
</P>
<P>
   And for whatever reason, the Angels bats suddenly came to life
against the Oakland A's in a 10-6 win before 9,268. The Angels got
13 hits, including five by shortstop Gary DiSarcina, batting in the
No. 2 spot for the first time in more than a year. It was
DiSarcina's second career five-hit game, the other coming June 13
at Texas earlier this season.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Angels win, the Rangers clinched at least a tie for
the division title with a victory over the Mariners in Seattle. The
Angels' only hope for postseason play is to beat the A's the next
three days and hope Texas loses the next three to Seattle. That
would force a one-game playoff Monday in Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   In all probability, the game featured Jack McDowell's final
appearance of his career. Though he was staked to a 5-0 lead,
McDowell wasn't able to last long enough to qualify for the
victory.
</P>
<P>
   McDowell went four innings, allowing six runs and eight hits. He
has pitched with pain in his elbow all season and has said he is
leaning toward retirement so he can spend more time with his family
and his band, Stickfigure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm approaching it as though it's not his last game, he hasn't
said anything to me,'' Collins said before the game. ``If it is, I
consider myself fortunate to have watched him this year. I hope it
isn't. He tells me his arm doesn't hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a pitcher, these are the guys you sit and talk with.
If there's an open seat next to him on the bus, you sit next to
Jack McDowell.''
</P>
<P>
   It took the Angels only five batters in the first inning
Thursday to score more than they did in the entire series vs.
Texas. Against the Rangers, the Angels sent 103 batters to the
plate and scored three runs in the three games.
</P>
<P>
   But in the first inning against the A's, the Angels got started
quickly. Jim Edmonds led off and reached on second baseman Scott
Spiezio's error. DiSarcina followed with a single off the third
baseman Eric Chavez's glove, Edmonds taking third.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Salmon doubled home Edmonds, then Darin Erstad drove in
DiSarcina with a groundout.
</P>
<P>
   Next up, Todd Greene hit a two-run homer, his first since Aug.
19, 1997. That gave the Angels four runs in five batters, and they
weren't through. Matt Walbeck doubled and went to third on center
fielder Ryan Christenson's error. Troy Glaus then singled home
Walbeck for a 5-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels, though, couldn't get comfortable. The A's got three
hits in their first three at-bats off McDowell in the first inning
and eventually all three scored in the inning to cut the Angels'
lead to 5-3.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels continued their assault on A's starter Jimmy Haynes
(11-9) in the second inning. Edmonds led off with a double, his
42nd of the season to tie a club record. Doug DeCinces (1982) and
Johnny Ray (1988) also had 42 in a season.
</P>
<P>
   DiSarcina drove home Edmonds with a double and then scored
himself later in the inning on Erstad's groundout. DiSarcina
doubled home another run in the fourth, and Haynes didn't make it
out of the inning, trailing 8-3.
</P>
<P>
   The A's rallied for three more runs in the bottom of the fourth,
two coming home on Chavez's double and a third run on a single by
Mike Macfarlane.
</P>
<P>
   But again the Angels responded, getting two runs in the sixth
off A's reliever Blake Stein to go up 10-6. Salmon drove in the
first run of the inning with a single and Erstad drove in the
second when he hit into a fielder's choice.

DODGERS AVOID NO-HITTER, WIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Out of it in the standings and on the field, the
Los Angeles Dodgers seemed like the perfect team for Steve
Woodard's attempt at a perfect game.
</P>
<P>
   In the first game of the season's final series Thursday night,
Woodard, the 23-year old Milwaukee Brewers right-hander, retired
the first 18 Dodgers he faced. But for the second time in two
weeks, the Dodgers not only broke up a perfect game, they actually
won, too.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Cedeno opened the seventh with a home run and the Dodgers
went on to beat the Brewers 4-1 in front of 30,024 at Dodger
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 10, San Diego's Kevin Brown also retired the first 18
Dodgers he faced. He then got the last six. In between, the Dodgers
scored four runs to win 4-3.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did that against Brown and we had to execute that way
again,'' Dodgers manager Glenn Hoffman said.
</P>
<P>
   Woodard is no Kevin Brown, a Cy Young Award candidate. He
entered the game 1-7 in his last eight decisions. But he was rarely
challenged until Cedeno drove a 2-0 fastball into the empty
right-field pavilion to tie the game at one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was waiting for the fastball on the 2-0 count,'' Cedeno
said. ``When we are down and not getting hits, we do what we need
to do.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until the eighth inning, with Woodard out of the game,
that the Dodgers took over.
</P>
<P>
   Reliever Chad Fox (1-4) allowed three runs in the eighth and
again Cedeno was at the center of the action. He walked, raced from
first to third on a wild pitch and scored on a single by Trenidad
Hubbard to make it 4-1.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's wild pitch scored Juan Castro, who reached base on the
weirdest play of the night. After rookie Paul LoDuca opened the
eighth with a double off the wall in right-center, Castro tried to
sacrifice him to third. But Brewers first baseman Mark Loretta
booted the bunt, then threw wildly to first for two errors on one
play. LoDuca scored and Castro went all the way to third.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers rookie Eric Weaver (2-0) replaced right-hander Dave
Mlicki after six innings and picked up his second major-league
victory. He also beat the Padres on Sept. 13 after coming on in
relief of Ismael Valdes. This time he pitched two scoreless innings
before turning the game over to closer Jeff Shaw.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw retired all three batters he faced to record his 46th save
and 23rd with the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Woodard was coming off a dismal performance against St. Louis,
when he allowed nine hits and seven runs in 52/3 innings of a 12-10
loss. But lost in that start were nine strikeouts and just one
walk.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had his good stuff tonight,'' Brewers manager Phil Garner
said. `` He only gave up two hits in seven innings. If we had any
kind of offense we would have been able to keep him out there.''
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't overpowering Thursday, but after some early fly balls
Woodard starting getting outs on the ground. Hubbard took
left-fielder Geoff Jenkins to the wall in the first, but Woodard
didn't get challenged again until Cedeno in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt good all night,'' Woodard said. ``I was making some
good pitches. You know I wasn't thinking about it at all. I've had
a couple like that before that got away. They ended up hitting the
same pitches I was throwing all night.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his performance, Woodard had just a 1-0 lead over
Dodgers starter Dave Mlicki.
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee scored its only run in the second inning on a home run
by shortstop Jose Valentin. Mlicki, who left his last start with
lower back pain, allowed just four hits before being lifted for
pinch hitter Angel Pena in the sixth..
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I felt good, I thought I could keep going,'' said
Mlicki, who said he had no soreness in his back. ``When you have a
good pitcher like Woodard and he is throwing a perfect game. I'd
rather have a batter hit than me.''

WITH AT LEAST 250 DEAD IN CARIBBEAN, STORM HEADS TOWARD FLORIDA
KEYS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   MIAMI _ As the death toll from Hurricane Georges's rampage
through the Caribbean rose to at least 250, the storm crossed Cuba
Thursday, turned northward and took aim at southern Florida, where
a million people were advised to evacuate mobile homes and
low-lying coastal areas.
</P>
<P>
   At least 125 of the deaths were reported in the Dominican
Republic, where workers recovered 76 bodies Thursday from a river
in San Juan de la Maguana, 120 miles west of the capital, Santo
Domingo. Earlier, at least 45 people in the town of San Cristobal
were killed when the walls of a school being used as a shelter
collapsed in flood waters.
</P>
<P>
   In the Dominican Republic and Haiti, which share the island of
Hispaniola, hundreds of people were missing and feared dead. Leonel
Fernandez, president of the Dominican Republic, said the storm had
left more than 100,000 people homeless and severely damaged sugar,
banana, rice and coffee crops that were nearly ready for harvest.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a national tragedy,'' Fernandez said in a
televised address to the country's 7.5 million people. ``We face a
titanic task.''
</P>
<P>
   As Hurricane Georges moved back over open water, its winds
reached 90 mph late Thursday night and they were expected to reach
105 mph on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The airport in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, was closed
because of damage to the control tower and terminals. It was
uncertain when it would reopen, but the earliest estimate for
restoration of jet traffic was Sunday, American Airlines said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 3.8 million residents of Puerto Rico were reported
still to be without electricity and water. The local telephone
company said 339,000 of its customers had no long-distance service,
making communication with relatives in the continental United
States difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Some shops and restaurants have reopened, using generators as
their power source, and the government said it hoped to restore
power to half the island by the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   In Cuba, officials reported two dead from the hurricane, both
electrocutions because of downed power lines. Civil Defense
officials warned residents to expect mudslides and coastal flooding
in the eastern part of the island up to Cayo Coco, a small island
popular with tourists north of Ciego de Avila in central Cuba, and
urged them to avoid the streets.
</P>
<P>
   About 370,000 people had been evacuated to safer areas in the
eastern provinces, but some had begun returning home Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Government television showed some rivers overrunning their banks
after seven hours of rain, cutting off some municipalities and
flooding nearby housing. Power was out in many areas.
</P>
<P>
   Early Thursday, the energy expended by Hurricane Georges in its
four-day rampage across Puerto Rico, Hispaniola and Cuba appeared
to have exhausted the storm. But as the hurricane moved back out
over the warm waters of the Caribbean, it gained force, and
meteorologists warned that it could strengthen to a Category 3
storm, with winds over 125 miles per hour, by the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   With the storm gaining speed and strength as it moved toward the
Florida Straits, forecasters predicted that the eye would strike
the Florida Keys early Friday. From Miami to Tampa, millions of
residents rushed to complete their storm preparations in
anticipation of that landfall and the flooding and destruction that
are expected to accompany it.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1992, we weren't as ready for Hurricane Andrew as we should
have been, and I vowed not to let that happen again,'' said Lisa de
Grandy as she loaded plywood into a van outside a home-supply store
here this morning. ``It's tense in there, like a scavenger hunt,
and this is not something I really want to be doing again, but we
want to suffer as little damage as possible this time.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The course Hurricane Georges is thought most likely to follow in
the coming days would take it directly over the lower Keys early
Friday and on into the Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of both Miami and Fort Lauderdale awoke Thursday to
find that a hurricane warning had been issued for their
communities. By late Thursday, warnings were posted for 5 million
people in eight counties _ Monroe, Miami-Dade, Broward, Collier,
Lee, Charlotte, Sarasota and Manatee.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may become a major hurricane, and we need to be ready for
that,'' Jerry Jarrell, director of the National Hurricane Center
here, cautioned Thursday, after radar images indicated the eye of
the storm was reorganizing. ``People really need to count on it
being bad.''
</P>
<P>
   As Hurricane Georges was regrouping, Alex Penelas, the mayor of
Miami-Dade County, which has 2 million residents, issued a decree
for the evacuation of Miami Beach, Key Biscayne and other
communities on barrier islands facing the Atlantic. But the
directive was strictly voluntary, and many residents, especially
young people and those who did not experience Hurricane Andrew,
said they had no intention of complying.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been in a hurricane before, but I'm not
panicking,'' said Carolina Aguirre, a 32-year-old teacher and Miami
Beach resident. ``It's more dangerous to leave than to stay, so I
will stay.''
</P>
<P>
   Residents of mobile homes and trailer parks, many of whom
experienced the full force of Hurricane Andrew and its 150 mph
winds, seemed to be treating a mandatory evacuation order for them
more seriously.
</P>
<P>
   At Fowler's trailer park in southern Miami-Dade County, Xiomara
Lopez, 44, and her family of five were loading an air-conditioner
and clothes into a truck and preparing to leave for a relative's
house.
</P>
<P>
   ``This trailer survived Andrew, but we're not taking any
chances,'' said her daughter, Ayza Corujo, 23. ``We're lucky,
because a lot of the people here are poor and don't have anyplace
to go. We're just praying that our home is still here when we come
back, because we don't have any insurance.''
</P>
<P>
   The evacuation directive also applied to Homestead and Florida
City, both of which were leveled by Hurricane Andrew.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are extremely concerned because of the extensive flooding
we believe will be associated with this hurricane,'' Penelas said
Thursday afternoon in explaining the measure and announcing the
opening of public shelters across the county.
</P>
<P>
   James Witt, director of the federal Emergency Management Agency,
said: ``It is the storm surge coming behind the Keys that will have
a lot of the force. We're worried about flooding and crop damage.''
</P>
<P>
   Key West, through which the eye of the storm is expected to
pass, was reported Thursday to be virtually a ghost town, with
tourists having fled and hotels, bars and boutiques along normally
bustling Duval Street closed. The airport was closed this morning,
and a 9 p.m. curfew was ordered for the city and all the rest of
Monroe County.
</P>
<P>
   At Cape Canaveral, the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration initially ordered the space shuttle Discovery rolled
back to its hangar, three and a half miles from the Atlantic, but
decided Thursday evening to keep it on its seaside launching pad.
The shuttle had been moved to the pad on Monday for next month's
flight with Sen. John Glenn.
</P>
<P>
   Hotels in nearby Orlando were filling rapidly with residents
fleeing threatened areas further south, and MacDill Air Force Base
in Tampa was ordered evacuated.

CARDS FALL INTO PLACE; RED SOX GAIN PLAYOFFS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ On the night the Red Sox captured the American League
wild card with a 9-6 win over the Baltimore Orioles at Fenway Park,
the bubbly of choice was Le Domaine Extra Dry California Champagne,
and it wore as well as it tasted.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Sox CEO John Harrington, who lost the dry look as soon
as Bret Saberhagen clutched his arm and Tim Wakefield took aim with
his bottle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody have a little champagne for Mr. Harrington?'' said
Saberhagen, the 15-game winner who didn't play Thursday night but
issued a call to arms before the game, when he walked purposefully
to the TV set and switched off the Jerry Springer video that was
drawing howls in the clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got work to do,'' Saberhagen said. ``Batting practice is
in 10 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Batting practice never ended for the Red Sox, not on a clinching
night when they won their 90th game and collected 18 hits,
including two home runs by Nomar Garciaparra, who scored four
times; three hits by Mo Vaughn, who regained a razor-thin lead in
the AL batting race; and four hits by catcher Scott Hatteberg, all
of which took the sting out of the three home runs allowed by
winning pitcher Pedro Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   ``I consider my game to be a bad game for myself and for the
team,'' said Martinez (19-7), who was long gone to the clubhouse
when closer Tom Gordon struck out the side in the ninth for his
major league-record 42d consecutive save, the last out coming when
umpire Jim Evans called out Robbie Alomar on a checked-swing third
strike at 10:14.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm glad,'' Martinez said, ``that my teammates were there
to back me up like they've done all year long.''
</P>
<P>
   The cigars were Partagas, a Jamaican brand, and Montecristo,
from the Dominican Republic. Everyone seemed to have one in the
winners' clubhouse, except for Lauren Hatteberg, the 10-month-old
daughter of the catcher. She still preferred her pacifier.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the absolute best,'' Scott Hatteberg said. ``I hope
she remembers it. I know she won't, but I'll tell her she was in
here.''
</P>
<P>
   True story: Lauren Hatteberg raised her tiny index finger.
``That's right,'' Hatteberg said. ``No. 1.''
</P>
<P>
   The hugs, the handshakes, the smiles, and even the tears shed by
Leroy Vaughn, father of the first baseman, had no labels. But the
new caps modeled by everyone in the clubhouse, from Midre Cummings,
the man who was released twice by other clubs in spring training;
to Mike Stanley, the recycled Red Sox DH; to Dennis Eckersley,
baseball's 2,000-year-old man, who tied Hoyt Wilhelm's major league
record with his 1,070th career pitching appearance, told the story.
</P>
<P>
   The caps didn't just have a red ``B.'' There was a wild card
tucked on top.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know how with Chinese food, you can mix everything up and
it tastes great?'' Leroy Vaughn said. ``That's what this team was
like. This team had a little bit of everything. That's what
happened. And next year, you can't explain it.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Duquette, the man who put this team together, walked into
the office of manager Jimy Williams after first passing under a
champagne sprinkler. The two men embraced.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nice going, Dan, goldang it,'' Williams said to Duquette. ``I
mean it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We got 90 wins and we're going to the dance,'' Duquette said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ain't going to the dance,'' Williams said as Duquette
pulled away from him. ``We're going to the party.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel real good. I feel really proud for all of 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   Just then, Harrington came in. ``Congratulations to you,''
Harrington said in mid-hug.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thanks to you,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all started with that long talk we had in October,''
Harrington said.
</P>
<P>
   What October was that? Williams was asked. ``I don't remember
which October,'' Williams said. ``A red October.''
</P>
<P>
   There hasn't been a red October in these parts since 1995, when
the Sox won the AL East and were eliminated by the Cleveland
Indians in three straight games. The best-of-five first round of
the playoffs opens Tuesday, probably in Cleveland, though if the
Indians and Rangers should finish the season tied, the Sox will be
headed to Texas instead.
</P>
<P>
   On this night, the Sox cared little about whom they will be
playing. This was a night to celebrate that they'll be playing at
all in October.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great feeling,'' said Darren Lewis, the
bargain-basement center fielder who in 1993 played for a team, the
Giants, that won 103 games and went home on the last day of the
season. ``We're not finished yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just a start. This is a mini-celebration for all the
hard work we did during the season. But soon we're going to have to
stop and refocus on what our real goals are. Celebrate tonight and
start again tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   When the last out was recorded, Vaughn and Valentin converged
from opposite corners of the diamond, met on the mound, and wrapped
each other in joyful embrace, even as Gordon pointed skyward.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we had two outs, I tried to get Mo's attention,''
Valentin said. ``Mo and I, we're the only ones who were here in
'95.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not everyone here knows what it feels like. Obviously, there
are other veterans who have been there, but the playoffs are a
different animal. We're going to have to bear down and make as few
mistakes as possible, because the team that makes the fewest
mistakes wins.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't supposed to be here,'' Valentin added. ``But now
that we're here, maybe we'll sneak up on somebody.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the whole idea, Vaughn said. ``I know pretty much what
we're going to experience. I look forward to it. I'm glad to be
here. Respect everybody, fear no team.''

DUQUETTE DOES CLUBHOUSE VICTORY LAP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Champagne streams and champagne droplets were still
floating down through the thickest of cigar smoke when general
manager Dan Duquette entered a Red Sox clubhouse that best could
best be described as controlled happiness.
</P>
<P>
   Duquette shook the hands of players, stopped to congratulate
players, and, carrying a ``Red Sox Wild Card'' T-shirt in his
hands, hugged a few in the melee of restrained joy that followed
Thursday night's 9-6 victory over the Orioles at Fenway Park. But
when the GM entered the office of manager Jimy Williams, he showed
emotions that seldom are on public display.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got it!,'' Duquette said as he wrapped Williams in a
prolonged bear hug. ``We got it ... we're going to the dance ...
and we got 90 wins!''
</P>
<P>
   When Duquette left Williams's office, he went along the row of
lockers just outside the door, the lockers of the coaches, and he
shook all their hands and said to all the men virtually the same
words: ``We got 90 wins. Did you know that?'' and ``We won 90
games. Isn't that something.''
</P>
<P>
   As much as he enjoyed his team surprising one and all in the
baseball world by earning the American League wild card, Duquette
seemed almost as pleased that Boston had won 90 games. In his mind,
this was a benchmark.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ninety wins,'' he said again and again. ``Did you know the Red
Sox haven't won 90 games since '86?'' Needless to mention, that was
the last year Boston was in the World Series, the last time the Red
Sox won a postseason game.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're all great,'' Duquette said when asked to compare this
surprise to the surprise of 1995, when the Red Sox last made the
playoffs, as AL East champions. ``We had a bunch of guys who had
great individual years. This was a complete team effort ... and we
won 90 games. First time we won 90 games since '86. It's a great
achievement for everybody involved; that's what's great about
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Not far behind Duquette in the locker room was CEO John
Harrington, who noted the controlled celebration and said, ``In
'95, we were a lot happier, we were out on the field, and we may
have been riding horses.''
</P>
<P>
   The point, said Harrington, ``is that those of us who've been
through it and have been there before are saying, `We're happy.
We're just as happy but we're not showing it. We're going to show
it when we can reach the next level.'''
</P>
<P>
   Harrington said he was not surprised by this team: ``We expected
this and wanted this.'' But getting to the AL Championship Series
and perhaps the World Series? ``Now,'' conceded Harrington, ``that
would be a surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   But maybe not, said Harrington in his next breath. ``We've got
it all. Nomar (Garciaparra) is the MVP (of the league), we've got
the top stopper (Tom Gordon), we got a Cy Young guy (Pedro
Martinez), don't we? We've got it all.''
</P>
<P>
   And more champagne dripped through the cigar smoke.

 By JONATHAN FEIGEN  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
Get enough mail, and you begin to recognize signs of trouble.
Before long, you can see anger in an address.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Return addresses identifying militant-sounding groups from
post-office boxes are a good clue to what is inside the envelope.
Crayons are not a good sign.
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska senior center Josh Heskew, a veteran of all sorts of
mail, should have recognized the clue on the envelope.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should have known,'' he said, ``when it comes addressed to
Mrs. Josh Heskew.''
</P>
<P>
   Heskew is not married, but the letter, if it could be called
that, was meant for him. And like most well-thought-out,
constructive criticism of its kind, it contained no return address,
no signature.
</P>
<P>
   Scribbled on a scrap of paper, the letter read: ``How does it
feel to be the captain of the worst offensive line in America?''
</P>
<P>
   It included a prediction that Washington would stomp Nebraska on
Saturday. Heskew laughed and tacked it to the wall outside the
Nebraska locker room.
</P>
<P>
   But as ready as college football players are to accept
motivation wherever it can be found, his teammates needed no such
reminder of the strange attitude that has developed about the
Nebraska Cornhuskers.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a remarkable run of injuries, Nebraska is 3-0, is ranked
No. 2 in both polls and has outscored opponents by an average of
26.6 points per game.
</P>
<P>
   But most conversation about the defending national co-champion
centers on what is wrong. The running game has been without its
usual swagger and taste for the jugular. The defensive line rarely
has punished quarterbacks. And discussions about pass coverage are
not appropriate in mixed company.
</P>
<P>
   The more understanding observers allow only that the game
against respected Washington will provide Nebraska with a chance to
show if it has solved its many problems.
</P>
<P>
   The Cornhuskers, while aware of the opinions, contend they are
on schedule. And Nebraska's schedule usually leads to a bowl with
the national championship at stake.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel tremendous about where we're at, and I hope our players
feel good about it. I think they do,'' Nebraska coach Frank Solich
said. ``Sometimes when you don't win in terms of big numbers like
maybe the public wants or expects or the media want or expect, or
you yourself want or expect, it could be looked at as discouraging.
But it should not be for our ballclub. I think we've come through a
lot in these first three games.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of teams out there, as you saw from the past
weekend or the weekend before, that are outstanding football teams
that couldn't get it done. It can happen to anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't happen to Nebraska as the Cornhuskers posted wins of
56-27 over Louisiana Tech, 38-7 over Alabama-Birmingham and 24-3
over California, despite injuries that forced the Cornhuskers to
start a different quarterback in each, to play without their best
rusher and with their top pass rusher limping at half-speed.
</P>
<P>
   Starting quarterback Bobby Newcombe is scheduled to return
Saturday. Tailback DeAngelo Evans is considered at 100 percent and
will play for the first time since 1996. Defensive end Mike
Rucker's groin injury is almost healed. Starting defensive tackle
Jason Wiltz and cornerback Erwin Swiney also returned to practice
this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does strike me; it seems like you'd think about more
positive things than the negative,'' Heskew said. ``It sounds like
we haven't been playing well. I don't know whether people take it
for granted, but maybe we have spoiled our fans. They expect us to
score 50 to 60 points every game.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, they expect more, and the demands are specific.
Nebraska must win to form, with a dominating, merciless running
game and a punishing pass rush. The rest, as long as Nebraska wins
by embarrassingly large margins, are details.
</P>
<P>
   But through three games, Nebraska averages 259.7 yards rushing
per game, good for third in the nation but far off last season's
daily pace of 392.6 yards. The Cornhuskers averaged 513.7 yards of
total offense, the most in the nation. This season they rank 18th,
averaging 446.7.
</P>
<P>
   And after ranking fifth last season in total defense, allowing
257.3 yards per game, the Cornhuskers now rank 62nd, allowing 338.3
yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were disappointed after the (1996) season and came out the
next year with a lot of confidence,'' senior fullback Joel
Makovicka said. ``We knew we could play well and play with anybody.
This year, we need to get that confidence. You build confidence as
you play and play well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have potential to be a really good football team. As a
senior class, it's been a great ride, and now it's our time to keep
it going. We don't want to go out as a senior class and not play up
to our abilities. We've been spoiled and played well, so well our
fans are spoiled too.''
</P>
<P>
   And if the Cornhuskers are considered off recent form, solutions
seem at hand. Wingback Lance Brown is the only injured starter not
expected back in the lineup Saturday. Solich said Newcombe, who was
sensational in his one outing as Scott Frost's successor, was a
natural at the option from his first day on campus. And Solich, who
is usually as cautious in his comments as was Tom Osborne, his
mentor as Cornhuskers coach for the previous 25 seasons, raves
about Evans.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got great quickness,'' Solich said. ``He's got great
acceleration off of his cuts. He gives us a back that can make a
big play, that can make a 60-, 70-, 80-yard run. He's done that in
games. He's done that in scrimmages. He's a tremendously confident
back. He can make you miss. When something is not there, he can
make something out of it. You don't see a lot of those backs
around. We have one.''
</P>
<P>
   And against California two weeks ago, Nebraska's defense seemed
to improve as much as the return of Evans and Newcombe could
bolster the offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was some questions by some people about where we were
defensively, but we played a total defensive game, playing the pass
well, getting a rush on the quarterback and stopping their running
game,'' Solich said. ``It was a great game for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike last season, the Cornhuskers do not need to make up
ground in the polls. And Solich will point to the other champions
of the past two seasons _ Florida, Michigan _ that have lost while
the Cornhuskers roll on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pleased. We're 3-0; we've done some very good things,''
Solich said. `` I'm not concerned about this football team. If you
would have told me when I first got named as the head coach at the
University of Nebraska we would now be 3-0, I'd have felt great,
and I do.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can continue to improve _ and we have ability, we have
talent _ we can be an excellent football team. I think we're on
track.''
</P>
<P>
   But keep those cards and letters coming.

 By ALAN TRUEX  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
NEW YORK _ By winning three of four games in the Astrodome last
week _ all in dramatic, late-comeback fashion _ the New York Mets
captured the hearts of America's largest city.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But these are not necessarily kind hearts. New Yorkers can be
almost schizophrenic in the way their mood swings from euphoric to
homicidal.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets were booed Wednesday by a crowd of 29,728 as they
trudged off the Shea Stadium field after losing their second
consecutive game to the Montreal Expos, the third-worst team in the
National League.
</P>
<P>
   The reaction was hardly surprising. When John Franco, a native
New Yorker, blew a two-run lead in the ninth inning in a loss to
Florida a week ago, he was assailed with obscene chanting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what some people are thinking when they come to
the ballpark _ or if they're thinking at all,'' Mets manager Bobby
Valentine said.
</P>
<P>
   Franco, a 14-year veteran who, like Valentine, has never made a
postseason appearance, called the Houston expedition ``the best
single series I've ever been involved in.''
</P>
<P>
   It was especially meaningful to the Mets, because if they win
the wild-card race to get into the playoffs, they will play the
Astros in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Mets, tied with the equally self-destructive Chicago
Cubs in the wild-card shuffle, depart their not-so-comforting home
and hope for the sort of results they got on their last excursion.
</P>
<P>
   This time the destination is Atlanta, where the Mets play their
final three scheduled games against a team that has won its seventh
consecutive division title. The Cubs, McRaemeanwhile, head to
Houston, where they open a three-game series tonight in the
Astrodome.
</P>
<P>
   Expos manager Felipe Alou predicted the Cubs ``won't win another
game'' after defensive substitute Brant Brown swatted a fly he
should have caught and caused a victory to slip away Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``You lose a 7-0 lead, and you have to take a four-hour plane
ride to Houston,'' Alou mused. ``Everybody's celebrating two home
runs by (Sammy) Sosa, and suddenly you get beat. It takes two weeks
to recuperate. And they don't have two weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Mets have some recuperating of their own to do, thanks
to Alou's youthful spoilers.
</P>
<P>
   Mets center fielder Brian McRae said the Expos were extra
motivated because of ill feelings toward Valentine, who is often
called ``the most disliked manager in baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Their coaches don't like Bobby,'' McRae said. ``It gives them
added incentive for them to beat us.''
</P>
<P>
   Alou emphatically disputed that, but Valentine suggested
animosities might be connected to the Mets' little-used and
disgruntled reliever, Mel Rojas, a former Expo and a nephew of
Alou.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of Dominicans on that team (the Expos) that
talk to Mel,'' Valentine noted.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever their motivation, the Expos beat the Mets eight of 12
games this season.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it's up to the Mets to regain the opportunism that was so
apparent in Houston. They lead the league with 35 one-run
victories. But their lineup lacks punch aside from Mike Piazza and
John Olerud, and the pitching is suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Although Al Leiter, Rick Reed and Armando Reynoso are a combined
39-17, only Leiter has pitched well recently.
</P>
<P>
   Reed, who starts tonight against rookie Bruce Chen, has allowed
15 home runs in his last eight starts. But he claims he has found
the problem: His follow-through off the mound was occurring too
soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``My arm wasn't catching up, so I was elevating my pitches,'' he
explained. ``My side work (Tuesday) was unbelievable. I think I've
got it figured out.''
</P>
<P>
   Leiter is scheduled to pitch Saturday (against Tom Glavine),
with Reynoso probable for Sunday (vs. Greg Maddux).
</P>
<P>
   If the starters falter, Valentine can always call on Turk
Wendell. A quirky righthander known for throwing the resin bag
almost as hard as he throws his pitches, Wendell has pitched in a
club-record nine consecutive games, aided by two days off and a
cortisone shot to relieve arm soreness.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if he was concerned about damaging his arm, Wendell
shrugged and said, ``They can rebuild it in the offseason.''
</P>
<P>
   It's an offseason the Mets are having trouble postponing, while
the buzz here continues over a possible intracity World Series.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees are dominating the American League while the Mets
try to replicate Florida's wild-card ride of last October that
ended in a World Series championship.
</P>
<P>
   If the Mets and Cubs finish the regular season in a two-way tie,
the teams will meet at Shea for a Monday winner-take-wild card.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't be surprised,'' Piazza said, ``if this comes down
to a one-game playoff after all.''

VAUGHN, GARCIAPARRA: DIFFERENT STROKES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE BURRIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Mo Vaughn and Nomar Garciaparra were the first Red Sox
to take the field in the top of the ninth inning, joining ace
reliever Tom Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   That was at 10:06 p.m. Eight minutes later, after Gordon blew a
pitch by Baltimore's Roberto Alomar for the final out, Vaughn went
to the mound, embraced third baseman John Valentin, and joined in
the celebration. Garciaparra stood at second base alone, and
eventually, his teammates formed a line behind him and exchanged
congratulatory handshakes.
</P>
<P>
   The two are a contrast in styles. Vaughn is a vocal leader whose
bat speaks as loudly as his words. Garciaparra is a player whose
power and presence far outweigh his oratory. Thursday night both
asserted themselves in their own way, guiding the Red Sox to their
third postseason berth this decade.
</P>
<P>
   Both players went 3 for 5 in the 9-6 victory over the Orioles
that clinched the American League wild-card playoff berth.
Garciaparra belted two home runs, his 34th and 35th, and drove in
three runs. Vaughn collected his 200th hit of the season, scored a
run, nudged ahead of the Yankees' Bernie Williams for the AL
batting lead, and registered eight putouts at first base. He also
went to the mound to offer advice to Pedro Martinez in the fourth
inning after the starter gave up a home run.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, in their own way, they savored the accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   Both Vaughn and Garciaparra were late arrivals in the Red Sox
clubhouse. Their teammates, already pouring bottles of champagne,
awaited them. Garciaparra was doused as soon as he entered.
</P>
<P>
   After growing weary of waiting for Vaughn, several players went
out to the field to retrieve him. The slugger entered the locker
room trying unsuccessfully to outrun pitcher Jim Corsi, who was
pouring champagne over his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming out of here, everyone had us picked for fourth place.
But April is when it started, with all those comeback wins,'' said
Vaughn, who added that this postseason clincher is better than
1995's, when the Sox won the AL East. ``I think the concept of this
team is what it's all about. We have guys interchanging in the
outfield, guys who got hurt and came back.''
</P>
<P>
   The slugger spoke nonstop for about 20 minutes to reporters,
making certain he mentioned the efforts of various teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``First and foremost, we've had some of the best pitchers in the
league, guys who have had double-figure wins,'' said Vaughn.
``We've had guys who have swung the bat well. We played some sharp
defense. But the main thing is we never got down. This team is
built on character. This team stuck together as a ball club, and
you need to do that. We have no individuals on this team.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Garciapparra, initially, he was nowhere to be found.
Finally, he emerged for comment but seemed impatient throughout,
like someone who had just been told he inadvertently double-parked
in front of a police station.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a small step, and we understand that,'' he said. ``I
think we were the only guys who believed in ourselves. So we'll
take it, enjoy it, as well as we should. It's a long season, and
when you go through what we've been through, the bump and grind, we
enjoy it. But we know it's a long season and there's still the
postseason to play.''

<P>
   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
THE story was told so often, sometimes it seems as if I was sitting
alongside my father and his friends on that remarkable day, leaning
against crates, watching the radio, cherishing a moment.
</P>
<P>
   It was Oct. 8, 1956. In a dank warehouse on the south side of
San Antonio, deep among the blue-collars and thousands of miles
from New York, a handful of men were putting in an extra shift at
the plant. They were busting calluses as they moved crates of
machinery onto a truck, trying to meet a deadline. A co-worker
rushed into the warehouse carrying a radio, shouting, ``You're not
going to believe what's happening in the Series.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' Don Larsen had pitched seven innings of perfect
baseball in a World Series game against the Brooklyn Dodgers. Like
everywhere else across the country, everything stopped. Crates
slammed to the ground. The men pulled off their work gloves,
gathered around the radio, sat on boxes and agonized over every
pitch they heard called on the scratchy portable. Finally, Larsen
sent 27 men down in a row, pitching perfection and carving his
place in baseball history.
</P>
<P>
   We all have such stories. We all remember where we were, what we
were doing, what it was like to witness _ even via the airwaves _
something special in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Until October 1969, I always believed Sister Mary Ambrose at St.
Ann's School knew nothing and cared nothing about baseball. The
only lumber she ever swung was a yardstick across the backs of my
knees. I wasn't even sure she had a heart, that she could feel such
things as the anxiety and anticipation of a dramatic baseball
moment.
</P>
<P>
   But there she was on that October day, announcing to the
third-grade class the lesson for the day was about courage. She
then wheeled in a TV, and we watched the black-and-white images of
the Miracle Mets defeating the Baltimore Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   Pick a moment, any moment, and you probably remember the
lingering taste the moment left: Larsen's perfect game, Roger Maris
slamming his 61st, Bob Gibson pitching his third World Series
complete game, the Miracle Mets, the colorful A's, Carlton Fisk's
legendary homer, the Big Red Machine, Bucky Dent's drama, Reggie
slamming three in a single World Series game. There's just
something special about something special in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why this weekend and the upcoming playoffs have all the
markings of days we will rehash years from now. We'll spin stories
to our children about where we were, what we were doing, when Sammy
Sosa and Mark McGwire engaged in the greatest home-run drama the
game has known.
</P>
<P>
   We'll talk about the Renaissance Season of 1998, when,
remarkably, going into the final weekend of the year there were 11
of the 30 big-league teams in the playoffs or with a chance to get
there.
</P>
<P>
   We'll talk about how the Giants scratched back into the
three-team NL wild-card race, as the Cubs took on the powerful
Astros and the Mets challenged the great Braves for the final berth
on the season's final weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the fondest memories this game and this city will have
figure to be happening right now. No longer will the best Astros
days only have to do with aging video of Mike Scott wrapping up the
division title with a no-hitter in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   We'll shake our heads in amazement at how this final Astros home
series of 1998 was as much a playoff scene as the playoffs
themselves, with Sosa swinging mightily not just to edge McGwire
but to lift his team into the playoffs and lift the spirits of his
hurricane-ravaged Dominican Republic homeland.
</P>
<P>
   We'll remember the Astros' 100-win season and perhaps the day
Shane Reynolds won his 20th for a staff on which he is overshadowed
by Randy Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   We'll wonder how long it will be before someone else posts a
50-50 season of doubles and stolen bases the way Craig Biggio did
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   We might remember how Brant Brown's game-losing play in
Milwaukee two days before this season-ending series foreshadowed
the Cubs' demise.
</P>
<P>
   But maybe we'll recall how Cubs pitcher Kerry Wood ended his
rookie season with a playoff berth on the line. Maybe somewhere in
town, someone will walk into a warehouse Saturday and announce,
``You're not going to believe what Kerry Wood is doing to the
Astros.''
</P>
<P>
   This has been a riveting season, so why not expect a fitting
conclusion? This has been a season we haven't been able to keep our
eyes off of, from the Yankees' flirtation with the all-time wins
record, to Sosa and McGwire, to Wood, Johnson, Roger Clemens, Cal
Ripken, the wild races, the fading Anaheim Angels and the surging
Astros.
</P>
<P>
   You get the feeling the baseball stories we will tell years from
now are happening now. Where will you be this weekend? Where will
you be this October?

RANGERS CLINCH TIE FOR WEST TITLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Things sometimes seem pretty serene in Ken Griffey
Jr.'s corner of the Mariners clubhouse. The leather recliner, the
video game cartridges and the general affability of its most
prominent resident all give evidence of that.
</P>
<P>
   But Griffey turned defiant for a moment before Thursday's game
against the Texas Rangers. The subject: the possibility that with a
Rangers win and an Anaheim Angels loss Thursday, Texas could
celebrate an American League West pennant on the Kingdome floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hell, yeah, it matters,'' Griffey said. ``Would you want me to
come over to your house and throw a party?''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, if you're a kid and your bedroom is decorated with
Griffey posters, that might sound like a pretty cool idea. But the
point was clear enough: nobody likes to watch someone else's
celebration, especially when it's on your turf.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers made a clinching possible by storming through
Anaheim with three straight wins over the Angels, who had led the
division for much of the season. Their momentum continued Thursday
night, as they pounded Mac Suzuki and beat the M's, 9-3, before
22,891 fans.
</P>
<P>
   But the Angels also won, beating the Oakland Athletics, 10-6 in
Oakland, meaning the most the Rangers clinched Thursday night was a
tie for the division title. Texas can secure its second division
title in the past three seasons with a win or an Angels loss
tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``To go into Anaheim and play the way we did the whole series
and to continue that here just shows what type of team we are,''
said shortstop Royce Clayton, who had three of the Rangers' 15
hits. ``We didn't get down at any point, and we kept our focus and
played solid baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers scored three times in both the second and third off
Suzuki, who lasted only 21/3 innings in his last _ and shortest _
start of the year. The 23-year-old right-hander allowed six runs
(five earned) on seven hits and four walks.
</P>
<P>
   Suzuki (1-2) worked into the seventh inning in starts against
Boston and Minnesota this month, but was coming off a four-inning
outing at Anaheim Saturday. In all, he worked 222/3 innings in his
five starts, allowing 17 earned runs for a 6.20 earned-run average.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suzuki didn't throw the ball well (tonight),'' said manager
Lou Piniella. ``He couldn't hit his spots with his fastball, and
his split-finger was up, plus he was behind in the count. He didn't
really have a good outing at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this is a learning experience. I'm not disappointed in
him. We'd like to see these kids pitch well, but we have to be
realistic and patient.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, Suzuki escaped a shaky first by getting Will
Clark to fly to center to strand two runners, both of whom had
walked. After two quick outs in the second inning, Todd Zeile lined
a double just inside the foul line in left field. Clayton's single
tied the score at 1-1, and a triple, walk and RBI single increased
the Rangers' lead to 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   Clark led off the third with a double, and Lee Stevens' one-out
triple scored him. Then Zeile walked and a Clayton single scored
Stevens, driving Suzuki from the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was feeling different; not the same as Boston and the
Twins,'' Suzuki said. ``I don't know why, but I will find out
tomorrow. That's not me. I didn't throw strikes. I was behind in
the count, everything was up.''
</P>
<P>
   The first batter reliever Paul Spoljaric faced, Tom Goodwin,
bounced to second baseman David Bell. Bell fielded it near the bag
and reached behind himself to tag Clayton, then fired a one-hopper
to first, where David Segui scooped it for what looked like an
inning-ending double play.
</P>
<P>
   Problem was, umpires ruled Bell had missed Clayton and that his
throw arrived too late to catch the speedy Goodwin. Runners were
safe all around, and Zeile scored the Rangers' sixth run one batter
later. After Mark McLemore popped to first base for the second out,
catcher Dan Wilson mishandled Segui's three-hop throw to the plate,
scoring Zeile.

HOUSE OKS MORE VISAS FOR SKILLED WORKERS 
</HEADLINE>
   By LOUIS FREEDBERG  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
    WASHINGTON _ After months of delays, the House easily passed a
bill Thursday expanding the number of temporary visas issued to
foreign workers, a measure designed to help Silicon Valley firms
who say they can't find Americans to fill many skilled positions.
<TEXT>
<P>
   California lawmakers as well as industry representatives hailed
the 283-to-133 vote for the bill, which benefited from overwhelming
Republican support. The legislation was worked out as part of a
compromise with the White House, and is expected to pass easily in
the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall, it is a temporary solution to what is hopefully a
short-term problem,'' said Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif. ``In the
long run, America must make a long-term investment in our nation's
children so that our high-tech industries are not dependent on
foreign workers.''
</P>
<P>
   Until now, the federal government has issued 65,000 temporary
``H1-B'' visas each year, which allow workers to stay in the
country for up to six years. But this year, the supply of visas was
exhausted by May, four months before the end of the fiscal year on
September 30.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new bill, the cap would be raised to 115,000 for each
of the next two years, and to 107,500 in 2001. After that, the cap
would revert to 65,000.
</P>
<P>
   The White House threatened to veto earlier versions of the bill.
Administration officials argued that the temporary visa program was
rife with abuse and insisted on stronger protections for American
workers.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation had been stalled mainly because of disagreements
about whether high-tech companies should be required to ``attest''
to the fact that they had tried to find American workers before
hiring a foreign one, and to pledge that they would not lay off
American workers in order to hire lower paid foreign workers.
</P>
<P>
   The bill approved Thursday was the result of a compromise
reached over the past few weeks between the White House and
Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill. At the same time, the
White House had to satisfy two competing constituencies to which it
has built close ties: labor unions and the high-tech industry.
</P>
<P>
   Under the compromise, only companies whose labor force is made
up of 15 percent or more temporary foreign workers will have to
declare to the Labor Department that they had sought Americans
before hiring a foreign worker. The compromise bill would also
require employers to pay $500 for each temporary foreign worker
they hire into a fund that would provide 10,000 scholarships and
job training. The fees are expected to generate between $75 million
and $100 million annually.
</P>
<P>
   ``The agreement will dramatically help California's high-tech
industry, which has been hurt by the lack of qualified skilled
workers available for employment,'' said Rep. Ellen Tauscher,
D-Calif., a strong supporter of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the compromise bill would grant the U.S. Labor
Department additional powers to to make spot checks of companies
suspected of abusing the law. Until now, the federal government
could only investigate a firm if a formal complaint had been filed
against it.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the lopsided vote, there was spirited opposition to the
bill from an unusual alliance of liberal Democrats and conservative
Republicans, who questioned why high-tech firms needed foreign
workers when many have laid off thousands of Americans over the
past year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is all about a powerful business lobby that is trying to
ensure a supply of cheap labor,'' said Rep. Dana Rohrabacher,
R-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Even Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, the chair of the House
subcommittee on immigration who helped broker the compromise, said
he is not altogether convinced there is a shortage of qualified
American workers. ``The evidence is inconclusive, but I believe we
should give industry the benefit of the doubt and grant these
additional visas,'' he said.

SILICON VALLEY SUBDUED AT CLINTION VISIT 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARK SIMON and CARLA MARINUCCI  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ President Clinton returns for Democratic fund
raising in Silicon Valley Friday amid signs that the wealth of
support he once enjoyed from high-tech executives has been eroded
by the White House sex scandal.
</P>
<P>
   While first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton is the star at a
sold-out $250-a-head fund-raiser for incumbent U.S. Sen. Barbara
Boxer in San Francisco Friday night, sources in Silicon Valley say
it has been more of a struggle to sell tickets to the president's
exclusive events to the high-tech donors who once clamored to
participate in them.
</P>
<P>
   The contrast between the two Clinton fund-raisers underscores
the deepening effects of the scandal in the nation's most populous
state, where the president has enjoyed widespread support.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's $25,000-per-couple fund-raising reception
Friday night at the Tech Museum in San Jose _ one of dozens of
high-priced fund-raisers he has attended in California _ has put
the loyalty of a group of big money high-tech supporters to the
test.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great opportunity to show they're not just fair-weather
friends, despite the fact that they're uniformly horrified by his
behavior,'' said Reed Hastings, president of Technology Network,
the bipartisan political action committee under whose banner
tonight's fund-raiser is being held.
</P>
<P>
   The event, scheduled months ago, is co-chaired by John Doerr,
TechNet co-founder and a leading Clinton loyalist since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Sources close to the event say Doerr has been scrambling to find
people who will pay to attend the gathering, in some cases
extending no-cost invitations to assure a good crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Doerr referred all inquiries to Wade Randlett, TechNet's
Democratic director, who said the rumors are untrue.
</P>
<P>
   The event will draw a good crowd, including key figures who
supported Clinton in the past, said Randlett.
</P>
<P>
   But Randlett said there will be some nonpaying guests who are
taking the places of people who sent checks but are unable to
attend.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just had a lot of folks who wanted to be supportive of the
president but couldn't make it,'' Randlett said.
</P>
<P>
   Another party insider suggested that many high-tech leaders _
who have repeatedly dug into their pockets for Clinton events _ are
simply holding off this time because ``they're getting tapped
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Randlett said the event will raise more than he expected _
although final figures are not in _ and added that interest has
grown since the release of the president's videotaped grand jury
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``My present sense right now is that we've really turned the
corner,'' Randlett said.
</P>
<P>
   Backers of the event have been pitching it as a show of support
for a president whose policies have been in virtual lock-step with
the industry agenda.
</P>
<P>
   They point out that Clinton's visit comes on the heels of a
critical agreement Wednesday by the White House and congressional
leaders on legislation doubling the number of foreign workers who
can enter the United States on special visas to fill
high-technology jobs for the next three years. Silicon Valley
industry leaders have long lobbied for an increase in the so-called
H-1B visas, saying they cannot find qualified workers to do
high-level technology work, but their position has been bitterly
opposed by some labor leaders.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the Clinton administration _ which had indicated it
might veto such legislation _ said a compromise was reached by
providing funding for retraining programs for American workers. The
retraining, costing millions of dollars, would be paid for by fees
from foreign workers who get the special visas to work here. The
lifting of the visa cap was welcomed as a bipartisan agreement that
will help fill the industry's needs until enough skilled workers
are available.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the high-tech leaders who lobbied Clinton on that issue
are also keenly aware that the president will leave San Jose and go
to another exclusive dinner in Los Angeles tomorrow hosted by
attorney Bill Lerach, the leading advocate of shareholder lawsuits
and industry executives' foremost bogeyman.
</P>
<P>
   Lerach was the principal backer in 1996 of Proposition 211, a
statewide ballot measure that would have made it easier to file
shareholder lawsuits. Industry executives regarded the proposal as
a frontal assault, and they roused themselves into a fit of
political activism that continues today.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, for the past two years Clinton and industry executives
have enjoyed a fine romance, including a high-profile endorsement
of the president's re-election in 1996, followed by a private
dinner with $50,000 donors a month later and a big
$50,000-per-person event a year ago at the home of CNET chairman
Halsey Minor.
</P>
<P>
   But in contrast to the unbridled enthusiasm that greeted Clinton
on many past visits to Silicon Valley, this time the approach
appears more subdued.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still support him,'' said John Dean, the chief executive
officer of Silicon Valley Bank who endorsed Clinton in 1996.
``Obviously, I don't support what he did, and I think you can
differentiate between the two.''
</P>
<P>
   John Gage, chief scientist for Sun Microsystems and a co-founder
of Clinton's much-heralded Net Day, said, ``I still support Clinton
and I would vote for him again. It's just very sad. If you look at
everything he's done and everything that's happened in terms of
policy, in terms of the American economy . . . I absolutely support
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very disappointed in him for the way he's behaved. My wife
will never forgive him,'' Gage said.
</P>
<P>
   Regis McKenna, a high-tech strategy consultant and one of
Silicon Valley's staunchest Democrats, said he does not plan to
attend the dinner and has tried to distance himself from all the
recent controversy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been very good about not reading, hearing or talking
about anything having to do with this,'' McKenna said. ``I'm still
a Democrat. I'm a faithful Democrat. I believe in their principles.
But I'm not going to comment on (the scandal).''
</P>
<P>
   But Harry J. Saal, founder of Network General (now Network
Associates) and another active Democrat, said he will be at
tonight's event, eagerly showing support for the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am supporting him and I guess even more so, given the way
this problem is being handled. . . . I certainly can't defend
everything the president has done, but I am certainly outraged by
what so many other public officials are doing under some banner of
justice and morality,'' said Saal, who also chairs the charitable
nonprofit Silicon Valley Community Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very comfortable going to an event that is going to
support the candidacy of many Democrats,'' Saal said. ``I'll
partition my mind to focus on the positive outcome and not view
this purely as a vote for or against the president.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton visit is not expected without controversy. Already,
some conservative radio stations are calling for armies of
protesters to greet Mrs. Clinton outside the Boxer fund-raiser at
the Hilton Hotel Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who will continue on to San Diego as well as Los
Angeles for more Democratic Party fund-raisers tomorrow, is also
expected to be the focus of protests.

WINE SEEMS TO CUT CANCER RISK 
</HEADLINE>
   By CARL T. HALL  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Wine drinkers seem to run a lower risk of
developing certain types of cancer than people who drink beer and
hard liquor.
</P>
<P>
   Research published in this week's British Medical Journal, based
on detailed health studies of 28,180 adults in Denmark, suggests
that the type of alcoholic beverage you drink makes a big
difference in your odds of developing cancer of the upper digestive
tract.
</P>
<P>
   The study authors, led by Morton Gronbaek of the Copenhagen
Center for Prospective Studies, concluded that wine may contain
protective compounds that cancel out the well-known cancer-causing
effects of alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   Other studies have identified a plant substance called
resveratrol, found in grapes and fresh grape skins. Red wine has
been found to contain more resveratrol than white or rose
varieties.
</P>
<P>
   Another explanation may be that wine may not contain
cancer-causing substances that are present in the other beverages.
The British journal included an editorial note discussing one
possible example _ DNA-damaging substances called nitrosamines,
which are found in beer and distilled spirits but not in any
significant amounts in wine.
</P>
<P>
   Until more is known, researchers stopped short of recommending
alcohol, in any form, for cancer prevention, suggesting that whole
grapes or juice might be your best bet. Besides the well-known
hazards of heavy drinking, there is also a danger that some types
of malignancies, such as breast cancer, may increase in frequency
with exposure to alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   The Denmark study released Thursday confirmed previous research
showing the carcinogenic effects of alcohol generally. Heavy
drinkers, in fact, ran a 12-fold increase in the risk of cancer of
the upper digestive tract compared with abstainers _ making alcohol
a worse carcinogen than smoking.
</P>
<P>
   But the amount of wine consumed made a major difference, the
research showed. Among the moderate drinkers, those who took at
least 30 percent of their alcohol in the form of wine were even a
bit less at risk than nondrinkers for the type of cancer included
in the study.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers took into account such factors as age, sex,
educational level and tobacco use. Although alcohol is no health
tonic, they found that a little wine may not be all bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``A moderate intake of wine probably does not increase the risk
of upper digestive tract cancer, whereas a moderate intake of beer
or spirits increases the risk considerably,'' they concluded.

 KOHL'S BIG MISTAKE MAY COST HIM POWER   c Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BERNARD D. KAPLAN  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Helmut Kohl's 16 years as Germany's head of government
may be ended Sunday by a major error he committed nearly a decade
ago at the time of his country's re-unification following the
collapse of communism.
</P>
<P>
   His decision to exchange the virtually worthless communist
currency known as the east mark on equal terms with West Germany's
strong deutsche mark was a bid to cement the previously divided
country and make himself a popular hero to the economically
strapped residents of what used to be East Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The move, which was taken against the advice of nearly all
financial experts, turned out to be an economic disaster that still
haunts him and his party, the Christian Democratic Union.
</P>
<P>
   With prices of its goods and services suddenly pegged to the
D-mark, former communist East Germany's outmoded industry found it
impossible to compete even in its old markets in the ex-Soviet
Union and its satellites. Unemployment soared to as much as 30
percent and hundreds of factories shut down almost overnight.
</P>
<P>
   East Germans' enmity toward their western brethren and
especially the Kohl government deepened into something close to
outright hatred. In some ways, as one Bonn commentator noted,
differences between the two halves of the newly unified country
seemed greater or at least more bitter than in communist times. The
``essies'' as they came to be called felt themselves ill-used and
treated with contempt.
</P>
<P>
   Conditions have since somewhat improved. Joblessness in former
East Germany is down to 18 percent _ still more than twice the
figure in the west of the nation _ and foreign investment is at
long last trickling in. But there is still a long way to go.
Disillusionment with Kohl appears almost certain to deprive his CDU
party of enough votes in the east to form a new government.
</P>
<P>
   The best that the long-time chancellor may be able to hope for
is a so-called grand coalition with his main rivals, the Social
Democrats. who currently hold a small edge in the polls. If that
happens, a humiliated Kohl would almost certainly have to step
aside.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the east's former communists. now known as the Party
of Democratic Socialism, smell the scent of revenge. The latest
polls suggest the ex-communists could win enough parliamentary
seats to prevent the main parties from forming a government except
on their terms.
</P>
<P>
   That could mean political paralysis in Bonn. But for easterners,
it would above all be a demonstration that they also possess power
that has been dismissed for too long as insignificant.

A FINE MESS!
</HEADLINE>
  By BRUCE GOTTLIEB 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some people are looking for a way to punish President Clinton
that's tougher than censure but not as tough as impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   On ABC's ``This Week,'' former Clintonite George Stephanopoulos
proposed a fine--Clinton should reimburse the government for the
cost of the Lewinsky portion of Starr's investigation (the part for
which his dissembling was responsible).
</P>
<P>
   Is this suggestion serious? Is it kosher?
</P>
<P>
   Stephanopoulos certainly meant to be serious and subsequent
articles from the New York Times, Baltimore Sun, and the Associated
Press treated his proposal respectfully. A financial penalty might
assuage outraged voters in a way that Clinton's many apologies have
not.
</P>
<P>
   There is precedent. In 1997 Congress fined Newt Gingrich
$300,000 as punishment for lying about ethics violations. Speaker
Gingrich agreed to accept a loan from Bob Dole, who was by then
employed by a Washington lobbying firm. Many pundits pronounced
this deal a conflict of interest, even though Dole pledged not to
lobby his well-connected debtor. Coincidentally, on Monday Gingrich
announced he doesn't need Dole's money since the latest Gingrich
book is selling better than expected.
</P>
<P>
   One problem with the fine idea is how Clinton could be expected
to pay it--on top of his lawyers' bills, etc. The fine
Stephanopoulos proposes would be something like $4 million. It's
hard to think of any way the president, or even the ex-president,
could raise that kind of money without controversy and objection
from the very critics the fine is supposed to assuage.
</P>
<P>
   In practice, a fine can only work as part of a plea bargain.
Clinton must agree to it. If Congress attempted to impose a fine
against his will, Clinton could call it a ``bill of attainder.''
That is a law imposing punishment on an individual without trial,
and it is prohibited by the Constitution. But Bill Clinton is the
only person with the legal standing to dispute a fine levied
against Bill Clinton. If he goes along, no one else can object.

THE UNJUST WAR THEORY 
</HEADLINE>
  By WILLIAM SALETAN 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the videotape of his Aug. 17 testimony before the Lewinsky
grand jury, President Clinton finally laid out a moral theory to
explain his evasions.
</P>
<P>
   He believes he is the target of an unjust war, a series of
illegitimate investigations against which he is entitled to defend
himself and others by any technically legal means.
</P>
<P>
   Here is Clinton's moral theory, point by point, as expressed in
his testimony.
</P>
<P>
   _ His initial motives for covering up his relationship with
Monica Lewinsky were personal, not legal. First, he was embarrassed
by his behavior. Second, he was trying to protect his family.
Third, to the extent that he was trying to prevent the affair's
exposure, he thought the threat was posed by journalists, not by
prosecutors. ``I certainly didn't want this to come out, if I could
help it,'' said Clinton, explaining his efforts to help Lewinsky
hide their affair. ``I was embarrassed about it.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The questions Jones' lawyers asked Clinton about Lewinsky were
illegitimate, because the Clinton-Lewinsky relationship wasn't
sexual harassment. ``Even if you look at the facts here in (the)
light most unfavorable to me,'' Clinton argued, ``no one has
suggested that there was any sexual harassment on my part.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Clinton exploited legal technicalities to frustrate the Jones
lawyers and was morally entitled to do so, because their lawsuit
against him had become an unjust political war. ``They knew they
had a lousy case on the facts. And so their strategy, since they
were being funded by my political opponents, was to have this
dragnet of discovery,'' said Clinton. ``They proceeded to cross the
country and try to turn up whatever they could. ... What they
wanted to do and what they did do and what they have done by the
time I showed up here was to find any negative information they
could on me, whether it was true or not. Get it in a deposition,
and then leak it, even though it was illegal to do so. ...(They
tried) to get any person in there, no matter how uninvolved with
Paula Jones, no matter how uninvolved with sexual harassment, so
they could hurt me politically.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton accused the Jones lawyers of a ``gotcha game,'' said
they ``were trying to set me up and trick me,'' and even accused
them of not being ``lawful in their conduct vis-a-vis me.''
Therefore, Clinton argued, ``in the face of their repeated illegal
leaking, it was not my responsibility to volunteer a lot of
information.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The video is an extension of Kenneth Starr's unjust war. This
is Clinton's masterstroke. Knowing the video would be released, he
planted a bomb in the hope it would blow up in Starr's face. Toward
the end of his testimony, he looked at the camera and said,
``There's a videotape being made of this, allegedly because only
one member of the grand jury is absent. This is highly unusual. ...
So I think I am right to answer all the questions about perjury but
not to say things which would be forever in the historic annals of
the United States because of this unprecedented videotape (that)
may be leaked at any time.''

POLITICIANS AND PRIVACY: A DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>
  By MICHAEL KINSLEY and THOMAS NAGEL 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   From: MICHAEL KINSLEY
</P>
<P>
   To: Thomas Nagel
</P>
<P>
   Dear Professor Nagel,
</P>
<P>
   I have been arguing about this (with myself, among others) for
two decades. My argument has been that the private lives of
politicians are often fair game for three reasons:
</P>
<P>
   First, hypocrisy. Politicians don't really attempt to keep their
private lives private. They don't say: ``Stay away from my wife.
Don't take pictures of me playing with my kids or talking to the
minister on my way out of church. My private life is nobody else's
business.'' They do not insist on the importance of maintaining
separate public and private spheres, as you do in your article.
Instead, they present an image of their private lives that may or
may not be accurate. If it is not accurate, they are in essence
lying to the voters. And if they'll lie about one thing, they'll
lie about others--which is something voters are entitled to know.
</P>
<P>
   Second, exploitation. The typical ``politician's private life''
story involves a married male politician carrying on with a much
younger woman in a relationship that basically trades use of her
body for a brief sharing of his aura of power or glamour. Even if
the particular woman involved is perfectly satisfied with the
bargain--even if both women, the wife included, are satisfied with
their bargains--this behavior suggests that the politician has a
crass (are we still allowed to say ``unliberated''?) view of women.
And more: It suggests by implication an exploitative attitude
toward people in general.
</P>
<P>
   A willingness to use people like this--and to use your official
position to use people--is also something voters are entitled to
know about.
</P>
<P>
   Third, democracy. Never mind what I think--or even what you
think, professor. The proper test for a journalist trying to decide
whether to publish some information about a politician's private
life is not whether it is politically relevant in his or her own
judgment but whether it is politically relevant in the judgment of
his or her readers. (Not merely interesting--that's too easy--but
politically relevant.)
</P>
<P>
   And my assumption for most of the past two decades has been that
most people do find a politician's adultery a legitimate factor in
casting their votes, even if I and my friends might believe it
doesn't matter. In fact (I have often asserted), people who believe
that this stuff should stay private are motivated more by other
people's interest than by their own indifference. They want to deny
people information because people will use it to reach the wrong
conclusion. And that's anti-democratic.
</P>
<P>
   As for Clinton, let's take my three points one by one. First,
it's too bad that he'll be best remembered for lying about
adultery, since he actually, for a while, came closer than any
national politician ever has to saying, ``I make no great claims
about my private life, so don't call me a hypocrite for failing to
meet my own standards.'' In the '92 campaign, he admitted to a
``flawed'' marriage and, implicitly, to screwing around.
Unfortunately, he also implied the flaws were repaired. (And I
believed him!)
</P>
<P>
   Second, in terms of what a style of sexual activity says about a
person's attitude toward women and people in general, Clinton looks
very bad. It's tempting to say that his exploitative sexual habits
expose his famous human empathy as a complete fraud. But I think
that's too hard: Don't forget, life is complicated. Still, for an
admirer, it's dismaying.
</P>
<P>
   On Point 3, I seem to have got it utterly backward. My notion
was that we media sophisticates and inside-the-Beltway types could
shrug off private sexual indiscretions like adultery, but we had no
right to deny information to the masses of people ``out there'' who
did not shrug it off.
</P>
<P>
   With Flytrap, though, Outside the Beltway is where folks are
shrugging it off, and Inside the Beltway is aflame with righteous
moralism. And I suppose that if most people really don't care about
it, it's no longer elitist and anti-democratic not to tell them
about it.
</P>
<P>
   Over to you.
</P>
<P>
   From: THOMAS NAGEL
</P>
<P>
   To: Michael Kinsley
</P>
<P>
   Dear Michael,
</P>
<P>
   Let me react to your three objections in their strong form,
which you later qualify--since they present an important view.
</P>
<P>
   Hypocrisy: Strictly, this means professing values you do not
hold and denouncing others for conduct that you engage in yourself.
To answer your first question, that kind of hypocrisy deserves
exposure, even if it means publicizing the sex lives of moralistic
evangelists and politicians. Helen Chenoweth got what she deserved.
</P>
<P>
   But you include under hypocrisy something else, which is also a
problem of American politics--the standard presentation of the
candidate as human exemplar and glowing family ideal. I agree with
you that this has provided an opening for media intrusiveness, and
think we would be much better off if politicians never dragged
their families into the limelight. But they are now stuck with the
practice, whether they like it or not, and the public-private
boundary has to be drawn at a different place.
</P>
<P>
   If it is generally recognized that the familial frame in which
politicians are presented is a convention, there is no point in
exposing it, any more than there is a point in exposing the social
conventions of politeness as dishonest. Kennedy was packaged as a
devoted family man. Do you think the public interest would have
been advanced by his sexual exposure?
</P>
<P>
   You suggest a blanket requirement of truthfulness, but anyone
who has been around for a while knows that the unvarnished truth at
full volume is tolerable only in limited doses and that a great
deal is better left unsaid or covered up. Perhaps you wouldn't
trust someone who lied about his sex life. I wouldn't trust someone
who didn't, some of the time.
</P>
<P>
   Exploitation: This is precisely one of those issues that is
forced on us when intimate relations become public, but which there
is no reason to settle publicly. My view is that while people often
behave badly in sexual relations of any kind, as they do in
familial relations, no generalizations about who in such cases is
exploiting or maltreating whom are worth anything.
</P>
<P>
   But the real point is that our different responses to this kind
of story, strongly opposed as they may be, are irrelevant to
political judgment, yet they crowd out what is relevant. Visceral
feelings of either sympathy or outrage with the sexual couplings of
middle-aged statesmen and their breathless groupies are just
personal reactions and will take us nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   Only a pathological communitarianism would insist that we come
together as a society to arrive at a collective conclusion about
the right attitude to such an episode. As with truthfulness, you
suggest that there is a single vice called ``using'' people, which
generalizes across contexts. But people are more complicated than
that, and we already have enough on our plates in trying to
evaluate the public conduct of public figures.
</P>
<P>
   Democracy: As you say, the general public seems in the present
case more sensible than those people who modestly call themselves
the ``elites,'' with respect to the political relevance of sexual
information. But you pose a difficult question about the role of
the press in a different climate. If puritanism is culturally
dominant, should the press still adhere to the convention, one that
serves the interest of all parties, that private embarrassments
will not be aired for political gain? Of course a puritan climate
will help sustain that convention by directly inhibiting the press.
</P>
<P>
   I don't have a theory of the ethics of journalism, but if you
propose to evaluate journalistic practices by their contribution to
democracy, I think there is a good case against giving prominent
and relentless coverage, and against allocating large investigative
resources, to material that is a) irresistibly gripping and
salacious; b) of negligible intrinsic political importance; and c)
likely to drastically reduce the choice of available candidates on
trivial grounds.
</P>
<P>
   The destructive effect on the space of public discourse of the
introduction into it of such material was predictable in advance by
anyone with any imagination at all, but now it has been established
empirically. The effect is out of all proportion to the importance
of the facts even in the estimation of people who think they matter
politically.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinary people understand this, but many journalists have a
professional interest in being blind to it, apparently. At the time
of Gary Hart's exposure, I saw an exchange on television between a
reporter and a woman he stopped in the street. He asked her whether
Hart's adultery would make it impossible for her to vote for him,
and she said yes. He then asked whether she was glad to know about
it, and she said no, she wished she hadn't been told. She was not
being irrational.
</P>
<P>
   My respects,
</P>
<P>

DON'T READ THIS 
</HEADLINE>
  By TIMOTHY NOAH 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   We who think Flytrap encompasses at least a few matters of
genuine public importance are struck by the newsworthiness of a
certain e-mail chain letter making its way around the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The letter, titled ``Reclaiming Our Dignity,'' calls for a
one-day boycott on Oct. 1 of all newspapers, magazines, TV news
programs, and (gasp) ``any of the Internet sites that have
information on the Starr report.''
</P>
<P>
   The boycott is not being ginned up by fringe crackpots. It's the
brainchild of three thirtysomething yuppies who were having dinner
together in Cambridge, Mass. One works for a publisher, one is
studying to be a teacher and one works for a foundation. All three
agreed that they needed some respite from the Lewinsky scandal,
which they felt had engulfed the national conversation.
</P>
<P>
   First they contemplated a national strike. Too radical, they
concluded (``We decided we couldn't get people to stay home from
work.'') Then they talked about a boycott of all consumer products.
But what did Prell Concentrate have to do with Monica Lewinsky? (In
fact, we would add, Monica probably wouldn't be caught dead near
the stuff.) Finally they settled on a one-day media boycott.
</P>
<P>
   ``The investigation of the President has gone too far,'' the
letter begins. Release of ``unnecessarily graphic details of the
President's sexual life, the recent release of the Starr Report
over the Internet and the videotapes of the President's testimony
to the grand jury has eroded our dignity as a country. The efforts
to humiliate the President, humiliate us all. Therefore, please set
aside October 1, 1998 as a day of reflection on our country and the
democratic process.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter asks readers not to buy newspapers or magazines on
that day. ``If you subscribe to a newspaper, tape it to your window
and door, with a large circle and slash, indicating your
displeasure with the level of reporting.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of watching the news, ``take a walk, say hi to your
neighbors, or write a letter to Congress.'' Above all, it says,
``reflect about the type of community you want, the characteristics
of a government that would make you proud to participate, and what
you can do (or not do) to reclaim the dignity of the democratic
process.''
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, we won't be participating, but we go weak in
the knees whenever people start calling for civic virtue. (Mario
Cuomo's speech to the 1984 Democratic convention still sets our
heart aflutter.)

JUICY JOURNALS FOR US DOCTORS 
</HEADLINE>
  By ATUL GAWANDE  
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Forget books and magazines. Turn off the television. Put down
the Starr report. If you really want the lowdown, something that
will tell you almost anything you want to know about people,
medical journals are where the action is.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 alone, the National Library of Medicine added references
to 519,012 new articles from some 3,200 journals to its Medline
database. The fact that all these journals can survive and multiply
should be a clue that there's something compelling about them.
</P>
<P>
   Subscribers are willing to pay dearly to keep their favorite
journals going. Rates run to $3,000 a year or more for some
journals. As a result, while The New Yorker lost millions last
year, the scientific publishing giant Elsevier put out some 1,200
journals and made a whopping 40 percent profit on them.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, for many doctors and scientists, the interest in a
given journal is purely parochial. Even the smallest ones--Elsevier
produces some with fewer than 500 subscribers--can be the prestige
publication for a tiny field. Moreover, behind the glossy covers
and stilted prose, many of these little journals function as the
gossip rags, the People magazines, for the science niches.
</P>
<P>
   Poke around in a few medical journals, and you're bound to find
material as absorbing as anything you'll find in Vanity Fair.
</P>
<P>
   The names alone are worth perusing. Many journals follow the
standard ``Annals of'' or ``Archives of'' or ``Journal of''
approach--you know, like the International Journal of Leprosy. But
the best are the direct, in-your-face journal names: Placenta, Gut,
Brain, Blood. When you pick up Placenta, you know exactly what
you're getting.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, you get the impression that the editors are proud
to give it to you, that they have no second thoughts about the
field they have chosen. Consider, by comparison, Foot and Ankle
International. It's a terrible name. It conveys embarrassment, a
sense that the editors thought ``Foot'' alone wasn't good enough
for them. Even adding ``Ankle'' was still too minor league for
their ambitions, so they had to tack on that ``International.'' You
want a journal more willing to glory in its small, arcane world.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, however, the cool stuff is what's inside, and a few
journals always have the cool stuff. The Journal of Sex and Marital
Therapy is, not surprisingly, reliably fascinating no matter what
your profession. A recent issue I browsed through at the library
(while hiding it in a copy of Science) had such topically relevant
reports as ``Extramarital Affairs'' and ``Penile Erections: Shape,
Angle, and Length.''
</P>
<P>
   A quirkier favorite of mine is the Journal of Emergency
Medicine, which is replete with oddball articles--such as the
recent one from the University of Tennessee on 14 cases occurring
over five weeks in which prisoners reported swallowing razor blades
and other metal objects.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, however, I discovered the journal that never fails
to amaze: the American Journal of Forensic Medicine and Pathology.
A typical issue contained an article on three suicide victims with
multiple gunshot wounds to the head (complete with photos from the
death scenes; one poor guy shot himself five times before he
finally died), another on improved methods to determine the age of
an unidentified victim, and yet a third on the homicide rituals of
the Italian Mafia.
</P>
<P>
   Each of these specialized journals offers an obsessive's-eye
view of the world around us, a new look at the seemingly familiar.
International medical journals, however, can do the opposite. They
tend to share the common language of doctors everywhere and so can
make the unfamiliar reassuringly accessible, while still conveying
a revealing sense of their national Zeitgeist.
</P>
<P>
   I recently picked up the Annals of Saudi Medicine, for example,
and discovered, to my surprise, the telling obsessions of a
modernized country: ulcers, a growing epidemic of obesity, smoking,
heart disease, child abuse. The Indian Journal of Medical Research,
on the other hand, despite all the press reports about India's
burgeoning middle class, is currently filled with reports on
infectious diseases--the scourge of poor nations.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, few people appreciate the refined charms of medical
journals. Occasionally, however, I'll come across a fellow journal
junkie. We'll exchange tips like frat boys do. ``Have you seen the
Journal of Personality and Social Psychology?'' one such friend
asked me not long ago. ``That journal is hot.''
</P>
<P>
   I looked it up at my next opportunity. It did not disappoint.
The first issue I read had a study of 219 subjects who were
instructed to put on a specific facial expression while looking in
the mirror. What the psychologists found was that participants told
to do nothing more than put on a happy face developed a
significantly more positive mood than those told to adopt a neutral
expression. And those made to assume an unhappy expression had the
worst moods of all.
</P>
<P>
   I made a mental note to check that journal out again. And, when
I left the library that evening, you can bet I had a smile on my
face.

KENTUCKY'S QUARTERBACK: BORN FOR THE BIG TIME 
</HEADLINE>
  (gm) 
 By JOE DRAPE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LEXINGTON, Ky. _ There is a gold chain hanging from his neck and
the lore of a mountain hero weighing him down. Folks from the
hollows of Thousand Sticks and Hell For Certain watched him grow up
and throw touchdowns in neighboring Hyden _ at 357 people, a big
place by eastern Kentucky's standards.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Couch is 6 feet 5inches and 225pounds of square-jawed
quarterback with a high and tight haircut and manners honed in
Sunday school. Only the No. 2 _ his now-famous jersey number _ that
hangs and sparkles from that chain shouts Big Time. And why
shouldn't it?
</P>
<P>
   Couch, a junior, is a Heisman Trophy candidate. He is the golden
arm behind the nation's most productive offense. He is also the
most visible ambassador of the Commonwealth of Kentucky's other
sport. Even at Leslie County High School, where he became the most
prolific passer in national prep history, Couch signed autographs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always visualized that I'd be a big-time quarterback leading
a team,'' he said. ``It is what I was born to do.''
</P>
<P>
   How big time both the leader and his team have become will be
measured Saturday when the Wildcats go to Florida Field and take on
the No. 8-ranked Gators. Couch has thrown 133 times this season, 99
of them complete, for 1,171 yards and 13 touchdowns to 9 different
receivers. His Wildcats are 3-0 and ranked in the polls _ No. 25 by
the coaches _ for the first time since 1984.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows how to put a ball in there so they catch them,'' said
Florida Coach Steve Spurrier, the 1966 Heisman winner and an astute
judge of quarterbacks. ``His receivers have few drops.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is a further history between Couch, Spurrier and
Florida that resonates beyond the nationally televised matchup and
the Wildcats' bid for respect. In 1995, the quarterback was named
National High School Player of the Year and was the center of
intense recruiting.
</P>
<P>
   Most thought Couch and Spurrier were a natural fit. Spurrier
grew up in Johnson City, Tenn., was a celebrated high school
quarterback and, as a coach, turned the Gators into one of the most
pass-happy teams in the nation. But the two never warmed to each
other. ``They had a lot of passers they were talking to and I
thought he'd be a lot different,'' Couch said diplomatically.
</P>
<P>
   His father, Elbert, tells it more pointedly. Spurrier never
visited the Couches. Instead he sent the defensive coordinator, Bob
Pruett. ``You got the best quarterback in the nation and you send
your defensive coordinator,'' Elbert Couch said. ``I'm sure it
offended Tim. It offended me.''
</P>
<P>
   But not Tim's mother, Janice Couch. She had painted his room
Kentucky blue in an overt hint about where she wanted him to go.
The then-Kentucky coach, Bill Curry, had won the recruiting battle,
but two years ago at Florida Field he lost the tight-knit Couch
family's good will.
</P>
<P>
   Couch did not have a good day in The Swamp. In his first
collegiate start, he was 6 of 18 for 13 yards with 1 interception.
Worse, No. 2 took a beating about as severe as the 65-0 thrashing.
``I was running the option and I'm not an option quarterback,''
Couch said tersely, which explained why Curry is no longer the
coach.
</P>
<P>
   If Spurrier spurned him and Curry alienated him, Couch found a
soulmate in Hal Mumme, now in his second year as the coach. The
Texas native is an iconoclast. He came to Kentucky from Valdosta
State in Division II, by way of Iowa Wesleyan, and brought some
funny ideas from the coaching sticks.
</P>
<P>
   Every Wildcat practice is open to anyone _ family, alumni,
students and representatives of the news media _ creating a loose
atmosphere reminiscent of an ice-cream social. And Mumme gambles.
Last year, Kentucky was 21 of 38 on fourth downs and the Wildcats
have converted 6 of 8 so far this year _ including a fake punt last
week against Indiana on fourth and 21 when Kentucky was down by 17.
That gamble resulted in a 79-yard touchdown thrown by Mumme's son,
Matt, who is Couch's backup, and keyed a 31-27 comeback victory.
</P>
<P>
   But the reason Couch is breaking records at Kentucky and not at
Tennessee _ where he threatened to transfer after his freshman year
_ is because Mumme brought the Brigham Young University offense to
Bluegrass country, after devloping a friendship with BYU Coach
LaVell Edwards. Its tenets are simple: pass short, pass long.
</P>
<P>
   ``The run is not our first choice, not even the second choice;
it's usually third,'' Mumme said of an offense averaging 572.7
yards a game.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Couch became the trigger man of an air-missile
offense that launched him into the national stratosphere. He threw
for 3,884 yards and 37 touchdowns and led the nation in pass
attempts, completions, yardage and completion percentage. He had a
better day against Florida, completing 33 of 59 for 348 yards and 2
touchdowns, but the first of his 3 interceptions helped spot the
Gators to a 28-0 first-quarter lead, and the Wildcats lost, 55-28.
</P>
<P>
   So, in the Couch home, Tim's return to Florida matters a great
deal. It may be his last time _ although only a junior, he is
expected to enter the National Football League draft next spring
and is projected as a first-round selection. Couch said he has not
decided whether he will return for his senior year, but he did take
out a $3 million insurance policy for the season.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Couch will forget about his season-long goals. How
he wants to lead the Wildcats to a bowl game. How he wants to win
the Heisman. He will focus on beating Spurrier, on erasing the
single lowest moment of his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want people to remember me for more than what happened the
first time,'' Couch said. ``We've got a lot of confidence. We can
win down there.''

TRAJECTORY OF A BRIEF CAREER HINTS AT WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN 
</HEADLINE>
  (gm) 
 By ROBERTA SMITH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The American painter Bob Thompson lived hard and died
young, in 1966, just short of his 29th birthday, after years of
substance abuse. He painted at a fairly brisk pace, too.
</P>
<P>
   The survey of his career at the Whitney Museum of American Art
is densely occupied by bright paintings large and small. They, in
turn, are densely populated by tumbling, frolicking, coupling and
sometimes fighting figures _ men and women, birds, horses, the
occasional satyr or imaginary monster. These paintings often have a
seen-before familiarity; their themes include Depositions,
bacchanals, Nativity scenes, Last Judgments and numerous Greek
myths, portrayed in compositions drawn from Poussin, Piero, Goya
and Titian.
</P>
<P>
   But these figures and the landscapes they occupy are silhouetted
in flat, feverish monochrome colors that provide an indisputably
modern air, as does their frequent tone of ribaldry, satire and
conflicting emotion. Altogether they convey a sense of headlong
momentum, of a smart young man in a hurry, in love with painting
and its history, with the possibilities of contemporary art and
with life itself. (And, judging from the number of female nudes and
their predicaments, he was visited by not altogether pleasant
feelings about women.) The intensity of these works is heightened
by galleries painted bright yellow or red, an iffy tactic that, for
once, makes the art sing.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson was born in 1937 in Louisville, Ky., the only son of a
successful, educated middle-class black family that expected its
children to go to college and into one profession or another. He
arrived in New York from art school in Louisville some time in 1959
by way of a summer in Provincetown, Mass., where he met such
figurative Expressionists as Lester Johnson, Red Grooms, Mimi Gross
and Gandy Brodie and abandoned the precocious Abstract
Expressionist style of his student days.
</P>
<P>
   He also became familiar with the painterly figuration of Jan
Muller, who had died the previous winter. He was so drawn to
Muller's art that he made an imaginary painting of his funeral. And
a piece of Muller's advice, quoted by his widow, Dody, became a
central tenet of Thompson's work: ``Don't ever look for your
solutions among the work of your contemporaries _ look at Old
Masters.'' The seven-year whirlwind career that followed included
critical and financial success and a couple of longish stints in
Europe studying art in the museums of Paris, Rome and Madrid.
</P>
<P>
   Wherever he went, Thompson seems to have made friends and
influenced people. He was magnetic, confident and determined to
succeed. His friend, the painter Emilio Cruz, called him ``a man of
unique, contagious character'' and ``perhaps the only black man I
ever met who was totally intolerant of the notion of inferiority.''
</P>
<P>
   Including more than 100 works dating from 1959 to 1966, this
show brims with a raw talent and unquenchable ambition that are
engaging and irresistible, even if Thompson never quite gained
control of them. The show does not confirm the assertion made by
Thelma Golden, the curator, in her introduction to the exhibition's
disappointing catalog, that his prolific career included many works
that are ``truly great.''
</P>
<P>
   There are, however, a number of remarkable works. Front and
center in the first gallery, one of the show's best, hangs the
monumental ``Garden of Music'' of 1960, a magnetic mural-size group
portrait of some of post-bop jazz's leading lights that may be
Thompson's masterpiece. Painted in relatively subdued tones, it
shows Ornette Coleman, John Coltrane and others with their
instruments in an abbreviated landscape of colored dots and stark
trees. It has the mysterious power of a Gauguin or a Munch expanded
to the scale of Pollock.
</P>
<P>
   Toward the middle of the show is Thompson's ``St. George and the
Dragon,'' a big reprise of Tintoretto's treatment in the National
Gallery, London, which turns the image into an abbreviated, still
scary cartoon, a Color Field painting gone wildly Classical. And
among the later works are a relatively realistic portrait, ``Le Roi
Jones and His Family,'' which shows Thompson mustering a probing
figurative style reminiscent of Alice Neel's, and paintings like
``Death of the Infants of Bethel,'' a composition reminiscent of
Poussin. Here the blazing figures form a tight, bright jigsaw,
while landscape and sky benefit from more variegated brushwork, as
if Thompson at the end of his life was toying with the idea of
breaking up his big flat shapes and painting in a more spontaneous
manner. (The fragmenting skies in the paintings in the last two
galleries portend change.) And everywhere there are instances of
ecstatic color, like the blue and white sky of ``Foetus'' of 1961.
</P>
<P>
   But too many of these paintings are unresolved and indifferently
painted. Their figures and colors jangle rather than jell,
side-stepping the sense of rightness or inevitability basic to
``great.'' They often feel like they could be adjusted, improved in
color or composition, and it often seems that Thompson agreed.
Especially in the middle of the exhibition, he seems to be
reworking similar motifs from painting to painting, so they end up
feeling both formulaic and hesitant. And almost invariably the
smaller works and studies are stronger; their colors sharper, their
surfaces less brusque than their blown-up counterparts. In fact,
the heart of the show is the red-walled gallery at its center,
where more than 40 small works dot the two walls, more or less
summing up Thompson's development and major themes in images that
have the taut radiance of cloisonne enamel.
</P>
<P>
   As few artists are able to do, Thompson's art at its best held
form, content and subject matter in equal balance, an important
example in the present moment, when content is so frequently
reduced to subject matter _ to art's detriment. He did this in an
unusual, circular way that was astutely formal and yet deeply
personal.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Thompson's work consisted of images from art history
rejuvenated by modern color and given weight by oblique or not so
oblique references to relations between the races. Thompson's red,
blue and yellow madonnas, gods and goddesses may relate to the
palette of Fauvism and Pop Art. But they create a rich
psychological resonance, as if demonstrating again and again the
relationship of color and form to feeling. And they also imply a
multiracial world, a kind of rainbow universe which, while not
without its tensions, especially where women are involved, suggests
an acceptance of difference that Thompson's real world could not
muster.
</P>
<P>
   His marriage to a white woman, Carol Plenda, cannot have been
without tensions, if only socially instilled ones; but to make such
a marriage is to dream of a world in which skin color does not
matter. Such a world, however fraught with drama, is one that he
often painted. A vivid exception is ``L'Execution,'' one of the
show's smallest, most powerful works, which features a small, black
human form, blindfolded and hanging from a tree, a lynching
descended from Piero's ``Flagellation of Christ.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson's trajectory reflects the hard work and passion
required of a mature painting style, even if he did not achieve
one. Would he have continued his tango with art history? Might he
have marshaled his inspirations into a more synthesized style as
Philip Guston did? We will never know.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime his work should animate a rich discussion that
might examine his debt to various post- and post-Post-Impressionist
tendencies _ Symbolism, Fauvism and German Expressionism, his
relationship to the nonfigurative painters of his time _ to the
flat, undiluted colors of early Al Held or Jack Youngerman or late
Stuart Davis, who also drew inestimable inspiration from jazz. His
figuration needs to be closely related to other black artists from
Robert Colescott to Jean-Michel Basquiat, who also made black
achievement one of their subjects. But it also could be examined
within in a wider context of nonblack contemporaries who quoted the
Renaissance (Leland Bell, for example) or who used color to
intensely psychological ends (Lucas Samaras, for example).
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, almost none of this occurs in the exhibition's
catalog, whose main essay, by the art historian Judith Wilson,
provides a fascinating account of the artist's life. The essay is
especially enlivened by the recollections of Thompson's
contemporaries, like those of Cruz and Mrs. Muller, but it devotes
too much space to detailing paintings that appear in neither show
nor catalog and draws few useful insights from the carefully
assembled information. Still, exhibition and catalog make Thompson
an indisputable fact of recent art history, which is a cause for
celebration and, undoubtedly, an impetus for further study.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob Thompson'' is at the Whitney Museum of American Art, 945
Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, through Jan. 3. The show is partly
sponsored by AT&AMP;T, with additional support from Fletcher Asset
Management and TLC Beatrice International.

SURVEY FINDS AN UPSURGE IN THEATERGOERS UNDER 20 
</HEADLINE>
  (gm) 
 By ROBIN POGREBIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The proportion of Broadway theatergoers younger than
20 has nearly tripled in the last 30 years, and most of these young
people attend musicals rather than plays, according to a study
released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The study, commissioned by the Theater Development Fund and the
League of American Theaters, found that theatergoers under 20 made
up 13.9 percent of the total Broadway audience last year, up from
4.9 percent in 1966. In addition, the report found Broadway's
audience was younger than Off Broadway's, with an average age of 40
compared with the Off Broadway average of 45. The research was
conducted by Audience Research and Analysis.
</P>
<P>
   The study's results may in part reflect the youthful appeal of
``Rent,'' the rock musical about life in the East Village. But
George Wachtel, president of Audience Research, said that the study
surveyed a variety of productions _ 104 audiences over 52 weeks _
and that the increases in younger audience members more likely
reflect the success of the Disney musicals ``The Lion King'' and
``Beauty and the Beast.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing the children of the baby boomers attending the
theater,'' Wachtel said. ``That's healthy for the theater.'' But he
added that the report was ``also a warning.''
</P>
<P>
   Children and young teen-agers ``are going to the theater because
their parents loved it so much,'' he said. ``But we have lost the
audience in between, ages 18 to 24. That has showed a long-term
decline.'' While the report did not track that age group
specifically over the long term, Wachtel said other research showed
this trend.
</P>
<P>
   The study also found that audiences remained predominantly
white: 87.1 percent for Broadway and 89.1 percent for Off Broadway.
But it showed that younger theatergoers were more ethnically
diverse. In the age range of 18 to 24, Asian, Hispanic and
African-American theatergoers represented 20 percent of the
Broadway audience and 25.4 percent Off Broadway. Those groups
accounted for 12.9 percent of the total Broadway audience last year
and 10.9 percent of the Off Broadway audience.
</P>
<P>
   The report also suggested that early exposure to theater through
arts education programs and field trips was most likely to create
adult theatergoers.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Goldstein, executive director of the Theater Development
Fund, the nonprofit organization that operates the TKTS booths,
said that he was heartened by the findings, but that there was
still a long way to go in developing young audiences for straight
plays. While people under 18 account for 12.8 percent of the total
audience at all musicals, the study found they were only 1.1
percent of the total at other plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a job to do in terms of the awareness and
accessibility of the straight play,'' Goldstein said. ``I think the
well-rounded theatergoer needs to be interested in both the
straight play and the musical.''
</P>
<P>
   The entire study can be read on the Web at www.tdf.org. It also
surveyed the attitude of theatergoers under 25. It found that 4 out
of 5 agreed that ``going to the theater is cool''; the majority
agreed ``I would spend my own money on the theater''; two-thirds
agreed that ``theater is for someone my age,'' and only 1 in 10
agreed with the statement ``I attend the theater because my parents
or teachers want me to.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the survey's other notable statistics: the percentage of
international visitors attending Broadway shows increased to 12.9
percent of the total audience in 1997, from 7.4 percent in 1991,
and Broadway theatergoers were more likely to be from out of town,
while Off Broadway audiences come predominantly from the New York
metropolitan area.
</P>
<P>
   Women accounted for the majority of the total audience both on
and off Broadway; 26.1 percent of the Broadway audience had
children under 18, compared with 16.4 percent of the Off Broadway
audience, and theatergoers surveyed at Off Broadway performances
reported attending on average more than twice as many shows in the
last year as the Broadway audience.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    The Blue Ridge Parkway, a 469-mile Federal scenic highway
running between the Shenandoah National Park in Virginia and the
Great Smoky Mountains National Park in North Carolina, skirts the
eastern side of Asheville, N.C., for about 12 miles. But all signs
of the city's commerce and industry are obscured by hills and by
walls of rhododendron bushes.
 &HT;    Distracted drivers _ those with their eyes on autumn leaves, for
instance _ can easily pass the five Asheville exits without
realizing they have missed the largest city in western North
Carolina.
 &HT;    Asheville is particularly appealing in the fall, since it is
surrounded by some of the highest mountains in the eastern United
States, like the 6,684-foot Mount Mitchell, and is just minutes
away from protected wilderness areas and whitewater rivers. In
contrast, there is the Biltmore Estate, a 255-room mansion in the
style of a French chateau.
 &HT;    Asheville, population 67,000, is about 85 miles from the
southern end of the parkway. It makes a good stop for leaf watchers
who need replenishing, or a convenient base camp.
 &HT;    The downtown section, largely neglected for decades, is
undergoing a renaissance. The area has exceptional (and eccentric)
architecture, including Art Deco and Gothic Revival, and in the
past three years more than 20 buildings have been restored or
renovated. Once-empty storefronts house galleries with art,
antiques and the crafts of the region.
 &HT;    In the evenings, sidewalks fill with a mix of skateboarders and
window shoppers. You can hear blues on one side of the street and
bluegrass on the other.
 &HT;    More than a dozen downtown restaurants offer some form of
outdoor dining, including four side by side on Pack Square, three
of them so close that diners can pass a salt shaker from one
restaurant to the next.
 EVENTS  
 &HT;    The turning of the leaves begins with the red blush of dogwoods
and concludes with the russet tones of oaks. In late September
visitors will want to seek out higher elevations; those traveling
in early November should stick to valleys and lowlands. Foliage
conditions: (800) 280-0005.
 &HT;    Leaf watchers are not the only creatures flocking in. On clear
days thousands of migrating hawks have been seen following air
currents along the mountain ridges.
 &HT;    The privately owned Chimney Rock Park, 25 miles southeast of
Asheville on Highway 74A, will hold a hawk watch on Sept. 20. From
a rocky perch 1,200 feet above the valley floor, participants will
look for broad-winged, sharp-shinned and cooper's hawks.
 &HT;    An ornithologist will identify less frequent migrants: ospreys,
falcons and the occasional eagle. Admission to the park, $9.95 ($5
for children aged 6 to 16), includes an elevator ride to a gift
shop and a 75-mile view. It can be crowded at the top. Information:
(800) 277-9611.
 &HT;    A simple wooden folk toy is the center of attention at the 18th
annual Gee Haw Whimmy Diddle World Competition, Sept. 19 at the
Folk Art Center, mile 382 on the Blue Ridge Parkway (measured from
the northern end) just north of town.
 &HT;    A whimmy diddle consists of two sticks, one with a propeller
attached to one end, and the trick is to make the propeller spin by
rubbing one stick against the other.
 &HT;    Such traditional crafts as soap carving, blacksmithing and
basket weaving will be demonstrated on the grounds of the center,
which offers exhibits and a sales gallery year round. Free
admission; information, (828) 298-7928.
 &HT;    Handicrafts both homespun and sophisticated will be sold at the
Southern Highland Craft Guild Fair, Oct. 15 to 18 at Asheville
Civic Center, 87 Haywood Street. About 150 crafts experts will
participate, all members of the guild, which was established in
1928 and also operates the Folk Art Center. Tickets are $5;
information, (828) 298-7928.
 &HT;    ``In the City: Urban Vision 1900-1940,'' is an exhibition of 55
paintings by such artists as Edward Hopper, Reginald Marsh and John
Sloan. The pictures are on display through Oct. 31 at the Asheville
Art Museum in Pack Place, 2 Pack Square, and are on loan from the
Whitney Museum of American Art. Admission, $5; information, (828)
253-3227.
 &HT;    The work of the city's own artists can be viewed during the City
Center Arts Walk, which is held every other month, the next one on
the evening of Nov. 6. Twenty-four downtown galleries and studios
will be open for crowds who come for the art, the street performers
and the festive atmosphere. Free; information, (828) 258-0710.
 SIGHTSEEING  
 &HT;    The Blue Ridge Parkway has unblemished views of valleys and
ridges and provides frequent overlooks. Between miles 363 and 369,
about 25 miles north of
 &HT;    Asheville, Craggy Gardens offers trails and picnic areas.
Another eight miles north is the entrance to Mount Mitchell State
Park, where visitors can climb a stone tower to admire a stunning
360-degree view.
 &HT;    When a new road opens on Oct. 24, parkway travelers will have
direct access to the North Carolina Arboretum at mile 393 just
south of Asheville. For now, drivers must follow signs from State
Route 191.
 &HT;    The arboretum showcases native flora in informal plantings and
distinctive theme gardens. Free; grounds open daily from 8 a.m. to
9 p.m. Information, (828) 665-2492.
 &HT;    Cold Mountain is attracting increased attention after giving its
name to Charles Frazier's best-selling novel of Civil War days.
Visible from the overlook near parkway mile 412, the peak is strong
but hardly spectacular, especially when compared with Looking Glass
Rock, the dramatic granite dome that comes into view from the
parkway a few miles farther south.
 &HT;    Asheville's best-known literary landmark, Thomas Wolfe's boyhood
home, was badly damaged in a fire on July 24 and is expected to be
closed for several years. The site's new visitors center, at 52
Market St., remains open and is well worth a trip, with its
well-designed displays, among them the contents of Wolfe's last New
York apartment. Admission is free; open Monday to Saturday, 9 a.m.
to 5 p.m.; Sunday 1 to 5. Information, (828) 253-8304.
 &HT;    F. Scott Fitzgerald visited the city frequently during the
1930's and always stayed in Room 441 of the Grove Park Inn. He
liked the room because it overlooked the courtyard and he preferred
observing people to mountains.
 &HT;    This year the hotel restored the room to look as it did during
his visits, outfitting it with vintage telephone and radio and
Fitzgerald memorablilia. The room can be viewed when unoccupied, or
you can stay there yourself for $185 for two, $195 on weekends.
 &HT;    A thorough tour of the Biltmore estate, (800) 543-2961, with its
chateau, winery and 75 acres of gardens, can take the better part
of a day, yet it is not easy to leave anything out.
 &HT;    The basement, which is a recreation area with two bowling alleys
and a swimming pool, is as fascinating to some as the main floors,
where spacious rooms house fine furniture, paintings, 16th-century
tapestries, and carvings in stone and wood.
 &HT;    Admission is $29.95 a person ($22.50 for children aged 10 to 15;
free for 9 and under). The estate is open daily, the house from 9
a.m. to 6 p.m., the grounds from 8:30 a.m. to dusk, and the winery
from 11 to 7. All are likely to be busy on weekends, and almost
certainly during leaf season, particularly in October.
 WHERE TO STAY  
 &HT;    Beds are at a premium during leaf season, especially on
weekends; reservations are essential. Prices do not include a 9
percent tax.
 &HT;    The shady and historic Montford Park neighborhood, just north of
downtown, has a dozen bed-and-breakfast inns within a six-block
area. Most are in fine old houses, and many have pleasant gardens.
 &HT;    The Lion and the Rose, 276 Montford Ave., (828) 255-7673, fax
(828) 285-9810, dates back to 1895. This neoclassical house has
four guest rooms and one suite, all furnished with antiques and
queen-size beds. A room for two ranges from $115 to $165; the
suite, $195.
 &HT;    The Radisson Hotel, 1 Thomas Wolfe Plaza, (800) 438-3960, fax
(828) 254-1374, is in the heart of downtown. Its 12 stories of
glass and steel do not add character to the city, but the 281 rooms
are comfortable, and some have a view of the mountains. A double is
$99 to $149.
 &HT;    Budget: Many of the city's less expensive hotels and motels can
be found on busy Tunnel Road. Days Inn Central, 199 Tunnel Road,
(828) 254-4311, fax (704) 258-3970, is near the Asheville Mall, the
city's biggest shopping center. The inn has 77 rooms; doubles are
$59 to $79.
 &HT;    Luxury: Richmond Hill Inn, 87 Richmond Hill Drive; (888)
742-4540, fax (828) 252-8726, started out with rooms in a mansion
built in 1889. The inn has been expanded with nine one-room
cottages built around a croquet green, and the newest addition (in
1996), the garden pavilion, with guest rooms and a restaurant for
groups. There are 36 rooms and suites in all, many with fireplaces.
Most, particularly in the main house, are furnished in Victorian
style. Rates for a double room, $135 to $375, include a full
breakfast and afternoon tea.
 &HT;    Grove Park Inn, 290 Macon Ave., (800) 438-5800, fax (828)
252-6102, has also grown considerably over the years. With two
modern wings, it now has 510 rooms and is a resort with golf, a
comprehensive sports facility, three restaurants and a nightclub.
The rooms are furnished in the Arts and Crafts style that evolved
from the turn of the century to the 1920s. Doubles: $185 to $235.
 WHERE TO EAT  
 &HT;    At the Market Place, 20 Wall St., (828) 252-4162, fall brings
apples, one of the chef's favorite foods. They turn up in soups,
salads, and desserts and in such entrees as trout stuffed with
apple and bacon, and salmon with a red onion and apple crust. The
decor, which is contemporary, includes stainless steel and marble
walls. Dinner for two, with a modest wine, is about $90, not
including tax and tip.
 &HT;    La Caterina Trattoria, 5 Pack Square, (828) 254-1148, has the
feel and the flavors of Italy. It's in a building that is more than
100 years old and has high ceilings plastered with posters, and
small white tiles on floor and walls. Sausages, some pastas and the
mozzarella are made on the premises. Osso buco and braciole are
among the entrees. Outdoor and indoor dining. Dinner for two with
wine is about $75.
 &HT;    The Laughing Seed Cafe, 40 Wall St., (828) 252-3445, has an
eclectic look with a fantasy Caribbean mural stretching the length
of one wall, as well as local quilts. It offers satisfying
vegetarian variations of such traditional foods as the sloppy Joe,
Reuben sandwich and New Orleans muffaletta. Dinner specialties
include Thai green curry and pesto penne primavera. Dinner for two
with beer from the microbrewery in the basement is about $30.
 &HT;    ``Colorful'' does not adequately describe Salsas, 6 Patton
Avenue, (828) 252-9805, a tiny place with Day-Glo decor and wild
Mexican and Caribbean cuisine. One salsa is made with smoked ancho
chiles, cinnamon and charred tomatillos; another has mango, carrot
and habanero pepper. Improbable combinations _ a taco with smoked
trout, eggplant and plantain _ usually manage to please. Always
jammed, but that is part of the fun. Dinner for two, with beer, is
about $25.

 &HT;    
 By RICK MASHBURN 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    The Blue Ridge Parkway, a 469-mile Federal scenic highway
running between the Shenandoah National Park in Virginia and the
Great Smoky Mountains National Park in North Carolina, skirts the
eastern side of Asheville, N.C., for about 12 miles. But all signs
of the city's commerce and industry are obscured by hills and by
walls of rhododendron bushes.
 &HT;    Distracted drivers _ those with their eyes on autumn leaves, for
instance _ can easily pass the five Asheville exits without
realizing they have missed the largest city in western North
Carolina.
 &HT;    Asheville is particularly appealing in the fall, since it is
surrounded by some of the highest mountains in the eastern United
States, like the 6,684-foot Mount Mitchell, and is just minutes
away from protected wilderness areas and whitewater rivers. In
contrast, there is the Biltmore Estate, a 255-room mansion in the
style of a French chateau.
 &HT;    Asheville, population 67,000, is about 85 miles from the
southern end of the parkway. It makes a good stop for leaf watchers
who need replenishing, or a convenient base camp.
 &HT;    The downtown section, largely neglected for decades, is
undergoing a renaissance. The area has exceptional (and eccentric)
architecture, including Art Deco and Gothic Revival, and in the
past three years more than 20 buildings have been restored or
renovated. Once-empty storefronts house galleries with art,
antiques and the crafts of the region.
 &HT;    In the evenings, sidewalks fill with a mix of skateboarders and
window shoppers. You can hear blues on one side of the street and
bluegrass on the other.
 &HT;    More than a dozen downtown restaurants offer some form of
outdoor dining, including four side by side on Pack Square, three
of them so close that diners can pass a salt shaker from one
restaurant to the next.
 EVENTS  
 &HT;    The turning of the leaves begins with the red blush of dogwoods
and concludes with the russet tones of oaks. In late September
visitors will want to seek out higher elevations; those traveling
in early November should stick to valleys and lowlands. Foliage
conditions: (800) 280-0005.
 &HT;    Leaf watchers are not the only creatures flocking in. On clear
days thousands of migrating hawks have been seen following air
currents along the mountain ridges.
 &HT;    The privately owned Chimney Rock Park, 25 miles southeast of
Asheville on Highway 74A, will hold a hawk watch on Sept. 20. From
a rocky perch 1,200 feet above the valley floor, participants will
look for broad-winged, sharp-shinned and cooper's hawks.
 &HT;    An ornithologist will identify less frequent migrants: ospreys,
falcons and the occasional eagle. Admission to the park, $9.95 ($5
for children aged 6 to 16), includes an elevator ride to a gift
shop and a 75-mile view. It can be crowded at the top. Information:
(800) 277-9611.
 &HT;    A simple wooden folk toy is the center of attention at the 18th
annual Gee Haw Whimmy Diddle World Competition, Sept. 19 at the
Folk Art Center, mile 382 on the Blue Ridge Parkway (measured from
the northern end) just north of town.
 &HT;    A whimmy diddle consists of two sticks, one with a propeller
attached to one end, and the trick is to make the propeller spin by
rubbing one stick against the other.
 &HT;    Such traditional crafts as soap carving, blacksmithing and
basket weaving will be demonstrated on the grounds of the center,
which offers exhibits and a sales gallery year round. Free
admission; information, (828) 298-7928.
 &HT;    Handicrafts both homespun and sophisticated will be sold at the
Southern Highland Craft Guild Fair, Oct. 15 to 18 at Asheville
Civic Center, 87 Haywood Street. About 150 crafts experts will
participate, all members of the guild, which was established in
1928 and also operates the Folk Art Center. Tickets are $5;
information, (828) 298-7928.
 &HT;    ``In the City: Urban Vision 1900-1940,'' is an exhibition of 55
paintings by such artists as Edward Hopper, Reginald Marsh and John
Sloan. The pictures are on display through Oct. 31 at the Asheville
Art Museum in Pack Place, 2 Pack Square, and are on loan from the
Whitney Museum of American Art. Admission, $5; information, (828)
253-3227.
 &HT;    The work of the city's own artists can be viewed during the City
Center Arts Walk, which is held every other month, the next one on
the evening of Nov. 6. Twenty-four downtown galleries and studios
will be open for crowds who come for the art, the street performers
and the festive atmosphere. Free; information, (828) 258-0710.
 SIGHTSEEING  
 &HT;    The Blue Ridge Parkway has unblemished views of valleys and
ridges and provides frequent overlooks. Between miles 363 and 369,
about 25 miles north of
 &HT;    Asheville, Craggy Gardens offers trails and picnic areas.
Another eight miles north is the entrance to Mount Mitchell State
Park, where visitors can climb a stone tower to admire a stunning
360-degree view.
 &HT;    When a new road opens on Oct. 24, parkway travelers will have
direct access to the North Carolina Arboretum at mile 393 just
south of Asheville. For now, drivers must follow signs from State
Route 191.
 &HT;    The arboretum showcases native flora in informal plantings and
distinctive theme gardens. Free; grounds open daily from 8 a.m. to
9 p.m. Information, (828) 665-2492.
 &HT;    Cold Mountain is attracting increased attention after giving its
name to Charles Frazier's best-selling novel of Civil War days.
Visible from the overlook near parkway mile 412, the peak is strong
but hardly spectacular, especially when compared with Looking Glass
Rock, the dramatic granite dome that coms into view from the
parkway a few miles farther south.
 &HT;    Asheville's best-known literary landmark, Thomas Wolfe's boyhood
home, was badly damaged in a fire on July 24 and is expected to be
closed for several years. The site's new visitors center, at 52
Market St., remains open and is well worth a trip, with its
well-designed displays, among them the contents of Wolfe's last New
York apartment. Admission is free; open Monday to Saturday, 9 a.m.
to 5 p.m.; Sunday 1 to 5. Information, (828) 253-8304.
 &HT;    F. Scott Fitzgerald visited the city frequently during the
1930's and always stayed in Room 441 of the Grove Park Inn. He

of a day, yet it is not easy to leave anything out.

and a swimming pool, is as fascinating to some as the main floors,
where spacious rooms house fine furniture, paintings, 16th-century

(828) 254-4311, fax (704) 258-3970, is near the Asheville Mall, the
city's biggest shopping center. The inn has 77 rooms; doubles are

252-6102, has also grown considerably over the years. With two

The rooms are furnished in the Arts and Crafts style that evolved
from the turn of the century to the 1920s. Doubles: $185 to $235.

 (PLEASE NOTE: This article has been transmitted twice _ into the

 &HT;    
 By GENE AND ADELE MALOTT 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    On the second day of their cruise-tour through Alaska, Robert F.
Reiland rushed his wife who was suffering from a life-threatening
breathing problem to a hospital emergency room in Fairbanks.
 &HT;    After four days of intensive care, Mrs. Reiland had recovered
enough to return home to Palm Beach Gardens, Fla., ending the
couple's journey. At the time they wrote us, they had received no
refunds for the portion of the trip that had to be cancelled, for
hotel bills in Fairbanks and for extra airfare _ not a penny from
the tour operator, their travel agent or the airline.
 &HT;    As Reiland says, ``We paid $11,000 up front for what became only
a round-trip to Alaska and a riverboat ride ...''
 &HT;    The truth is that the Reilands hadn't bought trip insurance. In
fact, they didn't even know such a thing existed. And, apparently,
their travel agent didn't tell them, either. As a result, nobody
was required to refund the Reilands' money.
 &HT;    With more mature travelers taking longer and more expensive
vacations, trip insurance is becoming a necessity to protect a
fairly large travel investment _ and it provides peace of mind.
 &HT;    A typical policy costs only 5 percent to 6 percent of the cost
of the trip; some policies cost less. Rates seem to be lower than
they were several years ago, and coverages are better as insurance
vendors expand their claims experience.
 &HT;    On the downside, leading trip-insurance sellers are beginning to
charge rates based on age _ the older you are, the more trip
insurance costs. The higher cost is also a result of the greater
number of claims filed by mature travelers, who have more
experience travelling.
 &HT;    For example, a policy from CSA Travel Protection will insure a
$2,500 trip for a premium of $69 if you are under 55, $105 if you
are 56 to 70, and $135 if you are 70 or older. Even so, those
premiums are a bargain compared with the costs of travel that
aren't reimbursed.
 COVERING THE BIG COSTS  
 &HT;    Make sure you are covered for loses you can't afford to absorb,
and try not to pay high prices for other frills. Make sure, too,
that the policy you choose is an insurance policy and not just an
add-on to a trip offered as an afterthought.
 &HT;    Nancy Hoyt Belcher of Oakland, Calif., was on a trip to Alaska's
Denali Wilderness Retreat on a remote back corner of the national
park, a place where there are no roads, when she suffered a heart
attack. Bad weather prevented a plane from getting in, so she was
helicoptered to the nearest hospital in Fairbanks.
 &HT;    But Fairbanks had no cardiology unit, so she was airlifted to
Anchorage, where she recuperated. Belcher says the bill for that
relatively short evacuation was more than $9,000. Some evacuations
from remote corners of the world to decent hospitals can cost up to
$25,000.
 &HT;    Your insurance policy should cover the following:
 &HT;     _ TRIP CANCELLATION OR INTERRUPTION: This is the primary reason
for all trip-insurance policies. It comes into play when: the death
or serious illness of you, your traveling companion or a close
relative at home requires you to cancel your trip and to stay home;
you have an emergency at home, like a flood or an earthquake; you
miss connections and can't pick up the trip; the ship is disabled
on a cruise the week before yours; your cruise is cancelled; and
your tour operator goes broke and you are stranded overseas.
 &HT;    Insurance reimbursement should cover the cruise fare or cost of
a tour that won't be refunded, any extra meals or lodging bills and
any airfare add-ons to fly home early.
 &HT;     _ EVACUATION:  Emergency medical evacuation insurance (EME) is
also a feature of most trip-insurance policies. Claim it when you
have an illness too serious to be treated on the spot and you must
be airlifted from some remote location to a hospital where you can
get proper care, or you need additional evacuation to a hospital
near your home.
 &HT;    Although evacuation is rarely necessary, it is about the most
expensive thing that can go wrong on a trip _ up to $25,000 for a
long-distance airlift. Clearly, this is an expense most travelers
can't absorb.
 &HT;     _ MEDICAL EXPENSES:  While extra medical or dental expenses may
be covered by your existing health-insurance policies, you should
check your policy to make sure you're covered outside the United
States.
 &HT;    If you've purchased Part B coverage, Medicare will probably
cover expensive options such as medical evacuation under its
provisions for ambulance services _ but only in the United States.
 &HT;    Beware: Medicare does not cover most health-threatening
situations that happen to you outside the country. So you'll need
this supplemental medical/dental coverage when you're traveling
abroad.
 &HT;     _ EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE: Does the policy provide medical
referral to English-speaking doctors overseas (preferably using a
telephone hotline), translation by phone, medical monitoring in a
foreign hospital, prescription help, emergency cash to pay foreign
hospital bills and possible legal assistance?
 &HT;    What you don't need in a trip-insurance policy are items often
already covered by your existing policies or those whose cost you
can handle: for example, coverage for lost or delayed luggage, lost
passports or travelers checks, accidental death or dismemberment,
accident insurance on a rental car.
 &HT;    And make sure you read your policy when you receive it and
understand your coverage. You may want to shop further.
 &HT;    Here are leading companies that provide trip insurance for
mature travelers. All basic policies from these companies provide
coverage for trip cancellation, medical evacuation, extra medical
costs and emergency services:
 &HT;     _ Access America,  (800) 284-8300.
 &HT;     _ American Express,  (800) 758-2639.
 &HT;     _ Berkeley Carefree,  (800) 323-3149.
 &HT;     _ CSA,  (800)348-9505.
 &HT;     _ TravelGuard,  (800) 826-1300.
 &HT;     _ Travelers,  (800) 243-3174.
 &HT;    Of these, ``Consumer Reports Travel Letter'' rated CSA and
Access America policies as best values.
 &HT;    Buy a trip-insurance policy from your travel agent at the time
you book the trip _ most agencies can set you up with these
companies _ or directly from the insurance provider.

 By GENE AND ADELE MALOTT 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    On the second day of their cruise-tour through Alaska, Robert F.
Reiland rushed his wife who was suffering from a life-threatening
breathing problem to a hospital emergency room in Fairbanks.
 &HT;    After four days of intensive care, Mrs. Reiland had recovered
enough to return home to Palm Beach Gardens, Fla., ending the
couple's journey. At the time they wrote us, they had received no
refunds for the portion of the trip that had to be cancelled, for
hotel bills in Fairbanks and for extra airfare _ not a penny from
the tour operator, their travel agent or the airline.
 &HT;    As Reiland says, ``We paid $11,000 up front for what became only
a round-trip to Alaska and a riverboat ride ...''
 &HT;    The truth is that the Reilands hadn't bought trip insurance. In
fact, they didn't even know such a thing existed. And, apparently,
their travel agent didn't tell them, either. As a result, nobody
was required to refund the Reilands' money.
 &HT;    With more mature travelers taking longer and more expensive
vacations, trip insurance is becoming a necessity to protect a
fairly large travel investment _ and it provides peace of mind.
 &HT;    A typical policy costs only 5 percent to 6 percent of the cost
of the trip; some policies cost less. Rates seem to be lower than
they were several years ago, and coverages are better as insurance
vendors expand their claims experience.
 &HT;    On the downside, leading trip-insurance sellers are beginning to
charge rates based on age _ the older you are, the more trip
insurance costs. The higher cost is also a result of the greater
number of claims filed by mature travelers, who have more
experience travelling.
 &HT;    For example, a policy from CSA Travel Protection will insure a
$2,500 trip for a premium of $69 if you are under 55, $105 if you
are 56 to 70, and $135 if you are 70 or older. Even so, those
premiums are a bargain compared with the costs of travel that
aren't reimbursed.
 COVERING THE BIG COSTS  
 &HT;    Make sure you are covered for loses you can't afford to absorb,
and try not to pay high prices for other frills. Make sure, too,
that the policy you choose is an insurance policy and not just an
add-on to a trip offered as an afterthought.

FAST AID IS ESSENTIAL IN HIGHWAY FIRST AID 
</HEADLINE>
  (gm) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ MAny highway accident victims who are pronounced
dead on arrival at emergency rooms have injuries doctors find to be
surprisingly small.
</P>
<P>
   A bump on the head, for example.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you render someone unconscious by giving them a blow to the
head,'' said Dr. Henry Bock, an emergency room physician at
Methodist Hospital in Indianapolis, ``one of the things that gets
scrambled is the urge to breathe.''
</P>
<P>
   In the time it takes for an ambulance to arrive _ 10 minutes on
average in urban areas and 19 minutes for rural crashes _ that bump
could become fatal. Many people who are transported to emergency
rooms with head injuries, Bock said, ``never have any diagnosed
brain injuries; they have hypoxic injuries,'' meaning those caused
by lack of oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Carl P. Valenziano, who is the president-elect of the
American Trauma Society, a professional association of
emergency-room doctors, said that when doctors see such a person in
the emergency room, ``We all have thoughts of, `This guy doesn't
have injuries he should have died from.'''
</P>
<P>
   Bock, who is also the medical director of the Indianapolis Motor
Speedway, said drivers hurt in crashes at the track don't have this
problem, simply because help arrives so fast.
</P>
<P>
   But help could arrive more quickly for ordinary drivers on
ordinary highways, experts say, if only bystanders were willing to
pull over and begin artificial respiration.
</P>
<P>
   In August, the Shell Oil Co. began distributing 35 million free
booklets, called ``Crash Course,'' at its service stations around
the country, to give simple instructions on what to do if you
arrive at the scene of an accident. (The information is also
available at www.countonshell.com; it was developed with the
National Safety Council, www.nsc.org, and the American Trauma
Society, www.amtrauma.org, both of which have more information.)
</P>
<P>
   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, part of the
U.S. Transportation Department, is hoping to begin widespread
bystander training, like cardiopulmonary resuscitation training, in
the next few months, working through the trauma society and similar
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials and private experts say most drivers will
not stop to offer assistance unless they are confident they will do
more good than harm, and part of the training is to convince them
they can help. The training materials also point out that most
states have good Samaritan laws that protect the person who tries
to help.
</P>
<P>
   The advice from experts breaks down into five steps:
</P>
<P>
   _ Watch for accidents, especially broken guardrails or skid
marks. (About half of all fatal motor vehicle crashes are
single-vehicle accidents; in many cases a car or truck is in a
ditch or far off the road.)
</P>
<P>
   _ Park your car beyond the wreck, off the road, so you are not
hit by traffic.
</P>
<P>
   _ Call for help, or assign someone else to do so.
</P>
<P>
   _ Check for injuries. ``You tend to go to the people who yell
and scream,'' Bock said, but this is a mistake. ``Go to the quiet
people first,'' he said. ``If somebody is talking, they they are
breathing.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Try to stop severe bleeding. The Shell booklet recommends
placing a thick pad of clean cloth over the site of the bleeding,
but other experts say a finger with a thin wrapping of clean cloth
is better, because it produces more pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, when dealing with someone who is unresponsive and
does not appear to be breathing, the latest advice contradicts a
longstanding belief about accident victims: that it is important
never to move their heads or necks. It is now recommended that a
victim's head be pointed head straight and that his jaw be lowered.
Listen for gurgling, and if necessary, the victim's mouth should be
cleared of liquid or debris. If there is still no sign of
breathing, pinch the victim's nose shut and blow into the mouth.
</P>
<P>
   Bock, who helped inspire the highway safety agency to begin
working on its training course, said worries about moving a victim
are secondary. ``If they've got a neck injury, probably most of the
damage has already been done.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts said a significant number of the 40,000 people who die
annually because of traffic accidents could have survived if more
people stopped to help, and they hoped that training would
encourage more people to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Fear of infection may be a problem, but experts say the risk is
very low. For AIDS, Bock said, ``you have to get the blood into
your blood, and unless you do that somehow, it's not a problem.''
Even swallowing blood would not result in infection, he said,
because that does not put contaminants in the bloodstream.
</P>
<P>
   Valenziano, who is also the director of surgical critical care
and trauma at Morristown Memorial Hospital in New Jersey, said, ``I
think most people are much more scared to address injury because it
is not something they've been taught about.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people feel that their actions may be futile because they
don't know what they have to do,'' he said. ``So many people say
they know CPR, but as soon as you ask them, are they confident to
stop and help at scene of crash, they say no.''

 (PLEASE NOTE: This article has been transmitted twice _ into the

 &HT;    
 By EVERETT POTTER 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    The British Royal Family has made its share of gaffes and has
taken its share of knocks in recent years, most memorably when
Diana, Princess of Wales, died last August. So it's refreshing to
take note of one member of the extended Royal Family who's making a
good name for himself _ and his country in the process.
 &HT;    ``I'm very fortunate to be related to certain people'' James
Ogilvy says with characteristic modesty. Ogilvy is the 34-year-old
publisher and editor of the recently launched newsletter,
``Ogilvy's Britain and Ireland: The Insider Guide for the
Sophisticated Traveller.''
 &HT;    He also happens to be the son of H.R.H. Princess Alexandra, the
Hon. Lady Ogilvy, herself a first cousin to H.M. Queen Elizabeth
II. That makes James Ogilvy the 30th in line for the crown. He's
hardly up there with Prince William and Prince Harry, but he's a
Royal nonetheless.
 &HT;    Unlike some of his splashier relatives, Ogilvy lives out of the
spotlight in a small Scottish village not far from St. Andrews,
with his wife Julia and their children, Julia and James. It's a
quiet life but noteworthy enough to make the cover of Town &AMP;
Country in August 1997.
 &HT;    But for fans of Britain and Ireland, what's more important is
that Ogilvy has poured his love for his homeland and his expertise
in the luxury-goods field into this newsletter.
 &HT;    ``I've always been interested in newsletters, which are almost
completely unknown in Europe but big in the United States,'' Ogilvy
says from his 18th-century house with a view of the sea. ``But I
had never come across a newsletter about Britain, which I think is
a big omission.''
 &HT;    Especially given the fact that the British Tourist Authority is
projecting that a record 3.8 million Americans will go to Britain
this year.
 &HT;    Thankfully, Ogilvy already has a track record in the publishing
business. After spending four years as an investment banker and
then four years directing a shipping company, the MBA-wielding
Royal launched ``Luxury Briefing'' in October 1996.
 &HT;    This 16-page trade publication focuses on key events in the
luxury industry throughout the United States and Britain. Now it's
``Ogilvy's Britain and Ireland,'' which is squarely aimed at
affluent Americans.
 &HT;    ``We have something to say,'' Ogilvy explains. ``There's a lot
of information that we already had. We're quite well plugged in.''
 &HT;    The 12-page newsletter, now in its second issue, is as crisp and
well-organized as a good travel magazine. Each issue highlights
three London hotel properties.
 &HT;    In the first issue, properties such as The Hyde Park, The
Athenaeum and the Covent Garden Hotel are singled out.
 &HT;    Each issue also talks about hotels outside London, such as The
Clarence in Dublin and Chewton Glen in Hampshire. There are
features on London's hottest restaurants, on restaurants outside
London and on London shopping districts such as Westbourne Village.
 &HT;    There's also a feature on golf in each issue and a piece on
``Great British Institutions.'' In the first issue, it's about tea.
In the second, it's on bespoke tailoring.
 &HT;    What's best about it, perhaps, is the added attention to detail
_ to driving directions, airport, theater and museum information,
and even VAT refunds.
 &HT;    This is not for would-be Royals heading to Buckingham Palace.
It's for Anglophiles eager for insider news about where to eat, to
shop and to lay their heads at night. The prose is breezy, bright
and friendly, fitting for a newsletter for enthusiasts about all
things British, with a discrete nod to the Irish.
 &HT;    ``I think that as long as you're honest about a place, you can
lay it out for someone else to make their judgement,'' Ogilvy says.
 &HT;    An American enthusiast, he'd just returned from a two-week
summer vacation on the island of Nantucket.
 &HT;    ``I absolutely adore America,'' he says. ``I've got a lot of
very good American friends and I think I understand what Americans
enjoy. Unlike France or Italy or Spain, which are in or out of
fashion, Britain has a peculiar ongoing relationship with the
United States. So many Americans have links back here.''
 &HT;    The newsletter, which is priced at $100 a year, is a product
that Ogilvy hopes will have ``a clublike feel. I think someone like
Andrew Harper of 'The Hideaway Report' has done a tremendous job,
and I'd be very happy if we could emulate some of his success.''
 &HT;    Throughout the newsletter are ``Best-Kept Secrets'' such as
Cliveden Town House hotel in London and the Nefyn and District Golf
Club in Wales.
 &HT;    Does being a Royal give Ogilvy's newsletter special insight?
 &HT;    ``It doesn't necessarily give a particular slant to it,'' he
says. ``But I hope that my own experience and my own exposure to a
lot of the business we're writing about comes through. It's a
personal interpretation of what I feel are some great places. I
just hope people will not be disappointed.''
 &HT;    A one-year, six-issue subscription is $100. For a free sample

 &HT;    
 By EVERETT POTTER 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    The British Royal Family has made its share of gaffes and has
taken its share of knocks in recent years, most memorably when
Diana, Princess of Wales, died last August. So it's refreshing to
take note of one member of the extended Royal Family who's making a
good name for himself _ and his country in the process.
 &HT;    ``I'm very fortunate to be related to certain people'' James
Ogilvy says with characteristic modesty. Ogilvy is the 34-year-old
publisher and editor of the recently launched newsletter,
``Ogilvy's Britain and Ireland: The Insider Guide for the
Sophisticated Traveller.''
 &HT;    He also happens to be the son of H.R.H. Princess Alexandra, the
Hon. Lady Ogilvy, herself a first cousin to H.M. Queen Elizabeth
II. That makes James Ogilvy the 30th in line for the crown. He's
hardly up there with Prince William and Prince Harry, but he's a
Royal nonetheless.
 &HT;    Unlike some of his splashier relatives, Ogilvy lives out of the
spotlight in a small Scottish village not far from St. Andrews,
with his wife Julia and their children, Julia and James. It's a
quiet life but noteworthy enough to make the cover of Town &AMP;
Country in August 1997.
 &HT;    But for fans of Britain and Ireland, what's more important is
that Ogilvy has poured his love for his homeland and his expertise
in the luxury-goods field into this newsletter.
 &HT;    ``I've always been interested in newsletters, which are almost
completely unknown in Europe but big in the United States,'' Ogilvy
says from his 18th-century house with a view of the sea. ``But I
had never come across a newsletter about Britain, which I think is
a big omission.''
 &HT;    Especially given the fact that the British Tourist Authority is
projecting that a record 3.8 million Americans will go to Britain
this year.
 &HT;    Thankfully, Ogilvy already has a track record in the publishing
business. After spending four years as an investment banker and
then four years directing a shipping company, the MBA-wielding
Royal launched ``Luxury Briefing'' in October 1996.
 &HT;    This 16-page trade publication focuses on key events in the
luxury industry throughout the United States and Britain. Now it's
``Ogilvy's Britain and Ireland,'' which is squarely aimed at
affluent Americans.
 &HT;    ``We have something to say,'' Ogilvy explains. ``There's a lot
of information that we already had. We're quite well plugged in.''
 &HT;    The 12-page newsletter, now in its second issue, is as crisp and
well-organized as a good travel magazine. Each issue highlights
three London hotel properties.
 &HT;    In the first issue, properties such as The Hyde Park, The
Athenaeum and the Covent Garden Hotel are singled out.
 &HT;    Each issue also talks about hotels outside London, such as The
Clarence in Dublin and Chewton Glen in Hampshire. There are
features on London's hottest restaurants, on restaurants outside
London and on London shopping districts such as Westbourne Village.
 &HT;    There's also a feature on golf in each issue and a piece on
``Great British Institutions.'' In the first issue, it's about tea.
In the second, it's on bespoke tailoring.
 &HT;    What's best about it, perhaps, is the added attention to detail
_ to driving directions, airport, theater and museum information,
and even VAT refunds.
 &HT;    This is not for would-be Royals heading to Buckingham Palace.
It's for Anglophiles eager for insider news about where to eat, to
shop and to lay their heads at night. The prose is breezy, bright
and friendly, fitting for a newsletter for enthusiasts about all
things British, with a discrete nod to the Irish.
 &HT;    ``I think that as long as you're honest about a place, you can
lay it out for someone else to make their judgement,'' Ogilvy says.
 &HT;    An American enthusiast, he'd just returned from a two-week
summer vacation on the island of Nantucket.
 &HT;    ``I absolutely adore America,'' he says. ``I've got a lot of
very good American friends and I think I understand what Americans
enjoy. Unlike France or Italy or Spain, which are in or out of
fashion, Britain has a peculiar ongoing relationship with the
United States. So many Americans have links back here.''
 &HT;    The newsletter, which is priced at $100 a year, is a product
that Ogilvy hopes will have ``a clublike feel. I think someone like
Andrew Harper of 'The Hideaway Report' has done a tremendous job,
and I'd be very happy if we could emulate some of his success.''
 &HT;    Throughout the newsletter are ``Best-Kept Secrets'' such as
Cliveden Town House hotel in London and the Nefyn and District Golf
Club in Wales.
 &HT;    Does being a Royal give Ogilvy's newsletter special insight?
 &HT;    ``It doesn't necessarily give a particular slant to it,'' he
says. ``But I hope that my own experience and my own exposure to a
lot of the business we're writing about comes through. It's a
personal interpretation of what I feel are some great places. I
just hope people will not be disappointed.''
 &HT;    A one-year, six-issue subscription is $100. For a free sample
issue, contact ``Ogilvy's Britain &AMP; Ireland: The Insider Guide for
the Sophisticated Traveller,'' Coates House, Upper Largo, Fife, KY8
6JF, Scotland (888-OGILVYS/www.ogilvys-britain.com).

   The entrepreneurial spirit is alive and well in both large and
small businesses, reports Times writer Louis Uchitelle in this
cover feature. It's certainly a prime competitive weapon in big
business. Witness Merck &AMP; Company, the giant pharmaceutical
corporation, whose scientists are encouraged to scout outside the
company for promising new research that might lead to a future
drug. Then there are the millions of Americans who believe that the
entrepreneurial spirit resides mainly in small companies with fewer
than 100 employees. Here, self-employment is a big phenomenon,
particularly among workers who have been laid off by corporations.

   It may not be easy to spell, but entrepreneurialism is all the
rage among potential MBAs. Driven by student and alumni demand, no
field is hotter today in business studies. Whereas a generation ago
the goal of top MBA graduates was to join a Fortune 500 company and
climb the corporate ladder, students' most fervent desire nowadays
seems to be to come up with a marketable idea, start a company and
work for themselves. Ethan Bronner, national educational
correspondent for The New York Times and author of ``Battle for
Justice: How the Bork Nomination Shook America'' (Norton, 1989),
explains why in this feature.

   Ken Hakuta's story is inspiring. He's the inventor of the Wacky
Wall Walker, those slime-covered plastic creatures that ooze down
vertical surfaces. The beauty of it is that Hakuta didn't even come
up with the idea: All he did was license the toy from Japan for a
tiny fraction of the amount he made. Now he's a millionaire! There
are a ton of ideas out floating around, reports Neil Strauss. But
who has the time _ and money _ to make them happen? Strauss
doesn't, which is why he is giving away his top 10 get-rich-quick
schemes in this humorous feature for those who want to pursue them:
portable baby sitters ... address books, cell phones and wallets
that beep when they're lost ... public egg banks. Strauss is a

   When Bettina Richards was an artist-and-repertory executive for
big recording companies, she didn't like the way they treated
musicians. Her favorite bands were ignored if they weren't best
sellers; one lead singer, who went on to make a gold album, was
told he shouldn't be singing at all. In 1992, she started her own
company: Thrill Jockey Records. It would release music she cared
about and let the musicians decide what to release, how to package
it and run their careers. A profile by Jon Pareles.

   At age 10, Harold S. Blue, now the chairman of Proxymed Inc., a
health-care information-services company, hired playmates to shovel
driveways instead of doing the work himself. He paid them $3 of the
$5 he collected. As a boy growing up in India, Vinod Gupta, the
founder of infoUSA Inc., a seller of business information in Omaha
with projected sales this year of $250 million, caught frogs and
sold them to a research laboratory for lunch money. Like other
successful entrepreneurs, these men seemed to have a natural bent
for seizing opportunities. What defines them? Brent Bowers,
co-author with Harold Geneen of the book ``The Synergy Myth'' (St.
Martin's Press, 1996), attempts to answer this question in this
feature.

<P>
   Countless small-business owners have forged ahead
optimistically, ignoring the fact that they should have gotten
legal and accounting guidance before entertaining customers.
Lawyers are usually not a happy part of the plan for a new
business. Neither are accountants, investment advisers or other
professionals whose job it is to protect a business from the things
entrepreneurs would rather not think about. Laura Mansnerus, a
staff writer for The New York Times, explains why the suits should
be consulted before the grand opening.

   Donald Katz, the 46-year-old author of three highly acclaimed
nonfiction books, is a rather unlikely entrepreneur. His
three-year-old Internet start-up, Audible Inc., offers custom audio
information delivered on demand over the Web to portable devices
you can listen to any time and anywhere, say, while jogging or
driving to work. Tom Redburn, the business enterprise editor for
The New York Times, interviews Katz, whose experiences provide
insight into the obstacles and confusions that arise when
nonbusiness types go into business in a big way. Redburn has
written for The International Herald Tribune and the Los Angeles
Times.

   Ken Hakuta's story is inspiring. He's the inventor of the Wacky
Wall Walker, those slime-covered plastic creatures that ooze down
vertical surfaces. The beauty of it is that Hakuta didn't even come
up with the idea: All he did was license the toy from Japan for a
tiny fraction of the amount he made. Now he's a millionaire! There
are a ton of ideas out floating around, reports Neil Strauss. But
who has the time _ and money _ to make them happen? Strauss
doesn't, which is why he is giving away his top 10 get-rich-quick
schemes in this humorous feature for those who want to pursue them:
portable baby sitters ... address books, cell phones and wallets
that beep when they're lost ... public egg banks. Strauss is a
staff writer for The Times.

   When Bettina Richards was an artist-and-repertory executive for
big recording companies, she didn't like the way they treated
musicians. Her favorite bands were ignored if they weren't best
sellers; one lead singer, who went on to make a gold album, was
told he shouldn't be singing at all. In 1992, she started her own
company: Thrill Jockey Records. It would release music she cared
about and let the musicians decide what to release, how to package
it and run their careers. A profile by Jon Pareles.

   At age 10, Harold S. Blue, now the chairman of Proxymed Inc., a
health-care information-services company, hired playmates to shovel
driveways instead of doing the work himself. He paid them $3 of the
$5 he collected. As a boy growing up in India, Vinod Gupta, the
founder of infoUSA Inc., a seller of business information in Omaha
with projected sales this year of $250 million, caught frogs and
sold them to a research laboratory for lunch money. Like other
successful entrepreneurs, these men seemed to have a natural bent

   Countless small-business owners have forged ahead
optimistically, ignoring the fact that they should have gotten
legal and accounting guidance before entertaining customers.
Lawyers are usually not a happy part of the plan for a new
business. Neither are accountants, investment advisers or other
professionals whose job it is to protect a business from the things
entrepreneurs would rather not think about. Laura Mansnerus, a
staff writer for The New York Times, explains why the suits should
be consulted before the grand opening.

   The entrepreneurial spirit is alive and well in both large and
small businesses, reports Times writer Louis Uchitelle in this
cover feature. It's certainly a prime competitive weapon in big
business. Witness Merck &AMP; Company, the giant pharmaceutical
corporation, whose scientists are encouraged to scout outside the
company for promising new research that might lead to a future
drug. Then there are the millions of Americans who believe that the
entrepreneurial spirit resides mainly in small companies with fewer
than 100 employees. Here, self-employment is a big phenomenon,
particularly among workers who have been laid off by corporations.
Uchitelle is a staff writer for The Times.

   John Shoch, a Silicon Valley venture capitalist, scans the room

recognizes about half the financiers, hardware engineers and
software hackers who are seated. Shoch is doing what he does best:
``surfing,'' or looking for the next big thing in the nation's
technology heartland. What will it be? Is it wireless data? Is the
time finally right for interactive digital television? John
Markoff, a staff writer for The New York Times, reports on the
blinding pace of Silicon Valley and what seems to be everyone's
pastime _ catching the next big wave. Markoff is co-author of the
book ``Takedown: The Pursuit and Capture of America's Most Wanted
Computer Criminal'' (Hyperion, 1996).

   It may not be easy to spell, but entrepreneurialism is all the
rage among potential MBAs. Driven by student and alumni demand, no
field is hotter today in business studies. Whereas a generation ago
the goal of top MBA graduates was to join a Fortune 500 company and
climb the corporate ladder, students' most fervent desire nowadays
seems to be to come up with a marketable idea, start a company and
work for themselves. Ethan Bronner, national educational
correspondent for The New York Times and author of ``Battle for
Justice: How the Bork Nomination Shook America'' (Norton, 1989),
explains why in this feature.

   When Bettina Richards was an artist-and-repertory executive for
big recording companies, she didn't like the way they treated
musicians. Her favorite bands were ignored if they weren't best
sellers; one lead singer, who went on to make a gold album, was
told he shouldn't be singing at all. In 1992, she started her own
company: Thrill Jockey Records. It would release music she cared
about and let the musicians decide what to release, how to package
it and run their careers. A profile by Jon Pareles.

   At age 10, Harold S. Blue, now the chairman of Proxymed Inc., a
health-care information-services company, hired playmates to shovel
driveways instead of doing the work himself. He paid them $3 of the
$5 he collected. As a boy growing up in India, Vinod Gupta, the
founder of infoUSA Inc., a seller of business information in Omaha
with projected sales this year of $250 million, caught frogs and
sold them to a research laboratory for lunch money. Like other
successful entrepreneurs, these men seemed to have a natural bent
for seizing opportunities. What defines them? Brent Bowers,
co-author with Harold Geneen of the book ``The Synergy Myth'' (St.
Martin's Press, 1996), attempts to answer this question in this

   Countless small-business owners have forged ahead
optimistically, ignoring the fact that they should have gotten
legal and accounting guidance before entertaining customers.
Lawyers are usually not a happy part of the plan for a new
business. Neither are accountants, investment advisers or other
professionals whose job it is to protect a business from the things
entrepreneurs would rather not think about. Laura Mansnerus, a
staff writer for The New York Times, explains why the suits should
be consulted before the grand opening.

corporate America. The New York Times examines this attitude in

   The entrepreneurial spirit is alive and well in both large and
small businesses, reports Times writer Louis Uchitelle in this
cover feature. It's certainly a prime competitive weapon in big
business. Witness Merck &AMP; Company, the giant pharmaceutical
corporation, whose scientists are encouraged to scout outside the
company for promising new research that might lead to a future
drug. Then there are the millions of Americans who believe that the
entrepreneurial spirit resides mainly in small companies with fewer
than 100 employees. Here, self-employment is a big phenomenon,
particularly among workers who have been laid off by corporations.
Uchitelle is a staff writer for The Times.

   John Shoch, a Silicon Valley venture capitalist, scans the room

recognizes about half the financiers, hardware engineers and
software hackers who are seated. Shoch is doing what he does best:
``surfing,'' or looking for the next big thing in the nation's
technology heartland. What will it be? Is it wireless data? Is the
time finally right for interactive digital television? John
Markoff, a staff writer for The New York Times, reports on the
blinding pace of Silicon Valley and what seems to be everyone's
pastime _ catching the next big wave. Markoff is co-author of the
book ``Takedown: The Pursuit and Capture of America's Most Wanted
Computer Criminal'' (Hyperion, 1996).

   It may not be easy to spell, but entrepreneurialism is all the
rage among potential MBAs. Driven by student and alumni demand, no
field is hotter today in business studies. Whereas a generation ago
the goal of top MBA graduates was to join a Fortune 500 company and
climb the corporate ladder, students' most fervent desire nowadays
seems to be to come up with a marketable idea, start a company and
work for themselves. Ethan Bronner, national educational
correspondent for The New York Times and author of ``Battle for
Justice: How the Bork Nomination Shook America'' (Norton, 1989),
explains why in this feature.

tiny fraction of the amount he made. Now he's a millionaire! There

who has the time _ and money _ to make them happen? Strauss
doesn't, which is why he is giving away his top 10 get-rich-quick

SIX ARRESTED IN DRUG RAID NEAR TIMES SQUARE 
</HEADLINE>
  (gm) 
 By DAVID W. CHEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Police officers Thursday night raided a Times Square
building that had been transformed into a haven offering services
and shelter for the poor, arresting six residents on charges that
they had sold or possessed crack cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   The raid, which came after complaints from residents and
management, was the second such operation in the last three weeks
at the Times Square Hotel on West 43d Street near Eighth Avenue.
The first one resulted in seven arrests, said Capt. Kenneth
Kelleher of the Manhattan South Narcotics District.
</P>
<P>
   The raids are part of a larger effort to rid the Times Square
Hotel of drug dealers under a plan drawn up this year by the police
and the hotel's management, the nonprofit Common Ground Community.
</P>
<P>
   The hotel, which provides lodging for the poor, has made
remarkable strides in recent years to transform itself from a
rodent- and drug-infested building into a spruced-up center
offering an array of social and medical services. And both sides
hope to maintain the momentum.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to send a message that we have a zero-tolerance policy
as far as illegal activities,'' said Rosanne Haggerty, executive
director of Common Ground Community.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night's raid occurred without incident as the suspects
were escorted into an unmarked police van outside the building. The
police had battering rams in tow in case they needed to break down
doors but found that most doors were open.
</P>
<P>
   Common Ground Community renovated the Times Square Hotel in 1993
and 1994. Half the building's 652 studio apartments are set aside
for the working poor; the other half are reserved for homeless
people, including those with AIDS or a history of mental illness.
</P>
<P>
   As with any kind of housing for people who have had substance
abuse or other problems, there is always a struggle to maintain
order, Ms. Haggerty said.
</P>
<P>
   Some residents say that they have complained for months about
crack dealers next door; others say that some residents have loud
parties with lots of alcohol. So they said it was about time that
the police acted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately, the goal is to evict the people if they're not
going to be receptive to the treatment programs here,'' Captain
Kelleher said of the crackdown. ``They're just squandering a great
opportunity that others could use as a stepping stone.''

 &HT;    Florida art bundled up for storm
 &HT;    By Gary Schwan
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Multimillion-dollar art collections went
under wraps throughout South Florida recently because of Hurricane
Georges.
</P>
<P>
   Literally, in the case of the Norton Museum of Art.
</P>
<P>
   The familiar statues of Acteon and Diana on the museum's facade
were shrouded with tarpaulin for protection. The museum will be
closed through the end of the storm, along with many area art
museums.
</P>
<P>
   The Norton is in a flood plain. But the art-storage facility in
its expanded building is no longer on the ground floor, said
spokesperson Sarah Flynn.
</P>
<P>
   The Flagler Museum in Palm Beach is ready to restore damaged art
year-round. It has two strategically placed carts loaded with
restoration materials such as oil absorbent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Say, you have a painting soaked in a storm,'' said director
John Blades. ``If you can apply some treatment to it right away,
you can sometimes minimize long-term damage.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the massive building, the former home of railroad pioneer
Henry Flagler, Blades said ``it has withstood two major hurricanes
in its time. I think it can get through this.''
</P>
<P>
   Water, not wind, worries Morikami Museum officials in Delray
Beach. ``Our concern is flooding because the water level of our
lake is already very high,'' said director Larry Rosensweig.
Unprotected art has been moved off the ground floor, he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the Boca Raton Museum of Art, officials were preparing to
move more than a half-dozen large metal sculptures indoors if the
storm neared the city. Some huge sculptures are bolted to concrete
and would remain outside. ``These are two- and three-ton metal
sculptures,'' said museum registrar Marc Ransdell. ``If a hurricane
can move them, we're all in trouble.''

   ROSENFELD-SHORTTAKES _ I said I wouldn't watch it. But I did, at
least about an hour of Bill Clinton's grand jury performance. I
thought it was pretty dull, which, I'd guess, is what the president
was shooting for. His strong suit was his supposed unwillingness to
kiss and tell. They say a gentleman doesn't. (Rosenfeld, Cox News
Service) MOVED THURSDAY.
</P>
<P>
   GLASS-COLUMN _ Many Americans appear ready to give the brush-off
to the relentless independent counsel. When it comes to Clinton,
they may see some troubling ``misdemeanors,'' but no genuine ``high
crimes'' that would justify his ouster. Why? (Glass, Cox News
Service) MOVED 9/24.

   KLEINBERG-COLUMN _ Howard Kleinberg's regular Sunday column
moved Thursday for immediate release. The topic was Hurricane
Georges. (Kleinberg, Cox News Service)
</P>
<P>
   KELSO-COLUMN _ AUSTIN, Texas _ The next president of the United
States? My pick would be John K. McMillan, 41, the only person I
know of who might be able to stand up to the intense personal
scrutiny elected officials have to put up with today. (Kelso,
Austin American-Statesman) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   HATCHER-COLUMN _ Last week, while the nation was distracted by
slime, Congress performed a sleight-of-hand on juvenile justice.
The House took a simple bill that would have provided money to help
reunite families with their missing children, turned it into a $1.5
billion, tough-on-crime sound bite and called it a lesson in
accountability. (Hatcher, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   YOUNG-COLUMN _ It couldn't be. Or could it? Could the nearly
mythical survival power of Bill Clinton be triggered at death's
door by what, possibly, is the lowest moment in any presidency
ever? Hard to imagine, but, here goes: The tapes backfired. (Young,
Waco Tribune-Herald) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   MCCARTY-COLUMN _ Just in case Bruce Springsteen needs any
character references to cinch his induction into the Rock and Roll
Hall of Fame, I'll go on record: He has never taken advantage of
the clause in my marriage contract stipulating my unrestricted
right to run off with His Scruffiness. (McCarty, Palm Beach Post)
MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   CERABINO-COLUMN _ This is my first cyber-hurricane. I wasn't
online in previous years, which means I didn't have access to a
vast array of knowledge and information on the screen of my home
computer. I didn't have the ability to engage in something called
``hurricane chat.'' Hurricane Georges may not be the end of the
world for us. But you could make the argument that ``hurricane
chat'' is. (Cerabino, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

   I didn't have the ability to engage in something called
``hurricane chat.''
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane Georges may not be the end of the world for us. But
you could make the argument that ``hurricane chat'' is.
</P>
<P>
   There are places on the Internet where real information from
reputable sources is available. But certainly not at an electronic
watering hole where legions of bored and nervous people gather to
yammer about a looming natural disaster.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of computer technology, as a storm approaches we
now can touch the lives of thousands of other mildly uninformed
people by swapping bad information and unwarranted panic while at
the same time trolling for members of the opposite sex.
</P>
<P>
   Unless, of course, you're in a gay hurricane chat room.
</P>
<P>
   (Editor's note: Frank, it sounds like you're saying that the
hurricane is gay. Is that what you mean?
</P>
<P>
   Note to editor: No, the ``gay'' refers to the people in the chat
group. Although, now that you mention it, hurricanes rarely go
straight.)
</P>
<P>
   You wouldn't think hurricane chat would be an excuse to pick up
women. It's hard to imagine trying to put the make on somebody with
a patio-furniture-in-the-swimming-pool question.
</P>
<P>
   But after spending lots of time in hurricane chat over the past
couple of days, I've discovered that even an approaching maelstrom
is no reason to suspend cyber-trolling operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you have a daughter my age?'' one of my cyber-companions
just blurted out during a plywood discussion.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, another communicant just started greeting
other chatters with, ``Hi, sexy.''
</P>
<P>
   And sometimes, a hurricane chatter will abandon all talk of
storm tracking and flat-out ask others to reveal their age and sex
_ making it easier to pick one off from the herd.
</P>
<P>
   My guess is that if there's an Ebola virus chat group, guys will
be on it, looking to hit on women.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, some people are actually in hurricane chat to chat
about hurricanes. Here's just a sample of the information and
opinions I was offered: 1. The hurricane is heading to Jupiter.
</P>
<P>
   2. Canned peaches are hard to find.
</P>
<P>
   3. Being stoned during a hurricane makes drowning less painful.
</P>
<P>
   4. Looters should be shot.
</P>
<P>
   5. If a hurricane wipes out your possessions, you'll get to
upgrade your computer.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the funniest bit of hurricane paranoia was exhibited by
one participant who asked everybody else: ``Who thinks it will go
to the East Coast? Press 1.''
</P>
<P>
   And then, that person counted the number of ``1's'' to determine
whether he or she should be concerned about the storm. Tracking by
popular vote.
</P>
<P>
   I confess, my plan to remain passive in these hurricane chat
groups evaporated sometime after midnight on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Some guy in Miami was asking about the best way to secure his
doggie door.
</P>
<P>
   Another person suggested he buy ``tiny sand bags from Home
Depot.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Home Depot's out of the tiny sand bags,'' I typed. ``I've got
little rollaway shutters on my dog door.''
</P>
<P>
   This began a 15-minute discussion on possible doggie door storm
protection.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of it, I was suggesting: ``Of course, when all else
fails, you can plug up the hole with the animal, itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, how low have I fallen!
</P>
<P>
   I can't wait for this hurricane to go away so I can go back to
using my computer for more edifying purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Such as reading the footnotes in the Starr report.

 &HT;    Funeral home dispute goes to mediation
 &HT;    By Denise Gamino
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A $445,000 dispute between the world's largest
funeral home company and the State of Texas is headed for
mediation.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Funeral Service Commission voted recently to send the
controversial case about alleged illegal embalming to a state
mediation program.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute has rocked the funeral home industry in Texas as
1,200 funeral homes watch to see which side will prevail: the tiny
state regulatory agency or the $2.5 billion industry powerhouse,
Service Corporation International, known as SCI.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy arose last spring after state regulators
conducted surprise inspections of two Dallas-area funeral homes
owned by SCI and found what they described as evidence of
unlicensed embalming companies operating there. Regulators also
reported finding that embalming had been performed by apprentices
without proper supervision.
</P>
<P>
   The inspections _ and additional subpoenas issued to almost two
dozen SCI homes _ angered the Houston-based funeral home company.
</P>
<P>
   Chairman Robert Waltrip hand-delivered a complaint to the
funeral commission and to Gov. George W. Bush's office.
</P>
<P>
   He accused state regulators of ``storm-trooper tactics'' and
urged that staff members be disciplined.
</P>
<P>
   But the commission staff proceeded with its investigation of
SCI, and last month a commission panel recommended fines of
$445,000 against 23 SCI funeral homes and funeral directors. The
fines would be the largest penalty ever imposed by the commission.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the recommended fines, SCI informed the
commission it would ask for individual informal appeal conferences
to challenge the case against each funeral home and director.
</P>
<P>
   But SCI officials also said they would be willing to try to
resolve the dispute in mediation. The commission voted to sign a
$70-an-hour contract for mediation with the State Office of
Administrative Hearings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, it will be settled at mediation,'' said funeral
commission member Kenneth Hughes of Nacogdoches, who chaired the
committee that recommended the fines.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're happy to be going to mediation,'' said Bill Miller, an
Austin consultant hired by SCI last month to handle media
inquiries.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great way to resolve differences amicably and
completely,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The mediation may not resolve one lingering disagreement among
board members.
</P>
<P>
   The commission voted in May to reprimand its two members who
work for large, national funeral home chains _ Tommy Metcalf, an
SCI employee, and Robert Duncan of Equity Corporation
International, which is merging with SCI.
</P>
<P>
   They were accused of harassing the commission's regulators and
trying to interfere in investigations.
</P>
<P>
   At Thursday's meeting, Metcalf and Duncan addressed the
commission to deny any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I in no way threatened or intimidated (staff) of this funeral
service commission, and I most certainly did not obstruct
justice,'' Duncan said.
</P>
<P>
   Metcalf said the commission owes him an apology for maligning
his reputation and integrity. He said he had done nothing more than
challenge staff members during routine commission meetings to
verify that they had proper evidence for their cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they take this as a personal attack on them, that's their
problem,'' he said.

 &HT;    High court: Reporter was public figure
 &HT;    By Osler McCarthy
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ In an unusual case of a Waco television reporter
suing another television station for libel over his coverage of the
1993 Branch Davidian siege, the Texas Supreme Court decided that
the Waco reporter had no case.
</P>
<P>
   The court's decision _ that the Waco reporter was a ``public
figure'' _ was its first to define when someone involved in a
high-profile controversy falls into a category that makes winning a
libel case harder than someone considered a private person.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Supreme Court once again showed its commitment to
free speech and free press,'' said Dallas media lawyer Chip
Babcock, a former newspaper reporter who defended television
personality Oprah Winfrey in her suit earlier this year for
violating Texas' so-called veggie libel law.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the court hit the nail on the head,'' Babcock said.
</P>
<P>
   John McLemore, who covered the raid at the Branch Davidian
compound, alleged that Dallas television station WFAA and one of
its reporters defamed him in a story on speculation that the
Davidian sect members were tipped off to federal agents' raid of
the sect's Mount Carmel headquarters. McLemore sought $15 million.
</P>
<P>
   Four agents of the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms
and three sect members died in the raid that began a protracted
standoff that ended in fiery destruction of the compound that
killed 76 sect members.
</P>
<P>
   The court, in a unanimous opinion, held that a television
reporter was a public figure when _ as in McLemore's case _ the
reporter interjected himself into the controversy surrounding the
news event.
</P>
<P>
   McLemore, one of the few journalists who reported live from the
raid, was at the Davidian compound when federal agents stormed it
early in the morning on Feb. 28, 1993.
</P>
<P>
   In the decision, Justice Deborah Hankinson wrote that McLemore
was a public figure because he ``clearly voluntarily interjected
himself into the controversy'' over why the raid failed. Hankinson
determined that McLemore entered the compound when other reporters
did not and said McLemore portrayed himself to other reporters as a
hero by risking being shot to assist wounded federal agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``By reporting live from the heart of the controversial raid,
McLemore assumed a risk that his involvement in the event would be
subject to public debate,'' Hankinson wrote.
</P>
<P>
   McLemore, who now works for a Waco life insurance company, said
he was merely covering the story and responding to federal agents
who asked him to help with the wounded. ``If that's interjecting
myself into the story, I don't get it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   McLemore said he probably would appeal to the U.S. Supreme
Court.
</P>
<P>
   Being deemed a public figure, McLemore would have to prove that
WFAA's reporter knew what she reported was false or that she was
reckless about whether it was true.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Supreme Court said McLemore could not prove that.
</P>
<P>
   McLemore alleged that reporter Valeri Williams _ now a reporter
with ABC News _ libeled him by reporting that federal agents
claimed Waco reporters were hiding in trees at the compound before
the attack began.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' story repeated an allegation told to ABC's
``Nightline'' program by Houston Chronicle reporter Kathy Walt that
authorities believed Waco reporters tipped the Branch Davidians to
an impending raid.
</P>
<P>
   McLemore also sued Walt and the Chronicle, but he dismissed them
from the suit before trial.
</P>
<P>
   The trial judge refused to dismiss the suit against Williams and
WFAA. The Texas Court of Appeals in Waco upheld the judge's
refusal.

 &HT;    Do teens read? Kind of
 &HT;    By Rachel Sauer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   So there was this enormous white whale that was driving the
obsessive-compulsive Captain Ahab insane, and this guy Ishmael
wrote all about out.
</P>
<P>
   You know, Ishmael, as in ``Call me Ishmael.'' As in the first
line of ``Moby Dick.'' By Herman Melville. Come on, surely you've
heard of it.
</P>
<P>
   OK, how about this: In a moment of spiritual blindness, King
Lear booted out his good daughter, Cordelia, trusted his sneaky
daughters, Regan and Goneril, and eventually paid for it in a big,
big way.
</P>
<P>
   A big way. It was terrible. He went crazy and died. Is any of
this ringing a bell?
</P>
<P>
   Sigh. Never mind. Go back to your Gameboy or soccer practice or
Must-See TV or whatever and let the pundits wring their hands and
gnash their teeth and despair about how teenagers today just don't
read.
</P>
<P>
   Don't they?
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it's not that simple. Do teenagers read? The answer
is, well, kind of. Maybe. Some do, some don't. And because there is
growing alarm in national educational circles about the general
state of literacy in America today, some of that concern is
distilled onto teenagers, the group too old to be forced to read
and on the cusp of becoming reading or non-reading adults.
</P>
<P>
   According to the National Assessment of Educational Progress, in
1994 approximately 24 percent of high school seniors surveyed said
they read for fun almost every day, while 27 percent reported never
or hardly ever reading for fun. In the same survey, 45 percent of
fourth-graders said they read for fun almost every day.
</P>
<P>
   So somewhere between ages 9 and 17, 21 percent of America's
youth stop reading for fun almost every day, and by the later teen
years a person's reading habits are basically set, said Dr.
Elizabeth Moje, an assistant professor of literacy, language and
learning disabilities at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor.
She has conducted extensive national research on the reading
practices of at-risk youth.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I think teenagers today do read, actually, sometimes quite
avidly, but they don't read all of the things that their teachers
might value or the things we might deem to be classics,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But still, approximately 76 percent of high school seniors don't
read for fun almost every day. That's a lot. And with Mesa County's
estimated functional illiteracy rate at about 28 percent of all
adults, that's worrisome. And that leads to a lot of finger
pointing by older generations that these kids today just don't read
as much as they did when they were young.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wonder about that, though,'' said Lorena Thompson, who
teaches English and literature at Grand Junction High School. ``Did
older generations really read that much more when they were
teenagers?''
</P>
<P>
   Josh Gumpert, 15, said that might be possible, but only because
there were fewer distractions 50 years ago than there are today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over time things have changed,'' he said. ``There's so much
more entertainment now, computers, TV, the Internet, video games.
And more of us have jobs and play sports. A lot of times we don't
have time to read.''
</P>
<P>
   Clara Brown, 17, agreed: ``Time is a constant issue. We don't
have time to read for fun because we're already reading so much for
school. Most of us like to read,'' she said, indicating the rest of
the students in her advanced placement English class, ``but we're
doing so many other things in addition to school.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, today's teenagers are part of a generation that grew up
using a day planner. Because of modern conveniences people have
more leisure time than in previous eras, said Al Kreinberg, a
language arts and social studies teacher at R-5 High School, but
those increased leisure hours are increasingly packed with things
to do.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why, unlike previous generations, teenagers now are
victims of stress and must find ways of coping with it. Perhaps
that is why they frequently turn to the television to relax and
unwind, said Shaina Kaufman, 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think when you've been in school all day, you want to come
home and veg out,'' Kaufman said. ``You watch TV and it's easy, you
don't have to think or worry about whether you're understanding.''
</P>
<P>
   But TV is commonly seen as contributing to the abysmal reading
scores on national standardized proficiency tests. According to the
National Center for Educational Statistics, 25 percent of high
school seniors tested scored below the basic reading level in 1994.
That same report said there is a direct correlation between TV
viewing and reading proficiency. The more TV a teen watches, the
less likely he or she is to be a proficient reader.
</P>
<P>
   Still, though, some teenagers are reading. About 24 percent of
high school seniors surveyed in a 1994 National Assessment of
Educational Progress study said they read for fun once or twice a
week, if not every day. So coupled with the 24 percent who read for
fun almost every day, almost 50 percent of America's high school
seniors read for fun at least once a week.
</P>
<P>
   That's still not nearly enough, most would agree, but it's a
start, Moje said. The dilemma is how to satisfy a generation of
teenagers who grew up with instant gratification, who know if one
thing doesn't appeal to them they can push a button and have dozens
of other choices. It's that sound-bite mentality that confounds
people who don't relate to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be able to relate to the things I read, to be
interested in them. There's nothing worse than a boring book,''
said Mandy Bottger, 17.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most realistic and worldly generation in a while,
teenagers need to see how what they read is going to be useful to
them or at least entertain them without being boring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the key to getting teenagers to read is if it grabs
their interest right off,'' said Sue Ann Thompson, teen librarian
at the Mesa County Public Library's main branch. ``If it speaks to
them they'll read it, and it doesn't matter how long it is if it's
something they can identify with.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is why a humanities teacher at a District 51 high school
took ``The Agony and the Ecstasy'' by Irving Stone off the required
reading list for a humanities class, causing some literary purists
to weep. The students wouldn't read it, maybe out of laziness,
``but more because students couldn't relate to it,'' said Marcia
Beuscher, 17.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that is yet another shameful hallmark of dumbed-down
school curricula and a non-existent student work ethic, but Moje
emphasized that ``teenagers are reading a lot, but they don't
necessarily read or write the kinds of things valued in schools.''
</P>
<P>
   In her research, Moje said she has found that teenagers like
popular magazines and comic books and popular paperbacks by V.C.
Andrews, Tom Clancy and Stephen King. If the point is to get teens
to read words strung together into sentences, then they're doing
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reading is like a sport,'' said Brian Hurd, 15. ``You do it if
you're interested. There are always going to be people who just
don't like to read.''
</P>
<P>
   And most teenagers agree that they don't like having books
forced on them. So an adult shoving a copy of ``War and Peace'' in
a teenager's face and saying read it, for the love of all things
holy, because it's a classic and we should love the classics isn't
exactly a good motivator. Which isn't to underestimate the
classics, but if the mystique was removed and they were presented
as having real life applications, maybe more teenagers would want
to read them, Kaufman said.
</P>
<P>
   And if teens could talk about the dangers of modern
relationships instead of having to memorize the exact chronology of
Miss Havisham's descent into lunacy in ``Great Expectations,'' that
might be more successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're forced to memorize facts and then have to do a book
report or something, it stops being fun,'' said Audra Price, 15.
</P>
<P>
   Sue Ann Thompson agreed: ``You can lead a teenager to the
library but you can't make him read,'' she laughed, citing teens
who come in on their own because someone has said something about a
book that piqued their curiosity or because they developed an
interest in something and want to read more about it.
</P>
<P>
   Again, not to make things easier for students or take away their
educational responsibility, but they want to talk about a book and
understand it, said Kathryn Winkleblack, 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being able to discuss a book with somebody who's read it
really helps me,'' said Desiree Harris, 15.
</P>
<P>
   Having parents or friends who encourage reading also helps, said
Robert Gilmar, 17.
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents always read, always had books for us when I was
little, and that really helped me love reading,'' said Sarah
Whitehurst, 15.
</P>
<P>
   Educational and literacy experts agree that a love of reading
begins at birth, with parents reading to their children daily,
telling stories, having books around the home, visiting the library
and setting an example by reading themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers can help, too, by having story time, which Michelle
Hays, 14, said was her particular favorite, and doing things to get
kids thinking about books, to get them interested and engaged in
their reading, Moje said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you discuss a book, get kids to see how it can apply to
their lives, see how it's exciting and interesting, that will help
kids learn to love reading,'' Moje said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teachers should not assign reading that will not benefit
students in some way,'' Lorena Thompson said. ``Teachers should
give them a reason to read it. Some will choose not to and they
will fail, but it will be an informed choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Lorna Shanks, 15, said adults need to be more informed about the
reading teenagers are doing. That means not underestimating the
value of what they read on the Internet, which Kreinberg said is
becoming a huge source of reading material for his students, or
even in comic books.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some things teens read for pleasure outside of school are
really devalued,'' Moje said. ``Things like comic books. I've tried
to read them and I don't understand them, I can't make sense of
them. It's a really sophisticated literary practice to be able to
understand these, their multiple layers of text and being able to
follow all of it. Some of them are really challenging pieces of
text.''
</P>
<P>
   And if all else fails, bribery never hurts: Ellen Hardy said her
parents offered her $5 for each book she reads during the summer.
Julia Berry, 17, said her mother buys her a new book as soon as she
finishes the previous one.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that goes for adults, too,'' laughed Kristin Smith, 15.
``There's that contest with Oprah's Book Club that if you read the
book you could win lunch with Oprah. My mom reads those books every
month.''
</P>
<P>
   But back to the main question: Do teenagers read? The answer is
not as much as they should for the their own futures and the good
of society, but there's hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``While it's true that maybe our teenagers aren't reading in the
same way that the generation before us read, they're still reading
and they need to be encouraged to read a wide variety of things,''
Moje said. ``That doesn't mean throw the classics out, but it means
we need to expand our repertoire of reading.''
</P>
<P>
   So maybe teenagers could relate better to the pride of man
trying to dominate nature and himself in Jon Krakauer's ``Into Thin
Air'' more than Melville's ``Moby Dick.''
</P>
<P>
   And the mighty fall of King Lear? Check out popular magazine
articles about President Clinton.

MEN POSING AS UTILITY WORKERS PREY ON ELDERLY AT HOME 
</HEADLINE>
  (gm) 
 By MICHAEL COOPER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It begins with frantic knocking and doorbell-ringing,
and the elderly Brooklynites who answer are met by men in hard hats
and fluorescent-orange vests, carrying crackling walkie-talkies.
The men claim to be from ``the water company'' and warn of a nearby
water main break and the possibility of flooding, broken gas lines
and contaminated tap water. They ask, in urgent tones, to come
inside to check the pipes.
</P>
<P>
   But these men do not work for any utility, the police said.
Rather, they are a sophisticated team of thieves who have used
their disguises and tales of impeding emergency to enter, ransack
and rob at least 20 homes in Brooklyn in the last month.
</P>
<P>
   Like many con artists, the police said, they prey on the elderly
_ so far, the victims of the scam have all been between the ages of
70 and 92.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Salvatore Magaddino of the Brooklyn Robbery Squad said that
four men posing as utility workers have carried out the robberies,
mostly in Bensonhurst and Bay Ridge but some in Coney Island,
Flatbush and Park Slope, since Aug. 20. Some people have been
robbed of as much as $4,000, he said, and many lost favorite
heirlooms.
</P>
<P>
   Among the victims was Iole Cascio, a piano teacher who said she
was in her 70s and whose Bensonhurst home was hit on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``One rang the bell and I said, `Who is it?''' she recalled
Thursday. ``They said, `We're here to check your water _ there's
been a break on 63d Street. Have you drunk any water today? Has
anyone gotten sick?'''
</P>
<P>
   As the two men continued to speak, Mrs. Cascio recalled, they
walked into her house.
</P>
<P>
   ``One went upstairs with my daughter and said that he needed to
check for any discoloration in the bathtub,'' she said. ``The other
took me out to test a hose. He said I had to hold the hose while he
looked at the water. I was holding that hose for 15 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   While she held the hose, she said, the man kept talking, telling
her that he had been a plumber, that he likes the sun, that he
sleeps with two blankets. He told her that the utility company
would pay her $23 for her troubles, she said.
</P>
<P>
   At one point he began speaking into his walkie-talkie in a
language Mrs. Cascio did not recognize. When she asked, he told her
it was Hungarian. A few minutes later he went back inside, met his
partner at the bottom of the stairs, and walked out.
</P>
<P>
   Then Mrs. Cascio saw what had happened. Her closet was open, her
dresser had been emptied, and her rooms had been ransacked. Some
money and keepsakes were missing, she said, but she has yet to
tally the extent of her loss.
</P>
<P>
   She figures that while the former plumber kept her busy at the
hose and his partner kept her daughter in the upstairs bathroom,
their accomplices went through her house.
</P>
<P>
   The police are looking for four men between the ages of 25 and
50 who are all tall and heavyset. After several homes were hit on
Aug. 27, he said, the police distributed thousands of warning
fliers at centers for the elderly in southern Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, the police said another robbery with the same
modus operandi occurred at 3:20 p.m. Four men wearing yellow hard
hats entered a home in Bensonhurst on the pretense of repairing a
water main, and, as one of the men took the home's elderly
occupants to the basement, the others ransacked the home, making
off with $1,600 and jewelry, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   The next time the robbers strike, Magaddino said, the aviation
unit plans to send a police helicopter to track their getaway. The
robbers hit five homes on Wednesday, the police said, and one 911
caller said the men fled in a red van.

 &HT;    Storm-panicked Floridians outward bound
 &HT;    By Stephanie Desmon
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alicia Medina is afraid, she'll tell you that right off.
</P>
<P>
   The Kendall woman survived Hurricane Andrew. (Her house didn't.)
So under sunny skies, she loaded up her husband, their three
children and the photos and videotapes they've collected since 1992
and started heading north.
</P>
<P>
   She had no intention of sticking around for Hurricane Georges.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're running away,'' she explained as the family stopped for
a bathroom break at the Lake Worth-West Palm Beach service plaza on
Florida's Turnpike. ``We don't know (where we're going). We're just
hearing the news as we go along.''
</P>
<P>
   Northbound traffic on the Turnpike and Interstate 95 was heavier
than usual before the storm as evacuees from Monroe, Miami-Dade and
Broward counties looked for what they considered safe places to
ride out the storm.
</P>
<P>
   Some stopped in Palm Beach County, where many hotels had to say,
``Sorry, we're full.'' Hotels and motels on the Treasure Coast also
were pretty booked.
</P>
<P>
   Occupancy rates weren't available.
</P>
<P>
   Getting out by train became impossible because Amtrak stopped
running trains south of Orlando on Sept. 24. CSX shut its tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Palm Beach International Airport continued normal operations
although a few flights were canceled, said spokeswoman Lisa Waters.
Fort Lauderdale/Hollywood International Airport closed for arriving
flights the night of Sept. 24. Miami International Airport was
still open, but some delays were expected.
</P>
<P>
   Northbound boat traffic was heavier than usual as boaters looked
for a safe place to tie down. By nightfall, however, the
Intracoastal Waterway was empty, said Officer Joseph Anderson of
the U.S. Coast Guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the people were wise enough to get off the waters,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart marinas were nearly full, with many larger boats from
Broward, Miami-Dade and Monroe counties tying up at Martin County
docks.
</P>
<P>
   In anticipation of increased auto traffic, the Florida Highway
Patrol planned to put four times as many troopers on the interstate
today. Meanwhile, transportation workers were taking down
construction signs and barricades, meaning drivers should be
careful around unmarked construction sites.
</P>
<P>
   For much of the 24th, things were calmer in Palm Beach County
than expected because no local evacuations were ordered, said Manny
Papandreas, operations manager for Palm Beach County's emergency
operations center.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're probably going right straight on through,'' he said of
the evacuees.
</P>
<P>
   And some people, he hoped, were listening to the advice he has
touted for years: You're probably safer at home. Stay there.
</P>
<P>
   Richard and Lenore Bernard, a retired couple from Kendall, tried
staying home for Andrew. The roof blew off of their house while
they huddled inside.
</P>
<P>
   They were headed to Fort Pierce and stopped for some frozen
yogurt at the service plaza. Richard likes Fort Pierce because it's
a good spot for a short getaway west or north, should the storm
shift. Lenore isn't sure anywhere is safe from Georges.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's everywhere,'' she said. ``There's no getting away from
it.''
</P>
<P>
   For Jacki Garcia of Miami, Palm Beach was far enough. She
planned to get a hotel room on the island with her husband and
Lady, her Yorkshire Terrier.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is more like a vacation,'' she said.

 &HT;    Childish response to juvenile crime
 &HT;    By Candy Hatcher
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last week, while the nation was distracted by slime, Congress
performed a sleight-of-hand on juvenile justice.
</P>
<P>
   The House took a simple bill that would have provided money to
help reunite families with their missing children, turned it into a
$1.5 billion, tough-on-crime sound bite and called it a lesson in
accountability.
</P>
<P>
   It's brilliant. Guaranteed to teach us all a lesson. Here's how
it works:
</P>
<P>
   When a child commits a crime, punish him. If he commits another,
lock him up in a state-of-the-art detention center or, better yet,
an adult prison, where he can hone his crime skills. Make his
juvenile records public so he can't get a job or a college
education. Don't provide money for counseling, mental health
treatment or job training.
</P>
<P>
   Even Florida's conservative, tough-talking corrections officials
shook their heads in disgust this week when they heard the proposal
had passed the House. They know such draconian measures don't
reduce crime. Such laws turn petty thieves and troubled adolescents
into self-absorbed, manipulative, sometimes-violent adults whose
only skill is breaking the law.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, 280 members of Congress thought it sounded good.
They didn't tack it onto a proposal to help more mentally ill
children get treatment. They didn't tack it onto a bill that would
have provided therapy for children from abusive homes. Those
proposals are still stalled.
</P>
<P>
   But this one is a winner. To hear Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Orlando,
tell it, this bill will ``show juveniles that there are
consequences for their actions.'' It will encourage states to
prosecute more children in adult court, make juvenile records
public and increase the penalties for second and subsequent
arrests. The reward for any of the 40-odd states that rewrite their
juvenile laws to conform to this legislation: part of a three-year,
$1.5 billion pot of money that will pay for more detention centers,
more prosecutors, more probation officers.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds good, right? Take a seat in the courtroom of Palm Beach
County's chief juvenile judge, Ron Alvarez. Listen as social
workers, prosecutors, defense lawyers and the judge try to help
12-year-old Dorothy. Mentally retarded and mentally ill, she is
accused of having attacked her mother while in a rage. Judge
Alvarez has seen her before.
</P>
<P>
   The social worker: ``Dorothy's primary problem is mental
health-related as opposed to being a delinquent child. The
consensus is she needs . . . something that is secure. But there's
no funding.''
</P>
<P>
   Judge Alvarez: `It's July (the beginning of the budget year).
How did you run out of money already?'
</P>
<P>
   Social services administrator: ``The treatment, annualized, is
$300,000, which is our total budget for the year.''
</P>
<P>
   Judge Alvarez: ``Do you have any idea . . . when the Legislature
is going to wake up and realize how many kids need help with mental
health services as opposed to the jail cells they keep building? .
. . This lady needs help. She doesn't need to be placed in a
facility where there's a high probability of her conduct becoming
worse. Dorothy's not a delinquent child. She needs a mental health
placement. Today.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is nowhere to put her. Congress and the Legislature
have ignored Dorothy and others like her, choosing to concentrate
instead on the 20 percent of juvenile delinquents who truly need to
be locked up and kept away from society.
</P>
<P>
   But what about the other 80 percent, who enter the criminal
justice system in need of help, not incarceration? They are
mentally ill, or addicted to drugs or alcohol. Some are grappling
with learning disabilities; others are simply struggling with
adolescence. Many have no parents at home to give guidance and
discipline and set a good example.
</P>
<P>
   Do we just lock them up and expect them to behave better when
they get out?

 &HT;    In search of a Starr-proof president
 &HT;    By John Kelso
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The next president of the United States?
</P>
<P>
   My pick would be John K. McMillan, 41, the only person I know of
who might be able to stand up to the intense personal scrutiny
elected officials have to put up with today.
</P>
<P>
   McMillan, of Austin, is not exactly what you could call a party
animal. In fact, he is the founder, and only member, of the
Progressive Prohibitionist religion.
</P>
<P>
   This is one of those churches with no building.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a real advocate of fruit juice,'' the unflamboyant
McMillan said. He would like to start up an alcohol-free zone in
Austin consisting of fruit juice parlors, health food stores and
bookstores.
</P>
<P>
   So far the groundswell for this movement has been nonexistent.
In fact, McMillan says he has created virtually no interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I put an announcement on community access television and have
had, let's see, basically no calls on it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   McMillan just isn't the kind of guy who would make this nation
look foolish by creating a scene. This guy is so dull that
sometimes he uses his compensatory and vacation time from his
clerical job with the Texas Department of Public Safety to speak
before the Austin City Council.
</P>
<P>
   A regular at council meetings, he speaks once a month on such
topics as sidewalks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I even give my phone number each time, but I haven't gotten
any calls on my speeches,'' McMillan said.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to imagine McMillan involved in a scandal, because to
create one usually takes at least two people. And I suspect when
McMillan is around, he is often the only one there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't been invited to more than one party in the last year
and a half,'' McMillan said. He amended that to say that since
March 1997 he has been invited to just four parties in the Austin
area.
</P>
<P>
   He declined going to an Academy Awards-watching affair because
``I would have been up too late.'' One party he went to occurred at
The Spaghetti Warehouse downtown.
</P>
<P>
   What was that like? ``OK. We basically just sat there at this
table, about 10 of us, and we ordered an Italian meal,'' the stolid
McMillan said.
</P>
<P>
   Even Monica Lewinsky and a side order of breadsticks couldn't
liven up that gathering.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's McMillan's sex life. Shoot, he says he didn't even
achieve what the Romans called Hankius pankerooni during the two
years he was a student at the University of Texas in the late '70s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had zero sex of any sort, not even French kissing,'' the
single McMillan said. ``The most I did was shake hands with
people.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, McMillan added, he didn't even get many phone calls to
his apartment while he was attending UT.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the calls I got were almost always wrong numbers for the
Police Department,'' McMillan said.
</P>
<P>
   So let's elect John K. McMillan as our next U.S. president.
Under the new rules, he may be the only man left qualified for the
job.

 &HT;    Celebrity crushes are (mostly) harmless . . .
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just in case Bruce Springsteen needs any character references to
cinch his induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, I'll go on
record: He has never taken advantage of the clause in my marriage
contract stipulating my unrestricted right to run off with His
Scruffiness.
</P>
<P>
   My husband worries about this quite a bit, as well he should.
Why, if Bruce spent an hour or two with me, he'd realize we're
soulmates, and leave that red-headed woman in the dust.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, I'm terribly anxious about the clause in Jim's
contract granting him the same privileges with Lena Olin (the
actress who wore that bowler hat in The Unbearable Lightness of
Being, remember?).
</P>
<P>
   I thought every couple played this
``What-celebrity-would-tempt-you-to-abandon-your-marriage-vows?''
game. It's innocent, it's entertaining, it's a bellwether of
tastes. (No second dates with a guy whose feminine ideal is Pamela
Lee Anderson or Heather-Be-Thy-Name Locklear.)
</P>
<P>
   Yet when I mentioned this custom to a friend, she gasped: ``You
tell him that?''
</P>
<P>
   Are we the only ones who talk about this stuff? After conducting
a scientific survey of my girlfriends, I have good news for all
those who fantasize about celebrities: You're not alone.
</P>
<P>
   There's even good news for those who fret about America's moral
turpitude: Half the fun is that it poses absolutely no threat to
our true loves.
</P>
<P>
   ``My almost always number one is Kenneth Branagh,'' writes
Hildegarde. ``That face, that accent, that everything else. He's
got it all and could quote me Shakespeare all day to boot. Also on
my list is Ralph Fiennes: Striking, brooding, magnetic _ you get
the picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband and I have talked about the healthiness of admiring
beauty everywhere, but only expressing that admiration with your
one and only. He says it's OK to work up an appetite as long as you
eat at home.''
</P>
<P>
   Speculates my friend Bathsheba: ``I have a greater chance of
being struck by a meteor than having celebrity sex.'' Still, she
wouldn't mind taking a gander at Paul Newman, ``although he's
getting a little long in the tooth to induce intense wantonness.''
</P>
<P>
   Fantasies are tailored to the emotional needs of the moment.
After her divorce, Penelope ``had a huge crush on Bob Vila. He
seemed like a nice, patient guy who would teach me how to hang
drywall without getting angry if I used the wrong drill bit. In my
daydreams I imagined that he would let me borrow his flannel
shirts. Maybe he'd even think I looked cute in his flannel
shirts.''
</P>
<P>
   Ophelia dares not tell her husband of her secret passion for
Peter Jennings: ``Yes, he's balding, smokes and doesn't have a good
track record with women _ but so erudite! And the way he says 'We
begin tonight. . . .' is just thrilling. He understands me, I just
know it.''
</P>
<P>
   Esmerelda goes for the dangerous type: ``I would like to spend a
weekend with Tom Petty, but my sense is that, aside from being a
brilliant musician, he is also a skinny little stoner from
Gainesville who reeks of cigarettes. . . . So I gotta say, when I
think about it, I wouldn't run away with anyone. And I've noticed
that my husband just gets better-looking all the time. I'm serious.
He looks like someone in a Nautica ad.''
</P>
<P>
   What's this? She starts out fantasizing about Tom Petty, and
ends up rhapsodizing about her husband. Hey! That's not the way the
game should be played.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe it is. What if we lived out our celebrity fantasies?
Poor Bruce. Poor Lena. How cruel it would be, were Jim and I to toy
with their affections, only to come running back to each other.

 &HT;    High court: Reporter was public figure
 &HT;    By Osler McCarthy
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ In an unusual case of a Waco television reporter
suing another television station for libel over his coverage of the
1993 Branch Davidian siege, the Texas Supreme Court decided that
the Waco reporter had no case.
</P>
<P>
   The court's decision _ that the Waco reporter was a ``public
figure'' _ was its first to define when someone involved in a
high-profile controversy falls into a category that makes winning a
libel case harder than someone considered a private person.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Supreme Court once again showed its commitment to
free speech and free press,'' said Dallas media lawyer Chip
Babcock, a former newspaper reporter who defended television
personality Oprah Winfrey in her suit earlier this year for
violating Texas' so-called veggie libel law.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the court hit the nail on the head,'' Babcock said.
</P>
<P>
   John McLemore, who covered the raid at the Branch Davidian
compound, alleged that Dallas television station WFAA and one of
its reporters defamed him in a story on speculation that the
Davidian sect members were tipped off to federal agents' raid of
the sect's Mount Carmel headquarters. McLemore sought $15 million.
</P>
<P>
   Four agents of the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms
and three sect members died in the raid that began a protracted
standoff that ended in fiery destruction of the compound that
killed 76 sect members.
</P>
<P>
   The court, in a unanimous opinion, held that a television
reporter was a public figure when _ as in McLemore's case _ the
reporter interjected himself into the controversy surrounding the
news event.
</P>
<P>
   McLemore, one of the few journalists who reported live from the
raid, was at the Davidian compound when federal agents stormed it
early in the morning on Feb. 28, 1993.
</P>
<P>
   In the decision, Justice Deborah Hankinson wrote that McLemore
was a public figure because he ``clearly voluntarily interjected
himself into the controversy'' over why the raid failed. Hankinson
determined that McLemore entered the compound when other reporters
did not and said McLemore portrayed himself to other reporters as a
hero by risking being shot to assist wounded federal agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``By reporting live from the heart of the controversial raid,
McLemore assumed a risk that his involvement in the event would be
subject to public debate,'' Hankinson wrote.
</P>
<P>
   McLemore, who now works for a Waco life insurance company, said
he was merely covering the story and responding to federal agents
who asked him to help with the wounded. ``If that's interjecting
myself into the story, I don't get it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   McLemore said he probably would appeal to the U.S. Supreme
Court.
</P>
<P>
   Being deemed a public figure, McLemore would have to prove that
WFAA's reporter knew what she reported was false or that she was
reckless about whether it was true.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Supreme Court said McLemore could not prove that.
</P>
<P>
   McLemore alleged that reporter Valeri Williams _ now a reporter
with ABC News _ libeled him by reporting that federal agents
claimed Waco reporters were hiding in trees at the compound before
the attack began.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' story repeated an allegation told to ABC's
``Nightline'' program by Houston Chronicle reporter Kathy Walt that
authorities believed Waco reporters tipped the Branch Davidians to
an impending raid.
</P>
<P>
   McLemore also sued Walt and the Chronicle, but he dismissed them
from the suit before trial.
</P>
<P>
   The trial judge refused to dismiss the suit against Williams and
WFAA. The Texas Court of Appeals in Waco upheld the judge's
refusal.

 &HT;    Water boys deliver through storm
 &HT;    By Cara Anna
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH _ A moment of applause, please, for the water
boys.
</P>
<P>
   They've been restocking grocery shelves and making extra
deliveries this week, and they're in the running with the Weather
Channel folks for Most Popular.
</P>
<P>
   They're a little modest. ``I didn't even shave today,'' says
Jeff Forschbach, rubbing his chin.
</P>
<P>
   He's a Culligan man, and he's on the road every day at 7:15 a.m.
He doesn't plan any breaks, and he might get home to Lake Worth by
nightfall to close the hurricane shutters.
</P>
<P>
   His route is the area bounded by Okeechobee, Military Trail,
Southern and Jog. He's serving regular customers, but his
900-gallon truck is ready for the unexpected.
</P>
<P>
   Like the polite request from Betty Shrewsbury, who meets him at
the door of her shuttered home. ``Can I get an extra bottle in case
of a hurricane?'' No problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's gonna happen, it's gonna happen,'' Shrewsbury says as
Forschbach heads for the truck for another five gallons. ``I'm not
gonna run from it.''
</P>
<P>
   At another stop, Forschbach shows off the note stuck in the
door:
</P>
<P>
   ``Culligan _
</P>
<P>
   Please leave three free jugs.
</P>
<P>
   Carolyn Smith.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people have been doing this,'' Forschbach says. ``I
can give them one or two. If we did this all day, we'd run out.''
</P>
<P>
   He leaves two. Aaron Smith, Carolyn's son and a student at Palm
Beach Community College, doesn't seem to care.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been here all my life,'' he says. ``Another hurricane,
whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   Another hurricane, another 72 extra calls for water, Forschbach
says. The Culligan men split the load.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know you want me to say we've brought in temps or
something,'' says Bill Bauer, general manager at Culligan's Palm
Beach County office on Military Trail. ``But we're efficient
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, even he had to leave the office on Sept. 23 for the
first time in months to make deliveries. Fourteen of them.
</P>
<P>
   In Riviera Beach, the Mountain Water Co. got 167 calls, compared
to the average 60. Bishop's Water Co. in Lake Worth has two extra
trucks making deliveries, and calls have increased about 20
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Culligan usually gets two tractor trailers of water a week from
its plant in Ocala. Now it gets one a day. The plant is working
around the clock.
</P>
<P>
   They can't ship it fast enough, Bauer says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the drivers were in by 8:30 last night.''

 &HT;    Commentary: Did tapes backfire?
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It couldn't be. Or could it? Could the nearly mythical survival
power of Bill Clinton be triggered at death's door by what,
possibly, is the lowest moment in any presidency ever?
</P>
<P>
   Hard to imagine, but, here goes: The tapes backfired. As alarmed
as Americans are over the personal revelations, so too do people
resent someone shoving this in their faces, a wall-to-wall X-rated
TV show. And, no, this wasn't ``The People's Court.'' This was an
evidentiary fishing expedition, no presumption that a word of it
would ever make it to trial. Grand juries are secret for a reason.
</P>
<P>
   Monday was like one of those coup moments in countries whose
names change every other Friday: The deposed ruler stares into the
kliegs of seized state TV. Glowing cigarettes wait off-camera to
burn star-shaped scars into his flesh until he makes a statement to
signal the takeover complete. Next, we find his body wrapped in a
blanket on a street corner, and the people dance.
</P>
<P>
   Did GOP leaders (GOP now standing for Gratuitous On-screen Porn)
expect a street dance? They didn't get it. Maybe it's the corpse
that's missing.
</P>
<P>
   The amazing thing about this is that the Republicans didn't need
to offend the country in such a way. They could have left that up
to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   You can't defend the man in this case. My steps would be lighter
if he left office tomorrow. I'd vote for resignation rather than to
hear one more apology, and, goodness gracious, not one that makes
the State of the Union five minutes longer.
</P>
<P>
   But meanwhile, since it doesn't appear the president is ready to
resign or die from his self-inflicted wounds, there is the matter
of impeachment and a moment's pause for the gung-ho crowd. It seems
a key point used to bring the Monica matter into Ken Starr's
dragnet is missing.
</P>
<P>
   Starr sold Janet Reno on the expansion of his investigation _
from Whitewater and more to a sexual relationship _ in major part
based on the presumption of evidence that Clinton asked Lewinsky to
lie and that he got her a job to shut her up.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far that evidence is not there _ not from anything Lewinsky
has testified and not from anything Clinton friend Vernon Jordan
has testified. This may simply be well-covered tracks. But Lewinsky
is steadfast on that point.
</P>
<P>
   So there was no cover-up? Of course there was. Every affair is a
cover-up. It's like burger and bun. They come together. Right,
Congressman Hyde? Congresswoman Chenoweth? Congressman Burton?
</P>
<P>
   The issue of impeachment must come down to abuse of power _ to
the extent Clinton abused his office to conceal the truth. As one
who has generally supported Clinton's policies, I must say the
notion of trotting out staffers for months to say there was nothing
to the story is as troubling as anything aside from his insanely
reckless affair itself.
</P>
<P>
   Did someone say that trotting out staffers to tell untruths is,
well, the Washington way? Sen. Phil Gramm got extra-huffy about
this. Well he should, since we know that every word his staffers
say is stack-of-Bibles stuff. Ahem.
</P>
<P>
   Many among the great unwashed watch all of this and see
hypocrisy and overkill. To many, what's been done to expose
Clinton's affair is like fighter jets clearing the barn of field
mice.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's personal actions are indefensible. So how does he
survive in public opinion?
</P>
<P>
   One had to ask the same question in 1996. How did he survive
enemies' relentless 1,460-day personal barrage in his first term?
Is it possible that with Monday's release of the grand jury tape,
as bad as he looks, those people in their zeal once again have done
the impossible _ to make a known philanderer, liar and draft dodger
from Arkansas into a sympathetic figure? Could be.

 &HT;    Woodson over hill? Nope.
 &HT;    By Chick Ludwig
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI, Ohio _ The skeptics say he has lost it. That the
knee injury he suffered in 1995 made him damaged goods. That his
place among the NFL's elite cornerbacks is no more.
</P>
<P>
   The Baltimore Ravens' Rod Woodson hears none of it. He listens
only to the voice within . . . you're the best.
</P>
<P>
   The 12-year veteran, seven-time Pro Bowler and future Pro
Football Hall of Famer earned a berth on the NFL's 75th Anniversary
Team as a member of the Pittsburgh Steelers from 1987-96.
</P>
<P>
   And just in case you think he's over the hill after spending '97
in San Francisco, try this: A week ago, he blocked a Mike Hollis
field goal in Jacksonville. Two weeks ago against the New York
Jets, he pushed his career interception total to 43, picking off
Glenn Foley twice and racing 60 yards for his sixth career
touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   For the Bengals to be successful at Baltimore on Sunday night,
they have to avoid Woodson's wrath.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rod Woodson is great,'' said Bengals defensive coordinator
Dick LeBeau, who was Woodson's defensive coach in Pittsburgh from
1992-96. ``There were games he graded out with 12 tackles, two
sacks and an interception. He's a great playmaker.''
</P>
<P>
   Ravens head coach Ted Marchibroda agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Woodson is our big-play guy on defense,'' he said. ``He's been
the guy the others look up to. They can raise their game a little
bit more because they've seen how he has played the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He still has speed. He may have lost a little bit, but you
certainly can't see it when you watch him practice or play.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his speed, intensity and playmaking ability,
Woodson has the ingredient common in great cornerbacks _ amnesia.
</P>
<P>
   You get burned. You immediately erase it from your memory and
keep attacking.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be aggressive and very, very confident,'' Woodson
said. ``It borders on the edge of cockiness. You have to be that
way. You have to think that way. You have to believe you're better
than the guy in front of you; that there's no way in the world that
guy can catch the ball on you.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to sometimes be a calculated gambler. Show me a guy
that's not a gambler, and I'll show you a corner that's not very
good. Show me a corner that's gambling, that's taking chances at
times, wise chances, playing with good fundamentals and
understanding of the game, and I'll show you a corner that has a
good opportunity to be a very good player in the NFL.''
</P>
<P>
   Woodson will cover Carl Pickens, who leads the AFC with 20
receptions. Pickens needs seven catches to overtake Cris
Collinsworth (417) as the Bengals' career receptions leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be fun to play against Carl again,'' Woodson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Is the feeling mutual?
</P>
<P>
   ``No comment,'' Pickens said.

   KEY WEST _ With their homes shuttered and their cupboards
stocked, the Florida Keys settled in to wait for Hurricane Georges.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a curfew, resilient locals from gathering at the Green
Parrot on Whitehead Street in Key West, a ring of bicycles circling
the outside bar. Several blocks away, a handful of faithful prayed
at St. Mary's By the Sea Catholic church while others hurried with
last minute chores and kept an eye on growing clouds overhead.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing you can do in times like this is prepare and
come here and pray,'' Maggie Hernandez said after lighting a candle
at St. Bernedette's grotto, a 76-year-old shrine dedicated to
protecting the island from ``the full brunt of a hurricane.''
</P>
<P>
   With Hurricane Georges expected to rebuild fast, the nation's
top hurricane forecaster said Thursday he fears ``we'll lose a lot
of folks'' ignoring an evacuation order if storm waters wash over
the flat Florida Keys.
</P>
<P>
   About 770,000 people from Key West nearly to the Tampa Bay area
were advised to flee, but there was no indication how many obeyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This storm looks like it's all set to explosively intensify
once the eye gets over water,'' said Jerry Jarrell, director of the
National Hurricane Center in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Monroe County officials said they are happy with the
evacuation efforts that began earlier in the week. Officials
estimated that 75 percent of the Keys' residents have left, though
more have stayed behind in Key West.
</P>
<P>
   By day's end, officials urged people to stay put and called all
rescue workers to duty. Deputies, police and medical staff planned
to continue answering calls until winds reach 50 mph. Virtually all
businesses were shut down and boarded up in the Upper Keys.
</P>
<P>
   If the full force of the storm does cross the Keys, the first
job for emergency officials will be to clear the highway and search
for the injured. Though helicopters will likely be used to bring in
needed supplies, keeping the highway open is considered critical
for getting help to the islands.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to take care of people, and the only way to do that
is to keep the road open,'' Powell said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials also fear that heavy rains and a surging surf will put
the highway underwater.
</P>
<P>
   Monroe County officials have already asked the state to help
coordinate additional help from other counties after the storm
passes through.
</P>
<P>
   At the Big Coppitt Key volunteer fire station, where a hurricane
flag was hoisted for the first time, firefighters squeezed tankers
sent from Big Pine, Sugarloaf Key and Key West into the station's
bay. About two dozen firefighters and their families will ride out
the storm in the station, said Deputy Chief Scott Young.
</P>
<P>
   The Monroe County Sheriff's south substation on Stock Island
became a shelter to about 190 deputies. The building, constructed
in 1993, can withstand a category 5 storm, said deputy Jerome Fain.
Nearby, another 100 corrections officers shared the 585-bed jail
with about 600 inmates, some transferred from Marathon and
Plantation facilities, and Pooch, Lt. Manuel Cuervo's drug-sniffing
Pit Bulll terrier, Cuervo said. The jail can run on a generator if
power fails and has its own water treatment facility, Cuervo said.
</P>
<P>
   About 200 elderly from the Key West Convalescent Center also
moved into jail dormitories usually occupied by inmates. Another
200 from nursing homes around the Keys were also moved to the jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can I elect to stay here?'' Mary Karhan pleaded with center
administrator Don Capoldo, as he hurried to board residents on
school buses for the move. ``I'm sick of moving, for God's sake,
all over a little storm.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Florida Keys Health Center, a volunteer crew of three
doctors and four nurses from the University of Florida Health
Science Center in Jacksonville arrived Wednesday evening to keep
the emergency room open, said Dr. David Seaberg. The team, trained
in emergency medicine and disaster management, decided to come
because so many residents decided to stay, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Seven ambulances will continue to answer emergency calls until
winds reach 45 mph, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, passengers boarded the last commercial flight from
Key West about 10 a.m. Gulfstream flew four last flights, with
about a dozen passengers on each, said spokesman Terry Deischer.
</P>
<P>
   Many fishermen gambled and left their lobster traps out in the
Gulf of Mexico, though many are likely to be lost in the storm.
Most didn't have time to pull them in, or feared they would be just
as damages when stacked up onshore.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond Bruland has 2,500 traps _ worth about $18 a piece _
floating in the Gulf. He lashed his fishing boat to seven other
fishing boats at the docks of Keys Fisheries.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a minimal storm, but we're going to ride it out,''
Bruland said. ``We're committed now.''

 &HT;    Filled with wit, charm this ``Brothers''' a keeper
 &HT;    By Kevin D. Thompson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are three things you can count on in life. Death, taxes
and at least one odd couple TV show every year.
</P>
<P>
   This season there are quite a few, but the best of the bunch is
Brother's Keeper (ABC, 9:30 p.m. Friday). Two brothers, Porter
(Herman's Head's William Ragsdale), a stuffed-shirt history
professor and Bobby (Sean O'Bryan), a bad boy San Francisco 49ers
place-kicker live together. Oh, yeah, there's also Oscar (Liar
Liar's Justin Cooper), Porter's 8-year-old kid. Named after some
guy named Oscar Madison, perhaps?
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, Porter and Oscar were doing just fine until Bobby showed
up. Seems as if the New York Jets traded their partying kicker to
the 49ers. Part of the $1 million-a-year deal is Bobby must live
with Porter and be babysat by his not-too-pleased sports agent
(Bess Meyer).
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Porter's world is turned upside down. Now, instead of
preparing his son for tests by asking him questions like, ``What's
the speed of sound?'' or ``Who was the 19th president?'' Porter now
watches his son blow game pieces from his nose.
</P>
<P>
   As Porter, Ragsdale has the thankless role of playing straight
man to O'Bryan's high school hijinks. And it's O'Bryan who makes
Brother's Keeper fun to watch.
</P>
<P>
   Whether he's nailing a net to a living room floor or blowing up
surgical gloves, the guy is hilarious. He has the same kind of
presence and manic energy as a young Robin Williams in Mork &AMP;
Mindy.
</P>
<P>
   Ragsdale's no slouch, either and knows he's not there to upstage
O'Bryan. And Cooper looks like a real kid, not one of those
assembly line sitcom tykes who sound smarter than their parents.

 &HT;    Twins make 'Two' the kind of comedy family can enjoy
 &HT;    By Kevin D. Thompson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Let's see . . . how can you double your pleasure on a ho-hum
Friday night?
</P>
<P>
   If you're 13 or under, watching the perpetually cute Olsen twins
should do the trick. The perky duo star in Two of a Kind (8 p.m.
Friday), a comedy tailor made for ABC's slate of family-friendly
kid-coms.
</P>
<P>
   It's basically Full House 2. But, instead of playing the same
person, the girls play two very distinct characters. They really
play themselves, which shouldn't be too hard, considering they've
had 12 years of practice.
</P>
<P>
   Mary-Kate is the tomboy who likes jeans, baseball and wearing
her hat backward. Ashley is the straight-A student who likes
makeup, dresses and boys.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle is Kevin (Christopher Sieber), the single science
professor dad. At least Kevin's not some thick-headed dope of a dad
who thinks the Spice Girls are something you'll find on the Playboy
Channel.
</P>
<P>
   But harried Kev still needs help. Enter Carrie (Sally Wheeler),
a free-spirit student in Kevin's class.
</P>
<P>
   What happens next is sitcom typical. The girls like Carrie.
Kevin doesn't. Kevin gives in and let's Carrie babysit. Carrie
messes up after teaching the kids poker and taking them to a Cubs
game. Kevin fires Carrie. Everyone kisses and makes up. Two of a
Kind lives.
</P>
<P>
   And it should. This is one of those comedies that is impossible
to hate. The Olsen twins, though older (and future head-turners),
are still appealing. They're cute without being make-me-want-to-gag
cute. Even Kevin and Carrie make you want to go, ``Awwwww.''
</P>
<P>
   And Two of a Kind should make you _ and your kids _ laugh.

 &HT;    An annual second chance: Yom Kippur's solemn day of atonement
not child's play
 &HT;    By Scott Benarde
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   On the most memorable Yom Kippur holiday of my childhood, I was
playing with friends outside a synagogue in Edgeware, England, a
suburb of London. (It's tough for kids in any country to sit in the
sanctuary and pay attention during the longest, most solemn day of
prayer in Judaism.)
</P>
<P>
   It was my turn to use the slingshot one of the kids brought to
services. We had been trying to hit a telephone pole across the
street.
</P>
<P>
   I placed a pebble in the sling, pulled it back, took careful aim
at the pole, let fly _ and shattered the front windshield of a
shiny red van on the lot of an automobile dealership.
</P>
<P>
   On the Day of Atonement, on the final day of the 10 Days of Awe
when mortals seek forgiveness and are asked to be forgiving, when
God decides ``who shall live and who shall die,'' I scored a direct
hit on a clean, curved sheet of glass with a small,
harmless-looking stone.
</P>
<P>
   I ran back into the synagogue thinking my life was over at the
ripe age of 10. Not because God was going to strike me dead, but
because I'd be doing time in an English jail. I don't think I yet
understood the full meaning of the holiday.
</P>
<P>
   Yom Kippur is not for kids. At least not like Hanukkah, with its
exciting candle-lighting ritual and gift giving; Purim with its
costume parties and games; Passover with its seder and hunt for the
Afikomen, the middle matzo, and the prize for finding it; Sukkot
with its sleeping under the stars.
</P>
<P>
   Even the beginning of the 10 Days of Awe, Rosh Hashana, the New
Year, can boast the first, dramatic blasts of the shofar, a ram's
horn. It's a joy for children to watch and hear. But it is a
stirring wake-up call for adults, the beginning of a 10-day period
of introspection and review, which ends on Yom Kippur.
</P>
<P>
   Atonement is not child's play.
</P>
<P>
   On Yom Kippur, you fast and pray. All day. The other major
holidays are festive and celebrated with friends and family.
</P>
<P>
   On Yom Kippur, while you pray and chant with a congregation,
you're really out there on your own. The cantor with his soulful
chanting, the rabbi with his Torah explanations and sermons, are
but guides setting mood and tone to help you on your way.
</P>
<P>
   Yom Kippur is just you and God.
</P>
<P>
   You take a good, honest look in the mirror. You reflect on the
year and pray you've been worthy enough to be inscribed in the Book
of Life for another year. (Sometimes I think it's akin to Ebeneezer
Scrooge being visited by the Ghost of Christmas Past, except Yom
Kippur forces the issue; Jews don't wait for such visits.)
</P>
<P>
   Yom Kippur is an annual second chance.
</P>
<P>
   We seek forgiveness for a multitude of sins great and small: We
have trespassed, dealt treacherously, robbed, spoken slander, acted
perversely, done wrong, done violence, practiced deceit, counseled
evil, spoken falsehood, scoffed, and more. We have gone astray and
led others astray. And that's just the short list.
</P>
<P>
   As a congregation, as a people across the globe, we're not just
asking forgiveness, but admitting _ repeatedly _ a litany of flaws
and wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   The long list also includes sinning against God willingly and
unwillingly, by hardening our hearts, by disrespecting parents and
teachers, by foul speech and foolish talk, by bribery, idle gossip
and false pride. And more.
</P>
<P>
   We pray for compassion and forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   I also pray for self-improvement _ and fear regression and
hypocrisy.
</P>
<P>
   For me, the most important prayer is one my father sent me seven
years ago. It's not even a prayer, really. It's a ``supplemental
reading'' at the back of the Mahzor, the prayer book used on Rosh
Hashana and Yom Kippur. It's called We Wait Too Long.
</P>
<P>
   It's about the biggest sin of all: Squandering the time we have
on earth.
</P>
<P>
   It's also about finding the courage to do the right thing when
it needs to be done: being charitable, or loving or kind,
apologizing, setting aside hatreds, being thankful, offering
comfort to others, being parents to our children.
</P>
<P>
   It begins, ``We often wait too long to do what must be done
today, in a world that gives us only one day at a time, without any
assurance of tomorrow.'' It ends with, ``God, too, is waiting _
waiting for us to stop waiting, and to begin to do now, all the
things for which this day was made.''
</P>
<P>
   I carry this passage in my wallet, reading it from time to time.
I still have a lot of work to do. I still need an annual second
chance.
</P>
<P>
   Now more than ever.
</P>
<P>
   This year, our son is almost 15 months old, not the 3-month-old
lump he was last year at this time. He's curious. He expresses a
sense of awe and delight each Friday when we light the Shabbat
candles in our home. This is really year 1 in his Jewish life.
</P>
<P>
   This is the time I have to start thinking about keeping
slingshots out of his hands and putting a love of Judaism in them.
</P>
<P>
   A READING FROM THE NEW MAHZOR
</P>
<P>
   We often wait too long to do what must be done today, in a world
which gives us only one day at a time, without any assurance of
tomorrow. While lamenting that our days are few, we procrastinate
as though we had an endless supply of time.
</P>
<P>
   We wait too long to discipline ourselves and to take charge of
our lives. We feed ourselves the vain delusion that it will be
easier to uproot tomorrow the debasing habits which we permit to
tyrannize over us today, and which grow more deeply entrenched each
day they remain in power.
</P>
<P>
   We wait too long to work at the self-renewal of which these holy
days remind us. While we wait, our lives become progressively
depleted of spiritual content. The estrangement between us and our
heritage grows larger and more painful.
</P>
<P>
   We wait too long to become more deeply involved in Jewish life _
in Jewish observance and in Jewish study. While we wait, the time
for the harvest comes and we haven't even planted.
</P>
<P>
   We wait too long to show kindness. We wait too long to speak
words of forgiveness which should be spoken, to set aside hatreds
which should be banished; to express thanks, to give encouragement,
to offer comfort.
</P>
<P>
   We wait too long to be charitable. Too much of our giving is
delayed until much of the need has passed and the joy of giving has
been largely diminished.
</P>
<P>
   We wait too long to be parents to our children _ forgetting how
brief is the time during which they are children, how swiftly life
urges them on and away. We wait too long to express our concern for
parents, siblings, and dear ones.
</P>
<P>
   We wait too long to read the books, to listen to the music, and
to see the art which are waiting to enlarge our minds, to inspire
our spirits, and to ennoble our souls.
</P>
<P>
   We wait too long to utter the prayers which are waiting to cross
our lips, to perform the duties waiting to be discharged, to show
the love that may no longer be needed tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   God, too, is waiting _ waiting for us to stop waiting, and to
begin to do now, all the things for which this day was made.

<P>
   ROSENFELD-SHORTTAKES _ I said I wouldn't watch it. But I did, at
least about an hour of Bill Clinton's grand jury performance. I
thought it was pretty dull, which, I'd guess, is what the president
was shooting for. His strong suit was his supposed unwillingness to
kiss and tell. They say a gentleman doesn't. (Rosenfeld, Cox News
Service) MOVED THURSDAY.
</P>
<P>
   GLASS-COLUMN _ Many Americans appear ready to give the brush-off
to the relentless independent counsel. When it comes to Clinton,
they may see some troubling ``misdemeanors,'' but no genuine ``high
crimes'' that would justify his ouster. Why? (Glass, Cox News
Service) MOVED 9/24.
</P>
<P>
   TEEPEN-COLUMN _ Tom Teepen is on vacation. His column will
resume next week. (Teepen, Cox News Service)
</P>
<P>
   KLEINBERG-COLUMN _ Howard Kleinberg's regular Sunday column
moved Thursday for immediate release. The topic was Hurricane
Georges. (Kleinberg, Cox News Service)
</P>
<P>
   KELSO-COLUMN _ AUSTIN, Texas _ The next president of the United
States? My pick would be John K. McMillan, 41, the only person I
know of who might be able to stand up to the intense personal
scrutiny elected officials have to put up with today. (Kelso,
Austin American-Statesman) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   HATCHER-COLUMN _ Last week, while the nation was distracted by
slime, Congress performed a sleight-of-hand on juvenile justice.
The House took a simple bill that would have provided money to help
reunite families with their missing children, turned it into a $1.5
billion, tough-on-crime sound bite and called it a lesson in
accountability. (Hatcher, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   YOUNG-COLUMN _ It couldn't be. Or could it? Could the nearly
mythical survival power of Bill Clinton be triggered at death's
door by what, possibly, is the lowest moment in any presidency
ever? Hard to imagine, but, here goes: The tapes backfired. (Young,
Waco Tribune-Herald) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   MCCARTY-COLUMN _ Just in case Bruce Springsteen needs any
character references to cinch his induction into the Rock and Roll
Hall of Fame, I'll go on record: He has never taken advantage of
the clause in my marriage contract stipulating my unrestricted
right to run off with His Scruffiness. (McCarty, Palm Beach Post)
MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   CERABINO-COLUMN _ This is my first cyber-hurricane. I wasn't
online in previous years, which means I didn't have access to a
vast array of knowledge and information on the screen of my home
computer. I didn't have the ability to engage in something called
``hurricane chat.'' Hurricane Georges may not be the end of the
world for us. But you could make the argument that ``hurricane
chat'' is. (Cerabino, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

   FLU _ The flu shot just got easier to take _ testing of the
first oral flu pill has been completed and the results are good.
Hoffman LaRoche's pill significantly reduces the incidence of
influenza and works in treating it, too, reducing the duration of
illness and the severity of symptoms. The company made the

Paxson Communications (AMEX: PAX, $9.75) launched last month, will

   TEENS-READING _ Do teenagers read? The answer is, well, kind of.
And because there is growing alarm in national educational circles
about the general state of literacy in America today, some of that
concern is distilled onto teenagers, the group on the cusp of
becoming reading or non-reading adults. (Sauer, Grand Junction
Daily Sentinel) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   WHALEY_ Emily Whaley, whose 1997 book, ``Mrs. Whaley and Her
Charleston Garden,'' won the hearts of gardeners and non-gardeners
alike because of her candid outlook on life after 80, is still
making headlines. Whaley, who died this summer, has a new book
coming out in October, ``Mrs. Whaley Entertains,'' in which she
demonstrates how to enjoy yourself _ and make the best of your home
and garden _ while planning and throwing a party. As more folks tap
into her insight and her memory endures (the Charleston Garden
Festival is dedicated to next month), we talk to acquaintances
about her many contributions during a rich life. (Flanders ,

   YOM-KIPPUR-REPENT_ Yom Kippur. It's the most sacred day on the
Jewish Calendar, and literally means, Day of Atonement. Bill
Clinton recently said he has ``repented,'' even quoting from the
liturgy used by Jews during Yom Kippur services. But does saying
you're sorry really mean you've repented. We explore the concept of
forgiveness, atonement and repentence, focusing on the president
and the news of the day, but including a theological and historical
perspective. (White, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) ETA: 5 p.m.

GIULIANI STEPS UP CRITICISM OF DRUG CZAR OVER METHADONE CARE 
</HEADLINE>
  (gm) 
 By DAN BARRY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Several months ago, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani wrote
to Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey, the White House drug policy director,
in part to express pride that New York City's drug policy was
consistent with the national strategy. The mayor closed with, ``I
look forward to an opportunity to discuss these issues in person.''
</P>
<P>
   But the two men never had that discussion, and since then have
quarreled _ through the news media _ over the merits of methadone
treatment, a debate prompted two months ago by the mayor's
declaration that he wanted to curtail and eventually end the city's
role in providing methadone to heroin addicts.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the mayor personalized his criticism of the
general, calling him a ``disaster'' of a drug czar who prefers
providing subsidies to the methadone industry to weaning people
from dependence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if those doctors or General McCaffrey were dealing
with their own children or the people they loved, they wouldn't
have them on methadone,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In response, McCaffrey said his staff was being told by city
officials that the administration was actually modifying its
position on methadone treatment, after several internal discussions
and a flurry of complaints that its stand defied medical research
on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Calling Giuliani one of the most effective mayors in the
country, McCaffrey said: ``I can't imagine a responsible individual
would actually go through with it, now that he's got an
overwhelming pulse from an informed community that's said, `Don't
go this way.' This is a smart guy who will be held responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   City officials deny that they have retreated or modified their
plan, which is intended to move the 2,100 addicts who come to city
hospitals for methadone toward abstinence as quickly as possible.
But many details of the approach have yet to be worked out. And
while the mayor has continued to talk tough on the subject, other
officials have emphasized that the program will be flexible enough
to meet the needs of individual addicts.
</P>
<P>
   The city has programs at Bellevue, Elmhurst, Harlem, Kings
County and Metropolitan Hospital Centers that offer methadone, a
synthetic drug that has been used for more than a generation to
curb the cravings of heroin addicts.
</P>
<P>
   According to Dr. Luis R. Marcos, president of the city's Health
and Hospitals Corp., it now considers only those applicants who
express a desire for abstinence, and has stopped admitting those
``who do not see the option of abstinence, because we believe that
it would be unfair to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Marcos also said that the patients have been evaluated for their
ability to be weaned off methadone voluntarily through a support
program being developed by the city. ``At least half of these
patients will be entering the program,'' he predicted, although he
said the process might take about three months for many and longer
for others.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Neal L. Cohen, the city's health commissioner, emphasized
that the program's model, which is still being developed, will be
designed to address individual needs. ``There's no cookie cutter
here,'' he said. ``There's no one-size-fits-all.''
</P>
<P>
   But administration officials are vague in discussing what will
happen to patients who cannot or will not quit methadone. Marcos
said, ``We will not deny to anyone who needs the methadone or who
doesn't feel ready to enter an abstinence program.'' But other
officials suggested that patients would not be allowed to continue
in the program indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Parrino, the president of the American Methadone Treatment
Association, said that he and other drug-policy analysts had met
with the city's health officials last month, and were told that
``there was going to be some attempt to provide education to the
Mayor for a more informed policy decision.''
</P>
<P>
   But after the mayor's incendiary remarks yesterday, he said, ``I
don't have a clue.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, who has been applauded at Republican fund-raisers
around the country for his scathing comments about McCaffrey and
methadone use, said that the federal official favored subsidizing
the replacement of one drug with another at the expense of Phoenix
House, Daytop Village and other abstinence-model programs.
</P>
<P>
   But McCaffrey said that his office had substantially helped
those programs, and that while he agreed ``that the best objective,
when it can be achieved, is abstinence,'' he thought that Giuliani
had adopted a ``ready-fire-aim policy analysis.''
</P>
<P>
   Methadone, he said, is a scientifically proven approach to
stemming heroin addiction, transforming addicts who commit crimes
into people who work and otherwise benefit society. ``The mayor's
public stance on this issue is irrational and would create such
damage to life,'' he said.

FACING SUIT, SCHOOL ENDS DRUG TESTING OF ATHLETES 
</HEADLINE>
  (gm) 
 By ROBERT HANLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HACKENSACK, N.J. _ The school board in Ridgefield Park, N.J.,
has decided to end its policy of random drug testing of student
athletes rather than engage in a long and costly court fight over
whether the policy is legal under the New Jersey Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   As part of a settlement with the parents of a high school
football player who contended the policy violated the State
Constitution's protections against illegal searches and seizures,
Ridgefield Park will adopt voluntary drug testing for all students
in grades 7 through 12 and retain the right to test any student if
school officials have a ``reasonable suspicion'' the student has
used drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The school superintendent, David Rightmyer, said today that the
decision, made on Wednesday night, would allow the board to spend
hundreds of thousands of dollars it would have spent on legal fees
for the educational needs of the district's 1,744 students. ``If
it's going to take years for us to get there,'' Dr. Rightmyer said
of a lengthy court fight, ``why not let the battle be fought with
someone else's funds?''
</P>
<P>
   Judge Sybil R. Moses of New Jersey Superior Court approved the
settlement here Thursday and dismissed a lawsuit filed in August
1997 by the American Civil Liberties Union on behalf of Bryan
Wilson, a senior who plays offensive end on Ridgefield Park's
football team, and his parents, Robert and KamaRae Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   ``To us, it seemed like Big Brother was telling us how to raise
our children,'' Wilson said of the district's mandatory urinalysis
policy. He said that if student athletes could be required to
undergo drug testing, the board might then begin testing students
in particular religious or ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
   He said he endorsed the voluntary testing program the settlement
allows. ``There has to be something to stop a kid who's doing
drugs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   David Rocah, a lawyer with the ACLU, said the settlement would
have no bearing on other New Jersey districts with similar testing
policies because the challenge dealt only with the policy at
Ridgefield Park.
</P>
<P>
   At least eight other districts in the state require the tests,
including Clearview Regional, Washington Township and West Deptford
in Gloucester County; North Bergen in Hudson County; Clifton in
Passaic County; Pennsauken in Camden County, Hunterdon Central in
Hunterdon County and Brick Township in Ocean County, according to
the New Jersey School Boards Association.
</P>
<P>
   Rightmyer said the settlement did not disturb other elements of
an aggressive antidrug policy instituted at Ridgefield Park High
four years ago when, he said, the use and sale of drugs was
widespread at the school.
</P>
<P>
   The policy includes using drug-sniffing dogs to search students'
lockers, stationing undercover police officers in classes and on
school grounds and lengthy suspensions of any students caught using
or selling drugs. Six were suspended in the first two years of the
crackdown, Rightmyer said. No students have been caught in the last
two years.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Moses had ordered the random testing program suspended
shortly after the challenge was filed.

 &UR; (800 words) &QL;

   Breast irregularities send the author, not yet 40, for her first
mammogram. In the waiting room she finds the peculiar intimacy and
comraderie of women facing the same fears. ``In a week, or a month,
we won't recognize each other on the street. But today, in this
place, there is a truth we both know: We are all in this
together,'' Rubenstein writes. (slugged:

 By JACQUELINE RUBENSTEIN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    I am sitting in a room with at least 18 other women, all of us
in standard-issue gowns. We are of varying ages, ethnicity, and
economic standing. We are in varying states of dismay, fear and
apprehension. We are here because of our breasts.
 &HT;    This is my first mammogram. Some irregularities noted while
nursing my baby have prompted my visit, making me, nearing 40, one
of the youngest women in the room. Soon, another woman who looks
about my age comes in and sits next to me, acknowledging me with
worried eyes _ only a problem would have brought us here before the
recommended time.
 &HT;    All of us here have our stories _ if not our body's own, than
that of a close friend, sister, mother, aunt, cousin, friend of
friend, mother of friend. Someone who has found a lump or been told
of a spot, and who has had to enter the world we all now fear to do
battle, endure, survive _ or not. Regardless of our ages or reasons
for being here, it is impossible not to be nervous.
 &HT;    We sit, for the most part, silently, thumbing distractedly
through magazines, watching the parade of womanhood pass in and out
of the various rooms. One group of older women has clearly come
together, strength in numbers. They have brought their knitting and
sit companionably around a table, chatting and counting stitches,
losing track as one or the other of them is brought in for an exam
or consultation.
 &HT;    As we take our turns at the machine (this will only hurt for a
second, dear, a bit of pressure is all) and come back to wait for
our results, we note who goes in before and after us _ each of us
tracking our potential for bad news by the order and flow of our
companions. As name after name is called, the woman next to me and
I exchange glances more frequently, certain at last that many who
were examined after us have been given leave to go.
 &HT;    ``This is how my mother found out,'' she confides, finally.
``Everyone else was coming and going, but they needed to take more
time with her.''
 &HT;    ``Maybe our charts are just in a pile that hasn't been picked up
yet,''I offer inanely, trying to stem the panic that is rising in
us both.
 &HT;    We are silent again, and I pull my robe closer around me,
feeling the protrusions that have brought me here. They have marked
other stages of my life _ their small size the bane of my
adolescence, their sudden growth the first sign of my pregnancy,
their ability to produce nourishment for my baby an endless wonder.
 &HT;    Finally, I am called in and receive good news _ the
irregularities are nothing more than that, unremarkable changes
that can occur with pregnancy and nursing. I come out with a smile
and am greeted with a thumbs-up from my acquaintance.
 &HT;    ``Walk right on out of here,'' she says. ``Don't stop.''
 &HT;    I start to follow her advice but find I cannot leave without
her. We have not even exchanged names, and, if her news is bad, she
may not want or find comfort in a stranger's presence. But still I
linger in the dressing room, making small adjustments, peeking into
the waiting room, until I see her being summoned. When she comes
out, her face is awash in relief _ her mother's fate not yet, if
ever, her own.
 &HT;    She is at first surprised to find me waiting for her, but then
we self-consciously laugh and grasp hands tightly in understanding.
In a week, or a month, we won't recognize each other on the street.
But today, in this place, there is a truth we both know: We are all
in this together.

   &UR; EDITORS: The New York Times Syndicate looks at bilingualism,
politics and celebrity in its Hispanic Heritage Month (Sept.
15-Oct. 15) package. Two articles examine how assimilation has
altered the attitude of many Hispanics toward their native language
and culture. An article from Hispanic magazine describes how the
GOP is cultivating the Hispanic vote after getting a shellacking in
the 1996 election. Finally, we offer a three-part excerpt from the
autobiography of TV superstar Christina Saralegui.

   More and more English is creeping into Spanish-language
television these day. It's a tacit acknowledgement that an
increasingly large percentage of the Hispanic population is heavily
assimilated and speaks English often and well. This trend is also
reflected, Zate notes, in magazines such as the bilingual Latina
and in advertising. (slugged:

</P>
<P>
   ``I now speak my native language with an accent,'' best-selling
novelist Julia Alvarez declares in this lyrical and touching essay
from her forthcoming book. After Alvarez emigrated from the
Dominican Republic in the 1960s, her English became fluent as her
Spanish become dormant, a reflection of the growing distance
between herself and her native culture. ``It wasn't until I failed
at first love, in Spanish, that I realized how unbridgeable that
gap had become,'' she writes. (slugged:

</P>
<P>
   In the 1996 presidential race, only 21 percent of the Latino
vote went to GOP candidate Bob Dole. With Hispanics and other
minorities making up an increasingly large percentage of the
electorate, the Republican Party is recognizing the need to win
over a constituency that associates the GOP with English-only,
anti-immigrant policies. One step in this effort is the formation
last year of the New Majority Council. (slugged:

 &UR; (3 parts, 1,200 words each) &QL; 
 &UR; By CRISTINA SARALEGUI &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; From ``My Life as a Blonde,'' published by Warner Books &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She is the host of the most-watched TV program in the world _
Cristina Saralegui, the Cuban refugee who worked her way to the top
of the publishing world, then switched to television to create the
``El Show de Cristina,'' viewed daily by 100 million worldwide. Her
story, told in three 1,200-word parts, will inspire anyone to do
more with what they have. Born into wealth and ease, Cristina lost
it all when her family fled to Miami during Castro's revolution.
She defeated racism and poverty with an undaunted will to work and
to believe in her own dreams. Her mission in this book is to show
her readers how to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   In Part 1, Cristina tells of the family's flight to Miami and
how hardships in this country transformed her from a little rich
girl to a compassionate and supremely confidant businesswoman. In
Part 2, Cristina recounts the romance of meeting Marcos Avila of
Miami Sound Machine and of how they overcame her family's
resistance to her marrying a rock star 11 years her junior. In Part
3, Cristina describes her new life in TV, the grueling pace, the
seductions of fame and influence. (slugged:

 &HT;    While channel surfing on a Sunday night, a familiar face pops up
on the TV screen. It's Giselle Fernandez, former anchor of ``NBC
Nightly News'' and currently anchor of the entertainment show
``Access Hollywood.''
 &HT;    She greets an enthusiastic crowd with the usual pleasantries,
and then slips the phrase ``muy caliente'' into her monologue. She
continues to speak in English and then drops another Spanish word.
She introduces her guest, actress Maria Conchita Alonso.
 &HT;    You check the channel. This isn't ``Access Hollywood.'' The show
is ``Cafe Ole with Giselle Fernandez'' and it's on Galavision, a
Spanish-language cable network.
 &HT;    But she's speaking English. Wait a minute, what's going on here?
 &HT;    Welcome to bilingual television. English-language format and
content are gaining a foothold in a market once occupied solely by
Spanish media. From TV programming to magazines and radio,
bilingual and English-language media continue to grow as a way to
reach the Hispanic market.
 &HT;    Consider recent news items: Emilio Estefan plans to produce a
Latin-themed, English-language TV program for Universal Television
Group.
 &HT;    Latina magazine, a national bilingual women's magazine backed by
the publishers of Essence, switches from quarterly to monthly
distribution.
 &HT;    The Los Angeles Times announces plans to capture more Hispanic
readers, perhaps through a special Hispanic section in English.
 &HT;    In radio, several stations in the top 10 media markets use a
bilingual format with ratings success.
 &HT;    Why this growth in English and bilingual media?
 &HT;    ``It's the next logical step of the evolution of the Latino
population in the U.S.,'' says Alex Nogales, president of the
National Hispanic Media Coalition in Los Angeles.
 &HT;    As immigration laws tighten, and as the second- and
third-generation population increases, marketers and programmers
will focus on capturing the attention of the assimilated and
acculturated Hispanics, he explains.
 &HT;    In fact, the impetus behind Galavision's decision to air
bilingual programming lies in the success of another show that
celebrates assimilation and acculturation. Last year Galavision
began running a weekly half-hour bilingual show called ``Que Pasa
U.S.A.,'' a situation comedy that first aired on PBS in Miami back
in the '70s. The show represents a microcosm of what's happening in
the Hispanic media landscape.
 &HT;    ``Que Pasa U.S.A.'' features a Cuban family, with members from
three generations living under one roof.
 &HT;    ``It's about their experience in trying to retain their culture
and also to assimilate,'' says Michelle Bella, director of
marketing and communications for New York-based Galavision, the
cable network of Univision Communications Inc. in Miami. Galavision
reports that it reaches 7.5 million homes in the United States.
 &HT;    When Galavision first started airing ``Que Pasa U.S.A.,'' the
Nielsen ratings showed that it connected with viewers. This alerted
network executives to try more bilingual programming.
 &HT;    ``Until now, the English-dominant and bilingual crowd has
largely been ignored on TV,'' says producer Jeff Valdez, who along
with partner Bruce Barshop co-manage Si TV, the company that
produces ``Cafe Ole.'' Based in Culver City, Calif., Si TV produces
English-dominant and bilingual programming with Latino appeal.
 &HT;    According to the latest census information on language use at
home, assimilated Hispanics represent about 54 percent of the
Hispanic market. Data from 1990 show that 46 percent of Hispanics
speak Spanish and also speak English ``very well.'' Another 8
percent speak no Spanish. There are 26 percent who speak
predominantly Spanish and don't speak English well or not at all.
The remaining 20 percent say they speak both Spanish and English
``well.''
 &HT;    ``So far, (Hispanic) programming has pulled only from the
Spanish-dominant side,'' Valdez says. The new Galavision fare
creates ``a more competitive programming environment,'' he
believes.
 &HT;    But programming goes beyond language, emphasizes Barshop at Si
TV.
 &HT;    ``It's not just about language. It's also about programming
produced in the U.S.,'' he says. ``Most Spanish-language programs
come from South America and Mexico. Si TV is about recognizing the
cultural difference.''
 &HT;    Coverage of Hispanic culture in English has proven successful
for publishers, as exemplified by the bilingual women's magazine
Latina in New York. Latina publisher Christy Haubegger says she
chose a bilingual format to reflect the assimilated Latina in the
United States. No other magazine addressed the market in this way,
she says.
 &HT;    ``As a second generation Mexican-American who is bilingual,
reading in Spanish is very difficult,'' she says. ``And the
magazines published in Latin America don't relate to my life here
in the U.S.''
 &HT;    Thousands of women appear to share Ms. Haubegger's perceptions.
Latina debuted in May 1996 as a quarterly and this year changed to
monthly distribution. The magazine reports an unaudited circulation
of 300,000. According to Ms. Haubegger, Latina has attracted
high-end advertisers that previously had never placed ads in
Hispanic media.
 &HT;    ``We are the only Hispanic advertising that Ralph Lauren has
ever done, and that the Gap and Tommy Hilfiger has ever done,'' she
says.
 &HT;    Latina illustrates the growing support among advertisers for
English-language Hispanic media. However, many Hispanic advertising
agencies feel threatened by the use of English in the Hispanic
market. But the agencies created this problem in the first place,
says Nogales at the National Hispanic Media Coalition.
 &HT;    ``For years these agencies have been telling advertisers that
they will deliver the Latino market. And they've been telling
clients the only way to do it is to reach them in Spanish,'' he
says. ``They decided to put everything into the Spanish-speaking
game and now they're reaping what they sowed. These agencies are
going the way of the dinosaurs.''
 &HT;    The advertiser's message, including its language, must fit the
target audience.
 &HT;    Levi's, the San Francisco-based clothing manufacturer, launched
its first bilingual ads this summer for its jeans. Created by
Bromley, Aguilar &AMP; Associates in San Antonio, the ads, which ran on
Univision and Telemundo in Los Angeles and Houston, feature young
Hispanics who speak mostly Spanish with some English.
 &HT;    Michelle Vasquez, marketing manager at Levi's, says research
showed bilingual ads were the best way to reach the product's
target market _ young males ages 15 to 25.
 &HT;    ``We looked at the census data and found that 74 percent of this
group are bilingual,'' she says.
 &HT;    Despite an increase in English media that targets Hispanics,
Spanish-language advertising will continue to keep growing, says
Alejandro Ruelas, director of ethnic marketing at Anheuser-Busch in
St. Louis.
 &HT;    ``I think the political climate and the anti-Hispanic
initiatives out there will instill more pride in our people and
ultimately bring us back to our language,'' he says. ``There's the
growth of retro acculturation where a lot of Hispanics are making
an active effort to learn Spanish and consume Spanish-language
media. The Spanish language is here for the long haul and it will
continue to grow by leaps and bounds.''
 &HT;    So far, broadcast heavyweights Univision and Telemundo don't
perceive a threat on the language front. In fact, Univision
recently asked McDonald's to re-edit its latest TV commercial
``English Lessons'' for the air. The spot contained too much
English dialogue.
 &HT;    Univision accepts only all-Spanish advertising, says a company
spokeswoman in Los Angeles.
 &HT;    ``Our success comes from ads and programs being 100 percent
Spanish. Our viewers keep coming back because they are most
comfortable with that programming,'' she says.
 &HT;    At least one man is confident that Hispanics welcome culturally
relevant English media.
 &HT;    ``I've been getting (negative) comments about the viability of
targeting this market since the beginning,'' says Valdez at Si TV.
 &HT;    ``I say to those people, `Laugh all you want to now, but the
times, they are a-changing.'''

 By JULIA ALVAREZ  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 Excerpted from ``Something to Declare,'' published by Algonquin
Books  
 &HT;    The inevitable, of course, has happened. I now speak my native
language ``with an accent.'' What I mean by this is that I speak
perfect childhood Spanish, but if I stray into a heated discussion
or complex explanation, I have to ask, ``Por favor, puedo decirlo
en ingles?'' Can I please say it in English?
 &HT;    How and why did this happen?
 &HT;    When we emigrated to the United States from the Dominican
Republic in the early 1960s, the climate was not favorable for
retaining our Spanish. I remember one scene in a grocery store soon
after we arrived. An elderly shopper, overhearing my mother
speaking Spanish to her daughters, muttered that if we wanted to be
in this country, we should learn the language.
 &HT;    ``I do know the language,'' my mother said in her
boarding-school English, putting the woman in her place. She knew
the value of speaking perfect English. She had studied for several
years at Abbot Academy, flying up from the island to New York City,
and then taking the train to Boston.
 &HT;    At school, there were several incidents of name-calling and
stone-throwing, which our teachers claimed would stop if my sisters
and I joined in with the other kids and quit congregating together
at recess and jabbering away in Spanish. Those were the days before
bilingual education or multicultural studies _ when kids like us
were thrown in the deep end of the public school pool and left to
fend for ourselves. Not everyone came up for air.
 &HT;    Mami managed to get us scholarships to her old boarding school
where good manners and tolerance and English skills were required.
We were also all required to study a foreign language, but my
teachers talked me into taking French. In fact, they felt my
studying Spanish was equivalent to my taking a ``gut course.''
Spanish was my native tongue, after all, a language I already had
in the bag and would always be able to speak whenever I wanted.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, with Saturday drills and daily writing assignments,
our English skills soon met school requirements. By the time my
sisters and I came home for vacations, we were rolling our eyes in
exasperation at our old-world Mami and Papi, using expressions like
``far out,'' and ``what a riot!'' and ``outta sight'' and ``believe
you me'' as if we had been born to them.
 &HT;    As rebellious adolescents, we soon figured out that conducting
our filial business in English gave us an edge over our strict,
Spanish-speaking parents. We could spin circles around my mother's
``absolutamente no'' by pointing out the flaws in her arguments, in
English.
 &HT;    My father was a pushover for pithy quotes from Shakespeare, and
a recitation of ``the quality of mercy is not strained'' could
usually get me what I wanted.
 &HT;    Usually. There were areas we couldn't touch even with a
Shakespearean 10-foot pole _ the area of boys and permission to go
places where there might be boys, American boys, with their mouths
full of bubblegum and their minds full of the devil.
 &HT;    Our growing distance from Spanish was a way in which we were
setting ourselves free from that old world where, as girls, we
didn't have much say about what we could do with our lives. In
English, we didn't have to use the formal ``usted'' that
immediately put us in our place with our elders. We were
responsible for ourselves and that made us feel grown-up.
 &HT;    We couldn't just skirt culpability by using the reflexive: The
bag of cookies did not finish itself, nor did the money disappear
itself from Mami's purse. We had no one to bail us out of American
trouble once we went our own way in English. No family connections,
no tio (uncle) whose name might open doors for us.
 &HT;    If the world was suddenly less friendly, it was also more
exciting. We found out we could do things we had never done before.
We could go places in English we never could in Spanish, if we put
our minds to it. And my sisters and I put our combined four minds
to it, believe you me.
 &HT;    My parents, anxious that we not lose our tie to our native land,
and no doubt thinking of future husbands for their four daughters,
began sending us ``home'' to the Dominican Republic every summer to
Mami's family in the capital.
 &HT;    And just as we had once huddled in the school playground,
speaking Spanish for the comfort of it, my sisters and I now hung
out together in ``the D.R.,'' as we referred to it, kibitzing in
English on the crazy world around us, the silly rules for girls,
the obnoxious behavior of macho guys, the deplorable situation of
the poor.
 &HT;    My aunts and uncles tried unsuccessfully to stem this tide of
our Americanization, whose main expression was, of course, our use
of the English language.
 &HT;    ``Tienen que hablar en espanol,'' they commanded. ``Ay, come
on,'' we would say as if we had been asked to go back to baby talk
as grown-ups.
 &HT;    By now, we couldn't go back as easily as that. Our Spanish was
full of English. Countless times during a conversation, we were
corrected, until what we had to say was lost in our saying it
wrong. More and more we chose to answer in English even when the
question was posed in Spanish.
 &HT;    It was a measure of the growing distance between ourselves and
our native culture _ a distance we all felt we could easily retrace
with just a little practice. It wasn't until I failed at first
love, in Spanish, that I realized how unbridgeable that gap had
become.
 &HT;    He was a honey-skinned young man with wonderful dimples and a
pot belly that made him look like a Dominican version of the
Pillsbury doughboy. His name was Manuel Gustavo, but I
affectionately nicknamed him Mangu, after a mashed plantain dish
that is a staple of Dominican diet.
 &HT;    A few days after meeting him, Mangu's mother sent over an
elaborate dessert with lots of white frosting that looked
suggestively like a wedding cake.
 &HT;    When I tried to talk to Mangu about something of substance, the
conversation foundered. I couldn't carry on in Spanish about
complicated subjects, and Mangu didn't know a word of English. Our
silences troubled me. Maybe, my aunts were right. Too much
education in English could spoil a girl's chances in Spanish.
 &HT;    Evenings, Mangu would come over, and we'd sit on the patio and
try to make conversation or drive out to the country club in his
father's car to dance merengue and see what everyone else was
doing. What we were doing was looking for people to fill up our
silence with their talk.
 &HT;    I never had a Spanish-only boyfriend again. Maybe the
opportunity never presented itself, or maybe it was that as English
became my dominant tongue, too many parts of me were left out in
Spanish for me to be able to be intimate with a potential life
partner in only that language.
 &HT;    Still, the yearning remained. How wonderful to love someone
whose skin was the same honey-dipped, sallow-based color, who said
``concho'' when he was mad and ``cielito lindo'' when he wanted to
butter you up!
 &HT;    ``Ay, to make love in Spanish ...'' the Latina narrator of
Sandra Cisneros' story ``Bien Pretty'' exclaims. ``To have a lover
... whisper things in that language crooned to babies, that
language murmured by grandmothers, those words that smelled like
your house.''
 &HT;    But I wonder if after the Latina protagonist makes love with her
novio, she doesn't sit up in bed and tell him the story of her life
in English with a few palabritas thrown in to capture the rhythm of
her Latin heartbeat?

 c.1998 Hispanic magazine  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   On Sept. 16, 1997, a group of Republicans met in a conference
room at the Marriott Hotel in downtown Washington, D.C., to launch
the party's latest program to enlist minorities. The meeting ended
on an upbeat note, but it had started with a lot of soul-searching
and apologies.
</P>
<P>
   The sense was that Republicans were running out of chances with
Latino voters. This time they vowed they would get it right.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the hosts _ Republican National Committee chair Jim
Nicholson and co-chair Patricia Harrison _ the attendees included
House Speaker Newt Gingrich, Sen. Ben Knighthorse Campbell
(R-Colo.), Rep. Henry Bonilla (R-Texas), Rep. J. C. Watts (R-Okla.)
and some prominent minority Republicans who had been enlisted to
lead the new charge.
</P>
<P>
   It had been almost a year since the Republicans had received one
of their worst thrashings from the Democrats in the presidential
elections. The Latino vote had flexed its muscle in almost total
repudiation of the Republican presidential candidate and platform.
</P>
<P>
   Months later some Latino communities still rankled with
anti-Republican sentiment. Warning signs flashed all over the
Republican domain.
</P>
<P>
   An unsolicited report prepared by Republican pollster Frank Lunt
stated, ``Our majority is at stake. Republicans barely maintained
their congressional majority in 1996, and a major reason their
support dropped from 1994 was the utter collapse of the Hispanic
vote.''
</P>
<P>
   The report concluded, ``The Hispanic vote is up for grabs, and
it is up to individual Republican candidates to say in plain
English and prove by their actions that they deserve it.''
</P>
<P>
   Party strategist Stu Spencer, in a memo to California GOP
leaders, warned that they would be committing ``political suicide''
if they continued to alienate Hispanics instead of courting what
many party philosophers contend are natural allies.
</P>
<P>
   Citing Hispanic disenchantment, Spencer added, ``The trend is
obvious, and the political danger is real. We are dramatically
losing market share of the fastest growing segment of the
electorate.''
</P>
<P>
   The RNC is concerned about its political standing with Hispanics
but not necessarily impressed with the Luntz and Spencer
appraisals, which an RNC spokesperson considered exaggerated and
overly alarmist.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, if such ominous warnings sound like Chicken Little
to some, the party leaders now seem to accept that the sky could
fall on them if they don't move more decisively and intelligently
to rebuild their minority constituency, particularly Hispanics, to
the heights of the Nixon and Reagan years.
</P>
<P>
   Banking on a new vehicle to attract minorities to the party, the
GOP unveiled the New Majority Council at the September meeting. It
sounds and looks a bit like Jesse Jackson's Rainbow Coalition,
encompassing Hispanics, African Americans, Asian Americans and
Native Americans in a collegial effort with the emphasis on the
word ``majority,'' which the Republicans say foretells the future
status of the ethnic electorate.
</P>
<P>
   On the Hispanic side, statistics tell it better. Today's U.S.
population is 72.5 percent non-Hispanic white and 27.5 percent
minority, with Hispanics making up 11 percent. According to the
U.S. Census, within 50 years the adult population will transform
into 52.8 percent non-Hispanic white and 47.2 percent minority,
with Hispanics making up 24.5 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
   RNC co-chair Harrison says, ``We have to stop minority thinking
because we are now talking about a new majority. It's up to us to
move toward people we want at the table and not up to the people to
find the table.''
</P>
<P>
   She credits the late Lee Atwater, the former RNC chairman and
premier political swami, as the originator of this idea. Atwater
was developing what he called the ``big tent'' for the Republicans
at the time of his death, and Harrison says she is just building on
this concept.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the NMC will achieve its goal is another matter. The
council's message of ``heritage, hope and opportunity'' is not
exactly revolutionary, and it relies on the GOP's basic planks of
family values, quality education, crimefighting, entrepreneurship
and less government.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bonilla, who is emerging as the Republicans' Latino star,
says Latinos, by virtue of their culture and values, are ready-made
Republicans, but the party has been slow to mine this bountiful
lode of voters. He credits his own success to dogged community
outreach.
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla is a three-term Republican congressman from an area long
known as a Democratic power base. He was the first Latino
Republican congressman elected from Texas, and he has won each
contest with 60 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla attributes his success to delivering the right message _
the Republican message, not a specially crafted Hispanic one _
personally to his constituents and listening to their concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to show up at these communities as I do,'' he says.
``I try to get this across to our people, but it's the hardest
thing to make them understand that it's not hard to do and that we
don't have to change our message or our values.''
</P>
<P>
   To start making inroads with Hispanics, the GOP must overcome a
notoriously bad reputation of late for antagonizing Hispanics. The
Republicans are also known for constantly shooting themselves in
the foot on Latino sensitivities.
</P>
<P>
   The Pete Wilsons and Bob Dornans of the party don't help.
Neither do the issues of immigration, affirmative action and
English-only, all attributed to Republican politics.
</P>
<P>
   In the last presidential campaign, the Republican candidate, Bob
Dole, practically ignored the Hispanic constituency. Latinos
responded in kind by helping Clinton clobber him, delivering 72
percent of the Latino vote to the president. Hispanics nationwide
voted 21 percent for Dole, the lowest support among Hispanics for
any presidential candidate in the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic congressional candidates also got 72 percent of the
Hispanic vote.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans contend that the Dole shellacking was an aberration.
They insist that better measures of Republican-Latino affinity are
Richard Nixon, the first candidate to seriously court the Latino
vote, and the Great Communicator, Ronald Reagan, still a hero to
many Latinos. Both won the Hispanic vote by large margins,
generating the largest Latino turnouts in a presidential election
up to now.
</P>
<P>
   Republican strategists point out that Latinos will respond to
the right message and messenger. They cite mayoral races in two
cities with large Hispanic populations.
</P>
<P>
   New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani received 40 percent of the
Hispanic vote, and Richard Riordan of Los Angeles got 48 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, who is building a
large Hispanic following that supporters are confident will
mushroom into a national constituency if he decides to run for
president.
</P>
<P>
   If Democrats have dominated the Latino constituency, it is
largely because they are better _ a lot better _ at exploiting the
issues and playing to Latino emotions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Latinos have no problem with voting Republican,'' says Arturo
Vargas, executive director of the National Association of Latino
Elected Officials Educational Fund, which counts 5,400 members.
``They have shown it in the past, like in l984, when they gave
Reagan over 40 percent of their vote. It means the Republican Party
has the potential to attract Latinos. The Republicans have to
examine what has succeeded and what has driven Latinos away.''
</P>
<P>
   Antonio Gonzalez, president of the Willie C. Velasquez
Institute, suggests that the GOP was punished in 1996 by Latino
voters for its so-called extremist positions, but it doesn't mean
that Latinos have banished it forever.
</P>
<P>
   ``1998 will be the measure of whether this is a long-term trend;
I don't think it is,'' he says. ``The issues will not be the same,
and if you examine the polling trends, many Latinos consider
themselves undecided or independent.''
</P>
<P>
   A Tomas Rivera Policy Institute poll that asked if Latino voters
``lean'' toward Democrats, Republicans or ``neither way,'' 64
percent in California, 67 percent in Florida and 69 percent in
Texas gave the last answer.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans and their NMC are aware of Latino voting
tendencies by now, but since gaining a majority in Congress in
1994, Republicans have provided proof for critics who say the party
is anti-Latino.
</P>
<P>
   Every bit of English-only legislation was sponsored by a
Republican, and welfare and immigration reforms were spearheaded by
Republicans. If the Republican Party can acknowledge past mistakes
and make an honest effort to win Latinos to its style of
government, it's in for better times.
</P>
<P>
   If it fails once again, the consequences will again be
self-inflicted, and, many predict, long-lasting.

 c.1998 Hispanic magazine  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   On Sept. 16, 1997, a group of Republicans met in a conference
room at the Marriott Hotel in downtown Washington, D.C., to launch
the party's latest program to enlist minorities. The meeting ended
on an upbeat note, but it had started with a lot of soul-searching
and apologies.
</P>
<P>
   The sense was that Republicans were running out of chances with
Latino voters. This time they vowed they would get it right.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the hosts _ Republican National Committee chair Jim
Nicholson and co-chair Patricia Harrison _ the attendees included
House Speaker Newt Gingrich, Sen. Ben Knighthorse Campbell
(R-Colo.), Rep. Henry Bonilla (R-Texas), Rep. J. C. Watts (R-Okla.)
and some prominent minority Republicans who had been enlisted to
lead the new charge.
</P>
<P>
   It had been almost a year since the Republicans had received one
of their worst thrashings from the Democrats in the presidential
elections. The Latino vote had flexed its muscle in almost total
repudiation of the Republican presidential candidate and platform.
</P>
<P>
   Months later some Latino communities still rankled with
anti-Republican sentiment. Warning signs flashed all over the
Republican domain.
</P>
<P>
   An unsolicited report prepared by Republican pollster Frank Lunt
stated, ``Our majority is at stake. Republicans barely maintained
their congressional majority in 1996, and a major reason their
support dropped from 1994 was the utter collapse of the Hispanic
vote.''
</P>
<P>
   The report concluded, ``The Hispanic vote is up for grabs, and
it is up to individual Republican candidates to say in plain
English and prove by their actions that they deserve it.''
</P>
<P>
   Party strategist Stu Spencer, in a memo to California GOP
leaders, warned that they would be committing ``political suicide''
if they continued to alienate Hispanics instead of courting what
many party philosophers contend are natural allies.
</P>
<P>
   Citing Hispanic disenchantment, Spencer added, ``The trend is
obvious, and the political danger is real. We are dramatically
losing market share of the fastest growing segment of the
electorate.''
</P>
<P>
   The RNC is concerned about its political standing with Hispanics
but not necessarily impressed with the Luntz and Spencer
appraisals, which an RNC spokesperson considered exaggerated and
overly alarmist.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, if such ominous warnings sound like Chicken Little
to some, the party leaders now seem to accept that the sky could
fall on them if they don't move more decisively and intelligently
to rebuild their minority constituency, particularly Hispanics, to
the heights of the Nixon and Reagan years.
</P>
<P>
   Banking on a new vehicle to attract minorities to the party, the
GOP unveiled the New Majority Council at the September meeting. It
sounds and looks a bit like Jesse Jackson's Rainbow Coalition,
encompassing Hispanics, African Americans, Asian Americans and
Native Americans in a collegial effort with the emphasis on the
word ``majority,'' which the Republicans say foretells the future
status of the ethnic electorate.
</P>
<P>
   On the Hispanic side, statistics tell it better. Today's U.S.
population is 72.5 percent non-Hispanic white and 27.5 percent
minority, with Hispanics making up 11 percent. According to the
U.S. Census, within 50 years the adult population will transform
into 52.8 percent non-Hispanic white and 47.2 percent minority,
with Hispanics making up 24.5 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
   RNC co-chair Harrison says, ``We have to stop minority thinking
because we are now talking about a new majority. It's up to us to
move toward people we want at the table and not up to the people to
find the table.''
</P>
<P>
   She credits the late Lee Atwater, the former RNC chairman and
premier political swami, as the originator of this idea. Atwater
was developing what he called the ``big tent'' for the Republicans
at the time of his death, and Harrison says she is just building on
this concept.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the NMC will achieve its goal is another matter. The
council's message of ``heritage, hope and opportunity'' is not
exactly revolutionary, and it relies on the GOP's basic planks of
family values, quality education, crimefighting, entrepreneurship
and less government.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bonilla, who is emerging as the Republicans' Latino star,
says Latinos, by virtue of their culture and values, are ready-made
Republicans, but the party has been slow to mine this bountiful
lode of voters. He credits his own success to dogged community
outreach.
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla is a three-term Republican congressman from an area long
known as a Democratic power base. He was the first Latino
Republican congressman elected from Texas, and he has won each
contest with 60 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla attributes his success to delivering the right message _
the Republican message, not a specially crafted Hispanic one _
personally to his constituents and listening to their concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to show up at these communities as I do,'' he says.
``I try to get this across to our people, but it's the hardest
thing to make them understand that it's not hard to do and that we
don't have to change our message or our values.''
</P>
<P>
   To start making inroads with Hispanics, the GOP must overcome a
notoriously bad reputation of late for antagonizing Hispanics. The
Republicans are also known for constantly shooting themselves in
the foot on Latino sensitivities.
</P>
<P>
   The Pete Wilsons and Bob Dornans of the party don't help.
Neither do the issues of immigration, affirmative action and
English-only, all attributed to Republican politics.
</P>
<P>
   In the last presidential campaign, the Republican candidate, Bob
Dole, practically ignored the Hispanic constituency. Latinos
responded in kind by helping Clinton clobber him, delivering 72
percent of the Latino vote to the president. Hispanics nationwide
voted 21 percent for Dole, the lowest support among Hispanics for
any presidential candidate in the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic congressional candidates also got 72 percent of the
Hispanic vote.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans contend that the Dole shellacking was an aberration.
They insist that better measures of Republican-Latino affinity are
Richard Nixon, the first candidate to seriously court the Latino
vote, and the Great Communicator, Ronald Reagan, still a hero to
many Latinos. Both won the Hispanic vote by large margins,
generating the largest Latino turnouts in a presidential election
up to now.
</P>
<P>
   Republican strategists point out that Latinos will respond to
the right message and messenger. They cite mayoral races in two
cities with large Hispanic populations.
</P>
<P>
   New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani received 40 percent of the
Hispanic vote, and Richard Riordan of Los Angeles got 48 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, who is building a
large Hispanic following that supporters are confident will
mushroom into a national constituency if he decides to run for
president.
</P>
<P>
   If Democrats have dominated the Latino constituency, it is
largely because they are better _ a lot better _ at exploiting the
issues and playing to Latino emotions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Latinos have no problem with voting Republican,'' says Arturo
Vargas, executive director of the National Association of Latino
Elected Officials Educational Fund, which counts 5,400 members.
``They have shown it in the past, like in l984, when they gave
Reagan over 40 percent of their vote. It means the Republican Party
has the potential to attract Latinos. The Republicans have to
examine what has succeeded and what has driven Latinos away.''
</P>
<P>
   Antonio Gonzalez, president of the Willie C. Velasquez
Institute, suggests that the GOP was punished in 1996 by Latino
voters for its so-called extremist positions, but it doesn't mean
that Latinos have banished it forever.
</P>
<P>
   ``1998 will be the measure of whether this is a long-term trend;
I don't think it is,'' he says. ``The issues will not be the same,
and if you examine the polling trends, many Latinos consider
themselves undecided or independent.''
</P>
<P>
   A Tomas Rivera Policy Institute poll that asked if Latino voters
``lean'' toward Democrats, Republicans or ``neither way,'' 64
percent in California, 67 percent in Florida and 69 percent in
Texas gave the last answer.
</P>

</P>
<P>

Republicans. If the Republican Party can acknowledge past mistakes
and make an honest effort to win Latinos to its style of
government, it's in for better times.
</P>
<P>
   If it fails once again, the consequences will again be
self-inflicted, and, many predict, long-lasting.

 By CRISTINA SARALEGUI  
 From ``My Life as a Blonde'' 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    It isn't easy to be rich.
 &HT;    Everyone wants the people who make it to have started at the
bottom. I didn't start at the bottom, I must admit.
 &HT;    My grandfather was a millionaire. In Cuba he was called the
Paper Czar because he was co-owner of the most important magazines
on the island and also held the monopoly for selling paper.
 &HT;    I was born in Miramar, a wealthy suburb of Havana, where
everyone's main worry was to make sure that during hurricane season
his yacht was secured at the club. I lived in Miramar until we had
to emigrate to Miami in 196O, shortly after Fidel Castro's
revolution had overthrown the dictator Fulgencio Batista.
 &HT;    In the United States, I faced something I had never known:
prejudice. In those early days there were not many Latinos in
Miami. And even though I was blond, with light eyes, my accent and
behavior were unmistakably foreign to the ``natives.''
 &HT;    I didn't understand why I was called ``spic,'' until someone
explained that the word came from the way a Spanish speaker
pronounces the word ``speak,'' shortening the vowel to spic. But
then I couldn't understand why they said, ``Hey, spic, why don't
you go back where you came from?'' when none of the ancestors of
those ``natives'' were from the United States either.
 &HT;    I enrolled in the University of Miami, where I studied
communications with a minor in creative writing. During the last
year of the course, the university required an internship with some
publication.
 &HT;    I chose Vanidades because of my deep sentimental ties to that
magazine. My family had just sold it to a Venezuelan publisher and
his partner. I thought, All right, I'll work as an intern for a
year, and that's the last they'll see of me.
 &HT;    I learned to write every kind of article, from pieces on beauty
and fashion to international news. Then when Frank Calderon, the
editor in chief of Buenhogar (the Spanish version of Good
Housekeeping) was appointed editor of Cosmopolitan en Espanol and
the first thing he did was to hire me from Vanidades as his first
staff writer.
 &HT;    Like a good Cosmo girl, I was 26 and decided to move from our
home on Key Biscayne and rent a small apartment. My father was
going through one of his hard times and was trying to sell the
mansion on Key Biscayne to cut back on expenses. I moved, both to
be independent and not to be a burden on my parents.
 &HT;    I must admit that I had a more difficult time than other girls
my age because I was totally spoiled and immature.
 &HT;    My first excursion into cleaning consisted of buying two spray
cans of foaming cleanser: one for the bathroom, the other for the
oven. From time to time I mixed them up and cleaned the bathroom
with the oven cleaner and the oven with the one for the bathroom.
 &HT;    My mailbox was overflowing with bills. My money ran out because
I earned so little, and I began to lose my credit. My father was
now flat broke and couldn't help me either. I kept moving to
cheaper and cheaper apartments.
 &HT;    Eventually I realized my life was a mess, and I knew I had to
calm down.
 &HT;    One of the young men I was going out with was named Tony
Menendez. He was a firefighter and real estate salesman. I told
myself, ``I need to slow down and have a baby. This is a good man,
and I know he will be a good father.'' I was that cool in my
calculations.
 &HT;    I married him and a year later, at 29, had my first daughter,
Cristina Amalia Menendez y Saralegui, whom we called Titi. When our
daughter was born, Tony and I moved into a small house on Key
Biscayne.
 &HT;    As time went by, I realized that my husband, although he was
working every day (and getting dressed every day in jacket and
tie), simply wasn't selling anything. We had to move into my
father's three-room apartment, with my dachshund, which was covered
with fleas that immediately infested my mother's carpet.
 &HT;    One day my husband said, ``You have to get a job and help out.''
 &HT;    I looked him straight in the eye and said; ``I left my job to
start a family with you. If you ask me to go back to work, you'd
better be ready for whatever happens.''
 &HT;    I wasn't capable of working in an office from 9 to 5 and
trudging home like an automaton to pick up my life. That was work,
not a career. And for me it had to be a career.
 &HT;    I went to Cosmo and visited my former boss. ``I'm sorry,'' he
told me.
 &HT;    On my way out of the building, in desperation I turned and went
to see Elvira Mendoza, whom I had left in the lurch at Vanidades to
go work for Cosmopolitan.
 &HT;    ``Elvira, I have a baby girl now. Here's her picture,'' I began.
 &HT;    She answered, ``What a beautiful child!''
 &HT;    Then it all poured out. I told her the truth and confessed that
I needed a job.
 &HT;    Her reply was instantaneous. ``Well, of course, I'll give you a
job.''
 &HT;    So I came full circle back to where I'd begun, because she paid
me almost the same salary I'd started at, the lowest scale allowed.
 &HT;    I worked at all hours. I did anything they told me. The owner
suggested that I take on the additional responsibility of being
editorial coordinator for Intimidades, a new small-format magazine
in Caracas, Venezuela, that focused primarily on information about
sexuality.
 &HT;    I worked the whole day at Vanidades, writing and editing. Then,
at 5 o'clock, I would save my article on the computer, get into my
car, eat a sandwich as I drove, pick up my baby from the sitter,
put her in her car seat and take her to the home of my
mother-in-law, Marieta, a saint who worked at a factory that made
ballet and exercise clothing.
 &HT;    I would run back to my office, sit back down at the computer,
and with that crazy schedule we got Intimidades under way.
 &HT;    Then one day Frank Calderon, for reasons I don't know to this
day, banged his typewriter against his desk and walked out. The
management offered me his position as editor in chief of
Cosmopolitan.
 &HT;    I was terrified. But I accepted for two reasons: hunger and
ambition. My daughter had turned me into a career woman. And
careers are like children: They grow! I had to dare to grow with
mine.
 &HT;    That was MY CAUSE during the 10 years I directed Cosmopolitan.
Little by little I shaped the magazine to be a motivating force for
working women.
 &HT;    Here are some of the things I've learned:
 &HT;    _ List in a notebook the most important things in your life,
family, job, health, etc.
 &HT;    _ On the basis of those principles, define the goals you want to
reach.
 &HT;    _ Every goal must have a deadline, whether 20 years or two
months.
 &HT;    My goals have been varied because I am convinced that happiness
leads to success but that we are happy only when we achieve a
balance in our lives.
 &HT;    That's why I divide my goals into categories:
 &HT;    _ Cultural goals: Take classes in a foreign language, read a
book every two weeks.
 &HT;    _ Family goals: Have a lasting marriage and children who become
good men and women.
 &HT;    _ Spiritual goals: Read everything that might open the eyes of
my spirit and help my soul evolve.
 &HT;    Every morning review your goals for self-improvement and keep
the last day of the month to check, point by point, what you have
done to reach them.
 &HT;    Begin right now.

 By CRISTINA SARALEGUI  
 From ``My Life as a Blonde'' 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    One day a representative of CBS Records called to ask me a favor
with these fateful words:
 &HT;    ``We just signed a local group called Miami Sound Machine. We're
going to book them into Regine's in New York and launch them as the
company's new artists and we need you to back us up in print.''
 &HT;    At the same time _ life's little coincidences _ another friend,
a newspaperman in Puerto Rico, had called to say that he was
organizing a festival of Caribbean music in Cancun, Mexico, and he
wanted me to recommend the hottest U.S. group playing Latin music.
 &HT;    I recommended Miami Sound Machine.
 &HT;    On the plane carrying us to the festival in Cancun I met Emilio
and Gloria Estefan and (by chance!) Marcos Avila, the band's bass
player.
 &HT;    Emilio and Gloria were very pleasant companions during that
trip, and we quickly became friends, so spontaneously and sincerely
that soon Tony and I began hanging out with them. Since we lived
only five minutes away, we went everywhere together.
 &HT;    Seeing them, watching how happily they were married, I realized
how unhappy I was. I began to realize that following their example
of working together and getting ahead together, I had to change the
circumstances I found myself in.
 &HT;    One day Emilio said, ``I'm going to Peru with Gloria and the
band. You've filed for divorce. Your problems are out of your
hands. Why don't you let me invite you to come with us?''
 &HT;    It was my destiny to meet my destiny.
 &HT;    Emilio who's always joking, began selling me on Marcos, I don't
know why. He said over and over, ``Marcos Avila is my right hand
and a very serious fellow. Why don't you two get together?''
 &HT;    Now I believe that maybe Emilio sensed the chemistry between
Marcos and me before the things happened I'm going to tell you
about.
 &HT;    But I listened and thought, ``Marcos is short, fat,
short-tempered and close-mouthed. And he's married! I like tall,
handsome, elegant men. And I'm short-tempered too. We'd make a
terrible couple!''
 &HT;    One night we all went to a discotheque. I was at Gloria and
Emilio's table but had gone to the ladies' room. There I saw a
black girl and a white girl get in a fight _ with razor blade _
over a musician.
 &HT;    The musician was Marcos! I froze. I did what you do on automatic
pilot and, eyes straight ahead, walked out the door.
 &HT;    As I stepped outside, Marcos came up and said, ``Want to
dance?''
 &HT;    ``Not on your life!'' I answered, and went back to the table to
see how everything turned out.
 &HT;    That night Marcos explained that he was going through the stage
of total upheaval that precedes a divorce. Sometimes he left home
and took refuge in his grandmother's house, where he hid out before
going back to his own house to see his baby girl.
 &HT;    As for me, my husband and I were legally separated.
 &HT;    We were two miserable souls that met like homeless people under
a bridge. Marcos says today that by then he had determined to
captivate me. It's true, we began to see each other differently.
 &HT;    One night after a concert, we all got together in a suite and
had a tremendous party. Afterward Marcos offered to walk me back to
my room. He came in with me, sat on my bed, began to massage my
back, and said, ``If you and I make love ... ''
 &HT;    He corrected himself. ``No. When you and I make love, you're
going to see what a real man is like.''
 &HT;    I pretended I hadn't heard him. I quickly told him good night,
gave him a stupid kiss on the cheek, and he left. But I was left
with that promise in my heart. The next day I got up at 6 a.m. and
carefully painted my toenails red.
 &HT;    That night he came back, and he was better than his promise. It
was like making love with someone for whom you had been created
with that one purpose in mind. The earth moved, bells rang and I
was left stupefied because that had never happened to me and I was
35 years old!
 &HT;    It was well worth painting my toenails.
 &HT;    From that moment Marcos began his campaign to move into my house
so I wouldn't go out with anyone else. He intended that after eight
years of marriage to one man I should pass directly to him, with no
romantic interlude in between.
 &HT;    Marcos is 11 years younger than I am. At that time he had a
ponytail halfway down his back, but a buzz cut in front. And he had
an earring. After all, he was a musician.
 &HT;    My parents were totally opposed to our relationship. My first
marriage had been plagued by economic problems. At one point my
father asked if I was proposing to support men all my life.
 &HT;    To add to the complications, Titi, my daughter, was a holy
terror! I remember the first day Marcos came to the house. Titi had
some plastic handcuffs, and under the pretense of playing cops and
robbers, she cuffed him to the metal stairway and threw away the
key--so he couldn't be with me. We had to break the handcuffs to
get them off.
 &HT;    Faced with that situation, I told Marcos, ``You'll have to win
Titi over, because I'm not going to marry you if she doesn't want
me to.''
 &HT;    By the end of our first year together, Titi was so fond of
Marcos that she told me one day, ``Mami, he loves us. He's nice.
Why don't we marry him?''
 &HT;    All I could do was laugh!
 &HT;    For the wedding I wore a white cotton dress I'd bought in
Mexico, and Titi wore one just like it. I bought white flowers for
my hair and white flowers for hers. She stood by my side in her
identical white dress, and the two of us wed Marcos Avila.
 &HT;    Later, despite his success and the money he was earning, and
after 12 unbroken years with Miami Sound Machine, he decided to
leave the group. ``I've had the fans, the limousines, the Johnny
Carson show,'' he said. ``Now I want a family.''
 &HT;    Marcos opened a public relations agency to offer to
Spanish-language performers the things he had learned while
traveling with Miami Sound Machine.
 &HT;    Once Marcos felt he was on solid ground, he began brainwashing
me to leave Cosmopolitan. My reaction was: Are you crazy?
 &HT;    Marcos, though, convinced me that what I was doing in that
corporation was selling my time instead of my talent.
 &HT;    Take note, all you reading this book, of that important
difference, whatever your situation at the moment.

 &HT;    A DIS-UNITED KINGDOM? SCOTLAND LEADING MOVEMENT TOWARD REGIONAL
INDEPENDENCE
 &HT;    With SCOTLAND-PRIMER-$ADV26.
 &HT;    For Use Saturday, Sept. 26 And Thereafter.
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON JR. 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Forged 70 years before American independence, the
United Kingdom is showing distinct signs of disunity.
</P>
<P>
   Within a year, three of the kingdom's four principal regions --
Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales -- will elect legislatures
with varying degrees of autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   Each region has a legitimate political movement pushing for at
least some measure of freedom from England, ranging from a sort of
American-style statehood to full-fledged independence.
</P>
<P>
   So much has changed that even Wales, which was conquered by
England a century before Chaucer wrote ``The Canterbury Tales,''
voted a year ago to form its own assembly only two decades after
rejecting the idea by a 4-1 margin.
</P>
<P>
   As the 20th Century comes to an end, there is real possibility
that Great Britain, the world's most vast and powerful political
force at the turn of the last century, soon may be whittled down to
little more than England and a few possessions.
</P>
<P>
   The growth in popular support for regional autonomy -- called
``devolution'' here -- was capitalized upon by the savvy British
Prime Minister Tony Blair, who swept to power 16 months ago on a
landslide. For Blair, it was a calculated political venture
intended in part to build support by addressing complaints that the
government in London was inattentive to local matters.
</P>
<P>
   While providing an avenue for people in the other regions to
gain more local control, some leaders fear -- or hope -- that Blair
may have unwittingly unleashed a new and potentially fatal burst of
nationalistic ambition.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Sked, a senior lecturer in international history at the
London School of Economics, worries that devolution is dismantling
the framework of British government without a well-defined
replacement.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're getting is strange ad hoc bodies rather than a part
of a general constitution,'' Sked said. ``You're going to end up
with a constitutional stew that could bubble over and burn
everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, there seems to be no turning back. The momentum seems
particularly potent in Scotland. Earlier this week, Alex
Salmond(CQ), the head of the Scottish National Party (SNP), told
spirited delegates attending a party convention that they -- not
the English -- control the country's future. ``Scotland's party,''
Salmond said to thunderous cheers, ``is ready to be Scotland's
government.''
</P>
<P>
   If Salmond's party captures a majority in the Scottish
Parliament in May elections, then his party says it intends to open
negotiations with the British Parliament on the terms of
separation. Recent polling suggests his surging party may fall
short of a majority, which still is expected to be held by Blair's
Labor Party.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the issue of independence will persist because of popular
support. A new poll for The Scotsman newspaper shows that 51
percent of Scots would vote for independence if given the chance in
a referendum.
</P>
<P>
   John MacInnes, a researcher for the SNP, said the rise of the
independence movement has paralleled a 50-year rise in the Scottish
national identity. It also parallels the decline of the British
Empire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scots used to be able to move out into the empire to Canada
and Australia and make successes of themselves, and that's been
closed off to them,'' he said. ``At the same time, there has been
the rise of Europe in economic terms.''
</P>
<P>
   The SNP intends to make Scotland an independent nation within
the European Union and look after its national interests without
the influence or interference of the government in London, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But, Sked, also a Scot, questions whether Scotland would really
be better off on its own. He believes the EU if anything would be
less responsive to Scottish interests than the London parliament.
</P>
<P>
   And he worries about the talent base of a fledgling legislature.
``The likely prospect is one of second-rate Scottish politicians
finding themselves with a lot of problems which they used to talk
about but which they cannot solve; and bringing in constitutional
and economic measures which will only exacerbate them,'' Sked said.
</P>
<P>
   Scots may cool to independence when they take a harder look at
it, he added, saying, ``If it ends up leading to higher taxes, and
the Scottish financial services industry leaving the country, the
consequences could be dire.''
</P>
<P>
   In Ireland, the push for independence from Britain fueled a
30-year guerrilla war that claimed more than 3,000 lives. The New
Northern Ireland Assembly, which convened for the first time
earlier this month, has been charged with plotting a course that is
consistent with the what the majority wants.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the population of Northern Ireland is divided over
remaining part of Britain, with a majority still indicating support
for the union, polls show. However, most political observers doubt
the separatists such as Sinn Fein, the political party affiliated
with the Irish Republican Army, would participate in the assembly
without for hope of eventually obtaining independence and,
ultimately, union with the Republic of Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Much depends on economics, said Barry Jones, a professor of the
University of Wales in Cardiff who studies devolution. ``If there
is a sudden severe downturn in the global market or if the British
economy weakens significantly, then it could be destabilizing,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   A weakened British economy could make breaking away and seeking
an independent affiliation with the EU appear attractive to
supporters of independence, he said.
</P>
<P>
   For Wales, there seems to be much ambivalence about devolution.
``The paradox is that we've been united with the English longer
than either the Scots or the Irish, yet we've preserved our
language and culture better than either,'' he said. ``But that
hasn't translated into a political movement.''
</P>
<P>
   The Welsh are interested in controlling their own affairs but
not becoming an independent state, said Jones, who believes the
Welsh model could represent a shift to a kind of federal republic
on the order of the U.S. system.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the United Kingdom is entering unchartered water. One
potentially troubling and divisive issue could come if the English
begin to feel they are the political losers in the new order.
Ironically, the English will be the only people without a directly
elected assembly to represent their interests. Members of
Parliament from Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales will be poised
to set policy in England, while the English will have no voice in
affairs in these regions.
</P>
<P>
   This could lead to a call for an English assembly, said Bill
Shaw, an official with the Edinburgh office of the Conservative
Party. ``There are signs of an English backlash already,'' Shaw
said. ``People will wonder why some Scottish (member of parliament)
can vote on an issue important to Surrey while their (member of
parliament) has no say over how their money is spent in Scotland.
And once your average person starts realizing the consequences of
this, they'll take great offense at it.''
</P>
<P>
   There is even some concern about how well the fabric of British
nationhood is holding together. The sense of feeling British is
stronger in older generations who experienced or at least remember
World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were the 15 days when Britain stood alone against
Hitler,'' Jones said. ``That's not so important for younger people
but it is for people over 40.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones believes that British nationalism remains a powerful
binding force. ``Look at something as recent as the Falklands
war,'' he said. ``That produced a tremendous flood of British
nationalism that surprised even the British.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, there is some concern the ship may founder before anyone
takes full account of the rocks ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to dawn on the English in the next year or so that
there are going to be some changes,'' Sked said. ``By then, it may
be too late to do anything about it.''

 &HT;    CASHLESS SOCIETY: A BARTER DEAL IN RUSSIA IS BORN
 &HT;    With RUSSIA-BARTER-$ADV26.
 &HT;    EDs: Saratov is on the Volga River about 450 miles south of
Moscow.
 &HT;    For Use Saturday, Sept. 26 And Thereafter.
 &HT;    By CHARLES W. HOLMES 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARATOV, Russia _ ``It involves a lot of time and nerves and
risks,'' Fyodor Shimchuk says of barter. He is general director of
Sapkon/Neftemash, a company in southern Russia that makes pumps and
valves for the oil and gas industry.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, it took a dozen negotiators from his company
and others more than two months to complete a barter deal involving
$100,000 worth of equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how it unfolded:
</P>
<P>
   1. A natural gas drilling facility in Yamburg, above the Arctic
Circle, needed replacement parts: $100,000 worth of safety valves
and pumps.
</P>
<P>
   2. In Saratov, about 1,500 miles southwest of Yamburg, a company
called Sapkon/Neftemash makes the pumps and valves.
</P>
<P>
   3. The two companies began negotiations after Yamburg said it
did not have the cash to pay for the equipment.
</P>
<P>
   4. Yamburg is a subsidiary of Russia's natural gas monopoly,
Gazprom, headquartered in Moscow. Yamburg asked Gazprom to give
Sapkon/Neftemash $100,000 worth of natural gas in return for the
pumps and valves.
</P>
<P>
   5. Gazprom agreed, ordering its subsidiary in Saratov to provide
the gas.
</P>
<P>
   6. But Sapkon/Neftemash, the pump manufacturer, had no use for
natural gas. However, it owed about $100,000 to the local electric
company, Sarenergo.
</P>
<P>
   7. Sarenergo didn't need natural gas either. But its subsidiary
did -- the power plant that actually produces the electricity.
</P>
<P>
   8. So the chain was completed. Simply put, the Arctic drilling
station paid Sapkon/Neftemash for the valves and pumps with
$100,000 worth of natural gas. But four other companies and
affiliates also were involved in the complex circle of bartering.
</P>
<P>
   Since no cash traded hands, Sapkon/Neftemash is hard-pressed to
pay its workers. Also, under Russia's tax system the company will
have to record the value of the transaction -- $100,000 -- and pay
taxes on the sale, money it does not have.
</P>
<P>
   Without barter, the company would survive, but would be forced
to make major layoffs and pay cuts, Shimchuk said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes the barter negotiations reach a critical point where
our suppliers can do nothing else but pay cash,'' says Shimchuk,
``and for that we are very happy.''

 &HT;    MEXICO RECALLS 1968 STUDENT MASSACRE WITH NEW DEMANDS FOR TRUTH
 &HT;    With photos placed in the International folder on the Cox
Server.
 &HT;    EDs: Oct. 2 is the 30th anniversary of the 1968 student
massacre.
 &HT;    For Use Sunday, Sept. 27 And Thereafter.
 &HT;    By SUSAN FERRISS 
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ It began with a police crackdown on students
playing football and ended in a horrific massacre that has scarred
Mexico for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Mexicans call it Tlatelolco (pronounced, tla-tay-Lol-ko), one of
the names for an ancient plaza here where scores, perhaps hundreds
of students and others were shot down by soldiers during a peaceful
rally on Oct. 2, 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knows how many really died in the sudden attack, carried
out on the eve of the 1968 Olympic Games here. And nobody was held
accountable for the carnage, which tarnished Mexico's reputation
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   But more than a generation later -- as Tlatelolco's 30th
anniversary approaches -- Mexicans emboldened by a more democratic
era are demanding answers and an end to official secrecy about what
really happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are still victims of Tlatelolco,'' said Ana Ignacia
Rodriguez, who was a 22-year-old law student who survived the
massacre only to be detained at gunpoint and sentenced to 16 years
in prison on trumped up sedition charges.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez was released after two years, but black-listed from
jobs. Trained as a lawyer, she rejected the profession because she
forever lost faith in Mexico's justice system.
</P>
<P>
   Sergio Aguayo, a champion of fair elections in Mexico, said
Tlatelolco ``was a parting of the waters, especially because of the
violent methods of repression that were used.'' He is author of
``1968: Archives of Violence,'' one of a number of new books about
Tlatelolco that are now being published.
</P>
<P>
   A committee established last year in Mexico's newly pluralistic
Congress is expected to issue a report on Tlatelolco in October. It
has been investigating recently unsealed archives belonging to
Mexico's Interior Ministry, which is charge of domestic security.
</P>
<P>
   Some committee members are opposition politicians who are
Tlatelolco survivors; they were elected to Congress last year,
breaking nearly 70 years of monopoly by Mexico's dominant
Revolutionary Institutional Party.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the student protests that swept the world in 1968 -- for
democracy, against the Vietnam War -- Mexico's was perhaps the most
violently repressed, investigators say. The brutal attempt to
establish total control stripped away an image of benevolence the
government was struggling to project during the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Today, military records on Tlatelolco remain sealed. But Aguayo
and others have pieced together accounts of how -- and who -- was
behind the bloodshed by reviewing unsealed Mexican archives and
thousands of memos produced by the American CIA, the FBI, the U.S.
Embassy in Mexico and other U.S. agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Searching for clues and international reaction, Aguayo also
found a treasure of information among International Olympic
Committee records in Europe and in the Lyndon Baines Johnson
Library archives at the University of Texas in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a plan mounted by the government to get rid of the
student movement before the Olympics. There's no doubt,'' Aguayo
said.
</P>
<P>
   The government of then-President Gustavo Diaz Ordaz, considered
a stern authoritarian, didn't plan on killing so many students,
Aguayo said. But it was willing to use violence to stop the student
movement before the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest bombshell Aguayo found in archives is an apparent
pattern of international support for Mexico's decision to act
harshly.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, stories swirled that the students were financially
supported or armed by Cuba or the Soviet Union. Versions of these
tales appear in Cold War-influenced FBI memos dispatched to the
United States from Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, Aguayo said, ``evidence of outside support for the
students doesn't exist. All the evidence is that the outside
support was for the government of Mexico. This is very noteworthy
because the Soviet Union, Cuba, Washington, they all supported the
government of Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   The unlikely spark for the 1968 protests was a fight that broke
out that summer between two schools engaged in a casual game of
touch football. Police brutally intervened, angering students
throughout Mexico City. Even current Mexican President Ernesto
Zedillo, who was 16, joined in some protests and was photographed
confronting police.
</P>
<P>
   Students were also primed by growing discontent over a lack of
freedom of speech and concern for political prisoners, including
imprisoned labor activists who were trying to break from Mexico's
government-controlled unions.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the summer, students marched for the repeal of a law
that gave authorities sweeping power to imprison dissidents. They
also wanted the dissolution of a repressive special police unit
they considered unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the consciousness of the young people and people in
general, the idea was growing that in Mexico there were no
democratic freedoms,'' recalled Rodriguez, the former law student.
``And we wanted freedoms.''
</P>
<P>
   Police occupied high schools and universities and began
imprisoning students. On Oct. 2, Rodriguez said, students gathered
for a legal assembly in Tlatelolco. The site is also called the
Plaza of the Three Cultures because it is surrounded by Aztec
pyramids, a colonial church and modern high-rise apartment
buildings.
</P>
<P>
   As dusk fell, investigators say, a secret police force known as
the Olympic Brigade opened fire on the crowd, provoking soldiers to
begin shooting. People of all ages were killed, indiscriminately,
while others ran for their lives.
</P>
<P>
   The official version of the story was that armed students fired
on soldiers. Aguayo said some of a hard core of protestors may have
returned fire, but his research shows that they were few and not
responsible for the violence.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers were censured in the aftermath of the shooting and
surviving student leaders were rounded up. The government offered
three different numbers -- none over 50 -- for how many died. The
figure is probably closer to 200 or 300, according to reporters who
attempted to independently investigate the death toll.
</P>
<P>
   Some survivors are calling for military officers from the era to
be forced to testify before Mexican or international investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the special congressional committee vainly attempted
to glean new information from former President Luis Echeverria, who
was Diaz Ordaz's interior minister.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still need the truth,'' said Elena Poniatowska, a Mexican
journalist and novelist who in 1971 published ``The Night of
Tlatelolco,'' a shattering account of survivors' experiences.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez believes Mexico's archives on Tlatelolco have probably
been sanitized, although she supports opening up all information as
well as investigating foreign archives.
</P>
<P>
   Three months after the massacre, Rodriguez was kidnapped by
police, blindfolded and interrogated and sentenced to prison in an
unconstitutional trial with fabricated evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine, a girl of 22. I pinched myself and told myself this
couldn't be happening to me,'' said Rodriguez, who now helps run a
Mexico City center that teaches women new jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Tlatelolco, Rodriguez said, frightened Mexicans and forced them
to accept authoritarian rule for a time. But it also inspired
massive outrage over voter fraud in the 1980s as well as the
country's current movement for greater democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mexico before 1968 was one country,'' Rodriguez said, ``and
after 1968 it was another.''

<P>
   ENGELS, Russia _ The good news for Trolza, a mammoth assembly
plant and major employer in this depressed town on the Volga River,
was a recent deal worth $25 million to produce buses for several
Russian cities.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news: No cash will be exchanged and no profits will
result.
</P>
<P>
   Barter made the deal possible. In a country with a sick economy,
a flimsy currency and a sea of debt, barter accounts for more than
two-thirds of all transactions in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The electric trolley buses will be built on an intricate web of
trades and swaps involving Trolza, dozens of companies who provide
component parts for the buses and the cities who need the vehicles
for their public transit systems.
</P>
<P>
   The factory, deep in the red since the Soviet Union collapsed in
1991 and with barely a ruble to its name, conducts an astounding 92
percent of its business in barter.
</P>
<P>
   It swaps buses to the city of Engels in lieu of paying its local
taxes. Farms give food in exchange for stocks of sheet metal, paint
and other items from Trolza's warehouses. Since Trolza cannot fully
afford to pay its employees, they get their salaries in onions,
cucumbers and macaroni.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't like barter. The best option is the classic one:
money for goods and services. But we don't have a choice. We've
returned to ancient times: a piece of meat for a piece of fur,''
said Arthur Mikhel, Trolza's chairman of the board.
</P>
<P>
   In the West, ``cashless society'' conjures 21st century images
of ``smart'' credit cards and high-tech cash registers and instant
electronic debits from a bank account.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's cashless society is from a century in the other
direction. It emerged from a Soviet-era economy that never quite
made the transition to capitalism. The Russian marketplace is
hamstrung by failing banks, the falling ruble, government
corruption and an oppressive tax system.
</P>
<P>
   The result is survival-by-barter from the corner fruit stand to
the highest levels of industry.
</P>
<P>
   Every Russian province, even in the relatively prosperous
capital, Moscow, has examples of barter. Workers get paid in toilet
paper and t-shirts. Companies stay in business by wrangling
supplies and swapping their products to pay their utility bills and
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   About 8,000 teachers in the impoverished Altai district of
Siberia have not been paid since February, owed $3.5 million in
wage arrears. They agreed this week to accept their pay in 15
bottles of vodka per teacher per month, which then can be re-sold
on the streets and to local markets.
</P>
<P>
   Barter now accounts for about 70 percent of trade in Russia and
the figure is growing amid the current economic crisis, according
to Yaroslav Lisavolik, a Moscow economist who has studied the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, barter reflects the fortitude of Russians who
are determined to survive in tough times, keeping the factories
running and commerce humming.
</P>
<P>
   But economists warn that more barter will only produce more
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Barter perpetuates trading between companies and individuals,
but perverts the system by making it impossible for the economy to
grow and for government to collect badly needed taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a law in economics that says bad money drives out
good money and this is exactly what has been going on. Barter,
which is bad money in a way, has been replacing cash,'' said
Lisavolik.
</P>
<P>
   Since the demise of the Soviet Union, about 70 percent of
Russia's economy is now in private ownership. Barter transactions
make it possible for businesses to remain in business. Bankruptcies
are rare.
</P>
<P>
   But barter leaves businesses with little capital for their
payroll and no clear picture of their prices and earnings. It chews
up time and productivity among the financial officers and corporate
planners who must arrange the often elaborate deals.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of cash also prevents Russian businesses from doing
things that fundamentally would improve the Russian economy, such
as modernizing aging Soviet-era plants and retraining the work
force.
</P>
<P>
   Without barter, debt-ridden companies would be forced to compete
in the hard world of a genuine market economy. Many factories would
fail and unemployment would rise.
</P>
<P>
   One of the world's largest enterprises, Russia's natural gas
monopoly, Gazprom, conducts 80 percent of its business in barter,
according to the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no cash and the chain begins from there. Everybody
uses electricity and everybody uses gas ... Enterprises couldn't
make their payments, so they started bargaining,'' said Andrei
Laptev, financial director for Sapkon/Neftemash, a company in the
southern city of Saratov which manufactures equipment for the oil
and gas industry.
</P>
<P>
   Since Russia's troubled economy means its customers cannot pay,
Sapkon/Neftemash has been forced to do about 60 percent of its
business this year in barter, up from 40 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In the dilapidated river town of Engels (named for the 19th
century philosopher Friedrich Engels who helped found the Communist
movement) the trolley bus factory struggles simply to exist. Dreams
of profit are sheer fantasy at Trolza, founded 130 years ago and
operating from a plant built just after World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The electric buses, which are tethered to overhead wires running
along city streets, are a common form of mass transit in Moscow and
dozens of other Russian cities. The company with 2,200 employees
had during its Soviet heyday the ability to produce 2,500 buses a
year. In 1996 and 1997, it manufactured only 120 each year.
</P>
<P>
   Trolza currently owes about $4.2 million in back taxes and
penalties -- a sum it cannot pay. Barter complicates the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Under Russia's tax laws, the company must record the sale of its
buses even if no cash changes hands. Thus, Trolza will owe taxes on
$25 million in sales after the recent barter deal is completed. And
without cash, it cannot pay taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You work and work and there is no result,'' complained Nikolai
Polulyakh, the company's general director and a member of the
regional parliament.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two real questions in Russia, 'What is to be done?'
and 'Who is to blame?' I think we are all to blame to take part in
such a system,'' he said.

 &HT;    THE DIS-UNITED KINGDOM
 &HT;    With SCOTLAND-SECEDE-$ADV26.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The countries that comprise the United Kingdom of Great Britain
and Northern Ireland are on a course that could further fragment
what's left of the once great empire.
</P>
<P>
   ENGLAND
</P>
<P>
   Population: 48.9 million
</P>
<P>
   Area: 50,362 square miles
</P>
<P>
   Capital: London
</P>
<P>
   Government: Unlike Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, England
has no government minister or department exclusively responsible
for its central administration.
</P>
<P>
   Prospect: As Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales move toward
more autonomy, politicians in England may well begin pushing for a
government more focused on England alone.
</P>
<P>
   SCOTLAND
</P>
<P>
   Population: 5.2 million
</P>
<P>
   Area: 30,418 square miles
</P>
<P>
   Capital: Edinburgh
</P>
<P>
   Government: Formed the United Kingdom with England in 1707.
Elections for the newly instated Scottish Parliament will be held
in May with the body convening in June. The parliament will have
authority over spending in Scotland and will have the power to levy
a local tax -- called the Tartan tax -- and will assume
responsibility for many areas of governance, including health,
education, transportation and the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Prospects: Scottish nationalists, who want Scotland to dissolve
the United Kingdom and join the European Union, have shown
themselves to have far greater political strength than anyone
expected and have a fair shot at gaining a majority in the new
parliament. Polls show considerable public support for independence
and dissatisfaction with being governed from London. Unionists fear
that Scotland is unprepared to go its own way, but for now are
losing their following.
</P>
<P>
   NORTHERN IRELAND
</P>
<P>
   Population: 1.7 million
</P>
<P>
   Area: 5,452 square miles
</P>
<P>
   Capital: Belfast
</P>
<P>
   Government: Came under British rule in 1690. A new assembly
convened earlier this month with measured authority over the nine
counties known as Ulster. As part of the Good Friday peace accord,
the assembly is to determine the political future of Northern
Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Prospects: The assembly includes representatives of the Unionist
and Republican movements. Unionists seek to remain a part of the
United Kingdom, while Republicans want Ulster to become part of the
Republic of Ireland, which encompasses the rest of the island. At
the very least it seems that the assembly -- if it holds together
-- is a major step toward some form of autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   WALES
</P>
<P>
   Population: 2.9 million
</P>
<P>
   Area: 8,019 square miles
</P>
<P>
   Capital: Cardiff
</P>
<P>
   Government: Brought under English rule in 1282. A year ago, a
razor-thin margin of voters endorsed a plan to create an elected
assembly to assume control of many governmental functions.
Elections are set for next year.
</P>
<P>
   Prospects: The nationalistic ardor is much cooler than in
Scotland or Northern Ireland, even though there is growing interest
in the distinct Welsh culture; the existence of which is
underscored by the fact that 20 percent of the inhabitants speak
Welsh as well as English and there are pockets of populations that
speak Welsh only. But the political support for full independence
seems thin.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Here's another example of how and why nothing
really seems to work any more:
</P>
<P>
   Paula Taggart is a nurse practitioner. She works for a
gynecologist. Not long ago, she was at an area shopping mall when
her beeper went off. The caller was a menopausal patient in the
suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called her right back,'' Paula Taggart told me. ``She's
going on and on, telling me about her whole week. And I finally say
to her, `Are you suicidal?' And she says, `Yes, I'm suicidal.' So,
I said, `OK, I'm going to get you some help.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Now the key thing when you're going through this is that you
have to keep them on the phone ... So thank God I had another pay
phone next to me ... I picked it up and dialed 911 ...
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them what my emergency was. I said, `I need some help.
I need you to get someone to her house.' They said, `What's the
address?' ... I tell the address, and the dispatcher says, `Well,
that's not our jurisdiction. We can't help you.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `You've got to be kidding me ... They said, `We'll
give you a phone number, and we can't do anything more than that.'
I said, `But this patient is suicidal ... I'm telling you, I'm a
medical professional, and I need your help.' They wouldn't help me
...
</P>
<P>
   ``I dialed the next phone number and got somebody in Saratoga
County. They told me, `I'm sorry, you've called the wrong number.
Let me give you the right number.' I mean, like, this is a
nightmare, and my key goal all through this is to keep her on the
other phone ...
</P>
<P>
   ``I finally got somebody at the third number, and they sent
help. But it was, like, a 25-minute ordeal. The whole thing is that
nobody knows that if you dial 911, you're not going to get help if
it's out of their jurisdiction ... Everybody I've told this story
to, including my boss, has asked, `Why couldn't they just patch you
through?' And I have to say, `I don't know.'''
</P>
<P>
   I do. I've harped on this before. Sure, the Albany metro area is
a contiguous region of nearly a million people. But government
boundaries in upstate New York _ and throughout most of the
Northeast, for that matter _ are 350 years old. Everything
important is set up on town and county levels, as though upstate
New Yorkers were still living in 1650.
</P>
<P>
   Why? The politicians like it that way, even though it gives New
Yorkers in particular and residents of the Northeast in general the
highest local taxes in America. It means more political jobs _ more
little, local dukes and earls suckling greedily at the public teat.
</P>
<P>
   That's why New York has roughly 850 school districts while
Florida, for example, administers education more efficiently at the
county level. That's why many communities in New York don't even
have 911 service available. They have to finance it locally, and
those communities are too small to afford it. The whole system is
loony, and every time anybody talks about regionalization, the
local pols start howling about the evils of big government.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Steve Heider of the Colonie Police Department knows quite a
bit about the 911 system. It's partially administered by his
department. He told me that each county 911 system in the Albany
metro area does have a limited capacity to communicate with the
systems of neighboring counties. But that happens only if the
person receiving the call figures that the emergency is severe
enough to get up, leave his or her station and go to another
station to push the patch-through button.
</P>
<P>
   I know from spending a night in a 911 operation just how hassled
these people are. Step away from your station, and you can miss
emergency calls.
</P>
<P>
   Heider said, ``If the person who took her call on the 911 level
evaluated her situation and didn't feel it was an emergency at that
very moment, that's why she was probably given a regular number to
call at the Saratoga County Sheriff's Department.''
</P>
<P>
   What it boils down to is that the Albany metro area has roughly
750 taxing units serving a population less than half of Manhattan's
_ where 911 works pretty well, by the way _ and that local
politicians cling desperately to all these ancient, outmoded and
utterly useless local governments.
</P>
<P>
   And if somebody dies needlessly?
</P>
<P>
   Well, that's a small price to pay to stave off big government.
</P>

NO MORE FORESTS HELD HOSTAGE

   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PETER SELIGMANN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ With some of California's last remaining stands
of magnificent redwoods targeted for clear-cutting, lawmakers had
no choice but to ante up an exorbitant asking price to protect
these irreplaceable treasures.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics labeled the recent $480 million dollar deal for
Headwaters ``extortion,'' based on the fact that millionaire
financier Charles Hurwitz and other investors will recoup more than
half of what they paid for Pacific Lumber by selling only 5 percent
of the forests they originally acquired.
</P>
<P>
   Extortion, hostage-taking _ whatever you call it _ we could be
confronted with the same no-option scenario with regard to forests
worldwide unless we take action soon.
</P>
<P>
   Our planet already has lost well over half its forests. And
according to recent studies, we lose 31 million acres of tropical
forest every year. These are habitats that claim the most abundant
and diverse plant and animal species, which means they provide vast
sources of current and yet undiscovered medicine, food, and
innumerable raw materials necessary to meet many basic human needs.
</P>
<P>
   The global economic heyday of the past decade exacerbated the
plight of tropical forests worldwide. Many corporations _
particularly from Southeast Asia _ quickly became flush with income
to invest in new ventures. They frequently targeted poor developing
countries in the tropics to log, mine or drill within their
forests. Now that the global economic boom is going bust, logging
investments in most tropical developing countries have ground to a
halt. We have a moment's reprieve to take steps to permanently
protect some of the most biologically valuable and potentially
vulnerable forests on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   A sum comparable to what will be paid for Headwaters' redwood
groves could rescue an enormous amount of our planet's richest
storehouses of biological resources. This is partly because
cash-poor developing countries have been tempted to sell trees dirt
cheap. Guyana in South America, for instance, made less than $2
million in logging revenues in 1996, although more than 16 million
acres of that country's forests _ an area five times the size of
Connecticut _ are within concessions.
</P>
<P>
   This kind of exploitation doesn't have to occur. Guyana's
neighbor, the similarly small and poor Suriname, is a case in
point.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of the Richard and Rhoda Goldman Foundation in San
Francisco, Suriname recently set aside for permanent protection 4
million acres of tropical forest. Money from the Goldman Foundation
helped establish a $1 million trust fund to manage the new nature
reserve. The contribution will also help put in place more
economically and environmentally sound development _ such as
ecotourism, bioprospecting, agroforestry and non-timber forest
products.
</P>
<P>
   Private donors as well as global financial institutions such as
the World Bank need to recognize just how much difference the right
kind of investments can make.
</P>
<P>
   We are at a critical juncture with regard to the future of the
planet's natural resources. Scientists have determined that more
than 50 percent of the world's terrestrial biological diversity is
found within just 2 percent of the planet's land surface. Most of
these regions happen to also be in tropical developing countries.
One of the few not in a developing country is the California
Floristic Province, where such unique and vulnerable habitats as
the Headwaters redwoods are found.
</P>
<P>
   The California Floristic Province, which extends 1,100 miles
from southwestern Oregon to Baja California, is on a short and
recently updated list of 25 global biodiversity hot spots. In
addition to claiming such a vast percentage of all species
diversity on Earth, another common denominator for the hot spots is
they are each under extreme threat.
</P>
<P>
   We need not wait until the rest of the hot spots end up as
hostages like the Headwaters redwoods. If we make investments to
protect tropical forests today, we can avoid paying ransom for
forest resources tomorrow.

<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I have a 56K modem, but I can only get it to
sign on at 28.8 or less. I confirmed that my modem and Windows 95
settings are correct. U.S. Robotics support determined there is
noise on my telephone line preventing a 56K connection. The phone
company will only guarantee a 14.4 connection. They sent out a
technician who determined my phone line met their specifications
for noise. Is there anything else to check? If there isn't, why
aren't consumers warned about this ``conflict'' with telephone
companies? I can't believe I'm the only one.
</P>
<P>
   _ Baudly Frustrated
</P>
<P>
   DEAR FRUS: Yes, you ARE the only one. The phone company has
singled out you _ and you alone _ for harassment. The rest of us
aren't having any problems.
</P>
<P>
   Your alternatives aren't very attractive: You could move closer
to the phone company's switching station. You could switch phone
companies. You could rewire your house with better telephone cable.
All that still may not fix the problem. I'm sure that the phone
company would be happy to let you pay more for a data-grade or ISDN
line, though. Why else would it be acting like the south end of a
northbound horse?
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I just finished reading the letter from the
person who heard creepy sounds while on the Internet. I, too, have
heard creepy sounds. Mine is a door slamming, and/or a squeaky
door. It doesn't happen regularly, just often enough to keep me
wondering when it will happen again.
</P>
<P>
   _ Haunted II
</P>
<P>
   DEAR II: Not to worry. That's just the escaped mental patient
who's been living in your crawl space waiting for just the right
moment to murder you in your sleep. Your computer is perfectly OK.
You must be really relieved!
</P>
<P>
   C'mon, you guys have all seen one too many ``X-Files.'' Look for
some rational explanation, like the couple next door having a
Hillary-size door-slammer of a fight. Or sound clips that are
programmed to play at certain points. As my computer tells me all
the time, you carbon-based units are way too suggestible.
</P>
<P>
   STUPID SOFTWARE TRICK: Seems like the only way Microsoft
engineers and developers get credit for something is when they
sneak their names into the product in places only they would know
to look. A reader who prefers to be known only as Cigar Boy _ for
legal reasons, he says _ earns a tip o' the homburg for this
Internet Explorer 4.0 trifle:
</P>
<P>
   Open the Help menu and click on About. Hold down Control and use
the mouse to drag the Explorer ``E'' over the picture of the globe,
then ram it against the ``Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0'' text,
which should retreat from the screen, exposing an Unlock button.
Click the button, which starts the globe shaking.
</P>
<P>
   Drag the ``E'' on top of the globe, which should start expanding
to fill the window. Close that window and another opens with a
scrolling list of hundreds of Microserfs, many of whom are still
chained to their cubicles. To break up the monotony, the
programmers also slipped in a couple of jokes. At least I think
they're jokes. It's so hard to tell when a geek is trying to be
intentionally funny.

   SAN FRANCISCO _ While the rest of the world has been occupied
with matters of great moment, the little people, aka children, have
been experiencing what could only be called Beanie Baby Meltdown.
</P>
<P>
   In case there are no children in your house (and you've been
sojourning on Mars for the last several years), Beanie Babies are
cuddly little beanbag animals, complete with birth date tags, that
have quietly taken over lives and established empires.
</P>
<P>
   Originally designed as playthings, these toys, through clever
marketing techniques, have morphed into something else; they now
belong in the rarified atmosphere of ``collectibles.'' Translated,
that means: Adults have gotten into the action, driving up prices
and unleashing Beanie Mania on an unsuspecting populace.
</P>
<P>
   Through a process known as early retirement from the line,
seemingly innocent stuffed piggies, puppies and platypi have soared
in price from a modest $4.99 to stratospheric levels _ at one
point, hundreds of dollars for a bear dedicated to Princess Di, and
thousands for Peanut, the Royal Blue Elephant (not to be confused
with the more pedestrian Peanut, the Light Blue Elephant, worth
about $15 and distributed en masse at an Oakland A's game in
August). Of course, as some learned to their sorrow, the
collector's prices could only be realized if the specialized tags
stayed firmly and perfectly attached.
</P>
<P>
   It became routine to enter a store to find hordes of anxious
grown-ups waiting in uneasy clumps for the next delivery of
beanies. No one was ever sure when or what would be available.
</P>
<P>
   People waiting in line developed a hunched posture _ with a
glazed, hopeless look in their eyes. Some were on missions,
dedicated quests aimed at placating anxious children whose
collections were lacking a special bear or bird. Others were
seasoned beanophiles, waiting to make a killing on the secondary
market, hoping to retire one day to Tahiti where the only beans
allowed would be fresh roasted and ground.
</P>
<P>
   Now, suddenly, the beanie market is collapsing. Where are the
headlines? Toy stores, stationery stores and drugstores are all
beaned up. Where before children would descend on a sales clerk,
pleading for beanies _ any beanies _ now stores have them _ and
it's just not the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I have all of those,'' my 9-year-old daughter Micki
observed coolly the other day, quickly surveying a pile of beanies
filling a counter at Nordstrom. ``Let's go get some ice cream,''
she said, walking off without a backward glance.
</P>
<P>
   This is the same daughter who, just a month before, grabbed a
small beanie cat, a duplicate of one she already had at home,
begging for it just because it was the only beanie baby in the
store.
</P>
<P>
   So, let the word go forth _ give the people what they want and
they won't want it any more. The Beanie Revolution is winding down.
</P>
<P>
   But, fear not _ a new and better place awaits the beanies of
this world. I like to think of it, with affection, as The Pet
Rock-Cabbage Patch Doll-Tickle Me Elmo Retirement Villa. In our
house, it's also known as the closet.

   Five years ago, physicist Zang-Hee Cho sought help from an
acupuncturist for relief from excruciating back pain. Initially,
Cho scoffed at the idea _ as an educated person, he says, he didn't
believe in acupuncture. But much to his surprise, it worked. How
could inserting needles into seemingly random points on the body
possibly affect human health? Read about Cho's subsequent study
involving this traditional Chinese medicine and a few student
volunteers in this feature from Discover magazine. Catherine Dold
is a free-lance writer who lives in Boulder, Colo.

<P>
   Five years ago, while visiting his native Korea, physicist
Zang-Hee Cho took a tumble down a hiking trail.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were in the mountains for a picnic, and my shoes were not
quite correct,'' recalls the 62-year-old professor from the
University of California at Irvine. ``I was thinking, as usual, and
I fell down. It was like a flight, like a big jump down the
mountain. The next day I returned to California and tried to stand
up after 12 hours on the plane. I couldn't stand up. I said,
'Uh-oh, big trouble.'''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't long before Cho began to look for some relief from the
pain in his back. Relatives suggested he try acupuncture. Though he
initially scoffed at the idea _ as an educated person, he says, he
didn't believe in acupuncture _ he tried it. And much to his
surprise, it worked.
</P>
<P>
   ``After about 10 minutes I felt the pain melting away.''
</P>
<P>
   Cho's unexpected relief prodded his professional curiosity. As a
physicist working in radiology, Cho develops ways to image the
complex inner workings of the body. One of his inventions was a
prototype PET scanner around 1975.
</P>
<P>
   How, he wondered, could inserting needles into seemingly random
points on the body possibly affect human health?
</P>
<P>
   He decided to take a closer look, and what he(found astounded
him. While sticking needles into a few student volunteers, he took
pictures of their brains and discovered that by stimulating an
acupuncture point said to be associated with vision _ but that is
nowhere near anything known to be connected to the eyes _ he could
indeed trigger activity in the very part of the brain that controls
vision.
</P>
<P>
   There just might be something to this acupuncture thing, he
figured.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Acupuncture and other forms of traditional Chinese medicine have
been around for more than 4,000 years. Yet the explanation for how
acupuncture _ and Chinese medicine as a whole _ works has long been
a mystery, if not an(object of mockery, for most Western doctors.
</P>
<P>
   The basic theory is outlined in a text from 200 B.C., attributed
to the Yellow Emperor (a mythical ruler). In brief, it recognizes
in people and in nature a vital energy or life force known as qi
(pronounced CHEE).
</P>
<P>
   Qi is the source nf movements ranging from voluntary musble
action to blood flow; it protects the body from external
influences, and it generates warmth.
</P>
<P>
   Qi flows through the body and to the organs by way of an
extensive system of channels known as meridians. If the flow of the
force is disturbed, the theory goes, the resulting deficiency,
excess or stagnation of qi causes bodily malfunction and thus
illness.
</P>
<P>
   Acupuncture, in which needles are inserted into specific points
along the meridians and manipulated, is said to restore the proper
flow of qi and thereby return the body to health.
</P>
<P>
   Practitioners recognize some 1,500 acupoints, most of which have
no obvious relationship to their intended targets. For example, a
point on the second toe is used to treat headaches and toothaches,
while a point near the elbow enhances the immune system.
</P>
<P>
   Another integral concept is the tension between two
ever-present, complementary forces of nature, yin and yang. When
their balance is disturbed, the theory goes, people get sick.
</P>
<P>
   Yin conditions reflect a lack of qi: pale face, cold
extremities, slow pulse, depression. Yang conditions result from an
excess of qi: red face, fever, fast pulse, agitation.
</P>
<P>
   Whct those researchers have been able to measure is a flow of
acupuncture induced endorphins. According to neuroscientist Bruce
Pomeranz, of the University of Toronto, numerous studies over the
past 20 years have shown that inserting needles into acupoints
stimulates nerves in the underlying muscles.
</P>
<P>
   That stimulation, researchers believe, sends impulses up the
spinal cord to a relatively primitive part of the brain known as
the limbic system, as well as to the midbrain and the pituitary
gland.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow that signaling leads to the release of endorphins and
monoamines, chemicals that block pain signals in the spinal cord
and the brain. The result: A well-documented generalized
``acupuncture analgesia.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The endorphin story is really nailed down,'' Pomeranz says.
``It looks like it's nerves to the brain. The acupoints that have
been mapped over thousands of years are likely the spots where
nerves are concentrated.''
</P>
<P>
   But the endorphin story ``doesn't explain many of the other
claims of acupuncture,'' he continues. ``There have been a number
of clinical trials showing that acupuncture is extremely useful for
the nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy and early pregnancy.
That's not the endorphin system. Nobody knows how that works.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor does the endorphin story explain what Cho found when
exploring acupoints that are traditionally used to treat vision
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Designated by Cho as VA1, VA2, VA3 and VA8, they are not found
near the eyes but on the outside of the foot, running from(the
little toe to the ankle. The ``VA'' in Cho's designation is for
``vision-related acupoint.''
</P>
<P>
   Acupuncturists say that these points are on the urinary bladder
meridian and refer to them as BL67, BL66, BL65 and BL60,
respectively. And they hold that stimulation of these points with
needles will affect the eyes via the system of meridians rather
than through the central nervous system.
</P>
<P>
   To test that premise, Cho strapped student volunteers into an
fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) machine.
</P>
<P>
   While standard MRI provides static cross-sectional pictures of
structures in the body, functional MRI goes further to reveal how
those structures are working. It measures minute changes in the
amount of oxygen carried in the blood, which is presumably a rough
measure of glucose uptake by various tissues and thus a good
indicator of which tissues are active. The results can be viewed as
colorful fMRI brain activation maps.
</P>
<P>
   Cho first stimulated the eyes of the volunteers by flashing a
light in front of them. The resulting images, as expected, showed a
concentration of color _ an increase in activity _ in the visual
cortex, the portion of the brain that is known to be involved in
eye function.
</P>
<P>
   Then Cho had an acupuncturist stimulate the acupoint VA1. In one
person after another, the very same region of the brain _ the
visual cortex _ lit up on the fMRI image.
</P>
<P>
   Cho noticed something else. When the activation data were
graphed to show the intensity of the response over time, he saw
that there were two distinct reactions among the dozen volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   During the acupuncture phase, some showed an increase in
activity, while others showed a decrease. In other words, in some
people, oxygen consumption in that brain region increased, while in
others, it decreased.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the acupuncturists mentioned, 'Oh, yes, it's yin and
yang,''' Cho says.
</P>
<P>
   Cho asked him which subjects were yin and which were yang, and
without seeing the data, the practitioner correctly pointed out who
had shown an increase in activity (yang) and who had had a decrease
(yin) in 11 of 12 cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how to explain it,'' Cho says.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   Like many preliminary scientific reports, Cho's small study 
 raises more questions than it answers. Still, he has demonstrated
new functional effects of acupuncture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Classically, acupuncture was the ultimate in experimentation;
people collected data for thousands of years,'' says Joie Jones,
professor of radiological sciences at the University of California
at Irvine and coauthor of the study. ``They noticed that when you
applied a needle in one position, it would have an effect in
another part of the body. But the connection through the brain was
never made. With these studies, we've demonstrated that for at
least some acupuncture points it goes through the brain.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet even if it does go through the brain, how does stimulating a
specific point on the foot trigger activity in the part of the
brain that controls vision?
</P>
<P>
   There is no explanation for that either, Cho says, although he
suspects that the path is along the nervous system.
</P>
<P>
   If that proves to be true, it's probably not the same pathway by
which acupuncture causes the release of endorphins, Pomeranz says.
</P>
<P>
   ``That endorphins are peleased by stimulating certain types of
nerves in fibers anywhere in the body, that's understood. But that
there is a specific connection between your toe and your visual
system is really bizarre. That's really mind-boggling.''
</P>
<P>
   Cho hopes to push the scientific frontier a little further by
using fMRI and other imaging systems to explore connections between
acupoints and the brain.
</P>
<P>
   He also plans to study how acupuncture might be used to increase
blood flow to the visual cortex in people who have suffered vision
impairment after a stroke.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of studies by other researchers have, in fact, already
found that acupuncture treatments can help stroke patients improve
their range of movement.
</P>
<P>
   Acupuncture imaging studies, Cho says, are ``opening a new door
for neuroscience.''

<P>
   For about two years the space probe Galileo has been gathering
ever more evidence that a large ocean lies hidden beneath the
frozen, fractured surface of Jupiter's moon Europa.
</P>
<P>
   Now the spacecraft has found the most convincing signs yet for a
Europan sea, in the form of salt deposits on the moon's icy
surface. The salts very likely come from a briny ocean many miles
below the ice.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence also suggests that Europa's ocean is highly
carbonated. Pressure from that seltzerlike sea may be responsible
for ejecting what appear to be sprays of debris visible on the
moon's face.
</P>
<P>
   The telltale signature of the salts was picked up by an
instrument on board Galileo called the Near Infrared Mapping
Spectrometer, which measures the absorption and reflection of
various wavelengths of sunlight by Europa's surface.
</P>
<P>
   Each material absorbs and reflects different, characteristic
wavelengths of light. The wavelengths measured by Galileo's
spectrometer _ from deep red in the visible spectrum out to longer
infrared wavelengths _ can thus reveal the chemical makeup of
Europa's surface.
</P>
<P>
   When the spectrometer focused on the areas of Europa that
appeared in photographs to consist of pure ice, it indeed measured
the characteristic spectrum of water ice _ no surprise there.
</P>
<P>
   But when the instrument examined features like the many dark
lines that crisscross the moon's surface, it obtained several
distorted spectra that each looked similar to ice.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas McCord, a geophysicist at the University of Hawaii who is
studying the Galileo data, recognized that the spectra were
produced by light reflecting off water-impregnated salty minerals,
including natron and Epsom salts. Such salts, McCord says, form
only in the presence of liquid water.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first evidence that Europa's ocean is briny,''
McCord says.
</P>
<P>
   The circulating currents of a salty sea would explain the
unusual magnetic readings that other Galileo instruments have
recorded. Those currents may create a magnetic field for the moon.
</P>
<P>
   Galileo found that the salts have the same composition at
different sites scattered about the moon, evidence that the sea is
extensive and well mixed.
</P>
<P>
   The composition of the salts, McCord says, gives some hints
about the chemistry of Europa's ocean.
</P>
<P>
   The presence of sodium carbonates means that carbon dioxide is
probably dissolved in the water.
</P>
<P>
   On Earth, volcanoes and submarine hydrothermal vents release
carbon dioxide, ``so it is reasonable to think that carbon dioxide
gas would be coming out of Europa's mantle and into the ocean,''
McCord says. ``The ice cap would seal the ocean most of the time,
so the carbon dioxide would build up and become like seltzer
water.''
</P>
<P>
   Raise the pressure of that carbon dioxide high enough and it
could erupt through the ice to the surface. (This could explain the
origin of volcano-like features on Europa.)
</P>
<P>
   Once exposed to the near vacuum that exists at the moon's
surface, the briny water would quickly evaporate, leaving the salts
behind.
</P>
<P>
   As yet, there is no evidence that Europa has hydrothermal vents
on its ocean floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if there is an ocean, there has to be heat coming out of
the mantle,'' McCord says, ``so there almost have to be
hydrothermal vents.''
</P>
<P>
   There is certainly no reason that hydrothermal vents couldn't
exist in oceans on worlds other than our own. In fact, the Mars
Global Surveyor mission recently found signs of a large deposit of
hematite _ a mineral often formed by hydrothermal activity _ near
Mars' equator.
</P>
<P>
   If the hematite deposit does indeed mark the site of a large
ancient body of hot water, it would be an ideal place to search for
past life on Mars.
</P>
<P>
   A briny Europan sea might also contain evidence of past life.
But unlike Mars, Europa may still harbor some kind of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is felt that carbon dioxide in the ocean created a fertile
environment for the formation of life on Earth,'' McCord says.
</P>
<P>
   Carbonates create a less acidic environment, one more favorable
for life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here we have, perhaps, a carbon dioxide-rich ocean. It's one
more thing that suggests that the ocean could be a habitat for
life.''

 By CATHERINE DOLD 
 c.1998 Discover magazine  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Five years ago, while visiting his native Korea, physicist
Zang-Hee Cho took a tumble down a hiking trail.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were in the mountains for a picnic, and my shoes were not
quite correct,'' recalls the 62-year-old professor from the
University of California at Irvine. ``I was thinking, as usual, and
I fell down. It was like a flight, like a big jump down the
mountain. The next day I returned to California and tried to stand
up after 12 hours on the plane. I couldn't stand up. I said,
'Uh-oh, big trouble.'''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't long before Cho began to look for some relief from the
pain in his back. Relatives suggested he try acupuncture. Though he
initially scoffed at the idea _ as an educated person, he says, he
didn't believe in acupuncture _ he tried it. And much to his
surprise, it worked.
</P>
<P>
   ``After about 10 minutes I felt the pain melting away.''
</P>
<P>
   Cho's unexpected relief prodded his professional curiosity. As a
physicist working in radiology, Cho develops ways to image the
complex inner workings of the body. One of his inventions was a
prototype PET scanner around 1975.
</P>
<P>
   How, he wondered, could inserting needles into seemingly random
points on the body possibly affect human health?
</P>
<P>
   He decided to take a closer look, and what he found astounded
him. While sticking needles into a few student volunteers, he took
pictures of their brains and discovered that by stimulating an
acupuncture point said to be associated with vision _ but that is
nowhere near anything known to be connected to the eyes _ he could
indeed trigger activity in the very part of the brain that controls
vision.
</P>
<P>
   There just might be something to this acupuncture thing, he
figured.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   Acupuncture and other forms of traditional Chinese medicine have
been around for more than 4,000 years. Yet the explanation for how
acupuncture _ and Chinese medicine as a whole _ works has long been
a mystery, if not an object of mockery, for most Western doctors.
</P>
<P>
   The basic theory is outlined in a text from 200 B.C., attributed
to the Yellow Emperor (a mythical ruler). In brief, it recognizes
in people and in nature a vital energy or life force known as qi
(pronounced CHEE).
</P>
<P>
   Qi is the source of movements ranging from voluntary muscle
action to blood flow; it protects the body from external
influences, and it generates warmth.
</P>
<P>
   Qi flows through the body and to the organs by way of an
extensive system of channels known as meridians. If the flow of the
force is disturbed, the theory goes, the resulting deficiency,
excess or stagnation of qi causes bodily malfunction and thus
illness.
</P>
<P>
   Acupuncture, in which needles are inserted into specific points
along the meridians and manipulated, is said to restore the proper
flow of qi and thereby return the body to health.
</P>
<P>
   Practitioners recognize some 1,500 acupoints, most of which have
no obvious relationship to their intended targets. For example, a
point on the second toe is used to treat headaches and toothaches,
while a point near the elbow enhances the immune system.
</P>
<P>
   Another integral concept is the tension between two
ever-present, complementary forces of nature, yin and yang. When
their balance is disturbed, the theory goes, people get sick.
</P>
<P>
   Yin conditions reflect a lack of qi: pale face, cold
extremities, slow pulse, depression. Yang conditions result from an
excess of qi: red face, fever, fast pulse, agitation.
</P>
<P>
   What those researchers have been able to measure is a flow of
acupuncture induced endorphins. According to neuroscientist Bruce
Pomeranz, of the University of Toronto, numerous studies over the
past 20 years have shown that inserting needles into acupoints
stimulates nerves in the underlying muscles.
</P>
<P>
   That stimulation, researchers believe, sends impulses up the
spinal cord to a relatively primitive part of the brain known as
the limbic system, as well as to the midbrain and the pituitary
gland.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow that signaling leads to the release of endorphins and
monoamines, chemicals that block pain signals in the spinal cord
and the brain. The result: A well-documented generalized
``acupuncture analgesia.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The endorphin story is really nailed down,'' Pomeranz says.
``It looks like it's nerves to the brain. The acupoints that have
been mapped over thousands of years are likely the spots where
nerves are concentrated.''
</P>
<P>
   But the endorphin story ``doesn't explain many of the other
claims of acupuncture,'' he continues. ``There have been a number
of clinical trials showing that acupuncture is extremely useful for
the nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy and early pregnancy.
That's not the endorphin system. Nobody knows how that works.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor does the endorphin story explain what Cho found when
exploring acupoints that are traditionally used to treat vision
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Designated by Cho as VA1, VA2, VA3 and VA8, they are not found
near the eyes but on the outside of the foot, running from the
little toe to the ankle. The ``VA'' in Cho's designation is for
``vision-related acupoint.''
</P>
<P>
   Acupuncturists say that these points are on the urinary bladder
meridian and refer to them as BL67, BL66, BL65 and BL60,
respectively. And they hold that stimulation of these points with
needles will affect the eyes via the system of meridians rather
than through the central nervous system.
</P>
<P>
   To test that premise, Cho strapped student volunteers into an
fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) machine.
</P>
<P>
   While standard MRI provides static cross-sectional pictures of
structures in the body, functional MRI goes further to reveal how
those structures are working. It measures minute changes in the
amount of oxygen carried in the blood, which is presumably a rough
measure of glucose uptake by various tissues and thus a good
indicator of which tissues are active. The results can be viewed as
colorful fMRI brain activation maps.
</P>
<P>
   Cho first stimulated the eyes of the volunteers by flashing a
light in front of them. The resulting images, as expected, showed a
concentration of color _ an increase in activity _ in the visual
cortex, the portion of the brain that is known to be involved in
eye function.
</P>
<P>
   Then Cho had an acupuncturist stimulate the acupoint VA1. In one
person after another, the very same region of the brain _ the
visual cortex _ lit up on the fMRI image.
</P>
<P>
   Cho noticed something else. When the activation data were
graphed to show the intensity of the response over time, he saw
that there were two distinct reactions among the dozen volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   During the acupuncture phase, some showed an increase in
activity, while others showed a decrease. In other words, in some
people, oxygen consumption in that brain region increased, while in
others, it decreased.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the acupuncturists mentioned, 'Oh, yes, it's yin and
yang,''' Cho says.
</P>
<P>
   Cho asked him which subjects were yin and which were yang, and
without seeing the data, the practitioner correctly pointed out who
had shown an increase in activity (yang) and who had had a decrease
(yin) in 11 of 12 cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how to explain it,'' Cho says.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   Like many preliminary scientific reports, Cho's small study
raises more questions than it answers. Still, he has demonstrated
new functional effects of acupuncture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Classically, acupuncture was the ultimate in experimentation;
people collected data for thousands of years,'' says Joie Jones,
professor of radiological sciences at the University of California
at Irvine and coauthor of the study. ``They noticed that when you
applied a needle in one position, it would have an effect in
another part of the body. But the connection through the brain was
never made. With these studies, we've demonstrated that for at
least some acupuncture points it goes through the brain.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet even if it does go through the brain, how does stimulating a
specific point on the foot trigger activity in the part of the
brain that controls vision?
</P>
<P>
   There is no explanation for that either, Cho says, although he
suspects that the path is along the nervous system.
</P>
<P>
   If that proves to be true, it's probably not the same pathway by
which acupuncture causes the release of endorphins, Pomeranz says.
</P>
<P>
   ``That endorphins are released by stimulating certain types of
nerves in fibers anywhere in the body, that's understood. But that
there is a specific connection between your toe and your visual
system is really bizarre. That's really mind-boggling.''
</P>
<P>
   Cho hopes to push the scientific frontier a little further by
using fMRI and other imaging systems to explore connections between
acupoints and the brain.
</P>
<P>
   He also plans to study how acupuncture might be used to increase
blood flow to the visual cortex in people who have suffered vision
impairment after a stroke.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of studies by other researchers have, in fact, already
found that acupuncture treatments can help stroke patients improve
their range of movement.
</P>
<P>
   Acupuncture imaging studies, Cho says, are ``opening a new door
for neuroscience.''

<P>
   Five years ago, while visiting his native Korea, physicist
Zang-Hee Cho took a tumble down a hiking trail.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were in the mountains for a picnic, and my shoes were not
quite correct,'' recalls the 62-year-old professor from the
University of California at Irvine. ``I was thinking, as usual, and
I fell down. It was like a flight, like a big jump down the
mountain. The next day I returned to California and tried to stand
up after 12 hours on the plane. I couldn't stand up. I said,
'Uh-oh, big trouble.'''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't long before Cho began to look for some relief from the
pain in his back. Relatives suggested he try acupuncture. Though he
initially scoffed at the idea _ as an educated person, he says, he
didn't believe in acupuncture _ he tried it. And much to his
surprise, it worked.
</P>
<P>
   ``After about 10 minutes I felt the pain melting away.''
</P>
<P>
   Cho's unexpected relief prodded his professional curiosity. As a
physicist working in radiology, Cho develops ways to image the
complex inner workings of the body. One of his inventions was a
prototype PET scanner around 1975.
</P>
<P>
   How, he wondered, could inserting needles into seemingly random
points on the body possibly affect human health?
</P>
<P>
   He decided to take a closer look, and what he found astounded
him. While sticking needles into a few student volunteers, he took
pictures of their brains and discovered that by stimulating an
acupuncture point said to be associated with vision _ but that is
nowhere near anything known to be connected to the eyes _ he could
indeed trigger activity in the very part of the brain that controls
vision.
</P>
<P>
   There just might be something to this acupuncture thing, he
figured.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   Acupuncture and other forms of traditional Chinese medicine have
been around for more than 4,000 years. Yet the explanation for how
acupuncture _ and Chinese medicine as a whole _ works has long been
a mystery, if not an object of mockery, for most Western doctors.
</P>
<P>
   The basic theory is outlined in a text from 200 B.C., attributed
to the Yellow Emperor (a mythical ruler). In brief, it recognizes
in people and in nature a vital energy or life force known as qi
(pronounced CHEE).
</P>
<P>
   Qi is the source of movements ranging from voluntary muscle
action to blood flow; it protects the body from external
influences, and it generates warmth.
</P>
<P>
   Qi flows through the body and to the organs by way of an
extensive system of channels known as meridians. If the flow of the
force is disturbed, the theory goes, the resulting deficiency,
excess or stagnation of qi causes bodily malfunction and thus
illness.
</P>
<P>
   Acupuncture, in which needles are inserted into specific points
along the meridians and manipulated, is said to restore the proper
flow of qi and thereby return the body to health.
</P>
<P>
   Practitioners recognize some 1,500 acupoints, most of which have
no obvious relationship to their intended targets. For example, a
point on the second toe is used to treat headaches and toothaches,
while a point near the elbow enhances the immune system.
</P>
<P>
   Another integral concept is the tension between two
ever-present, complementary forces of nature, yin and yang. When
their balance is disturbed, the theory goes, people get sick.
</P>
<P>
   Yin conditions reflect a lack of qi: pale face, cold
extremities, slow pulse, depression. Yang conditions result from an
excess of qi: red face, fever, fast pulse, agitation.
</P>
<P>
   What those researchers have been able to measure is a flow of
acupuncture induced endorphins. According to neuroscientist Bruce
Pomeranz, of the University of Toronto, numerous studies over the
past 20 years have shown that inserting needles into acupoints
stimulates nerves in the underlying muscles.
</P>
<P>
   That stimulation, researchers believe, sends impulses up the
spinal cord to a relatively primitive part of the brain known as
the limbic system, as well as to the midbrain and the pituitary
gland.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow that signaling leads to the release of endorphins and
monoamines, chemicals that block pain signals in the spinal cord
and the brain. The result: A well-documented generalized
``acupuncture analgesia.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The endorphin story is really nailed down,'' Pomeranz says.
``It looks like it's nerves to the brain. The acupoints that have
been mapped over thousands of years are likely the spots where
nerves are concentrated.''
</P>
<P>
   But the endorphin story ``doesn't explain many of the other
claims of acupuncture,'' he continues. ``There have been a number
of clinical trials showing that acupuncture is extremely useful for
the nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy and early pregnancy.
That's not the endorphin system. Nobody knows how that works.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor does the endorphin story explain what Cho found when
exploring acupoints that are traditionally used to treat vision
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Designated by Cho as VA1, VA2, VA3 and VA8, they are not found
near the eyes but on the outside of the foot, running from the
little toe to the ankle. The ``VA'' in Cho's designation is for
``vision-related acupoint.''
</P>
<P>
   Acupuncturists say that these points are on the urinary bladder
meridian and refer to them as BL67, BL66, BL65 and BL60,
respectively. And they hold that stimulation of these points with
needles will affect the eyes via the system of meridians rather
than through the central nervous system.
</P>
<P>
   To test that premise, Cho strapped student volunteers into an
fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) machine.
</P>
<P>
   While standard MRI provides static cross-sectional pictures of
structures in the body, functional MRI goes further to reveal how
those structures are working. It measures minute changes in the
amount of oxygen carried in the blood, which is presumably a rough
measure of glucose uptake by various tissues and thus a good
indicator of which tissues are active. The results can be viewed as
colorful fMRI brain activation maps.
</P>
<P>
   Cho first stimulated the eyes of the volunteers by flashing a
light in front of them. The resulting images, as expected, showed a
concentration of color _ an increase in activity _ in the visual
cortex, the portion of the brain that is known to be involved in
eye function.
</P>
<P>
   Then Cho had an acupuncturist stimulate the acupoint VA1. In one
person after another, the very same region of the brain _ the
visual cortex _ lit up on the fMRI image.
</P>
<P>
   Cho noticed something else. When the activation data were
graphed to show the intensity of the response over time, he saw
that there were two distinct reactions among the dozen volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   During the acupuncture phase, some showed an increase in
activity, while others showed a decrease. In other words, in some
people, oxygen consumption in that brain region increased, while in
others, it decreased.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the acupuncturists mentioned, 'Oh, yes, it's yin and
yang,''' Cho says.
</P>
<P>
   Cho asked him which subjects were yin and which were yang, and
without seeing the data, the practitioner correctly pointed out who
had shown an increase in activity (yang) and who had had a decrease
(yin) in 11 of 12 cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how to explain it,'' Cho says.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   Like many preliminary scientific reports, Cho's small study
raises more questions than it answers. Still, he has demonstrated
new functional effects of acupuncture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Classically, acupuncture was the ultimate in experimentation;
people collected data for thousands of years,'' says Joie Jones,
professor of radiological sciences at the University of California
at Irvine and coauthor of the study. ``They noticed that when you
applied a needle in one position, it would have an effect in
another part of the body. But the connection through the brain was
never made. With these studies, we've demonstrated that for at
least some acupuncture points it goes through the brain.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet even if it does go through the brain, how does stimulating a
specific point on the foot trigger activity in the part of the
brain that controls vision?
</P>
<P>
   There is no explanation for that either, Cho says, although he
suspects that the path is along the nervous system.
</P>
<P>
   If that proves to be true, it's probably not the same pathway by
which acupuncture causes the release of endorphins, Pomeranz says.
</P>
<P>
   ``That endorphins are released by stimulating certain types of
nerves in fibers anywhere in the body, that's understood. But that
there is a specific connection between your toe and your visual
system is really bizarre. That's really mind-boggling.''
</P>
<P>
   Cho hopes to push the scientific frontier a little further by
using fMRI and other imaging systems to explore connections between
acupoints and the brain.
</P>
<P>
   He also plans to study how acupuncture might be used to increase
blood flow to the visual cortex in people who have suffered vision
impairment after a stroke.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of studies by other researchers have, in fact, already
found that acupuncture treatments can help stroke patients improve
their range of movement.
</P>
<P>
   Acupuncture imaging studies, Cho says, are ``opening a new door
for neuroscience.''

<P>
   For about two years the space probe Galileo has been gathering
ever more evidence that a large ocean lies hidden beneath the
frozen, fractured surface of Jupiter's moon Europa.
</P>
<P>
   Now the spacecraft has found the most convincing signs yet for a
Europan sea, in the form of salt deposits on the moon's icy
surface. The salts very likely come from a briny ocean many miles
below the ice.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence also suggests that Europa's ocean is highly
carbonated. Pressure from that seltzerlike sea may be responsible
for ejecting what appear to be sprays of debris visible on the
moon's face.
</P>
<P>
   The telltale signature of the salts was picked up by an
instrument on board Galileo called the Near Infrared Mapping
Spectrometer, which measures the absorption and reflection of
various wavelengths of sunlight by Europa's surface.
</P>
<P>
   Each material absorbs and reflects different, characteristic
wavelengths of light. The wavelengths measured by Galileo's
spectrometer _ from deep red in the visible spectrum out to longer
infrared wavelengths _ can thus reveal the chemical makeup of
Europa's surface.
</P>
<P>
   When the spectrometer focused on the areas of Europa that
appeared in photographs to consist of pure ice, it indeed measured
the characteristic spectrum of water ice _ no surprise there.
</P>
<P>
   But when the instrument examined features like the many dark
lines that crisscross the moon's surface, it obtained several
distorted spectra that each looked similar to ice.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas McCord, a geophysicist at the University of Hawaii who is
studying the Galileo data, recognized that the spectra were
produced by light reflecting off water-impregnated salty minerals,
including natron and Epsom salts. Such salts, McCord says, form
only in the presence of liquid water.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first evidence that Europa's ocean is briny,''
McCord says.
</P>
<P>
   The circulating currents of a salty sea would explain the
unusual magnetic readings that other Galileo instruments have
recorded. Those currents may create a magnetic field for the moon.
</P>
<P>
   Galileo found that the salts have the same composition at
different sites scattered about the moon, evidence that the sea is
extensive and well mixed.
</P>
<P>
   The composition of the salts, McCord says, gives some hints
about the chemistry of Europa's ocean.
</P>
<P>
   The presence of sodium carbonates means that carbon dioxide is
probably dissolved in the water.
</P>
<P>
   On Earth, volcanoes and submarine hydrothermal vents release
carbon dioxide, ``so it is reasonable to think that carbon dioxide
gas would be coming out of Europa's mantle and into the ocean,''
McCord says. ``The ice cap would seal the ocean most of the time,
so the carbon dioxide would build up and become like seltzer
water.''
</P>
<P>
   Raise the pressure of that carbon dioxide high enough and it
could erupt through the ice to the surface. (This could explain the
origin of volcano-like features on Europa.)
</P>
<P>
   Once exposed to the near vacuum that exists at the moon's
surface, the briny water would quickly evaporate, leaving the salts
behind.
</P>
<P>
   As yet, there is no evidence that Europa has hydrothermal vents
on its ocean floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if there is an ocean, there has to be heat coming out of
the mantle,'' McCord says, ``so there almost have to be
hydrothermal vents.''
</P>
<P>
   There is certainly no reason that hydrothermal vents couldn't
exist in oceans on worlds other than our own. In fact, the Mars
Global Surveyor mission recently found signs of a large deposit of
hematite _ a mineral often formed by hydrothermal activity _ near
Mars' equator.
</P>
<P>
   If the hematite deposit does indeed mark the site of a large
ancient body of hot water, it would be an ideal place to search for
past life on Mars.
</P>
<P>
   A briny Europan sea might also contain evidence of past life.
But unlike Mars, Europa may still harbor some kind of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is felt that carbon dioxide in the ocean created a fertile
environment for the formation of life on Earth,'' McCord says.
</P>
<P>
   Carbonates create a less acidic environment, one more favorable
for life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here we have, perhaps, a carbon dioxide-rich ocean. It's one
more thing that suggests that the ocean could be a habitat for
life.''

A VISIT TO MCGWIRETOWN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   McGWIRETOWN, U.S.A. _ My actual location is Fairview Heights,
Ill., which is just 15 miles from downtown St. Louis, which is
where Mark McGwire reigns as king of the world.
</P>
<P>
   If you are anywhere in the St. Louis area, you are in
McGwiretown. McGwire owns the region, from Busch Stadium to
wherever it is in upstate Illinois that baseball fans stop rooting
for the St. Louis Cardinals and start rooting for the Chicago Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   In Chicago, home-run rival Sammy Sosa is king of the world. But
here in southwestern Illinois, where we can look across the
Mississippi River and see the famous Gateway Arch, life revolves
around Big Mac.
</P>
<P>
   Go into any supermarket, quick stop or department store and you
are knee-deep in vast arrays of Mac memorabilia: shirts, caps,
books, posters ...
</P>
<P>
   McGwiretown went nuts when Mac broke Roger Maris' single-season
home-run record Sept. 8, and sanity seems disinclined to return.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the day that the videotape of President Clinton's
grand jury testimony was released to America and the world, the
White House sex scandal had to share the top of Page 1 in the ``St.
Louis Post-Dispatch'': ``McGwire hits 65th homer but loses 66th in
controversy.''
</P>
<P>
   The locals are still snarling about that stupid umpire in
Milwaukee who voided No. 66 by ruling that a fan interfered with
the baseball before it cleared the outfield wall.
</P>
<P>
   The ump should thank his lucky stars he didn't make that call in
St. Louis. He might still be hanging by his heels from the top of
the Arch.
</P>
<P>
   Just a joke _ I think. Folks around these parts are fired up
about the home-run race. They live and die with every swing of
Mac's mighty bat.
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, this is not a good place to be for someone who
is attempting to conduct a boycott of baseball. There is no way to
avoid baseball in McGwiretown, U.S.A.
</P>
<P>
   I suspect that a person might get locked up faster for
bad-mouthing baseball in McGwiretown than for hijacking a truckload
of those weird new $20 bills that will soon be confusing consumers
everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Bad-mouthing Mark McGwire would surely be treated as a capital
offense.
</P>
<P>
   So I haven't said much about my baseball boycott. When I'm in a
public place and the ball game is on TV _ it's on everywhere, of
course _ I shut up and watch right along with everybody else.
</P>
<P>
   And when McGwire is finished batting, I go on about my business
_ right along with everybody else. Interesting thing about
Macmania: Nobody is particularly involved with the ball game; the
fans only care about McGwire's at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   In restaurants and sports bars, people will be ready to leave
and then someone will say: ``Wait, we have to stay until McGwire
comes up.''
</P>
<P>
   After McGwire bats, they rush for the door, determined to arrive
at their next destination in time for McGwire's next at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   If boycotting baseball means boycotting McGwire _ and it does _
there can be no boycott in McGwiretown. And if I don't get out of
here soon, there will be no boycott for me.
</P>
<P>
   It almost ended Wednesday. Sosa had hit two homers earlier to
pull even with McGwire at 65, and the Cardinals were playing at
home against the Houston Astros. The game was scheduled to start
shortly after 7 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   At 6:45, I was sitting in my hotel room, listening to the
pre-game show on the radio and calculating how long it would take
me to get to the ballpark. If I couldn't get there by game time, I
figured, I could certainly get there in time for McGwire's first
trip to the plate.
</P>
<P>
   The boycott was hanging by a thread. I was hoping that the
announcer would declare the game sold out and advise me to stay
away from Busch Stadium. He didn't.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, I procrastinated long enough that I lost the urge
to attend the game. I went on about my business, although I didn't
go anyplace that didn't figure to have a TV set tuned to the game.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire didn't hit a home run, and the boycott survived for one
more day _ but there were still four games to play.
</P>
<P>
   It's time for me to get out of town.
</P>

 COMMUNITY SERVICE FOR CLINTON   (EDS: This is an abbreviated
version of the original 1200-word essay.)  By DAVID PLOTZ 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Clinton and his allies are desperately seeking a dignified way
out of Flytrap: How about community service? We should let the
president serve out his term, but let's make him really serve.
</P>
<P>
   Every week until the end of his term, Clinton would spend a few
hours on some direct, necessary community service. Congress would
decide--after negotiation with the president--the total number of
hours and the kind of work. The service would be an everyday
obligation for Clinton, with no presidential photo ops and no
special treatment.
</P>
<P>
   What would be the benefits of this regimen? For starters,
Clinton would make tangible reparations for the damage he has
inflicted to society. In service, Clinton could not allow words to
substitute for actions. He would have to act.
</P>
<P>
   Service would meet another requirement of Flytrap punishment: It
would humble him. In service, he would, for the first time in 20
years, take orders instead of give them, cater to others instead of
being catered to. That might begin to cure, or at least temper, his
wicked and dangerous sense of entitlement.
</P>
<P>
   The humbling of Clinton would also serve a political function:
It would placate conservatives, especially if service were combined
with a haymaker congressional censure. The image of Clinton
scraping graffiti off some high school might persuade enough
Republicans to sign on.
</P>
<P>
   Some will object that service, like censure, is not in the
Constitution. Congress cannot impose community service on the
president without his permission--that would be an unconstitutional
``bill of attainder.'' (Slate's ``Explainer'' examines the ``bill
of attainder'' at greater length here.) But if Clinton consents,
censure and community service can proceed. And he would certainly
consent if the alternative was impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The thorniest question, of course, is: What kind of service? It
must be dignified: It cannot tarnish the presidency, and it must be
acceptable to Clinton. (So bedpans and chain gangs are out. Sorry,
Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga.) Yet it must be punitive enough that
Republicans will be satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, a perfect model for such honorable yet humble
service already exists, and it even has a presidential imprimatur:
</P>
<P>
   Habitat for Humanity. Clinton should build houses for the poor
with Jimmy Carter. Or, better yet, he should build houses for the
poor under the supervision of Jimmy Carter. Now that's a Flytrap
remedy even Clinton's worst enemies can love.

THE MILLENNIUM WORKS 
</HEADLINE>
  By JACOB WEISBERG 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Since plans for Britain's Millennium Dome began to take shape
last year, condemnation has poured in from all sides. Left-wing
critics are appalled at the waste of $1.3 billion that could have
gone toward housing and the National Health Service. Conservatives
object to the Blair government's attempt to present England as a
modern, multicultural nation instead of a tradition-bound,
Christian one. With the help of constant attacks from all sides,
the dome's approval rating fell to 8 percent in one recent
poll--lower than Monica's, Ken's, or even Linda's. The only people
in London who don't heap scorn on it are those who complain they're
too tired of the topic to talk about it.
</P>
<P>
   On the chance that something so despised might deserve
defending, I put on a hard hat and rubber boots and went to look at
the construction site in Greenwich, just outside London, this week.
(Sept. 21) (Because the world's clocks are fixed to Greenwich Mean
Time, this is the spot where the millennium can be argued to
officially debut.)
</P>
<P>
   As I half suspected, the dome is better than advertised. As a
building, it is stunning. As the site of the main international
event of the Year 2000, it may or may not succeed. But the dome has
at least a chance to follow in the path of its illustrious English
ancestors, the Crystal Palace exhibition of 1851 and the Festival
of Britain of 1951. Those events, too, were derided in advance as
wasteful and stupid. But they are remembered now as monumental
expressions of British identity and historical moment.
</P>
<P>
   As a feat of architecture, engineering, and urban renewal, the
dome is already close to being a success. John Major's Tory
government first conceived of the project, and Labor was officially
opposed before it took power, so until 1997, no one knew what would
happen. Once Tony Blair decided to make the dome a kind of
signature for ``New Labor,'' there were just three years to plan
and build one of the largest structures on earth--on a contaminated
gasworks site. Before construction could begin, the ground below
literally had to be washed to remove cyanide and arsenic. Engineers
then went about raising a room of nearly a million square feet.
This is a structure so huge that, according to Anthony Day, the
retired architect who gave me a tour, weather systems would form
inside if not for the high-tech fiberglass and Teflon double skin.
Day suggests that winter visitors will want to bring overcoats and
brandy flasks, because the building is simply too big to heat
(though I suspect the Brits like it that way).
</P>
<P>
   Even if the exhibition fails to draw the hoped-for 15 million
visitors, it will be responsible for turning hundreds of acres of
industrial wasteland into a lovely spot on the Thames linked to the
rest of the metropolis by the Underground.
</P>
<P>
   This follows the urban planning ideas of Britain's most famous
architect, Richard Rogers, who is responsible for the dome. Rogers
believes that London, like many of the world's great cities, is
being undone by traffic and unplanned sprawl.
</P>
<P>
   He argues in a recent book, ``Cities for a Small Planet''
(Westview Press, 1998), that the way to rescue London is to reduce
car traffic; develop new neighborhoods for mixed use; and convert
the city's greatest natural asset, the Thames riverbank, into
public space. If successful, the dome will make the case for
pursuing Rogers' grander vision--turning the Thames Embankment, now
a highway along the river, into a grand park.
</P>
<P>
   Like Rogers' best-known building, the Pompidou Center in Paris,
the dome is drawn in brilliant color, which jumps out against the
London drab like a brightly frosted cake. The Italian-born
architect's other hallmark, of which the Lloyd's of London
headquarters is the leading example, is for a building to show how
it works, exposing its elevators, ventilation pipes, and structural
girders.
</P>
<P>
   You can see, at a glance from the outside, how the dome stands
up. Its huge tent is sustained by brilliant yellow tent poles,
nearly 300 feet high and stitched together with steel cables. From
the overlooking hill of the Greenwich Royal Observatory, the
structure looks like a whimsical sea monster that crawled out of
the Thames.
</P>
<P>
   The chief fault of Rogers' other buildings is that they don't
age well--many of the better known ones have an early '80s, ``new
wave'' look. But the dome has the advantage of being temporary. The
millennium exhibition will last a year, and though the structure
may be converted to another use, it's only supposed to last 25
years.
</P>
<P>
   The tent is beautiful empty--David Hockney, the painter, was
recently quoted proposing that it be left that way. And members of
the planning committee may privately share that wish. Almost every
decision about how to fill the space has aroused controversy. The
most ridiculed proposal is ``Body,'' a gargantuan naked human
people can walk through, observing the operation of the internal
organs as in a Rogers building. Leaving Dome Person unsexed on the
exterior seems overly prudish. But the alternative of
Brobdingnagian genitalia and python-size pubic hairs could be hard
to stomach, even after the Starr report.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest challenge may be the least futuristic part of the
exhibition--the ``National Identity'' section, for which the
committee has yet to announce any kind of plan. In deciding what to
put here, Britain will be describing itself to the world.
</P>
<P>
   In previous great exhibitions, this was a less complicated
issue. At the dawn of the Industrial Revolution in 1851, Britain
was an imperial power with a unitary culture. A great exhibition
was a chance to dazzle with what it could make and build, beginning
with the glass and iron Crystal Palace itself, a marvel of early
Victorian engineering. The 1951 Festival of Britain (organized by
the grandfather of the Labor minister now in charge of the
Millennium Dome) still represented a culturally homogenous,
industrial country. It displayed thousands of British-made things,
heralding the emergence from wartime rationing into postwar
consumerism.
</P>
<P>
   But today, Britain is increasingly an immigrant nation with an
emerging postindustrial economy. It depends far more on the export
of services and its culture than it does on its goods. The Blair
government has invested its prestige in the dome because it sees it
as an opportunity to convey this new social and economic reality.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Mandelson, the Cabinet member in charge of the millennium
project, was lampooned for traveling to Disney World in search of
ideas. But an excess of popular appeal is less likely than an
overinfusion of centrist political ideology. Blair loves to say
that he sees Britain as a dynamic, forward-looking and
multicultural society. Laborites talk unblushingly about
``re-branding'' the country. To New Labor, the dome is a great
marketing opportunity. Which makes it, in a way, an authentic
expression of the spirit of the age.

DERSHOWITZ AS CHARACTER WITNESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A group of public-spirited virtue-mongers has designated one
week next month as Character Counts! week ... and not a moment too
soon! To commemorate said event (Oct. 18-24), the Joseph and Edna
Josephson Institute of Ethics is publishing ``The Power of
Character: Prominent Americans Talk About Life, Family, Work,
Values and More.''
</P>
<P>
   They've certainly assembled quite a list of characters. They've
got Dan Rather, Arianna Huffington, Dr. Laura Schlessinger,
Marianne Williamson, Charles Colson, Vartan Gregorian, the Rev.
Robert Schuller, Stephen Covey, Stephen Carter, and many, many
others. Diet book diva Susan Estrich, who once lied to me in an
interview (I know; it's like lying to Congress _ who cares?) is
here, with a nicely turned essay on the late Judge J. Skelly
Wright. Among local notables, we find Clark University's Christina
Hoff Sommers and O.J. Simpson's favorite appeals lawyer, Alan
Dershowitz.
</P>
<P>
   The Dersh, last spotted at Martha's Vineyard airport awaiting
the First Character's vacation arrival, leaves us with these
musings on character: ``Good character consists of recognizing the
selfishness that inheres in each of us and trying to balance it
against the altruism to which we should all aspire. It is a
difficult balance to strike, but no definition of goodness can be
complete without it.''
</P>
<P>
   Watch out, William Bennett. He's gaining on you.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Heard on the street
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I hear a sea change has occurred at the three national magazines
unloaded by mutual fund giant Fidelity Investments earlier this
year. The new owners, a bunch of rich guys out of Travelers Corp.,
actually expect the publications to make money!
</P>
<P>
   The three rags in question are Peter Lynch fanzine Worth, the
world's worst financial publication; Civilization, an elegant,
little-read paean to haute kultur; and American Benefactor, which
covers philanthropy. For several years, the magazines were the
plaything of deep-pocketed Fidelity boss Ned Johnson, and money
flowed freely. Current publishers Greenwich Street Capital Partners
are keeping a closer eye on the bottom line. My spy reports: ``The
place is a slave shop. Come back, Fidelity!'' ... Elsewhere,
Kathryn Harris reports in her Bloomberg column that Mitt Romney's
Bain Capital may be plunging deeper into Hollywood, as Bain,
through a tiny film company called Artisan, seems to be the only
bidder for PolyGram Filmed Entertainment. Bain has been mucking
around Tinseltown since last year's purchase of Artisan, formerly
known as Live Entertainment. Live's chief executive was Jose
Menendez, gunned down in his home by his own sons.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that Romney, a Mormon, ``avoids alcohol, tobacco, and
even caffeine,'' Harris asks: ``Why would a guy like Romney be
putting money in Hollywood?'' Maybe for the same reason the
Episcopalians at Boston Ventures put money in Motown Records _ to
make a bundle.
</P>
<P>

 &QL; 
Hi-ho the glamorous life!
</P>
<P>

 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   H.L. Mencken once remarked to his pal Charles Angoff that
writers are people who work for a couple of hours a day and talk
about themselves the rest of the time. So how do writers really
pass the time? My friend Paul Brown, coauthor of the business
classic ``Customers for Life'' has tapped into a group of scribes
who check the sales volume of their books at the amazon.com Web
site _ three or four times a day! (Amazon's entire inventory is
updated in real time, so a sale of a dozen books can propel a book
from number 4,678 in sales way up to number 235, in minutes.)
</P>
<P>
   Paul says his book generally hovers in the 10,000s to 20,000s,
but on one day it was the 641st best-selling volume in Amazon's
inventory. His friend Barbara Rudolph likewise cops to being ``a
compulsive Amazon checker'' who used to check the Web site 12-15
times a day. (``I'm down to five or six.'') Her book,
``Disconnected,'' about six &UR;  &LR; laid-off AT&AMP;T employees, has yoyoed
from number 6,000 to 1,500 within hours. A National Public Radio
feature sent ``Disconnected'' into the low 600s. Given that Amazon
represents only 3 percent of the US book market, ``I know I'm silly
to be doing this,'' Rudolph admits.

RACIAL GAP WIDENS IN HUB SCHOOLS' TEST SCORES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BETH DALEY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Despite more than a decade of effort by the Boston
public schools to close the test score gap between whites and
minorities, the gap has widened, scores show.
</P>
<P>
   While the schools have succeeded in the past two years in
boosting a significant number of black and Hispanic students out of
the lowest-scoring category, many minorities have not moved into
the higher scoring ranges at the rate of white students,
particularly in math.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in the 1996 citywide math test of 11th graders,
only 1 percent of blacks and 2 percent of Hispanics were ranked
``proficient'' or ``advanced.'' This compared to 18 percent of
whites.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the percentage of blacks and Hispanics scoring in those
top categories had increased _ to 2 percent of blacks and 4 percent
of Hispanics. Whites, in contrast, made an 11 percent gain, with 29
percent scoring at those levels.
</P>
<P>
   The city's test scores since 1985, reviewed by the Globe, are a
disheartening result for a school system that has made narrowing
the achievement gap between racial groups a priority for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's puzzling to us,'' said Maryellen Donahue, head of
research, assessment, and evaluation for the city's public schools.
``It's one of the most important issues we have.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is by no means unique to Boston. Nationally, the
test score gap between whites and minorities in city school systems
has generally either reached a plateau or increased, according to
the educational literature, after years of improvement during the
1970s and early 1980s following desegregation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing about this is that we saw the gap narrow before; it
is fully in our power to do it again,'' said Amy Wilkins, senior
associate of the Education Trust, a nonprofit Washington
educational think tank that has published reports on the
achievement gap nationally.
</P>
<P>
   But Boston School Superintendent Thomas Payzant said narrowing
that gap today is more difficult than it was 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference between the late '90s and the '70s is that
then, it was a task of simple literacy and basic skills,'' he said.
``Now, it's more complex. ... We've got some schools doing a better
job at it than others.''
</P>
<P>
   Payzant said that by mid-October, schools that have made the
most gains in closing the racial achievement gap will have been
identified so their methods can be replicated.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1985 and 1995, whites made much greater gains in math
and reading scores than blacks and Hispanics. The scores of Asian
students tended to either increase slightly or stay the same; their
greatest gains were in math.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, 50 percent of white 7th graders scored in the 66th
percentile or above for reading; 50 percent of blacks scored in the
44th percentile or above.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years later, 50 percent of whites were scoring in the 79th
percentile or higher, while 50 percent of blacks were scoring in
the 46th percentile or higher, according to Metropolitan
Achievement Test results supplied by the School Department.
</P>
<P>
   The citywide achievement test was changed in 1996 to the
Stanford 9. The scores on that test also show an increasing gap in
performance at the highest ranges.
</P>
<P>
   The most encouraging sign, however, is in reading, a focus of
the Boston schools for two years. Whites and minorities made about
equal gains in the last two years into the ``proficient'' and
``advanced'' levels.
</P>
<P>
   Payzant says he intends to work on closing the gap by raising
expectations for all students, through stricter promotion standards
and better professional development for teachers. Critics of the
school system have charged for years that many teachers have lower
standards for minority students than for whites.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard Alkins of the Boston branch of the NAACP said Thursday
that many minority children are also demoralized by the racism that
remains in America, which can affect achievement level.
</P>
<P>
   Others in education say there is a disparity in the education
level of white and minority parents that can affect children's
achievement.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Andrews, headmaster of the Neighborhood Charter School in
Dorchester, and Barney Brawer, who is working with him on the
achievement gap issue, say they see a high number of white students
doing well who are from well-educated families who live in the city
by choice.
</P>
<P>
   They also see an equally high number of black students not doing
well who come from poor and uneducated families. They say they are
struggling with how to make up in school for the educational
disadvantages students may have at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``School success is like a path you travel on,'' Brawer said.
``If you come from a family who has already traveled on it, they
know what to expect and what to do. But if you are someone who has
never done it, you can get very lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrews said: ``Here ... we teach the parents the rules of the
game: `Here are the rules for success. Here is what your child
needs to know.'''

GOP EYES TEXAS AS BUSH BUILDS A DOMINANT BASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CURTIS WILKIE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Squealing schoolgirls crowded a rally for Governor
George W. Bush here the other day while Emilio Navaira, a
heartthrob from the world of Tejano music, serenaded the governor
in Spanish with a campaign song, ``Juntos Con Bush'' (Together With
Bush). Bush responded with a few words in Spanish himself, then
winked impishly at his feat.
</P>
<P>
   The scene was strange, even in exotic Texas.
</P>
<P>
   But in this traditionally Democratic city, a bastion of
Mexican-American voters, Bush seemed to be flexing muscles for his
race for re-election this fall as well as rehearsing for a run at
the next Republican presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The governor says he will not make a decision about the
presidential race before winning re-election and dealing with the
legislature early next year, but this fall's contest does not
appear to be an obstacle to higher ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   According to polls this month by Texas newspapers, Bush holds a
staggering, 49-point lead over his Democratic challenger, Land
Commissioner Garry Mauro. The prospect of impressive victory
already has catapulted Bush into the thick of 2000 presidential
politics, where Hispanic votes are critical in three of the most
vital states, California, Florida, and Texas.
</P>
<P>
   While noting the ``sullied process'' in Washington and worrying
about how a presidential run would invade his family's privacy,
Bush expresses confidence about a national campaign and says he did
not fear reports about his high-living past.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been investigated,'' he said in an interview. ``There was
opposition research and profile pieces when I ran last time. I
think America is going to have to get used to the baby-boomer
generation of politicians. The relevant question of George Bush is
not: Have you made mistakes? But: Have you learned, grown up, and
become prepared to lead?''
</P>
<P>
   While chaos swirls in Washington, these are stable times for the
52-year-old Bush. The son of former President Bush is completing
his first term as governor with high popularity marks, presiding
over a period where prosperity has handed the state an extra $7
billion in revenue _ more than the annual budget of many Third
World countries. In Florida, Bush's brother Jeb is poised to be
elected governor.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor says his proudest accomplishment after four
years in office is ``the tone in Texas, a lack of divisiveness.''
With the Tejano singer at his side, Bush fielded several questions
from a Spanish-speaking television reporter after the San Antonio
event. He resorted to English words for Spanish expressions he did
not know, explaining afterwards, ``I refuse to let my sentences
dangle. My vocabulary's getting better, but I need more practice. I
want to show the people I care about their language.''
</P>
<P>
   After winning nearly a quarter of the Hispanic vote in 1994,
Bush hopes to become the first Anglo Republican candidate to make
substantial gains among Mexican-Americans in a Texas governor's
race.
</P>
<P>
   Many Democrats have already conceded the election. ``It's a
non-race,'' said a well-known Texas Democrat, speaking on the
condition he would not be identified. ``No one thought Mauro could
win, so he got no money. What's left of the Democratic Party is
willing to let Bush go.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview between fund-raising calls at a friend's office
here, Mauro sounded philosophical. ``Maybe it was not the smartest
political decision to run against the son of Barbara Bush,'' he
said. ``But I decided to run because I saw it as a unique
opportunity for this generation.''
</P>
<P>
   At 50, Mauro is a still-youthful veteran of Texas politics, the
last incumbent left from a colorful slate of Texas Democrats,
including Lloyd Bentsen, Ann Richards, and Jim Hightower, that
swept statewide races in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro is popular among Hispanics; some even think he is
Hispanic. ``I'll hang on to that vote big-time,'' he said. ``Bush
has a lot of money and support from the Austin insiders, but
there's not a depth of feeling for him around the state.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the governor has ignored Mauro's appeal for a debate.
``He's going to run for president, but he can't debate a land
commissioner,'' Mauro said in frustration. ``George Bush doesn't
understand textbook civics. He's ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   With little excitement in the governor's race, politicians in
Texas appear preoccupied with President Clinton's quandary and are
curious about Bush's long-range plans.
</P>
<P>
   Karl Rove, Bush's chief political strategist, said no national
campaign staff was being assembled. Asked about frequent visits to
Austin by Ralph Reed, former executive director of the Christian
Coalition and now a private consultant, Rove said Reed was ``a
longtime friend'' of the governor's and not part of any campaign
apparatus.
</P>
<P>
   In an expansive interview at his office in the state capitol
last week, Bush called the situation in Washington ``embarrassing
and depressing. The nation is focused on matters that are not of
state. ... But I have a more patient view, and I think the system
will be purged by the time the presidential race begins to jell.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has acknowledged being ``young and irresponsible,'' but he
said he does not intend to confess to a ``laundry list'' of
indiscretions. Before he was married, Bush had a reputation as a
carousing ladies' man. But he quit drinking abruptly on his 40th
birthday, and friends now describe Bush as a family man devoted to
his wife, Laura, and their twin 16-year-old daughters.
</P>
<P>
   With politics intruding into private lives, Bush said he is most
concerned that his family will be upset if he runs for president.
``It's a lifetime commitment,'' he said, that will make impossible
such ordinary outings as to go ``down to Wal-Mart and buy a power
mower.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said Clinton bore much of the blame for the poisonous
political atmosphere. ``He didn't tell the truth and he misused the
Oval Office.'' But the governor also criticized ``zero sum politics
_ I win; you lose _ that's been festering for a decade'' as well as
the practice of ``gotcha journalism.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The written word has been denigrated,'' Bush said. ``Scribes
have become pundits on TV. Political journalism has been changed by
TV and the Internet. There's a plethora of programming, of
information, a competition of opinion. It's almost anarchistic.''

CALIFORNIA NEEDS A NEW HIV REPORTING SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MITCH KATZ  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Powerful HIV therapies have lengthened the time
between initial HIV infection and an AIDS diagnosis for many
individuals. The result is that thousands of Californians who are
HIV-positive, but not diagnosed with AIDS, are missed by our
current reporting system since it does not track the human
immunodeficiency virus.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Pete Wilson's signature on a bill (AB 1663), sponsored by
Assemblywoman Carole Migden, would enable California to modernize
its AIDS case reporting system to incorporate HIV cases, providing
a more complete picture of the epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   With AB 1663, cases of HIV infection would be reported to local
health officials through the use of a unique code _ rather than a
person's name _ in an effort to protect both public health and
confidentiality. In recent months, there has been a great deal of
national debate about the importance of medical privacy. When
asked, the majority of people prefer that their medical records not
be made available to the government or other private entities for
fear that this information could be used inappropriately.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of HIV reporting, protecting confidentiality is more
than just an issue of privacy _ it also represents sound public
health policy. Studies have shown that when people know that their
names will be reported to their local health department, they are
less likely to get tested for HIV and obtain medical care because
of the very real fear of AIDS discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of names reporting, who say that collecting HIV case
information by name is more accurate, often fail to recognize this
serious deterrent effect. If names reporting ultimately undermines
the community's trust in the public health system, driving
individuals away from testing and treatment, we have caused great
harm.
</P>
<P>
   Because of these concerns, the City and County of San Francisco
_ distinguished by its longstanding leadership in the fight against
HIV _ firmly opposes name-based HIV reporting and strongly supports
the public health approach outlined in Migden's bill.
</P>
<P>
   I believe that this legislation represents a tremendous
opportunity for California. Not only has it gained the approval of
mainstream medical groups like the California Medical Association
and the California Conference of Local Health Officers, but support
also comes from advocacy groups for people living with HIV that
have traditionally opposed any type of HIV reporting system.
</P>
<P>
   Migden's bill is a unique compromise that provides a reasonable
response to a critical public health need. If the legislation is
not signed into law, California will continue to have no system of
HIV reporting, reducing our state's ability to accurately monitor
and track the epidemic. We must begin implementation of an HIV
reporting system immediately to ensure that we are not at a
disadvantage in federal resource allocations that may be based on
counting HIV infections rather than just AIDS cases.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, such a system allows us to continue to notify the
partners of those who are infected, when appropriate, just as we
currently do. Reporting the name of the infected person to the
health department is not necessary for such partner notification
services.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, by implementing the bill, California would join a
growing number of states that have rejected names reporting for a
more sound public health approach to HIV reporting. In addition to
Maryland _ which has used a unique identifier system successfully
for nearly five years _ Massachusetts and Hawaii are implementing
similar systems, and other states (including Connecticut and
Washington) are seriously considering this option. California's
current approach to AIDS reporting is outdated and should be
replaced.
</P>
<P>
   Migden's bill will provide much-needed information to public
health officials without driving individuals away from HIV testing
and medical care. California should swiftly take advantage of the
critical and exciting opportunity afforded by this bill.

RESOLVE TO KEEP MAKING CONTRIBUTIONS TO (401)K 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, September 27, 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I am totally lost and don't know how to think and plan for
the future. The new market changes have created a kind of
confusion. I am 46 and have a 401(k) plan evenly divided between
balanced funds and a stock index fund. Last quarter the returns
were low _ the balanced funds advanced 2.95 percent, and the stock
index was up 3.30 percent. God knows what the results are going to
be for the second quarter. Is my money in the right place? Should I
make changes before the end of this quarter?. One idea I had is to
close the 401(k) account, pay the penalties, pay off all my debts,
and start over.
</P>
<P>
   C.M., Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I think the problem is one of expectations. We don't really
have a ``new market,'' but simply a market which is, for the first
time in several years, showing that the direction isn't always
going to be up. The quarterly returns you achieved in the second
quarter, far from being low, are actually stronger than the
long-term average historical returns from stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Let's look at what was going on before the bull market of the
late '90s began. From 1950 to 1994, the Dow Jones industrial
average achieved gains in 310 months. For the other 230 months, the
average was in the red. This amounts to a 57.4 percent record of
gains. When you are dealing with a long-term program such as a
401(k) plan, your expectations should be more in line with those
1950-1994 results than with what has been happening in the
extraordinary markets from 1995 to 1998.
</P>
<P>
   If you plan to retire at age 65, this means you will be building
this account for another 228 months, and I think it's reasonable to
expect sour results in something very much like 97 of them _ this
is simply what happens with the market. (You should be guessing by
now that I'm entirely against cashing out the 401(k) plan.)
</P>
<P>
   Let's consider the effect of cashing out. If you were to take
that move, beginning over with the $200.33 combined monthly
contributions to the fund that you and your employer have been
making, it would take you a little more than 54 months to get back
to your current $13,655 balance. Then during the remaining 174
months the account would grow to $129,480. (These examples presume
10 percent average annual returns and continued total contributions
of $200.33 a month.) But if you left the current balance in the
account and continued making contributions at current levels, the
account would be worth $212,146 after 19 years. It seems to me that
having an additional $82,666 in your retirement pool should far
outweigh having $9,832 to spend now.
</P>
<P>
   Like other savings programs, a 401(k) is a discipline _ you have
to resolve to keep making your contributions no matter what else is
going on with your finances. When you have your 401(k) invested
primarily in stocks, the discipline becomes even tougher _ you have
to keep shoveling it in during those many months when the market
will lose ground.
</P>
<P>
   I have no problem with your choice of investments; you outline
that the alternative investments are a short-term interest account,
an equity fund, and your company's stock.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly with your long-term time frame, you don't want the
short-term interest account, and since you don't specify the equity
fund or your company, I can't make a judgment on those options.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am a 47-year-old union iron worker, and I have $110,000
invested through my union's annuity plan, which is being switched
to Vanguard investments. I contribute $7,000 annually. I plan to
work 10 more years, and like to make the most of the years I have
left to invest. How do you suggest I diversify my investments?
</P>
<P>
   D.G., Canyon Country, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Ten years is a tough time frame to work with. It is the
precise stage at which intermediate-term investing ends and
long-term investing begins. Since I'm pretty distrustful of the
current market, and since you'll soon enough be in the intermediate
term anyway, I suggest you take a cautious approach to investing
the $110,000 you've already saved, and then take a more aggressive
approach with investing your ongoing contributions.
</P>
<P>
   I suggest that half of your nest egg go into Vanguard Balanced
Index, which invests 60 percent of its assets in a broad array of
stocks, basically designed to emulate the performance of the stock
market at large, but dominated by the large-cap stocks that drive
most indexes. I would put the remaining 50 percent of the money in
Vanguard GNMA, a fund invested in government-guaranteed mortgage
securities.
</P>
<P>
   I suggest you divide the current contributions among three
funds, selected to counterbalance the conservative approach
suggested above. First, I'd put 25 percent of this money in the
Vanguard Specialized Health Care portfolio. This takes you into
expensive stocks, but it's a fast-growing sector of the market, and
profits in the kind of health care companies favored by this fund _
pharmaceuticals and health care equipment companies _ tend to move
even faster than sales. Such a holding can give you a bumpy road,
and might especially do so in the near term. But remember, you will
be engaged on a dollar-cost averaging program, and if the fund
stumbles, that means that next month's contribution will be buying
shares at a lower price, bringing your average overall cost per
share down.
</P>
<P>
   I would then put a similar percentage into Vanguard Small Cap
Stock Index. This is a sector of the market which has over the very
long haul tended to outpace the established large-cap issues that
have driven the recent markets. My feeling is that, more than any
other market sector, the small caps are ``due.''
</P>
<P>
   For the final 50 percent, I'll stick with stocks but be more
conservative, recommending Vanguard Index Value. This is a fund
which holds about two-thirds of the issues in the Standard &AMP; Poor's
500, selecting those with the lowest price-to-book value ratios.
These tend to be the solid, established, perhaps sleepy, but also
dividend paying stocks _ a lot of utilities, auto makers, and so
forth. The dividends and established franchises of these companies
would, I think, give it a little protection in a market downturn.
You might keep an eye on this one, and if the market appears to
have returned to more normal values _ which I would define as
dividends in the area of 2.5 percent, and price-to-earnings ratios
in the neighborhood of 15 to 20 _ then you might consider switching
to Vanguard Index 500. But for the current market, I'd venture no
further than Index Value.

FOR US EXPATRIATES IN MOSCOW, THE MUSIC HAS STOPPED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; MOSCOW _ What do you do when your city is too blue to listen
to the blues?
</P>
<P>
   Lately, Jane has had plenty of time to think that one over.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, she had a life that epitomized Russia's allure for
adventurous Americans _ an exciting job at an international
financial firm and a regular gig on Moscow's club circuit as the
lead singer of a blues band.
</P>
<P>
   But that was before Aug. 17, when Russia's government defaulted
on its debts, its banking system froze, and the ruble plummeted.
Moscow's burgeoning financial industry went bust overnight and
businesses across the country came to a virtual halt. The crisis
has swept away Russian and Western companies alike, and survivors
have faced losses and layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Now Jane, a Pennsylvania native who asked that her real name not
be used, has joined the swelling ranks of Moscow's unemployed.
Worse, her band's show at the Starlite Diner, a favorite expatriate
hangout, has been canceled. You can almost hear them play:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL; 
I was s'posed to play the Starlite &QL; 
But they turned out the stars there tonight. &QL; 
Ain't nobody gonna pay to hear me sing my blues. &QL; 
 &QL; 
(end poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It sounds like the right time to mosey on out of Moscow and join
the thousands of Westerners who are leaving or have already left
town. But Jane's Russian fiance, who plays guitar in her band, is
not going anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Like a number of Americans and other Westerners interviewed for
this report, Jane arrived in Russia hoping to find her fortune amid
the feverish capitalist gold rush here. In the process, these
expatriates fell in love with the place _ or at least the
opportunities available to enterprising Westerners in a land whose
people had long idealized the West. Many of these foreigners have
made more money or done more interesting things than they would
have done at home by exploiting a society that wrote the rules as
it went along.
</P>
<P>
   At the height of Russia's boom last year, firms invested heavily
in short-term treasury bills that yielded fantastic returns. But
when the government defaulted on the bills, investment companies
and banks were left holding millions of dollars of worthless paper.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were sort of like Daffy Duck stretched out between two
boats with the sharks under his crotch,'' said David Jordan, 27,
until recently securities analyst at RussInvest, a $30 million fund
that went under after Aug. 17.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan came to Russia last year on a tourist visa and landed a
job because the fund wanted an American who knew how to pick
stocks. That turned into a $62,000 annual salary. Now his
nationality is his biggest liability.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got Russians with Harvard MBAs,'' said Jordan, who has
an MBA from Vanderbilt. ``If a company's looking to hire, they are
going local. They don't need expat managers.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's Russian wife had a baby three weeks ago. He had no
plans to leave, but his job prospects look slim and he is unsure
what he will do. ``I was definitely caught off guard,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lots of people expected some kind of crisis to occur in Russia.
Its stock market began its downward plunge months ago, propelled by
falling oil prices and the financial crisis in Asia. By May,
Russian equities had gone from the world's best performers in 1997
to the world's worst in 1998. The Russian government, which only in
August defaulted on its debts to lenders, broke its contract years
ago with millions of workers and pensioners by not paying them for
months at a time. Still, few businessmen expected Moscow's consumer
economy to collapse so thoroughly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody thought it would get so bad so fast,''
said Paul O'Brien, a native of Waltham, Mass. and co-owner of the
two Starlite Diners in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Like most businessmen here, O'Brien cannot gain access to his
business's Moscow bank account _ where some $160,000 is frozen. The
collapse of the ruble and the ensuing problems exchanging it for
dollars have wiped out profits and made it harder to import food.
The sudden mass unemployment of Moscow's middle class has sapped
his customer base.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien has been forced to cancel $100,000 in food shipments
from the United States. Plans to open a third restaurant in Moscow
have been shelved and jobs and salaries have been slashed. Still,
he considers himself fortunate. The Starlite made payroll just
before the Aug. 17 collapse. For now, the business will survive.
</P>
<P>
   Others have not been so lucky. Scott Blacklin, president of the
American Chamber of Commerce in Moscow, said that major consumer
goods companies were tearing down the Russian distribution networks
they had built over the past six years because consumer buying
power has plummeted with the ruble's fall and exchange problems
were making it difficult to import. A survey produced by the
chamber found that 50 US companies had lost over $460 million
during the crisis. The overall losses of the international finance
community are estimated by some to be in the billions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like we've been hit by a neutron bomb and we've all been
irradiated, which means we're all alive today. But in 30, 60, 90
days, some of us are going to die,'' Blacklin said. ``The rest of
us are going to survive, but we'll all have to lie around and throw
up for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   One man who should be happy right now is Matt Taibbi, 28,
co-founder and co-editor of the eXile, a controversial
English-language bi-weekly that predicted the current crisis months
ago in a typically raw and irreverent editorial titled ``Russia
Should Default.''
</P>
<P>
   As a journalist, Taibbi, a native of Boston, is proud that his
paper broke the story. But as a businessman, he knows that eXile,
which survives on advertising that is disappearing, could fold. The
paper has already cut salaries in half. After five years in Moscow,
Taibbi is ready to go home.
</P>
<P>
   But how does one end up here for five years? ``If you're an
eccentric person in the US and you come here you probably feel at
home,'' Taibbi said.
</P>
<P>
   People who have been in Russia for a long time have grown used
to crises. The Russian ``boom,'' for example, began when President
Boris N. Yeltsin used tanks to blow away Parliament and hit its
stride while Russia fought a disastrous war with the breakway
republic of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   ``But then, you knew the sun was going to come up,'' said
Michael Fodor of Burlington, Vt., a co-founder of F-Squared, a
Moscow-based market research company. ``Now, companies' management
is saying `I'm not sure the sun is going to come up.'''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is glum. Some predict that the crisis will prove to
be good because it will correct expectations about Russia, which
were inflated despite the country's myriad political problems,
rampant corruption and poor leadership. Russians have always been
patient with the pain their leaders inflict on them, and some
American businessmen have evidently acquired the same patience.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a certain romanticism with being in the place in the
middle of history being made,'' said Bruce Macdonald, 64, of
Windsor, Vt., a marketing specialist who has worked in Moscow since
1989. ``You can have more impact on this society than anywhere
else.''
</P>
<P>
   That impact has not always been appreciated. In 1992,
Macdonald's advertising company helped design the vouchers that
Russia used to sell off shares in thousands of state-owned
factories. Russia's voucher privatization program has since been
widely discredited as a massive scam that allowed a few well-placed
insiders to gobble up the country's best assets for almost nothing.
Now, when Russian nationalists want to stoke anti-Western
sentiment, they invoke the names of the former Russian government
officials who oversaw the sell-off.
</P>
<P>
   Macdonald acknowledged all of that with a nod, but he is still
proud of the role he played in what was considered at the time to
be one of the momentous events of the twentieth century. It is that
sense that Russia is still on the brink of something extraordinary
that keeps him here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have the feeling I'd be bored to tears in the states,'' he
said. ``It's too stable, it's too peaceful, it's too regular. The
most exciting thing that happens is that Clinton has an affair.''

MERCEDES-BENZ SHOWS ITS NEW V-8S IN VERMONT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)  
 (For release Sunday, September 27, 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN R.WHITE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BASIN HARBOR, Vt. _ If you want a driving challenge, you don't
need to go the the expense of a trip to Monaco, Baja California, or
Pikes Peak _ Vermont will do quite nicely. The Green Mounmtain
State is chock-full of scenic routes, nasty mountain switchbacks
and an automotive mountain climb that's steeper than the famed
Pikes Peak run.
</P>
<P>
   Vermont, where the natives are a practical bunch, is a state
where an ``improved'' road means the dirt has been scraped by a
grader recently, and the paved roads are no wider than they
absolutely have to be. It is a place to test the mettle of a new
model, demonstrate the virtue of a car _ or show very quickly the
lack of it.
</P>
<P>
   It was here that Merceedes-Benz decided to introduce its newest
machines, the 1999 ML430 and CLK430, the first a sport/utility that
elegantly blends performance, luxury, and safety, the second a
sports car disguised as an elegantly civilized luxury coupe. The
routes included some few short stretches of interstate, quite a lot
of narrow mountain pavement, plenty of ``improved'' dirt, and, in
the case of the ML430, a couple of miles of muddy, rocky track
through the woods pretending to be a trail.
</P>
<P>
   The ML430 is the Benz answer to the luxury sport utility that
first appeared as the ML320 _ meaning it has a 3.2-liter V-6 under
the hood. The ML430 gets its numerical handle from the fact of a
4.3-liter, 268-horsepower, multivalve V-8 under the hood. For the
$43,750 list price, you get lots of room, seating for a small mob,
comfort, elegance, and a safety package that includes traction
control, the Electronic Stability Program that senses imminent skid
and corrects, Brake Assist that senses panic stops and increases
braking force, four-wheel antilock brakes, front and side air bags,
and a ``thinking'' five-speed automatic transmission that adapts to
the driver's mode of operation. And _ a challenge to the rest of
the SUV world _ a bumper the same height as that of a passenger
car; the Benz SUV is less of a threat to the wee ones on the road.
There is also the Baby Smart technology that turns off the air bags
to protect children in the Benz baby seat, and, if you like
sunroofs, the ML430 is to have the mother of them all available, a
4-foot-by-3-foot skyview.
</P>
<P>
   The proof, as they say, is in the pudding, so early Tuesday
under lowering skies, a herd of motor journalists set forth in 20
of the new SUVs, headed across Vermont Route 17, thence onto a
variety of roads. There are signs that tell you the roads will be a
... challenge? ``Winter travel not advised,'' it may say, or
``tractor trailers and busses (sic) not permitted.''
</P>
<P>
   The first tricky bit was a dirt trail in the process of being
graded with a mound of soft dirt running about where the left wheel
should be tracking. The ML traction control doesn't lock axles to
get you out of the muck; it senses slip and adds brake to improve
traction _ one wheel on the ground is enough to keep you moving.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible to get into trouble with an ML, but you have to
be prize-winning stupid to do it, and somebody on the route did,
but not trouble enough to need help _ merely an errant drift
slightly over the edge onto a shoulder that wasn't there.
</P>
<P>
   We tracked up mountains and down, on dirt, semi-dirt,
semi-pavement, and at last found ourselves dashing up Route 108 out
of Stowe across Smugglers' Notch, a paved, tortuous trail that at
one point barely becomes one lane as it bends around the rocks.
More dirt, more turns, then lunch and real craziness.
</P>
<P>
   We dined, as it were, at Zack's On the Rocks. Zack greets us in
a frilled purple garment somewhere between house dress and toga.
The decor can only be described as bizarre, the sugar is purple as
is the salad dressing, but the food is quite good _ if you enjoy
eating in what looks like the flower-festooned set of a horror
flick starring Bette Davis and Freddie _ in a cave.
</P>
<P>
   Then it was into the CLK430 with its 275-horsepower V-8, a
$47,900 luxury package that will leap from 0 to 60 miles per hour
in 6.1 seconds and offers the ESP as standard equipment _ it's an
option on the CLK320 sister coupe.
</P>
<P>
   Back down 108 through Smugglers' Notch from the north, now, then
a sprint on Interstate 89, and back onto the secondary tracks, and
the misadventure begins. The ML is no slouch in the corners, but
the CLK bends around the turns like an articulated rat _ CLK is
pronounced smooth, soaks up the bumps and ruts. My driving partner,
John Bugsy Lawlor of NPR and WBZ, is navigating this leg. We are to
``bear right at the round church and turn right onto Hinesburg
Road'' but Bugsy merely advises ``you go right'' and flashes past
Hinesburg for an eventual 14-mile detour. Another team follows us.
Later, I hear: ``I think we were supposed to go straight back there
on Moncton ....'' Oh, what the heck; we got 20 miles' more driving
than anybody else _ except for those other guys behind us.
</P>
<P>
   The ML430 is an SUV that looks more like a van than a truck,
behaves like a good sedan, handles and accelerates like a sporty
coupe, yet it is a rigid box on a frame just like the truck-based
SUVs. The CLK430 has the manners of a road racer, the ride of a
luxury sedan, and induces joy in a driver like a basket of kittens
evokes fun in a kindergarten. The V-8 engines in both cars offer
peak torque over a wide, flat band, 3,000 to 4,500 r.p.m.; the
result is surprising responsiveness in virtually any gear. The ML
is good at passing, the CLK is a lightning bolt.
</P>
<P>
   These are pricey cars for the well-to-do, but Benz cars wear
well. Sooner or later, they will be affordable used cars with all
that good stuff still working ... and then maybe I can afford one
to enjoy my approaching geezerhood.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, thumbs up.

CANCER CAN'T STOP THE ORIOLES' DAVIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBIN ROMANO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It was early in the baseball season, an off day for the
Baltimore Orioles, but far from an off day for Eric Davis.
</P>
<P>
   The veteran outfielder was on the phone to Boston, giving advice
and encouragement to a woman who had just been diagnosed with colon
cancer and was about to undergo the rigors of chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   At the all too young age of 36, Davis knows of what he speaks.
On June 15, 1997, just weeks after doubling over in the dugout with
severe abdominal pain, Davis underwent surgery at Johns Hopkins
Hospital in Baltimore. Doctors removed a baseball-sized growth and
a third of his colon. He then began a once-a-week chemotherapy
regimen that lasted nine months.
</P>
<P>
   Truly, no one expected Davis to return last season to the
Orioles, who at the time were trying to win the American League
East title. But four months after major abdominal surgery, he was
playing at Camden Yards as Baltimore clinched. A few weeks later,
just days after a chemotherapy treatment, he belted the winning
home run in Game 5 of the AL Championship Series against Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   His courage and determination won him many awards, including
those named in honor of Roberto Clemente, Tony Conigliaro, and Fred
Hutchinson.
</P>
<P>
   But what of 1998? Still subjected to chemotherapy treatments as
late as January, Davis had his fitness, his ability to play a full
season of baseball, called into question. Saying he didn't want to
``hurt Eric,'' his manager, Ray Miller, projected Davis for 100
games at the most.
</P>
<P>
   Even Davis's oncologist, Dr. Ross Donehower of Johns Hopkins,
wasn't sure what to expect.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not as if there is a huge precedent for this,'' said
Donehower. ``Most people who get colon cancer are older and most
aren't world-class athletes.''
</P>
<P>
   What Davis has done in 1998 is simply this: play in 128 games,
bat a team-high .328, hit 27 home runs, and drive in 87 runs _ all
while battling painful bone chips in his right elbow. After the
Orioles stumbled out of the gate and were a dreadful 38-50 at the
All-Star break, Davis brought them alive and back into the
wild-card race. He hit in a club-record 30 straight games during a
27-7 run, batting .400 with 12 homers and 41 RBIs during that
stretch.
</P>
<P>
   How impressive is all that? To comprehend, you must understand
the long-term effects chemotherapy can have on the human body.
</P>
<P>
   For colon cancer, the drug commonly used is 5-FU. In Davis's
case, it was administered once a week in six-week cycles, with two
weeks off between cycles. Davis was hooked up to an IV, and a form
of folic acid called leucovorin, which helps bind the 5-FU to its
target, was dripped into a vein in his arm for two hours. Midway
through the process, a nurse would inject the 5-FU into the IV.
</P>
<P>
   The drug targets fast-growing cells in the body, which cancer
cells are, but in the process, it also can damage cells in the bone
marrow and lining of the intestines.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Eric's case, he did very well on the drug,'' said
Donehower. ``He would experience a little nausea, and certain foods
would bother him. But mostly, he had profound fatigue that evening
and the day after.''
</P>
<P>
   ``After the chemo, you can see Eric is just wiped out,'' Orioles
assistant general manager Kevin Malone was quoted as saying last
year. ``He looks lifeless. Your heart goes out to the guy. But he
bounces back so fast. The spark returns to his eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   In the offseason, Davis weathered more chemotherapy treatments
and served as a spokesman for the Mid-Atlantic chapter of the
American Cancer Society, all the while working hard to keep his
6-foot-3-inch, 195-pound body in playing shape.
</P>
<P>
   Just before spring training, he received his last treatment at
the UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``When someone has been on chemotherapy for a number of months,
whether he's a world-class athlete or not, there's a cumulative
effect on the body,'' said Donehower. ``A person's energy level and
stamina are affected.''
</P>
<P>
   Such was the case with Davis, who sat out about 30 games this
season. ``My manager would tell me that whenever I felt tired to
let him know,'' said Davis. ``There were a couple of times I told
him I was tired, and I was expecting that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if that was a side effect from the chemo. I think
the tiredness was coming from not being able to work out like I
normally do in the offseason. I would miss almost three days a week
because I would take chemo on Wednesdays and I wouldn't be able to
do anything until Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under the circumstances, I feel about as well as I can expect
to feel, because I came into the season without any expectations at
all, so I feel great.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the hardest part was getting people around me to
relax. Even my own manager had predicted that he would bring me
along slowly, try to minimize the games that I played. That was my
biggest obstacle, getting the respect from him and letting him know
that, hey, I can go out there and be all right.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the season he's had, Davis is not a lock for the AL's
Comeback Player of the Year Award. Pitcher Bret Saberhagen has had
a terrific season, bouncing back from major elbow surgery to win 15
games for the Red Sox. In any given year, he would be a worthy
choice.
</P>
<P>
   But it's hard to compare his case with that of Davis, whose
accomplishments on the field are as great as his courage off it.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, his 13th year in the majors comes to an end. A free
agent, he expects to re-sign with the Orioles for 1999. But unlike
many of his teammates and fellow ballplayers, who will relax and
take another season of baseball as a given, Davis will have to take
one day at a time. His blood work last month proved normal, with
his six-month colon checkup due next. Tests will always be a part
of his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I'll ever be normal,'' said Davis, who lives in
Los Angeles with his wife, Sherri, and children, Erica and Sacha.
``Because I was diagnosed with cancer, it will always be a part of
my life, my body, my vocabulary.''
</P>
<P>
   As he did often during this past season, once hurrying from the
park late on a Friday evening to take part in a rally against
cancer, Davis will devote much of his free time to helping others
with the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Orioles fan, stricken at age 29 with cancer of the
lymph nodes, who wakes up every morning and goes to work, helped in
large part by the inspiration he gets from watching Davis play
baseball. And the young woman with breast cancer who became a fan
when Davis bought her and other patients lunch as they received
their chemotherapy treaments side by side at Johns Hopkins.
</P>
<P>
   And let's not forget the woman from Boston with colon cancer
whom Davis called earlier this year. That was me.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's obviously an inspiration to others with the disease, and
it's wonderfully exciting that he didn't allow the disease to
distract him from his goals,'' said Donehower. ``As Eric has said
himself, it's just something he had to do. He's very matter-of-fact
about it. He's doesn't look at what he's doing as anything special.
But, of course, it is.''

CAUGHT UP IN THE `GOTCHA' MILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By EILEEN McNAMARA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sun Myung Moon and his friends have done for me what Jenny Craig
and hers could not.
</P>
<P>
   If my experience is any guide, bogus allegations of plagiarism
could become the hottest weight-loss fad among the writing set. I
lost 6 pounds this week; I am wearing a dress that has not fit me
in a year.
</P>
<P>
   This slimming silver lining came cloaked in allegations of
plagiarism by a sympathizer of the Rev. Moon, the self-proclaimed
messiah who runs the multimillion-dollar Unification Church
business and religious empire.
</P>
<P>
   It was an attorney for the Moons who circulated a series of
passages from ``The Advent of Sun Myung Moon,'' a flattering
portrayal of the cult by George Chryssides, that he alleged were
stolen by Nansook Hong, a former daughter-in-law of the Rev. Moon
who has far less kind things to say in her just-published memoirs
about life in ``the True Family.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hong's book, ``In the Shadow of the Moons,'' is a memoir of
a young woman forced into marriage with the crown prince of the
Moon family when she was only 15. It is her story of the abuse she
suffered for 14 years until she escaped with her five children in
1995. Her publisher, Little, Brown &AMP; Co., hired me to help Ms. Hong
craft her narrative.
</P>
<P>
   This is what the Moonies say we ``stole'' from Mr. Chryssides:
</P>
<P>
   _A quotation from The Pledge, a prayer akin to the Lord's Prayer
in Christian denominations. (Ms. Hong memorized it when she was 7
years old.)
</P>
<P>
   _A passage from ``Divine Principle,'' a collection of the Rev.
Moon's ``revelations.'' (``Divine Principle'' is the cult's sacred
text, not unlike the Christian Bible.)
</P>
<P>
   _A description of the prayer service conducted eight days after
the birth of a baby. (Ms. Hong is the daughter of two of the Rev.
Moon's original disciples and the mother of five of his
grandchildren. What are the chances she needed to consult a
secondary source to describe church ritual?)
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, this newspaper ran a chart comparing a passage
from Ms. Hong's book with a passage from ``The Advent of Sun Myung
Moon.'' Both recount a widely circulated rumor about the early
Unification Church called The House of Three Doors. &UR;  &LR; That chart did
not include a passage from the primary source, a church document
that was referenced by both authors. It reads: ``.... there were
three different kinds of doors in the Unification Church: When you
went through the first door you had to take off your jacket; upon
entering the second door you had to take off more; and after
passing through the third door you took off all your clothes and
then committed adultery or fornication.''
</P>
<P>
   Is the wording similar in all three passages? Sure it is. This
is church lore, passed orally among members. Like any oft-repeated
story, it settles into a familiar form. In telling the story of
``Little Red Riding Hood,'' wouldn't we all note her mother's
warning not to ``leave the path?'' Wouldn't we all have her
exclaim, ``What big teeth you have'' to the disguised wolf?
</P>
<P>
   This is an ugly time in America. Accusation alone destroys
reputations. The respect we once had for evidence, the attention we
once paid to an accuser's motives, has been usurped by a national
game of ``gotcha.'' The media play it. Political candidates play
it. Special prosecutors play it. False messiahs play it, too. The
price we all pay is an erosion of human decency.
</P>
<P>
   I spent much of my summer explaining to my children _ ages 12,
10, and 7 _ why those of us who write for the public prints have a
responsibility to tell the truth. For any of us to lie, to fudge,
to trim in these pages is to debase the very real privilege
entrusted to a free press in a democracy.
</P>
<P>
   I have been at this work long enough to have grown a coat of
armor to deflect the often nasty criticism that comes with
committing one's opinions to newstype twice a week. But my voice
cracked when I told my children that this newspaper would carry a
story about someone &UR;  &LR; accusing me of plagiarism that I knew to be
baseless.
</P>
<P>
   I have my share of conspicuous faults. I am reliably told I am
too often profane in my private speech and too sanctimonious in my
public pronouncements; the Improper Bostonian calls me ``Eileen of
Arc.'' I might even be, as the Boston Herald once said, a
gender-and-class-obsessed ``shrieker.'' Whatever else you think of
the opinions that appear under that dreadful sketch of me, know
this: I am as poor an excuse for a plagiarist as I am an
advertisement for Jenny Craig.

A MOVER OF MARKETS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If a guru is a wise man with mysterious powers who can move his
followers in ways impossible to explain by either science or art,
then surely Alan Greenspan is Mr. Guru with a capital ``G.''
</P>
<P>
   His Svengali-like influence over not just the American financial
system, but the world's, was demonstrated yet again this week.
After some abstruse ruminations before two congressional
committees, many of the planet's largest wealth-holders shoved
billions around. It is uncanny.
</P>
<P>
   Chairman Al runs the Federal Reserve system in the way the pope
runs the College of Cardinals. His steady hand gets the last twist
on the spigot of money supply and interest rates. If any man can be
said to wield the throttle of the world economy, it's Big Al. Watch
his feet: If Al steps on the gas, the economy lunges ahead. If Al
tromps the brakes, things slow down so swiftly that stockbrokers
everywhere find their noses flattened on the dashboard.
</P>
<P>
   Because no man on earth has the raw power that America's
president always has (and still has), you can't nominate Greenspan
as the skipper of this giant ocean liner that is the US economy.
But if he's not the captain, he's at least the pilot-navigator. And
in rough weather, the people with dough in Wall Street and
everywhere else keep close tabs on Chairman Al.
</P>
<P>
   If your money is riding on the Titanic, slicing through
hazardous waters at high speed, you want a guy on the bridge who
sees the icebergs clearly. And the undisclosed debts of the world's
banks, the Japanese ones that are already underwater, and the US
and European ones that get killed by defaults and devaluations are
the iceberg that can slice open the US economy below the waterline.
Those bank debts are the hole in the boat. We need waterproof
bulkheads the Titanic didn't have. The closest thing we have to a
patch is the International Monetary Fund, which Congress refuses to
fund.
</P>
<P>
   Refusing money for the IMF in this world crisis is like
announcing you won't pay the Fire Department in the middle of a
five-alarmer. Sure, the IMF has problems, Al sighed before our
solons. But ``it's better to fund the IMF, than to have nothing at
all.'' Giving up, he brought the rationale down to their level.
Look, he said, ``It is far better to have a bicycle than to walk,
even though to have a limousine would be much better.'' Get it,
senators?
</P>
<P>
   Big Al moved markets mightily, twice in the last week, by doing
little more than taking his seat before two committees of Congress,
whose posturing politicians turn lapdog whenever Al's balding pate
shows up across the witness table. A week ago Wednesday, he
lectured the House Banking Committee and seemed to be witholding
any promise of a cut in interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   Since all the House seats are up for grabs Nov. 3, congressmen
look at a preelection interest rate cut like a crack addict eyeing
his smoking pipe: gimmee that! ``Greenspan talk trips up Dow;
216-point decline triggered by dashed hopes for rate cuts,'' was
the Globe headline next morning.
</P>
<P>
   But just as Chairman Al taketh away, so also he giveth _ in
spades. Appearing one week later before the Senate Budget
Committee, Al was at his winkin', blinkin', elfish best. His
routine calls for him to read, in deadpan fashion, a carefully
hedged assessment of world economic conditions, toss in a few
bromides (we should all spend less, save more, stay cool, be calm,
and diet regularly), and then answer questions with droll
allegories and the sorrowful head-shaking of an old grandfather who
has seen it all and is never surprised by the greed or stupidity
which is never far from the world of finance.
</P>
<P>
   He has a sense of humor, a lively wit, really. He told departing
Joe Kennedy ``Joe, I'll really miss you,'' and everyone broke up.
He did not take the bait when Barney Frank cracked shrewdly that
``The death of communism cost the IMF about 50 votes in the House
of Representatives.'' He remained above the fray when US
Representative Bernie Sanders, the independent from Vermont, railed
that ``your strategy has failed.'' Congressman, drolled Mr. G: if I
agreed with your diagnosis, I might agree with your solution _ but
I don't, so there.
</P>
<P>
   Big Al's style is like Jack Benny's _ it's all timing, and he
needs a straight man to furnish the setup. Fortunately for him,
Congress is loaded with straight men. When Al conjures up a riposte
he particularly likes, his eyebrows start to flutter. Imagine
Groucho Marx with a PhD in macroeconomics and no cigar; that's our
Al.
</P>
<P>
   So when the Senate panel got to the Q&AMP;A, members fell all over
themselves to get to ask the big R-question: so what about interest
rates, Mr. G, begged Senator Judd Gregg, Republican of New
Hampshire. Smiling Al, the Wizard of Oz, beamed. ``I think I know
where we have to go,'' he murmured. ``I do not think we
underestimate the severity of the problems ...''
</P>
<P>
   With a wink here, a blink there, a shrug, a sigh, having called
the world's economic distress ``more virulent'' than anticipated,
and ``likely to intensify,'' with ``erosion around the edges'' of
the US economy, and action definitely called for, Al then clammed
up. But the effect on the world's economy was like the Titanic's
lookout spying ice ahead. The Dow went up 257.
</P>
<P>
   In financial houses all over the planet, bells rang in the
engine room: ``Rate cut, rate cut! Buy, buy, buy!'' On bourses
everywhere, the word went forth. Now, if Al and his Fed governors
don't deliver what he all but promised when they meet in secret
Tuesday, you'll be reading about another meltdown Wednesday. Such
is Big Al's power. The Guru is in the house. No world figure, save
Nelson Mandela, for obvious reasons, gets this kind of respect.
</P>
<P>
   But you get the feeling Mr. G. knows how good he is. In a rare
moment of back-patting, with his irony meter clicking to the max,
Chairman Al opined: ``I have been able to string more words with
fewer ideas than anybody I know.'' Al, you're (itals) too(unitals)
modest.

HOW CAN CLINTON PUSH DOMESTIC ISSUES? HE CAN'T 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is no need to ask if President Clinton's trysts will
cripple his domestic agenda. He is already on crumbling crutches.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the Senate defeated Clinton's proposal to raise the
minimum wage by $1 an hour, to $6.15 by Jan. 1, 2000. Despite the
fact that $6.15 an hour would still not equal, in real dollars, the
value of the minimum wage 30 years ago ($7.21), the measure was
defeated, primarily by Republicans, 55-44.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times news story said that ``little groundwork had
been laid to build public or congressional support for a
minimum-wage increase this year. President Clinton mentioned it in
his State of the Union address in January, but as the Monica
Lewinsky scancal began to engulf him, he did little to follow up.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was in stark contrast to his actions in 1996, when he
twisted arms and triumphantly pushed through the
Republican-controlled Congress the first wage increase in six
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Worse was Clinton's race initiative. With braggadocio 15 months
ago, Clinton christened an advisory board to travel around the
nation and help him challenge America toward a more equal,
multi-ethnic future.
</P>
<P>
   Claiming to be ``obsessed'' with the task, Clinton said, ``If we
do nothing more than talk, it will be interesting but it won't be
enough.'' He said, ``Anybody who looks at my entire life can see
that it's been dominated by three things: economics, education, and
race. If there is any issue I ought to have credibility on, it is
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the advisory panel turned in a final report so tepid,
it was panned in news reports.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times said, ``Almost from its inception,'' the
panel ``was plagued by a lack of organization, a youthful staff
with few policy experts, and continued interference by White House
officials who feared the political consequences of its work ...
Another problem the board faced was that with public attention
diverted by the Lewinsky episode, it was hamstrung in efforts to
stimulate a nationwide dialogue on race.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas Morning News said the panel had ``a string of miscues
that drew bad reviews of the board, its staff, and even its mission
... The intiative, too, had to compete for media space and air time
with Monica Lewinsky and the ensuing scandal that has engulfed the
president.''
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Times wrote: ``By mid-December 1997, even
Clinton was distracted from his aggressive advocacy of the race
initiative. Bunkered in the White House with his legal advisers,
Clinton curtailed his public appearances to deal with allegations
of a sexual relationship with former intern Monica S. Lewinsky.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago Tribune, under the Web page headline ``Race Panel's
Report Thick But Lightweight,'' wrote: ``Clinton had hoped to carve
out his place in history as the president who bridged America's
great racial divide. But a slow start by his advisory panel and
controversy over the panel's political makeup, not to mention the
distraction of the growing sex scandal in Washington, reduced bold
ambition to the cautious rhetoric of a report titled ``One America
in the 21st Century.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bergen Record had a particularly damaging interview with
panel member Thomas Kean, a former governor of New Jersey. It was
embarrassing because even Kean, a Republican, said that Clinton's
interest in the panel, as the newspaper put it, was ``deflated.''
</P>
<P>
   The Record wrote that Kean is concerned ``that the White House
sex scandal will prevent Clinton from carrying out his promise to
continue the work of the commission.'' Kean told the Record:
</P>
<P>
   ``The president's involvement was not what it was supposed to be
... You could see it at our meetings. It started out with the
president there, and the first couple of meetings there were three
or four Cabinet members there and a lot of interest. The last six
months, we haven't had a single Cabinet member show up for a single
meeting, even hearings that involved the Cabinet member's own
department.''
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Edley, the Harvard law professor and Clinton
adviser, said Clinton needs to ``lay claim to the bully pulpit'' on
race. But this week, Clinton was a man lying down for
safer-than-safe Republican politics, proposing an increase in
military spending.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Post wrote that the White House had been
reluctant to commit to new defense dollars, because it wanted to
use the new federal budget surplus to fund ``various high priority
domestic programs. But the forceful and increasingly public case
being made by the Pentagon appears to have compelled Clinton to
signal his backing for more defense resources.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon will get billions to drop more bombs. Meanwhile,
Kean has declared that if the Clinton race initiative is ``dropped
here, then I think we've wasted our time.'' Deflated, distracted,
and disinterested from fighting Republicans on major domestic
issues, few dare suggest that Clinton will now do anything on
economics, education, and race except waste our time with rhetoric
and drop the ball when it counts. It is hard for Clinton to hold
America in his hands and get to his bully pulpit while hobbling on
his crutches.

SABERHAGEN SHOLDERS A FULL LOAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY TYE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Bret Saberhagen isn't merely the obvious pick as this
year's Comeback Player of the Year in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   He's the poster child for comeback players of any year, in any
sport.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the evidence, starting with the injury the Red Sox
pitcher came back from. Or, more precisely, the injuries. He'd torn
the sheath of ligament that helped hold the ball in his shoulder
socket. He'd also torn his rotator cuff, the collection of tendons
that maintained the necessary separation between the ball and the
socket.
</P>
<P>
   Either injury alone would have posed a huge challenge; coming
together, they spelled an almost certain end to his career, as well
as his use of the shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   To understand what the ligaments in Saberhagen's shoulder looked
like back then, imagine ripping a tablecloth in half. Then imagine
the two halves clinging to a sticky table to the point where they
have to be peeled free, further fraying the edges. Now envision
trying to stitch together the shredded halves so precisely that no
one can tell they've been torn.
</P>
<P>
   That's the challenge Saberhagen's surgeons faced two years ago.
It was partly that the initial injuries were ``incredibly
serious,'' recalls David Altchek, the New York Mets team doctor who
performed the operation. Even worse, he adds, Saberhagen ``was
playing for a team (the Colorado Rockies) who didn't want him to
have open surgery. He waited a considerable period and it made his
injury considerably worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Altchek peeled the ligaments away from surrounding muscles, cut
away the scar tissue, and sewed the ligaments back together. He
also installed in the bone a harpoon-like anchor with sutures
attached to it to repair the torn rotator cuff. And he did it all
without damaging any nearby muscles or tendons, and with the
shredded pieces fitting together precisely enough that Saberhagen
at least had a chance to resume the rotational motion necessary for
pitching.
</P>
<P>
   The benchmark for difficult shoulder operations used to be San
Francisco Giants righthander Orel Hershiser, the first pitcher to
come back from major reconstructive surgery. But doctors familiar
with Hershiser's injuries and Saberhagen's say the Sox pitcher's
woes were substantially worse.
</P>
<P>
   What goes on on the operating table, however, merely laid the
foundation for Saberhagen's comeback. As anyone who has undergone
an orthopedic procedure knows, it's the rehabilitation that matters
even more, and that tests a patient's will.
</P>
<P>
   To an extent, I have an idea what Saberhagen has gone through.
Because of the wear and tear of running six marathons and dozens of
short races, I've undergone three arthroscopic procedures plus a
full cartilage transplant operation on my knee. It has meant an
arduous recovery just to regain adequate mobility. And I do not
make my living as an athlete.
</P>
<P>
   In Saberhagen's case, that rehab lasted 18 months and assumed
Sysyphian proportions. He started every day with hot packs and
massages to get his blood flowing. Then there was an hour of
shoulder exercises, followed by running, lifting leg weights, and
doing other workouts to keep the rest of his body toned. Afternoons
brought more shoulder and other exercises designed to restore the
flexibility he'd lost, along with the strength. He generally was
the first player at the ballpark in the morning and one of the last
to leave at night.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few other players have come back and made a considerable
effort and done well. But none who have been away from the game as
long as he'd been away,'' says longtime Sox physician Arthur
Pappas. ``He barely pitched last year; the year before, he
basically didn't pitch; and the year before that was a spotty year.
He had between two and three years of not pitching or not pitching
effectively, which is a a tremendous amount of time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know of anyone who's been away that long and come back
and done as well as he has.''
</P>
<P>
   Altchek was equally impressed: ``Most people would be too
discouraged to go through this. He just did it because he loves the
game. That's the greatest statement about him.''
</P>
<P>
   Saberhagen's injuries were imposing. His surgery was inspired.
And his rehab was awesome. But there's one last critical element to
comebacks as defined by the Major League Baseball Players
Association, whose members last season began picking a Comeback
Player of the Year for each league: The winner not only must
rebound from injury or adversity, he also has to ``achieve
excellence on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   That should cinch the award for the 34-year-old Saberhagen. He
has won 15 games and lost just seven this season, the second-best
winning percentage (.682) among Sox starters. He struck out three
batters for every one he walked, allowed fewer home runs and hits
than ace Pedro Martinez, is second in the American League with 1.5
walks per nine innings pitched, and was effective enough that the
Sox recently extended his contract for three years, with an option
for a fourth.

<P>
   He's still a long way from the form he showed in 1985, when he
was the youngest player to win the World Series MVP Award, or four
years later, when he went 23-6, compiled a 2.16 ERA, and won his
second Cy Young Award. But nearly every trip to the mound this
season has inspired his team and delighted his doctors _ more so
when, between innings, he would remove his shirt so the trainer
could apply a salve and give him a quick rubdown.
</P>
<P>
   And while lots of Sox fans have held their breath every time
Saberhagen took the mound, wondering whether that was the night his
arm would fall apart, he improved over time, requiring less time to
loosen up and get his velocity up over 90 miles per hour. The
dreaded fade never happened, and he remains a criticial part of the
starting trio upon whom the Sox are pinning their postseason hopes.

PRESSING FLASHING MAY FIX A LEAK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, September 27, 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I have a leak in the roof by the chimney. I think the
flashing is leaking. I checked the attic and I can see a line of
daylight, near the chimney. How can I close that gap?
</P>
<P>
   ANONYMOUS CALLER
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Sometimes you can see daylight through flashing because it
sits on top of the roof shingles, unsecured, and may bend up a
little. Naturally, it is better if the flashing were touching the
shingles, glued with roofing cement. And that is what you could do:
Buy roofing cement _ it comes in cans and in caulking cartridges _
and slather some between flashing and roof, and hold the flashing
down or put weights on it so it will stay down. Or nail the
flashing with roofing nails, and dab a bit of cement over each nail
head. Roofers might be shocked at face-nailing flashing (with the
nail heads showing), but it is often done, with a dab of cement on
the nail heads, and nearly as often works.
</P>
<P>
   It may work for you. It worked for one flashing dabber, who
thanked the handyman for his sage advice.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I like the idea of mulching my leaves. How long will it take
for leaves to break down into compost?
</P>
<P>
   SUSAN REED, Wellesley, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. If you shred the leaves (and other organic matter such as
grass), the breakdown will take six months to a year. Unshredded,
two years and longer, because unshredded leaves tend to lie flat
and compact on each other. Being flat, they might also smother
anything under them that might try to poke through in spring.
</P>
<P>
   If you shredded your leaves and put them two or three inches
thick on garden beds this fall, they will be virtually invisible by
spring, but still provide considerable nourishment, allowing all
those perennials to come up swinging.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am stripping my front door, which is exposed to the
weather. I used Citristrip, and sanded to the bare wood, but it is
discolored. I would like to stain it, but is there a way to reduce
those discolorations?
</P>
<P>
   MARK PELOSKI, Arlington, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Treat the bare wood, the entire door, with liquid chlorine
bleach, straight from the jug. After it dries, do it again. Rinse
thoroughly and let dry. This will reduce the discolorations as much
as anything will. Wear skin and eye protection when working with
bleach.
</P>
<P>
   Then apply a stain and two to three coats of an exterior,
oil-based, high-gloss polyurethane varnish. Or use spar varnish or
marine varnish. Because the door is exposed to the weather, don't
expect long service from the varnish; three to five years is a
guesstimate.
</P>
<P>
   Or instead of the stain and varnish, apply an oil-based
semitransparent house stain. Choose your color and apply one coat;
two if the first coat is sucked well into the wood. This will last
up to five years.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------ &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   R.W. of Needham, Mass. called to tell us where he found some
concrete stain. ``I originally used Benjamin Moore concrete stain,
and it worked pretty well, but it has been discontinued.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I found a new concrete stain made by a company called H&AMP;C,
at Babel's in Needham. It comes in lots of colors, too. It is a
silicone acrylic with Shield Plus.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, thanks, R.W., for the information, which we will dutifully
file for further reference. And incidentally, Muralo makes a
concrete stain that comes in several, not lots of, colors. We
discovered it on a visit to Factory Paint Store in Weymouth, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Why all the fuss over a concrete stain? Because, unlike paint,
it will not peel, which is one of the big bugaboos about painting
concrete, especially flat, walked-on surfaces. The stain will not
peel, at least is not supposed to. The handyman has received no
complaints of any concrete stain peeling.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------ &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have some quarry tile on my kitchen and entry floor, and
it's the worst thing I have had in my life. The tile is stained,
and the grout is many different colors. I sanded the grout to
reveal fresh material, then sealed it. Can I paint it? There is
something on the tiles themselves, but I don't know what. Is there
a way to make the tile a little more resistant to stains?
</P>
<P>
   EILEEN RUDY, Holliston, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I would not suggest painting grout, but there are two things
you can try tht might be just as good or better. A tile colorer and
sealer called Grout Colorant, sold in tile stores. The other is to
use a semitransparent stain, like the stain used on house
exteriors. This stain is not designed for concrete, masonry or
grout, but is worth trying. Colors are limited.
</P>
<P>
   As for the tiles themselves, no one knows what's on there now,
so it would be risky to apply anything else, which could make it
worse.
</P>
<P>
   If you can get everything off the tiles by rubbing with steel
wool and paint thinner, then you can try Future, an acrylic finish
designed for linoleum, but it can work also on quarry tiles. No
guarantees.
</P>

NET MARKETER IXL BUYS INTO BOSTON 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: iXL is cq)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Continuing on a buying spree in a rapidly consolidating
industry, a leading Internet marketing company has established a
presence in Boston by acquiring Larry Miller Productions of
Charlestown and Spinners Inc. of Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   The two small firms said Thursday they were bought by iXL
Holdings Inc., an Atlanta firm that has merged the two companies
into an operation that will now be known as iXL's Boston office.
</P>
<P>
   Terms of the acquisitions were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   To a lay person, iXL might qualify as an on-line ad agency,
``but they'll get all sour at you if you call them that,'' says
Marc Johnson, an on-line advertising analyst at Jupiter
Communications, a New York market research firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``A provider of Internet marketing solutions'' is sometimes how
such companies like to be described, Johnson says.
</P>
<P>
   In Larry Miller and Spinners, iXL gets two companies that
together can build both the creative ``front end'' of a Web site as
well as a Web site's technical ``back end.''
</P>
<P>
   On the front end, Larry Miller has provided such high-tech
clients as Hewlett-Packard Co. with the creative expertise they
need to graphically design Web sites for electronic commerce and
other on-line marketing projects.
</P>
<P>
   On the back end, Spinners has been devoted to building intranets
_ internal networks based on Internet protocols _ and highly
sophisticated, interactive Web sites for such financial services
companies as Merrill Lynch and Brown &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spinners has the technology, and Larry Miller has the
creative,'' says Larry Miller president Jeff Janer.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're trying to do is blend the right combination of
creative and technical skills so we can provide strategic Internet
services for major corporations in such industries as health care,
financial services, media and entertainment, travel,
telecommunications, and retail,'' says iXL founder Bert Ellis.
</P>
<P>
   Growing mostly by acquisitions, iXL has bought similar companies
in such cities as New York, Denver, San Francisco, and Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   IXL is hardly alone on its acquisition spree.
</P>
<P>
   ```Bigger is better' is the recurring theme in this industry,''
says analyst Johnson, who adds, ``If you're a 25-person firm and
you tell Fidelity Investments, `We want to design your Web site,'
they'll just laugh at you.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a recent survey by Adweek magazine, privately held
iXL had estimated annual revenues of $60 million, tying it with a
New York company known as Agency.com for first place among the
nation's top 50 agencies in the field.
</P>
<P>
   As the frontiers of this business expand rapidly, small firms
such as Spinners are in danger of being rolled over by rivals that
are part of huge communications conglomerates such as Omnicom Inc.
or the Interpublic Group of Cos.
</P>
<P>
   ``The needs of clients are growing so rapidly that they can
quickly outgrow us,'' says president Niraj Shah of Spinners, a
company with 1997 revenues of about $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   By agreeing to be absorbed by iXL's national network, Spinners
now has access to the resources to work on $5 million assignments
from big clients, ``instead of getting $200,000 projects from
midsize companies,'' Shah says.
</P>
<P>
   With 1997 revenues of about $5 million, Larry Miller faced
similar challenges, says Janer, adding, ``We're too big to be small
and too small to be big.''
</P>
<P>
   If the acquisition gives Spinners and Larry Miller much needed
size and access to more resources, it gives iXL a list of local
clients as it seeks to gain a Boston presence.
</P>
<P>
   iXL was founded two years by Ellis after he sold off a regional
media empire he had put together by buying up a string of local TV
stations.
</P>
<P>
   Now Ellis seems to be applying a similar strategy to buying up
small Internet marketing companies, Johnson says. Until the stock
market's &UR;  &LR; recent mood swings, there had been talk of iXL exploring
an initial public offering of its stock.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, Shah and Janer's two companies will consolidate
office space at Spinners' headquarters in Cambridge. Shah holds the
title of president of iXL's Boston office, and Janer is executive
vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Together, Spinners and Larry Miller employ 70 staffers; no
layoffs will result from the merger, Shah and Janer say.
</P>
<P>
   To succeed at Internet marketing, three things are needed:
technical know-how, expertise in Web-site graphics, and an
understanding of how to develop an on-line maketing strategy, Janer
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``What iXL is trying to do is put together a three-legged stool
of technology, creative design, and strategy in a way that we can
offer one-stop shopping to large clients,'' he says.

`RONIN' PLAYS LIKE DEATH WARMED OVER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
RONIN 
Directed by: John Frankenheimer 
Screenplay by: J.D. Zeik &AMP; Richard Weisz 
Starring: Robert De Niro, Jean Reno, Natascha McElhone, Stellan
Skarsgard, Sean Bean, Skipp Sudduth, Michael Lonsdale, Jan Triska 
Running time: 121 minutes 
Rated: R (strong violence and some language) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was Alfred Hitchcock who coined the term ``McGuffin'' for the
object that set a chase movie in motion. It didn't matter what the
object was. ``Ronin'' is a classic McGuffin movie. Its gang of
good-guy mercenaries chases all over France to snatch a briefcase
that contains the key to the Irish peace process. What's in the
briefcase nobody is told _ not us, not the ad hoc bunch of heavy
hitters consisting of Robert De Niro, Jean Reno, Stellan Skarsgard,
Sean Bean and Skip Sudduth. That, however, doesn't stop them from
being willing to die to get it. They are the ronin of the title _
Japanese for samurai disgraced because they allowed their master to
die while they live.
</P>
<P>
   We're not told what these ronin did to be demoted from samurai
status. We're asked to accept that they're willing to face death _
and dish it out _ from a sense of professionalism. The post-Cold
War landscape being what it is, there's no morality or ideology
attached to their eforts, only money. You sign the contract, you do
the job, no matter what. It doesn't make for the most compelling
plot motor and all the skill in the direction of the chase scenes,
shoot-outs and set pieces can't conceal a fundamental hollowness
here. Action, after all, can't impart meaning to action, and the
veneer of rueful world-weariness _ and world-wariness _ stretched
across the faces of the actors can't supply the urgency we're
hoping for, either.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, this means that we ironically fall back on studying
the professionalism that has gone into this movie about
professionalism. There's even a certain comfort in John
Frankenheimer's slightly retro take on the hugger-mugger, and in
Robert De Niro's containment as the taciturn star of the team. Even
when he isn't fully immersed in a film (the potential for immersion
is decidedly limited here), De Niro can be depended upon to make
interesting choices. Here he makes carefulness the salient
characteristic of his veteran of the killing fields, a logical
choice when you think of it, that pays dividends.
</P>
<P>
   There's no real bang-up climax. There wouldn't be, given the
burn-out factor in the genre and in these particular characters,
ashen and disillusioned, staring old age in the face. The film
might have meant more if they hadn't been so opaque, if there had
been a bit more back story to go with them. As it is, they're
ciphers, generic technicians of death who are allotted only the
most perfunctory human faceting (Reno is the warm, comradely one,
Skarsgard is the cold, isolated one, etc.). ``Ronin'' goes through
the motions proficiently, but is unable to avoid seeming warmed
over and, for all its skill in execution, awfully ordinary.

KIDS TV MOVES UP A GRADE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   From the jungles of the Amazon to the battlefields of the Civil
War, from Greek mythology to the secret world of a toy shop,
there's no shortage of adventure in the fall children's television
lineup.
</P>
<P>
   No surprise there. What is striking, though, is that there is
also no shortage of quality in the new shows for kids _ which is
not to say there's a surplus, either. As always, it's an eclectic
menu, featuring both nourishing fare and junk food.
</P>
<P>
   But there are encouraging signs aplenty as a new season dawns:
more prominent roles for girl characters, a flood of programs based
on children's books (as the search for the next ``Arthur''
continues), subject matter that ranges from intergenerational
relationships to the teaching of history.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, many of the new and returning programs for children
have nothing more on their minds than whizbang cartoon antics. A
surprising number, though, demonstrate originality and ingenuity in
the way their characters resolve dilemmas, learn life lessons, or
just have fun.
</P>
<P>
   Nickelodeon, the top-rated cable channel among children, is
likely to make further inroads with an irresistible new show, ``The
Wild Thornberrys,'' along with the less impressive but potentially
audience-pleasing ``Animorphs'' and ``Cousin Skeeter.'' PBS adds to
its already strong children's lineup with a quiet charmer called
``Noddy,'' while there is nothing quiet about ``Warner Bros.
Histeria!,'' the WB network's rock 'em, sock 'em cartoon version of
history.
</P>
<P>
   The Disney Channel weighs in next week with two new shows aimed
at preschoolers: ``Rolie Polie Olie,'' an inventive romp through
the life of a boy robot in an all-robot world, and ``Out of the
Box,'' which uses songs and crafts to teach young children about
growing up. CBS, which caused a stir when it dumped its entire
Saturday morning children's lineup in January because of low
ratings, is rolling out six new animated shows as replacements,
including the endearing ``Franklin,'' based on the books by
Paulette Bourgeois. ABC's only new offering for kids is
``Hercules,'' a spinoff from the 1997 movie, but the ABC children's
show to watch is the witty and winning ``Squigglevision,'' formerly
known as ``Science Court.'' NBC is adding ``One World'' to its
Saturday lineup aimed at teenagers.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the new shows on other networks, however, go in the
other direction and target the 3-to-7 age group. Among the best is
the eye-catching, sweet-natured ``Noddy,'' created by Rick
Siggelkow, vice president of BBC Worldwide and one of the forces
behind ``Shining Time Station.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Noddy,'' the set is the star. Adapted from an animated BBC
series and based on the children's books by British author Enid
Blyton, ``Noddy'' takes place in an old-fashioned curiosity shop
that is lavishly and lovingly detailed. It is a place you want to
linger in, conveying the sense of an inanimate world that needs
only a child's imagination to bring it to life.
</P>
<P>
   The shop is owned by a retired sea captain named Noah whose
grandchildren, Kate and Truman, along with their friend, DJ, play
in the shop each day while their parents are at work. Their
creativity kindled by the shop's antique toys and dolls, the
children tell each other stories, which are then enacted in
animated tales featuring Noddy, a wooden toy who drives a
red-and-yellow taxicab.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a wonderful process of kids creating their own reality,''
Siggelkow said in an interview. ``Creative play, using your
imagination: These are tools that people need throughout their
lives.''
</P>
<P>
   The stories the children devise often contain lessons about such
issues as acting responsibly. Another goal of ``Noddy,'' Siggelkow
said, is to explore the ``rich area of intergenerational
relationships'' by focusing on the rapport between Noah and the
children. The leader among the children is Kate, which is no
accident, Siggelkow says. ``I felt it was important to have a girl
in the leadership position,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Noddy'' was slated to be just weekend filler until PBS
stations got a look at how good it is; now, it is scheduled to run
Monday through Friday on more than half the nation's PBS stations.
It premieres MondayM Sept. 28, and will air at 9:30 a.m. each day
and be repeated at at 3 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   At the opposite end of the spectrum from ``Noddy,'' but equally
engaging in its own frenetic way, is the WB's ``Histeria!''. The
show's theme song promises to ``make fun of history,'' and it does,
but ``Histeria!'' also manages to pack a surprising amount of
historic dates and details into its hijinks.
</P>
<P>
   We see Abraham Lincoln delivering the Gettysburg Address,
intoning ``Four score and seven years ago...'', only to be
interrupted by a noisy brat who screeches: ``What is it, some kind
of new math? ... Why not just say 87 years ago?'' But the essence
of Lincoln's address is eventually communicated, along with other
information about the Civil War. In another episode, 10th-century
Vikings burst into jovial-but-instructive song: ``We were always on
surprise attacks, which people found alarming. But when we weren't
sacking things we were really good at farming.''
</P>
<P>
   The pace of ``Histeria!'' is relentless, but as Tom Ruegger,
executive producer of Warner Bros. Television Animation, said in an
interview: ``We're covering 35,000 years of human history in 65
half-hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruegger said the show was inspired by episodes of
``Animaniacs,'' another WB cartoon show, in which such historical
eminences as Einstein and Michelangelo made appearances. Leonardo
Da Vinci will ``host'' an upcoming ``Histeria!'' on the
Renaissance; cartoon versions of Napoleon, Joan of Arc and Genghis
Khan will also be featured.
</P>
<P>
   The WB network is also launching two other new programs this
fall: ``Steven Spielberg presents Pinky, Elmyra and the Brain'' and
``Brats of the Lost Nebula.
</P>
<P>
   Margaret Loesch, head of Jim Henson Productions, which created
``Brats of the Lost Nebula,'' says the show's three-dimensional
puppets are a ``technical breakthrough.'' In dramatizing the
exploits of five teenagers who wander the universe after they are
separated from their parents, ``Brats'' imparts an upbeat message
of ``resourcefulness and teamwork,'' according to Loesch,
</P>
<P>
   My personal favorite among the new children's shows is
Nickelodeon's ``The Wild Thornberrys'' (Tuesdays and Thursdays at 8
p.m.)
</P>
<P>
   Produced by the creators of ``Rugrats,'' ``The Wild
Thornberrys'' is loaded with visual and verbal wit. This animated
show features a 12-year-old girl named Eliza (voiced by Lacey
Chabert of ``Party of Five'') who is a red-haired, freckle-faced,
braces-wearing ball of fire.
</P>
<P>
   Eliza is endowed with the gift of communicating with wild
animals, and she's always eager to explore the natural world by
striking up conversations with, say, lions. There's wildlife
aplenty since Eliza's parents (including a delightfully dim dad
voiced by Tim Curry) are on perpetual safari in order to make
nature documentaries.
</P>
<P>
   Her beleaguered sidekick is a thoroughly domesticated chimpanzee
named Darwin (reminiscent of the finicky talking chimp voiced by
John Cleese in ``George of the Jungle'') who wishes his human chum
was less intrepid, less eager to mingle with ... animals.
</P>
<P>
   ```Oooh, Darwin, there's a cliff; let's go climb it,' '' he
mimics her. `` `There's a lion; let's go see if it's hungry.' Can't
we just sit around for once?''
</P>
<P>
   Nickelodeon's other two new prime-time offerings for kids are
``Animorphs'' and ``Cousin Skeeter.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Cousin Skeeter'' (Tuesdays and Thursdays at 8:30 p.m.)
features a fast-talking, hip-hop puppet (voiced by Bill Bellamy)
who moves in with his shy cousin and begins wreaking havoc. With
its African-American cast, ``Cousin Skeeter'' has the chance to
break some ground, but only if it moves away from predictable
moves. Right now, the only original element is the sight of the
puppet interacting with humans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Animorphs'' (Fridays at 8:30 p.m., Saturdays at 9:30 p.m.) is
based on the popular books by K.A. Appelgate. It revolves around
five teenagers whose mission is to save the world from an invasion
by alien ``Controllers.'' Luckily, they have the power to transform
themselves into any animal they want by touching them and
``acquiring their DNA.''
</P>
<P>
   With its paranoid outlook and lines like ``Trust no one,''
``Animorphs'' may become an ``X-Files'' for kids, and there's no
denying the arresting power of the special effects when the teens
morph into animals. But the plotting and characterizations are
strictly paint-by-numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Ditto for NBC's ``One World'' (Saturdays at 1 p.m.). This series
about a multiethnic group of orphans adopted by a pro baseball
player and his sculptor wife seldom rises above standard sitcom
level.
</P>
<P>
   The only new CBS series available for review was ``Franklin,''
and it's a winner. You can spot the moral a mile away in these
gentle animated parables involving a young tortoise and his
friends, but who cares? The pace and themes _ loyalty,
individuality, growing up too fast, learning to play with kids
whose interests are different from yours _ are just right for very
young children. ``Franklin'' will air at 7 a.m. Sundays once it
premieres on Oct. 3, along with ``Anatole,'' ``Flying Rhino Junior
High,'' and ``Birdz.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a mixed bag at Fox this fall. The network's live-action
``Young Hercules'' (Monday through Thursday at 4:30 p.m.) displays
a wry sense of humor and well-choreographed action scenes that make
it highly watchable. But Fox's ``Mystic Knights of the Tir Na Nog''
(Monday to Thursday at 4 p.m.), an adventure series set in Ireland
and involving quests and journeys and a lot of medieval
blah-blah-blah, features five of the most charmless heroes since
``Power Rangers.''

LEARY SHINES ON `MONUMENT' MEAN STREETS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
MONUMENT AVE. 
Directed by: Ted Demme 
Screenplay by: Mike Armstrong 
Starring: Denis Leary, Ian Hart, Lenny Clarke, Jason Barry, Colm
Meaney, John Diehl, Billy Crudup, Greg Dulli, Noah Emmerich, Martin
Sheen, Famke Janssen, Jeanne Tripplehorn 
Running time: 90 minutes 
Unrated 
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Monument Ave.'' is the Irish ``Mean Streets.'' Set in
Charlestown among a bunch of boyos buying into an old system of
street-enforced rot posing as manliness, it's dark, edgy,
provisional-looking and immediate. The look and texture of the film
_ claustrophobic and ripe with corruption _ bespeak a world where
predatory viciousness leaves no room for loyalties, even of the
family kind, as evil is linked to false notions of honor and
manhood.
</P>
<P>
   This translates to Denis Leary's professional car thief, Bobby
O'Grady, simmering helplessly as Colm Meaney's boss thug, Jackie
O'Hara, has Leary's cousin shot to death in a neighborhood bar he
knows will yield no witnesses. Martin Sheen's sputtering cop from
West Roxbury, helpless on a patch of turf where talking to cops is
taboo, can't dent the stonewalling, as Jackie swaggers around in
his camel's-hair coat, buying the drinks, paying the rent for
impoverished grannies in the projects and letting everyone know
about it, while terrorizing everyone into submission with his
hair-trigger temper and galloping paranoia.
</P>
<P>
   Meaney's sadistic bully is juicily and scarily performed,
reinvigorating a type extinct since Cagney. But it's Leary who
gives the film its moral center in the most complex role of his
deservedly snowballing career. The conflict between Bobby's pain
and shame eat at him and push him. They're written on a face that
knows better than to reveal softer impulses that would be perceived
as weakness, with lethal consequences. When in the space of a
single year you can triangulate performances like the ones Leary
has delivered in ``Suicide Kings,'' ``Love Walked In,'' and now
``Monument Ave.,'' you are looking at the emergence of a figure who
has to be taken seriously as an actor.
</P>
<P>
   The film's brutal, episodic flavor also accommodates Bobby's
struggle to confront a code he had been proud to be thought part of
all his life. At one point, his rage is expressed in an incident of
vicious racism. But he's just as convincing in a woozily
atmospheric scene where he and his buddies have come to rest in his
living room after a night of drinking, egging each other on with
what even in their drunkenness they realize are hopelessly
unattainable sex fantasies involving movie stars. When sober, they
work off some aggressions playing playground hockey, the ones left
over from their pedal-to-the-metal nights.
</P>
<P>
   Director Ted Demme meshes Bobby's restless character into the
film's jagged rhythms and heads-up ensemble performance. Ian Hart
and Billy Crudup shine as his lifelong cronies. So do Jason Barry
as his Irish cousin whose sanity and decency are offended; Famke
Janssen as a full-blooded neighborhood woman smart enough to worry
about the future; and especially Marilyn Murphy Meardon as Bobby's
agonized mother banking on her moral authority when the killing
becomes too much. There's no melodrama, no sentimentalizing, just a
long, hard look at a life-sdestroying situation, inscribed in
gritty, jolting verite style. ``Monument Ave.'' is a long night's
journey into what its protagonist can only hope is day.

MERCEDES-BENZ SHOWS ITS NEW V-8S IN VERMONT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)  
 (For release Sunday, September 27, 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN R.WHITE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BASIN HARBOR, Vt. _ If you want a driving challenge, you don't
need to go the the expense of a trip to Monaco, Baja California, or
Pikes Peak _ Vermont will do quite nicely. The Green Mounmtain
State is chock-full of scenic routes, nasty mountain switchbacks
and an automotive mountain climb that's steeper than the famed
Pikes Peak run.
</P>
<P>
   Vermont, where the natives are a practical bunch, is a state
where an ``improved'' road means the dirt has been scraped by a
grader recently, and the paved roads are no wider than they
absolutely have to be. It is a place to test the mettle of a new
model, demonstrate the virtue of a car _ or show very quickly the
lack of it.
</P>
<P>
   It was here that Merceedes-Benz decided to introduce its newest
machines, the 1999 ML430 and CLK430, the first a sport/utility that
elegantly blends performance, luxury, and safety, the second a
sports car disguised as an elegantly civilized luxury coupe. The
routes included some few short stretches of interstate, quite a lot
of narrow mountain pavement, plenty of ``improved'' dirt, and, in
the case of the ML430, a couple of miles of muddy, rocky track
through the woods pretending to be a trail.
</P>
<P>
   The ML430 is the Benz answer to the luxury sport utility that
first appeared as the ML320 _ meaning it has a 3.2-liter V-6 under
the hood. The ML430 gets its numerical handle from the fact of a
4.3-liter, 268-horsepower, multivalve V-8 under the hood. For the
$43,750 list price, you get lots of room, seating for a small mob,
comfort, elegance, and a safety package that includes traction
control, the Electronic Stability Program that senses imminent skid
and corrects, Brake Assist that senses panic stops and increases
braking force, four-wheel antilock brakes, front and side air bags,
and a ``thinking'' five-speed automatic transmission that adapts to
the driver's mode of operation. And _ a challenge to the rest of
the SUV world _ a bumper the same height as that of a passenger
car; the Benz SUV is less of a threat to the wee ones on the road.
There is also the Baby Smart technology that turns off the air bags
to protect children in the Benz baby seat, and, if you like
sunroofs, the ML430 is to have the mother of them all available, a
4-foot-by-3-foot skyview.
</P>
<P>
   The proof, as they say, is in the pudding, so early Tuesday
under lowering skies, a herd of motor journalists set forth in 20
of the new SUVs, headed across Vermont Route 17, thence onto a
variety of roads. There are signs that tell you the roads will be a
... challenge? ``Winter travel not advised,'' it may say, or
``tractor trailers and busses (sic) not permitted.''
</P>
<P>
   The first tricky bit was a dirt trail in the process of being
graded with a mound of soft dirt running about where the left wheel
should be tracking. The ML traction control doesn't lock axles to
get you out of the muck; it senses slip and adds brake to improve
traction _ one wheel on the ground is enough to keep you moving.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible to get into trouble with an ML, but you have to
be prize-winning stupid to do it, and somebody on the route did,
but not trouble enough to need help _ merely an errant drift
slightly over the edge onto a shoulder that wasn't there.
</P>
<P>
   We tracked up mountains and down, on dirt, semi-dirt,
semi-pavement, and at last found ourselves dashing up Route 108 out
of Stowe across Smugglers' Notch, a paved, tortuous trail that at
one point barely becomes one lane as it bends around the rocks.
More dirt, more turns, then lunch and real craziness.
</P>
<P>
   We dined, as it were, at Zack's On the Rocks. Zack greets us in
a frilled purple garment somewhere between house dress and toga.
The decor can only be described as bizarre, the sugar is purple as
is the salad dressing, but the food is quite good _ if you enjoy
eating in what looks like the flower-festooned set of a horror
flick starring Bette Davis and Freddie _ in a cave.
</P>
<P>
   Then it was into the CLK430 with its 275-horsepower V-8, a
$47,900 luxury package that will leap from 0 to 60 miles per hour
in 6.1 seconds and offers the ESP as standard equipment _ it's an
option on the CLK320 sister coupe.
</P>
<P>
   Back down 108 through Smugglers' Notch from the north, now, then
a sprint on Interstate 89, and back onto the secondary tracks, and
the misadventure begins. The ML is no slouch in the corners, but
the CLK bends around the turns like an articulated rat _ CLK is
pronounced smooth, soaks up the bumps and ruts. My driving partner,
John Bugsy Lawlor of NPR and WBZ, is navigating this leg. We are to
``bear right at the round church and turn right onto Hinesburg
Road'' but Bugsy merely advises ``you go right'' and flashes past
Hinesburg for an eventual 14-mile detour. Another team follows us.
Later, I hear: ``I think we were supposed to go straight back there
on Moncton ....'' Oh, what the heck; we got 20 miles' more driving
than anybody else _ except for those other guys behind us.
</P>
<P>
   The ML430 is an SUV that looks more like a van than a truck,
behaves like a good sedan, handles and accelerates like a sporty
coupe, yet it is a rigid box on a frame just like the truck-based
SUVs. The CLK430 has the manners of a road racer, the ride of a
luxury sedan, and induces joy in a driver like a basket of kittens
evokes fun in a kindergarten. The V-8 engines in both cars offer
peak torque over a wide, flat band, 3,000 to 4,500 r.p.m.; the
result is surprising responsiveness in virtually any gear. The ML
is good at passing, the CLK is a lightning bolt.
</P>
<P>
   These are pricey cars for the well-to-do, but Benz cars wear
well. Sooner or later, they will be affordable used cars with all
that good stuff still working ... and then maybe I can afford one
to enjoy my approaching geezerhood.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, thumbs up.

WATER'S DISARMING `PECKER' EMBRACES SWEETNESS, CAMPY EXCESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
PECKER 
Written and directed by: John Waters 
Starring: Edward Furlong, Christina Ricci, Mary Kay Place, Brendan
Sexton III, Lili Taylor, Jean Schertler, Martha Plimpton 
Running time: 87 minutes 
Rated: R (sexuality, graphic nudity, language , and brief drug
use) 
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In ``Pecker,'' the latest John Waters comedy, the amiability
that has always been a part of his work moves to the forefront and
becomes the main event, reminding us that the once-trademark
impulse to outrage has receded in the older, mellower Waters.
Nominally, ``Pecker'' is the story of a Baltimore boy from a
blue-collar neighborhood who becomes an overnight celebrity
photographer. Jaded New York gallery sycophants gravitate to his
photos of friends and neighbors because they crave a fix of the
authenticity that no longer comes naturally to them. The joke, of
course, is that once the boy wonder (Edward Furlong, in a
disarmingly spacy performance) goes to New York, his celebrity
status threatens to cut him off from the world from which he draws
his naive vitality.
</P>
<P>
   Let's get that red-herring nickname out of the way. He's called
Pecker because ever since he was a boy he pecked at his food.
Blown-up photos of genitalia and rats having sex are about as
taboo-pushing as ``Pecker'' gets. The film doesn't even mean to set
up any stinging collision between blue-collar Baltimore and arty
Manhattan. Rather, it suggests a party to which Waters has invited
both camps, perhaps motivated by the fact that he has taken up
photography in recent years and now lives part time in New York.
Perhaps ``Pecker'' represents Waters trying to integrate the two
halves of the bifurcated life he now leads. But the film's
celebration of eccentric openness and campy excess leaves no doubt
that Waters's heart remains in his native Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   The impression left by ``Pecker'' has little to do with its
perfunctory gestures at story or huffings at irony. It adds little
to our disregard for celebrity culture, and its surprises are few,
especially to Waters aficionados. It's not satire, it's a series of
postcards from a thrift shop, the Bargai Hut, run by Pecker's mom
(Mary Kay Place, at her most grimacingly hospitable, especially
when she's pushing her full line of plastic garments), and from
such comfortably run-down dives as the Claw Machine and the Pelt
Room, to say nothing of the laundromat run by Christina Ricci's
softhearted drill sergeant in love with Pecker. Waters obviously
had such fun conceiving and dressing these settings that it seems
curmudgeonly to demand that anything much be going on in them.
Besides, the film is an embrace of littleness. It's certainly no
chore to sit through. But who ever thought to find oneself reaching
for words like ``sweet'' and ``mild'' to describe a John Waters
film?

MERCHANT-IVORY KEEP UP WITH THE JONESES

A SOLDIER'S DAUGHTER NEVER CRIES 
Directed by: James Ivory 
Screenplay by: Ruth Prawer Jhabvala (novel: Kaylie Jones) 
Starring: Kris Kristofferson, Barbara Hershey, Leelee Sobieski,
Jane Birkin, Dominique Blanc, Jessae Bradford, Anthony Roth
Costanzo, Harley Cross, Isaac de Bankole, Virginie Ledoyen 
Running time: 127 minutes 
Rated: R (language) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries'' gives Kris Kristofferson
the role of his career as a world-class novelist and world-class
father. It's also a rich, moving and altogether satisfying return
to form for the Merchant-Ivory team _ and a new direction, too. In
filming Kaylie Jones' autobiographical novel about growing up as
the daughter of expatriate novelist James Jones in the 1960s and
'70s, Merchant-Ivory forego their usual sheen and control and take
their stylistic cue from the unruliness that goes with the process
of keeping up with the Joneses.
</P>
<P>
   It's a tempestuous household, but a loving one, first as
transplanted Americans in Paris, then after moving abruptly back to
the US as Jones (called Billy Willis in the film) comes to grips
with heart trouble. The heart trouble, in refreshing contrast to
the family dysfunction that has become a screen fixture, is
mechanical, not emotional. Plenty of eventfulness swirls around the
family, but the core of the film is the loving father-daughter
relationship between Kristofferson's Willis and his daughter,
Channe, played by Luisa Conlon as a child and Leelee Sobieski as an
adolescent.
</P>
<P>
   Although he spent many of his waking hours immersed in reliving
his experiences as a GI fighting in the Pacific in World War II
(Terence Malick's film of Jones' novel, ``The Thin Red Line,'' is
due at Christmas), his sympathy for what his kids are going
through, and his wisdom in helping them get past it, cap
Kristofferon's re-emergence as an actor able to project vast depths
of experience, emotional solidity, generosity, crinkly-eyed humor
and a genius for never leaning too hard on his kids, who touchingly
grow closer together during the family's time of trial.
</P>
<P>
   Without ever lapsiong into banal sentimentality, Ruth Prawer
Jhabvala's script embraces all the characters in the film's loose
three-part structure. The first is named Benoit, for the French boy
they adopt. He blossoms under the emotional security he finds for
the first time, although it takes him quite a while before he feels
safe enough to unpack the suitcase he kept ready for a possible
return to the orphanage. Later, as played with winning
vulnerability by Jesse Bradford, he adopts his adoptive father's
name, Billy, feeling a full-fledged member of the family, although
his equilibrium is shaken when he receives a sympathetic
communication from his natural mother.
</P>
<P>
   The film's second part is called Francis, after a precocious
misfit Channe befriends at school in Paris, and with whom she
develops an outsider's complicity. The final act, Daddy, is
touchingly played out in the '70s, back in the states when Channe
finds adapting to new circumstances tougher than ever in the Long
Island suburb they move to, but is bolstered emotionally by her
father until she rights herself. Almost as a throwaway,
Kristofferson conveys a nobility of the heart in concealing from
his daughter the difficulties he's facing in marshalling his
remaining strength to try and beat the clock and complete his last
problematic novel.
</P>
<P>
   Sobieski makes a really strong impression in what has to be
regarded as her breakthrough role, conveying Channe's purity,
fragility and distress. Barbara Hershey shines as the family's
poker-playing earth mother, reminding us what she can do with
richly-textured material, although the scene most people will
probably remember most strongly comes when she confronts in lioness
style her son's power-tripping teacher in Paris. And you're not
likely to soon forget Kristofferson's low-key but high-profile
patriarch. This family glories in its eccentricity, but it's their
turning to one another in crisis that will get to you most. The
chronicle of this family is more than a little messy around the
edges, and the film is right to follow suit stylistically because
it's there with the goods when it counts. It's one of the most
affectingly acted, unabashedly loving films you'll see this year.

   &UR;  &LR; Eleven years is not an eternity for most careers, but it is
for a rock 'n' roll band. For the Boston-based Buffalo Tom, the
shock is just setting in, but so is the pride that the group has
gotten this far without ending up on the alt-rock scrap heap like
many of its peers.
</P>
<P>
   ``One day you're the next big thing, the next day you're
veterans and all your friends are having children,'' says Buffalo
Tom singer-guitarist Bill Janovitz. ``But the idea is that you can
grow older in rock 'n' roll and deal with different issues, though
the essential elements for us are still there. We still deal with
the quieter moments of relationships, the darker side of normality,
and the `Blue Velvet' side of growing up in suburbia.''
</P>
<P>
   They deal with them all in the alluring ``Smitten,'' the sixth
album by Buffalo Tom, which comes out Tuesday. The new disc shows a
deeper, more thoughtful, but still rocking, Buffalo Tom. Janovitz
and bandmates Chris Colbourn (bass-vocals) and drummer Tom Maginnis
(drums) were joined by keyboardist Phil Aiken, whose influence is
apparent in the heightened melodic sense that shows how far the
group has come from its early days as a thrashy, Husker Du-styled
guitar trio.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were always a pop band at heart,'' says Janovitz, ``but we
obscured that with big noisy guitars and sometimes bad production.
... We used to layer on five guitars, then layer them out to three
and maybe add keyboards as an afterthought. But this time we made a
pre-assumpton that keyboards would be there from the start.''
</P>
<P>
   The songs, which began to get hatched during a long weekend on
Chappaquiddick island two years ago, range from the pretty,
acoustic-flavored ``Under Milkwood,'' to the electric riff-rock of
``Walking Wounded.'' But the surprise is the increased role of
Colbourn, who eases the pressure on Janovitz by singing lead on
several tracks, including the first single, the XTC-meets-Squeeze
number, ``Rachael.''
</P>
<P>
   The increased democracy of the band was inevitable, says
Janovitz. ``You've got to put aside your ego for the band. For the
first time, I won't be singing the single, but hopefully it will be
our biggest to date.''
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo Tom has a great attitude about coming this far. ``We've
always done okay, even though we haven't hit the lottery,'' he
says. ``But we've had our taste of mainstream success. There's
something great about going to Sydney, Australia and playing for
1,000 people singing along to every lyric. Or to Stockholm and
having people do the same. Sometimes you can't ask for much more
than that.''

   Sitting in limbo: A song associated with reggae pioneer Jimmy
Cliff is ``Sitting in Limbo,'' which, unfortunately, is the state
he's in these days in his dual careers in music and film. His new
album, ``Journey of a Lifetime,'' is only being released overseas,
not here. His stateside record label, Island/PolyGram, wants to put
out a ``Best of Jimmy Cliff'' instead, he says. ``I'm stuck in
limbo right now, but I'll step out,'' he adds during a recent chat
from his Jamaican home.
</P>
<P>
   The import-only ``Journey of a Lifetime'' disc is ``a
philosophical album, but rooted in reality,'' says Cliff. ``All the
songs are a journey.'' One of them, ``Super Bad,'' comes from his
upbringing in a Jamaican ghetto. ``I saw many of my friends die
(there). '' Another one, ``Daddy,'' is ``about our lives as
parents.''
</P>
<P>
   As you might expect, Cliff isn't thrilled that the album lacks
an American release date. ``If it's advertised to the people,
they'll go get it,'' he says confidently. ``Fortunately, I can go
to the rest of the planet, but America is 32 percent of the world's
music market, so it's very important.''
</P>
<P>
   Cliff, also known as Dr. Cliff after receiving an honorary
doctorate from the University of the West Indies last year, is
still trying to mount a sequel to the award-winning reggae film,
``The Harder They Come,'' in which he acted and sang such classics
as ``You Can Get It If You Really Want,'' ``Many Rivers to Cross,''
and ``Wonderful World, Beautiful People.'' Cliff has worked up a
synopsis for a sequel, but says the people he shows it to just want
to take it for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   One thing that hasn't changed is Cliff's role as reggae
ambassador. He was the first reggae act, even before Bob Marley, to
tour Africa. He plans to play in Nigeria for six weeks this fall,
and hopes to go to China soon. ``I think they would like my music
over there,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, Cliff is a long way from retirement. ``I don't enjoy
doing anything else as much as this,'' he says. ``When I evaluate
my life, I'm here to be an artist.''

`BUDDY' ADDS HUMOR, STYLE TO THE PI GENRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
BUDDY FARO 
Starring: Dennis Farina, Frank Whalley, Allison Smith 
On: CBS 
Time: Friday at 9 p.m. 
Rated: TVPG 
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sometimes fast friends turn to enemies just as quickly. And so
the kooky, kicky premiere of Dennis Farina's ``Buddy Faro'' should
be approached warily, and with a healthy sense that few TV series
could ever live up to such a giddy and stylish introduction. We can
only pray to the gods of prime time that ``Buddy Faro'' doesn't
pull a Mr. Hyde next week and turn into ``Dellaventura,'' last
season's smarmy Danny Aiello crime vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   The premiere is a wonderfully snazzy and light-hearted hour,
with enough cinematic flair to make it feel like a little
theatrical movie. It's the story of the return of Buddy Faro, a
legendary P.I. who dropped out of society 20 years ago and landed
face down in the gutter _ the gutter being along the lanes of a
bowling alley South of the Border. He's a crude Rip Van Winkle with
his long white beard, but beneath the caked dirt is a reservoir of
snappy Rat Pack cool. After Buddy revisits a bathtub and razor,
once he's been retrieved by a younger detective played by Frank
Whalley, he's a natural with a martini in one hand, a cigar in the
other, and Tom Jones blaring ``Delilah'' over the show's lively
soundtrack.
</P>
<P>
   While the plot of tonight's premiere isn't complicated, there's
no point in spoiling it with too much information here. And anyway,
the real strengths of ``Buddy Faro'' are in its smart casting and
its rich visual atmospherics. Farina, who fit perfectly in two
Elmore Leonard movies, ``Out of Sight'' and ``Get Shorty,'' is just
right as Buddy. He's easily believable as both the down-and-out
caveman and the slick charmer with a glittery-gowned date on his
arm. He's pure unflappability, and it's a thrill when he looks
directly into the camera and says he feels ``like a hundred
bucks.'' And Frank Whalley is effectively eager as Bob Jones, the
gumshoe who idolizes Buddy, having trained himself according to
Buddy's classic detectiving book, ``I, Private Eye.'' Whalley, who
has been in movies like ``Pulp Fiction'' and ``A Midnight Clear,''
makes his second banana character simultaneously clueless and
intelligent.
</P>
<P>
   The look of ``Buddy Faro'' is an embarrassment of riches. The
shadows swimming over Bob's hands at his computer, the neon glow of
a barroom, mobsters with garish faces, the chandelier sparkle of a
dinner club, an alleyway lit in blue haze _ the show is dense with
these sorts of crafted images. The action may be set in 1998, but
the aura is pure vintage Hollywood. And there's a beautifully
designed sequence that's set in Bob's girlfriend's oppressively
modern, sterile home, where even the silverware may be art. ``She
has a very strong aesthetic,'' Bob tells Buddy, warning him not to
touch anything.
</P>
<P>
   Bob's girlfriend is a hysterical parody, an art-world ghoul
whose pale face and red lipstick put her on a visual scale not far
from the Master of Ceremonies in ``Cabaret.'' Her oddness is a
reminder that Mark Frost from the stranger-than-strange ``Twin
Peaks'' is the driving force behind ``Buddy Faro,'' as writer and
executive producer. Let's hope Frost stays interested in this
project, which will need to keep up its fresh sense of humor in the
manner of ``Maximum Bob,'' the quirky and consistently amusing
summer series. At a time when most of TV's crime shows are steeped
in realism, ``Buddy Faro'' has the opportunity to have a dazzlingly
good old time.

FAMILY TRAGEDIES HAUNTING COATES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ He was arrested during training camp,
charged with assaulting the mother of one of his children, an
allegation that will be addressed at a hearing Tuesday. Not long
after that incident, his aunt died in South Carolina. Then came a
knee problem and double ankle sprains which forced him to sit out
for the first time in his NFL career after 113 straight games.
</P>
<P>
   And last Friday, Ben Coates got word that his older sister, 38,
had died suddenly. He wasn't with the Patriots Monday, missed
Thursday's practice, and not expected for Friday's practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's had a tough haul,'' said his agent, Michael George.
``He's really devastated by his sister's death. He's had to be
there for his family. It's been a very tough time for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Long a key part of the Patriots' offense, the All-Pro tight end
has caught only three passes for 24 yards. A year ago at this time,
he'd caught 10 passes. There have been years when he was basically
Drew Bledsoe's only target, but in this spread-the-wealth offense,
that's no longer the case.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe has tried to make Terry Glenn the main man. With Troy
Brown also considered a big-play receiver, Coates has been
relegated to the background.
</P>
<P>
   In the offseason, the Patriots even drafted a tight end in the
second round, Alabama's Rod Rutledge, to go along with Lovett
Purnell, who is considered a fine receiver.
</P>
<P>
   Sidelined against Indianapolis in the second game, Coates
returned to action last week against the Tennessee Oilers and was
once again a secondary receiver. The Patriots are off this week and
play at New Orleans Oct. 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ben can always use the bye week,'' said coach Pete Carroll.
``The way he responded to this ankle, I think he's fine now. We
missed Ben on two chances last week _ once we had him on a corner
route when we couldn't get the ball to him and then we missed him
in the end zone. Ben would have had a big game if we had got the
ball to him. It'll go in cycles where you'll see Ben more active
than he is in other weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   At 29, Coates is still one of the most feared tight ends in the
business. The pounding he's taken over the years hasn't diminished
his desire to play and contribute. When he was hobbling after
twisting his ankle in the opener against Denver, he argued with
Carroll on the sideline in a futile effort to stay in the game.
</P>
<P>
   On any given pass route, Coates is drawing a linebacker and a
strong safety in coverage. His limited speed, caused by the leg
problems, has made it more difficult for him to get open.
</P>
<P>
   But Bledsoe hardly has abandoned him. When in trouble, he will
still fire the ball in the general direction of Coates.
</P>
<P>
   For eight seasons, Coates has been the greatest player New
England never knew. His shunning of the media over the years is
reminiscent of Jim Rice's behavior with the Red Sox. Coates has
trusted less than a handful of reporters, and there have been fewer
stories written about him than about any great athlete in this area
in recent memory.
</P>
<P>
   Coates doesn't like to be in the spotlight, at least not this
way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ben's a strong person,'' said George. ``He'll come out of this
fine. Right now it's just a rough period in his life.''

COULD PARITY SPOIL THE PARTY AT FIESTA? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Forida and Florida State have already lost. Nebraska has won
each week but has not been dazzling. UCLA has also had some shaky
moments. Kansas State remains an unknown because of the lack of
quality opposition.
</P>
<P>
   What we have in college football as October and conference play
approach is parity. There are lots of good teams that can beat each
other on any given Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   But there are no great teams.
</P>
<P>
   Well, let's hold up a little bit on that. Ohio State may be
classified as great by the end of the season, but the Buckeyes
still have to face their biggest obstacle, archrival Michigan, and
they trailed against Missouri at halftime last Saturday in
Columbus.
</P>
<P>
   It is plausible that when the matchup for the national
championship game in the Fiesta Bowl Jan. 4 is selected, neither
team will be unbeaten.
</P>
<P>
   Is this good or a nightmare for the people who put together the
Bowl Championship Series?
</P>
<P>
   We say it's good. We say it's great. The more controversy, the
better, and the thought of having to choose from a group of four or
five once-beaten teams for two slots is exactly the kind of turmoil
college football needs to convince the powers that be that the only
sane way to do things is to have a playoff system with eight or 16
teams.
</P>
<P>
   We could have a marquee matchup of unbeatens such as Ohio State
vs. the Kansas State-Nebraska winner or Ohio State vs. UCLA, but if
this season has shown anything, it's that everyone is capable of
losing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, I could see a situation where you have no unbeaten teams
at the end of the year,'' said Big East commissioner Mike
Tranghese, who hopes Syracuse can run the table and find a way to
sneak into the Fiesta Bowl. ``There's not a whole lot of candidates
out there to go unbeaten.''
</P>
<P>
   Recent history suggests that the chances of having at least two
unbeaten, untied teams at the end of the regular season are fairly
good. In every year since 1991, we've had at least two unbeaten,
untied teams. In 1992 and '93, there were three.
</P>
<P>
   Form might again take over, but thus far, we think getting just
one unbeaten team will be a major accomplishment.

   There are bad road teams and then there is Hawaii. The Rainbows
have lost their last 21 Western Athletic Conference games on the
road, and the last time they won any road game was in 1995 ... Some
people feel Nebraska will have its most severe test of the season
Saturday when it hosts unbeaten Washington, the last team to beat
the Cornhuskers in Lincoln. ``There's still talk that we're not a
proven team and that our win over California wasn't impressive
enough,'' said Nebraska center Josh Heskew. ``I guess we didn't get
enough style points. But Washington is a Top 10 team. They're going
to come to our place fired up.'' ... Here's some encouraging news
for Michigan fans. Although the Wolverines are 1-2 going into
Saturday's game against Michigan State, the last time Michigan
started 0-2 was in 1988, when the Wolverines finished 9-2-1 and
beat Southern Cal in the Rose Bowl ... A virus that hit the Duke
team last week before its game against Florida State has spread to
the Seminoles. At least 10 FSU players, including quarterback Chris
Weinke, came down with the bug and missed practice this week. That
could be good news for Southern Cal, which visits Tallahassee
Saturday ... Tennessee's 20-17 overtime victory over Florida last
week was costly _ literally. Fans did $25,000 worth of damage to
Neyland Stadium when they stormed the field and tore down the
goalposts ... Florida ranks 112th (out of 112) in turnover ratio
after turning the ball over four times against Tennessee. After
three games, the Gators are minus-10. ``I don't know what to do
about it,'' said coach Steve Spurrier. ``We haven't had this
problem until this year.'' ... After beating Houston last week,
UCLA quarterback Cade McNown criticized the Cougars. ``I felt like
they played us dirty with a lot of cheap shots, a lot of going for
the knees on late hits,'' said McNown. The response from Houston
coach Kim Helton: ``I don't think he's accustomed to throwing
laying on his back.'' ... UCLA, which has won a school-record 12
games in a row, rewarded coach Bob Toledo with a two-year contract
extension ... Marshall fans are learning that not all of last
year's success for the Mid-American Conference champion was
attributable to wide receiver Randy Moss. Quarterback Chad
Pennington is proving that he's pretty good as well. Marshall is
unbeaten after three games, including a 24-21 win over South
Carolina last week, and Pennington has thrown eight touchdown
passes. Coach Bob Pruett is 28-3 in two-plus seasons at Marshall,
including a Division 1-AA national championship two years ago and
the MAC title last year in Marshall's first Division 1-A season ...
Count on Alabama being focused for this week's game against
Arkansas. The Hogs have beaten the Tide two of the last three
years, including a 17-16 stunner last season ... Florida is all but
out of the Southeastern Conference race. For the Gators to win,
Tennessee will have to lose at least two conference games ... One
of the surprise teams of the year is Colorado. ``We are an exposed
3-0,'' says coach Rick Neuheisel. ``We have found our faults and
know what we have to work on and know what needs to be corrected.''
... Virginia is 4-0 for the third straight season. Contrast that
with Wisconsin, which, if it beats Northwestern Saturday, will be
4-0 for only the second time in 20 years.

   If you are a Notre Dame fan and want a good Christmas read, try
``Talking Irish: The Oral History of Notre Dame Football'' by Steve

an account in the words of the participants. Delsohn says he grew
up a college football fan and was fascinated by Notre Dame's
mystique. The only people who refused to be interviewed for the
book were Paul Hornung and Joe Montana ... Dick Farley, who begins
his 12th season as coach at Williams Saturday, is No. 7 on the
all-time winning percentage list with a 73-12-5 (.847) record ...
How's this for justice? In the first football game in Bryant

BURNS WORRIES THAT HOLDOUTS ARE WASTING TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Last year Pat Burns had no idea what kind of lineup he
would have for opening night.
</P>
<P>
   Early in training camp, the first-year Bruins coach had a group
of virtual no-names surrounded by a small core of veterans. Burns
figured he'd be in much better shape this time, but with four
unsigned Group 2 free agents sitting at home, including top scorer
Jason Allison, he is scratching his head much the way he did 12
months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``All those guys, I would die to have them in here in camp right
now,'' said Burns, referring to Allison, Anson Carter, and Kyle
McLaren. ``They're missing great opportunities. With the team we
could have, we could develop something here and they could be part
of it. We're talking about two 23-year-olds, a 21-year-old. That's
three of the four guys. (Ted Donato remains out while waiting to be
traded.) These kids have an opportunity to go out and really make a
statement about themselves: `Yeah, I'll go out and work for it.'
You've got to work. I coached a Stanley Cup final my first year and
I was making $80,000. That was 10 years ago and it was Canadian
(money). I was happier than hell. I took the challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns dipped his toe into the water a couple of days ago,
expressing frustration at trying to replace Allison in the lineup.
Before that, the coach had been reluctant to comment much on the
free agent situation. Thursday, though, he was expansive in urging
all three youngsters to look at the big picture _ if they continue
to produce, they will get the big money.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to put your time in,'' he said. ``I laugh when I
hear (some) say the Bruins don't want to pay. I know what goes on.
It's not that they don't want to pay. Put your time in, earn your
bananas, and we'll give you the money, but we're not just going to
hand it out to anybody that comes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a pretty nice situation for years to come if we get
everybody there. I have to understand Harry (Sinden) and Mike
(O'Connell), too. They're not going to hand it out; you've got to
earn it. We had one good year last year. We didn't have a great
year, we had a good year. Players had good seasons, they didn't
have great seasons. Jason had an above-average season. At this time
of year last year, we didn't know what we were going to do with
him. &UR;  &LR; Finally, it broke through and he's improved a lot of things,
but that's what you have to look at.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked if he thought Allison was ill advised in taking an
entrenched position, Burns said he thought it was more a matter of
Allison being led astray by comparing himself to other players and
believing he should be making the same salary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you start comparing yourself ... I'm happy to have a job
and I'm happy to work,'' said Burns. ``How much did they offer
Jackie Parker, $500,000 for five years? I'm getting $550,000 for
six years. Put it that way. Jackie Parker never coached a game in
the NHL and I've been here 10 years. I don't worry about that
stuff. If you start worrying about the guy over there, if you start
saying, `How come he can have it and I can't have it?' ... I think
Jason, if he gives himself one more year, he's over the hump.
Sometimes you've got to put your ass on the block.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of Burns's frustration stems from the fact that both player
and coach worked so hard to improve Allison's game, resulting in a
career year. He doesn't want that progress to stall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe he's a one-year wonder,'' said Burns.``If he
comes in in the same frame of mind as he left here last year, he's
going to get all the opportunities he got last year. He's going to
play on every power play. He's our best power-play centerman. Those
things will fall into place for him.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked if he thought Allison would be the same hungry player
if the Bruins gave in on a big-money, long-term deal, Burns said,
``It's all a question mark. I personally think he probably would.
He says he would.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
_____ &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Neither Rob DiMaio nor Tim Taylor skated Thursday. DiMaio took a
nasty hit Wednesday night in Pittsburgh, resulting in back spasms.
His back tightened up Thursday, so he was given the day off.
Taylor's situation is potentially more serious. Burns said it's
possible Taylor is suffering from appendicitis. Doctors are
attempting to treat it with antibiotics rather than surgery ...
Beginning tonight, the Bruins play three exhibition games in as
many nights. They start by taking on Montreal in Providence in a
game in which the teams will experiment by not using the red line.
Then they play back-to-back games against the Florida Panthers,
tomorrow in Greenville, S.C., and Sunday in Sunrise, Fla. Burns has
always been adamantly opposed to removing the red line. ``I don't
have a clue how that game is played,'' said the coach, who
indicated he would go with a strong-skating lineup tonight. ``A lot
of guys don't have a clue how that game is played. I hope they
don't go with it (permanently). I don't think they will.'' ...
Burns had a message for right wing Landon Wilson _ wake up. Wilson
made his presence known Wednesday only when he rifled the puck off
the glass 51 seconds into the first period, shattering a pane,
which resulted in a 17-minute delay. &UR;  &LR; ``He can't play that way,''
said Burns. ``He's a big, strong guy. He has all the tools to be
one of those big power forwards. He has to find a way to get there,
be there, bump the guy, win the battles to the puck. He thinks it's
going to come to him. That's not how it works.'' Burns said it's
players like Wilson who can drive coaches to distraction. ``You
know they could do it. You stress to them when you talk to them
about it. You're hard on them, like Allison last year. The first 20
games, he drove me nuts and I drove him nuts _ until he understood
what he could possibly do.''

MCGWIRE, SOSA HOMERUN DERBY ON HOLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ The late, great Ray Fitzgerald, covering the
interminable wait for Carl Yastrzemski's 3,000th hit, once wrote,
``It's lonely out here on the Yaz Watch.''
</P>
<P>
   It's pretty much the same out here on the McGwire-Sosa Watch, or
as Ted Kennedy would say, the ``Mike McGwire-Sammy Soo-ser'' Watch.
</P>
<P>
   No homers for the big guys Thursday. The Cubs, those blood
brothers of the Red Sox, did not play. As for McGwire, he went
homerless (1 for 3 with a walk) in four plate appearances during a
6-3 Cardinal victory over the Montreal Expos at Busch Stadium.
Three games remain and Home Run Derby '98 is deadlocked at a record
65.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine selling out all four games of a final weekend series
when you are 19 1/2 games out of first place, facing the Building
19 Expos. The Cardinals did it, thanks to You Know Who.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Tyler of Aerosmith (better known now as Liv's dad) threw
out the first pitch and it was a strike. Tyler looked like he'd be
OK to start for the Expos and serve up home run No. 66.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals wouldn't mind a little help for their big man.
There's a little sensitivity in these parts about the possibility _
after everything that's happened _ that McGwire might not even get
his name in the major league record book. St. Louis folks are
taking the Sosa challenge personally, and Oliver Stone might be
called in to document a Sosa-Bud Selig conspiracy theory.
</P>
<P>
   Think about it, sports fans. Start with last Sunday's game in
Milwaukee when fan interference and umpiring incompetence denied
McGwire a home run. Second base ump Bob Davidson made the wrong
call and Cardinal fans will never forget. During batting practice
Thurday night, a fan held a sign which read, ``Denkinger and
Davidson _ Separated At Birth.''
</P>
<P>
   Don Denkinger is the umpire who cost the Cardinals the 1985
World Series when he blew a call at first base in Game 6 against
the Royals. Until the Red Sox' choke in '86, it was the closest any
team came to winning a World Series without doing it.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, getting back to the conspiracy theory. Sosa this year
hit 12 homers in 12 games against the Milwaukee Brewers. It's never
been done before and would not have happened if Brewer owner Bud
Selig, now the baseball commissioner, hadn't allowed his team to
move from the American League.
</P>
<P>
   There. The commissioner's town took a home run away from McGwire
and surrendered 12 of Sosa's 65.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis manager Tony La Russa correctly points out that
McGwire has been walked a whopping 160 times, more than twice as
many as Sosa (73 walks).
</P>
<P>
   ``Give Mark another 80 at-bats and see who has more homers,''
said the manager.
</P>
<P>
   La Russa had McGwire batting in his customary No. 3 spot in the
order. The world waits to see if Tony bats Big Mac leadoff Sunday
to give him an extra AB.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire himself seems lonely, as he did before the two-week
home-and-home lovefest with Sammy. Big Mac's not talking before or
after games unless he hits a homer.
</P>
<P>
   Informally, I spoke with McGwire after Thursday night's win. He
talked about not talking.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the big deal?'' he said when asked about his new
silence. ``This is what I've done all year. There's no sense in
talking unless I do something.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the night, McGwire signed autographs for five minutes
before making his way to the batting cage for batting practice.
Seven of his 15 BP swings produced home runs, all resulting in mad
scrambles and wild applause.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie righthander Javier Vazquez started for the Expos, and it
was quickly noted that the 22-year-old Puerto Rican had allowed 30
homers, a Montreal record.
</P>
<P>
   Vazquez (5-14, 6.02 ERA) certainly looked nervous. In the bottom
of the first, he hit No. 2 batter Brian Jordan, then faced McGwire
as flashes popped and everyone (including the two benches) stood.
The kid threw four straight balls, none of 'em close. McGwire no
doubt had the La Russa green light on 3-0, but the pitch was way
high. Cardinal Nation booed as McGwire trotted to first, then
cheered when Ray Lankford followed with a three-run homer.
</P>
<P>
   When McGwire came to bat in the third, he saw no pitch faster
than 79 miles per hour. He swung and missed on a pair of changeups,
then looked at a 2-2 curveball strike.
</P>
<P>
   On his third appearance in the fifth, Big Mac cracked a hard
single to left on a 2-2 pitch. In the seventh, he tapped back to
the mound on a check swing against righty Shayne Bennett.
</P>
<P>
   Such a disappointment. Like Ray Fitz said, it's lonely out here.
</P>
<P>

&HT;    DILLER GOES TO BAT TO LAND BOSTON'S CHANNEL 68 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (s and f coding) (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   Barry Diller, the Hollywood mogul and owner of USA Networks
Inc., has apparently offered $35 million-$40 million to Boston
University to purchase its television stations, including Channel
68 (WABU), flagship of the Red Sox network.
</P>
<P>
   USA Networks Inc. officials signed a letter of intent in July to
purchase WABU and its sister holdings, WZBU in Vineyard Haven and
WNBU in Concord, N.H., plus Low-Power Station w67BA in Dennis.
</P>
<P>
   The purchase would give Diller and his evolving empire a
foothold in the nation's sixth-largest media market.
</P>
<P>
   Despite never-ending rumors that Diller remains interested in
purchasing an existing network such as CBS, he appears focused on
building an eighth network from the ground up, based on a
programming strategy called ``city vision,'' or, as he told
Newsweek, ``localism.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a deep hunger for a big TV network,'' he recently
told Time. ``Our agenda is quite clear. I'm happy with our
agenda.'' But, he coyly conceded, ``if a network came to us
opportunistically _ which I doubt strongly is going to happen _
that would be nice.''
</P>
<P>
   Diller's agenda calls for loads of local programming combined
with sports. So far, the results have been less than expected. WAMI
in Miami debuted June 8, and among its shows is one called ``10s,''
which features buffed men and women strolling South Beach. The
station also has television rights to Miami Heat games.
</P>
<P>
   Renowned for founding the Fox network and the Home Shopping
Network, Diller owns 16 UHF station across the country, including
Channel 66 in Boston. USA Network Inc. is worth an estimated $8
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Sources familiar with the negotiations suggest that Diller wants
Channel 68 with or without the rights to the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   The station has held those rights for the last two years but
refused to exercise a $14 million option for next season, largely
because it is losing an estimated $6 million annually.
</P>
<P>
   The station has offered to pay in the $7 million-a-year range,
but, citing proprietary information, has refused to detail its
offer to the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Gaining the rights to Celtics road games makes Channel 68 more
attractive for potential buyers. The recently signed deal calls for
the station and team to split the advertising revenue and share the
production costs, while Channel 68 pays the rights fee over time.
The station would make money after a certain threshold is reached.
</P>
<P>
   The letter of intent was extended to Sept. 18, but it remains
unclear whether Diller has retracted the offer or asked for more
time.
</P>
<P>
   Neither officials at USA Networks nor Channel 68 would confirm
or deny the pending sale.
</P>
<P>
   BU purchased the station in 1993 from the Christian Science
Monitor for a reported $4 million. Rumors of the station's sale
have persisted for years, but the Diller offer seems to be still on
the table.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Yellow means go
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ESPN has launched a technological innovation developed by
SporTVision Systems for its NFL games. Called ``1st and Ten,'' the
technology enables viewers to see a yellow line that appears
painted on the field at the first-down marker.
</P>
<P>
   The marker allows viewers to see the first-down position
regardless of the location of the cameras. It's not as simple as it
sounds. The location of the first-down yard line is entered into
the systems computer, which also gathers data on the camera's pan,
tilt, zoom, and focus functions. Based on that information, the
system knows where in each frame of video the line should appear.
</P>
<P>
   The innovation debuts Sunday night during ESPN's coverage of the
Cincinnati Bengals-Baltimore Ravens game.

NEWS MEDIA TAKE HEAT FOR COVERAGE OF CLINTON SCANDAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAVID ARMSTRONG  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ When America's first newspaper, Benjamin Harris'
``Publick Occurrences Both Forreign and Domestick,'' printed a
salacious story in 1690 about the king of France sleeping with his
son's wife, the Massachusetts colonial authorities closed the
newspaper after exactly one issue.
</P>
<P>
   Politics and sex have been a part of American journalism ever
since, long before Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike the America of three centuries ago, news of
hanky-panky in high places today is virtually inescapable. Credit _
or blame _ for this goes to the proliferation of media outlets and
the 24-hour news cycle that has come along with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politics as sex scandal has been with us from the very
beginning,'' said Erna Smith, head of the Journalism Department at
San Francisco State University. ``The desire for this kind of
titillation is part of human nature. The country is fascinated and
repelled at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   While treatment of the Clinton scandal is reminiscent of blanket
coverage of other big stories _ most pointedly, the O.J. Simpson
trial and the death of Princess Diana _ the possibility of
presidential impeachment has allowed many media outlets to cloak
themselves in the mantle of the public's right to know and to toss
long-held standards out the window.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many (scandal) stories have been based on leaks. The
motivations of the leakers were questionable,'' Smith said. Yet she
allows, ``The most interesting thing is that every single leak has
proven to be true. When we first heard about the dress (Monica
Lewinsky's stained garment), it sounded so outrageous. Then it
proved to be true.''
</P>
<P>
   While daytime talk shows and cable news operations obsessed on
the story from the beginning, network TV's most respected
newsmagazine, ``60 Minutes,'' did its part by interviewing Kathleen
Willey about her allegations that Clinton groped her.
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton's four hours of videotaped grand jury testimony was
released, all the major networks and cable news outlets aired it in
its entirety.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet, meanwhile, jumped closer to the ranks of the
``legitimate'' media by carrying Matt Drudge's initial Lewinsky
report, the release of the report by Whitewater independent counsel
Kenneth Starr, and the on-line magazine Salon's piece about Rep.
Henry Hyde's past extramarital affair.
</P>
<P>
   The 24-hour news cycle also is feeding ``a rush to judgment,''
said David Caploe, director of media studies at New College of
California.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than 100 newspapers have called on Clinton to resign.
There's been no consistent examination of the potentially
deleterious effect on the country if that happens,'' Caploe said.
``In The New York Times, their front-page stories are much less
analytical than I can remember in the past. Their inside stories
are still solid and analytical, but they aren't running on Page
One.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he said, competition in print and especially
electronic media blurs differences in reporting: ``The intention is
to be different from everyone else. Yet they end up duplicating
each other.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As it is, the Clinton affair may already have surpassed coverage
of O.J. Simpson and the death of Diana, the Princess of Wales. It
might eventually even surpass the mother of all modern U.S.
political scandals _ Watergate _ although it's playing out in a
very different way.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot more media now than when you had just three
broadcast networks,'' said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, dean of the
Annenberg School of Communications at the University of
Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   With more and more media outlets chasing smaller and smaller
audiences, Jamieson said, media organizations jump with both feet
on any big story that could bring them more than a niche audience.
</P>
<P>
   Smith criticized the daily newspapers and much of television for
low-quality coverage. While she praised C-Span for consistently
showcasing the world press' reaction to the Clinton story, she said
that's a rare high point.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, MSNBC is the National Enquirer of the airwaves,'' she
said, blasting the cable network owned by NBC and Microsoft. She
likened MSNBC's scandal coverage to ``wall-to-wall talk TV. They
argue with each other, they're wildly opinionated and speculative.
I think they're a disgrace.''
</P>
<P>
   That depends on when, and whom, you're watching, said MSNBC
spokesman Cory Shields. ``There are so many different formats we
have in a 24-hour period: talk shows, call-ins, formal newscasts.
If I saw a single episode of `Friends' I didn't like, I wouldn't
say I don't like NBC.''
</P>
<P>
   The changing technology that turned cable TV and on-line
services into omnipresent electronic wallpaper also has had a
profound effect on how the news is framed and reported, said Rich
Noyes, the political studies director of the Center for Media and
Public Affairs, in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``More news outlets create more news that can't be ignored,''
Noyes said. ``If you put a senator on, and he says something, that
becomes the news for everyone else, who have to cover it, too.''
</P>
<P>
   More broadly, he said, ``If you find a topic the public is
really interested in, you can play it out, rather than rounding out
your news diet. The media learned this in a big way with O.J.
They've been trying to replicate it ever since.''
</P>
<P>
   This development is not universally applauded, even among
journalists. For example, Pacifica Radio national affairs
correspondent Larry Bensky criticizes the commercial news media for
lack of proportionality and taste.
</P>
<P>
   ``Careers are made and broken on who gets the ratings, and who
can be the most provocative,'' Bensky said. ``All of them are
clamoring for attention like an unruly kindergarten of badly
behaved children. But they never go outside the box. They never go
out in the street to see what's really going on.''

considerable independence and even Cornwall has developed an
independence movement. While the BRitish intendeded these acts of
power decentralizatrion to strengthen the United Kingdom by
instituting a kind of quasi-federalism, the result as been to
actually at heat to the fires of independence. In the course of the
century, the British Empire, once one of the world's most powerful
and expansive political forces could enter the next century as ony
England and a few odd possessions. What does this mean? (Roughton,

   RUSSIA-BARTER _ ENGELS, Russia _ The good news for Trolza, a
mammoth assembly plant and major employer in this depressed town on
the Volga River, was a recent deal worth $25 million to produce
buses for several Russian cities. The bad news: No cash will be
exchanged and no profits will result. Barter made the deal
possible. In a country with a sick economy, a flimsy currency and a
sea of debt, barter accounts for more than two-thirds of all
transactions in Russia. In the West, ``cashless society'' conjures
21st century images of ``smart'' credit cards and high-tech cash
registers and instant electronic debits from a bank account.
Russia's cashless society is from a century in the other direction.
It emerged from a Soviet-era economy that never quite made the
transition to capitalism. The Russian marketplace is hamstrung by
failing banks, the falling ruble, government corruption and an
oppressive tax system. The result is survival-by-barter from the
corner fruit stand to the highest levels of industry. (Holmes, Cox
News Service).
</P>
<P>
   BARTER-BOX _ SARATOV, Russia _ ``It involves a lot of time and
nerves and risks,'' Fyodor Shimchuk says of barter. He is general
director of Sapkon/Neftemash, a company in southern Russia that
makes pumps and values for the oil and gas industry. Earlier this
year, it took a dozen negotiators from his company and others more
than two months to complete a barter deal involving $100,000 worth
of equipment. Here's how it unfolded. (Holmes, Cox News Service).

   DISEASE-RESEARCH _ WASHINGTON _ As cancer survivors participated
this weekend in ``the March,'' a nationwide demonstration against

$14 billion the government spends each year on medical research.
Many cancer survivors feel that given the number of lives it takes,
the disease does not get a fair share of federal research funds

years has been shepherding plans for the new U.S. Patent and

   RIDERS _ WASHINGTON _ In what has become an annual congressional
struggle, Democrats and Republicans, environmentalists and
regulated interests are going down to the wire over ``riders'' that
have been attached to the Interior Department's appropriation for
next year. These amendments would weaken or at least change various
existing environmental laws. Environmental groups hate them and
President Clinton has promised to veto them, with support among
most congressional Democrats and a few Republicans. With fiscal
1999 beginning Thursday, a Clinton veto over environmental riders
could end up shutting down the government, or much of it. (Nesmith,

Eric Robert Rudolph has been in the Western North Carolina

fact, combined with the coming winter, will give them a better
chance to find him. Bearhunting season starts Oct. 12, but federal
officials will meet with hunters in Andrews, N.C. to ask for their
participation and remind them of safety tips because agents will
also be in the woods. Bearhunters use tracking dogs, and it's
possible one could stumble on the fugitive or unearth some
evidence. We'll also round up everybody else still in the woods:
feds are now up to 80 agents, and there are a few hangers-on and
quasi-bounty hunters around. 25 inches. (Scruggs, Atlanta

<P>
   OZONE _ In May, smoke and haze from hundreds of forest fires in
Mexico darkened the skies above Texas. At the time, state officials
were concerned mainly about the potential health effects. Now their
concern has shifted to a new question: Did the smoke and haze cause
elevated ozone readings in Austin, San Antonio, Houston and other
cities? Officials believe it did and have asked the federal
Environmental Protection Agency to ignore those readings. An EPA
official told the state's top environmental officer last week that
the request would be granted. But now the federal agency says it
isn't so sure. The question is not academic. Cities deemed in
violation of the ozone standard are likely to be required to adopt
costly and inconvenient pollution-control measures, including
vehicle-emission inspections, reformulated gasoline and
restrictions on industrial expansion. (Haurwitz, Austin
American-Statesman).

   UT-ASIAN-STUDIES-PROGRAM _ University of Texas administrators
begin their search this week with a series of ads for a professor
to head up an Asian American Studies program to start in the fall
1999 semester. The search culminates a three-year-effort by UT
students and faculty members to rectify what they consider a gaping
hole in the university's ethnic studies programs. While UT has
offered courses African American and Mexican American studies to
students, issues related to the experience of Asian Americans _ who
are the second largest minority group on campus _ has been limited
to the odd class or two. We also explore the place of ethnic
studies in universities nationwide who are still digesting the
Hopwood doctrine. (Shah, Austin American-Statesman)

   PUBLIC-FIGURE _ AUSTIN, Texas _ In an unusual case of a Waco

Texas Supreme Court decided that the Waco reporter had no case. The
court's decision _ that the Waco reporter was a ``public figure'' _
was its first to define when someone involved in a high-profile
controversy falls into a category that makes winning a libel case
harder than someone considered a private person. (McCarthy, Austin
American-Statesman) MOVED.

   From Wall Street to Warsaw the world's financial markets face a
nail-biting day next Tuesday when the Federal Open Market Committee
-- the policymaking arm of America's central bank -- meets to
discuss interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   As global finance is buffeted by gales from emerging markets and
by ever gloomier news from Japan, the committee's decision will
have a huge impact.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the choice is an especially difficult one. America's economy
still seems buoyant enough, but global financial conditions are
deteriorating fast. As panicked investors flee emerging markets,
the calls for an interest-rate cut to provide extra liquidity,
boost confidence and stop the financial rot grow ever louder.
</P>
<P>
   Without action, doomsayers continue, America's economy will
eventually be dragged down too.
</P>
<P>
   Financial markets are increasingly persuaded that the Federal
Reserve will indeed cut rates next week. Short-term interest-rate
futures point to an easing of a quarter of a percentage point in
the federal-funds rate by the end of November and of almost a full
percentage point by the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The markets have often got their bets wrong in the past, in part
because policymakers make opaqueness something of an art. In early
September, Alan Greenspan, the Fed's chairman, was interpreted as
hinting at a rate cut when he suggested that ``it is just not
credible that the United States can remain an oasis of prosperity
unaffected by a world that is experiencing greatly increased
stress.''
</P>
<P>
   Days later, markets swooned when he denied that there was any
move toward an internationally coordinated interest-rate cut in the
rich world.
</P>
<P>
   Then last Tuesday William McDonough, head of the New York
Federal Reserve Bank and the FOMC's vice-chairman, made some
surprisingly candid remarks about the risks to America's growth.
</P>
<P>
   And on Wednesday Greenspan again stressed the importance of
being ``especially sensitive to the deepening signs of global
distress.'' In response to a question on interest rates, he said
``I think we know where we have to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet even factoring out distortions after this summer's long
strike at General Motors, most indicators still point to a vigorous
economy. So far, American consumers show few signs of serious
belt-tightening: retail spending and housing starts remain strong.
</P>
<P>
   With unemployment close to record lows, labor markets remain
stretched. Inflation, while still at historic lows, has stopped
falling.
</P>
<P>
   But there are also a few first signs of weakness, especially in
manufacturing. Excluding vehicles, industrial production in August
was flat, and although July's trade deficit was smaller than in
some previous months, the decline in exports (excluding aircraft)
is accelerating: in inflation-adjusted terms, America's exports of
goods and services fell at a 5 percent annual rate in the first
half of 1998, the worst performance since the recession of 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Might these be harbingers of worse to come? Many Wall Street
economists think so.
</P>
<P>
   J.P. Morgan, for instance, expects the American economy to grow
by only 1.5 percent in 1999. Such a slowdown might have several
causes.
</P>
<P>
   First, the gloomier growth prospects in emerging markets
(especially in Latin America) are likely further to reduce American
exports.
</P>
<P>
   Second -- also quite plausible -- lower corporate earnings and
investors' jitters about lending to firms in troubled times will
mean less capital investment.
</P>
<P>
   Less certain is the mood of the American consumer. Pessimists
think that continued market nerves will drive Wall Street lower and
that, with their wealth rapidly vanishing America's
less-than-thrifty consumers will spend less.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those who expect this also suggest that, by alleviating
financial chaos abroad, America's central bankers might reduce the
chance of a global recession and ease pressure on banks' foreign
loans -- and so lower the risks to America's expansion.
</P>
<P>
   This last argument, although the least certain of all, is the
one exercising most minds at the moment. Lower American interest
rates would, other things being equal, probably weaken the dollar,
thus taking some pressure off those emerging currencies that are
linked to it. Emerging economies would see lower interest costs on
their foreign debts.
</P>
<P>
   More important, they would benefit from the boost to global
liquidity: in the long run, one of the biggest influences on
capital flows to emerging economies is interest rates in rich
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Calm might also be restored to panicky financial markets, as the
Federal Reserve demonstrated that it would take the lead to head
off global depression. This last point is the most significant: the
economic relief for emerging economies from an American
interest-rate cut pales compared with its value as a market
tranquilizer.
</P>
<P>
   But conducting monetary policy primarily to influence markets is
a hazardous business. Would a large rate cut -- half a point or
more -- indicate decisiveness or panic?
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, might a small rate cut of 0.25 percent have little
effect, real or psychological?
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, would an American rate cut made alone be less
effective in influencing investors' perceptions than an
internationally coordinated move -- which the Europeans seem flatly
to have rejected?
</P>
<P>
   Nor is the downside risk of a reduction made primarily for
reasons of market sentiment negligible. If an American rate cut
prompted a sharp fall in the dollar, for instance, a powerful brake
on domestic inflation -- the strong dollar -- would go.
</P>
<P>
   Add all these concerns together and it becomes clear that there
is a case for making a rate cut.
</P>
<P>
   But the Fed in general, and Greenspan in particular, have built
up unparalleled credibility in financial markets. Their next
decision may be the biggest test yet.

THE REST OF THE WORLD TRIES TO GET AMERICA'S ATTENTION

<P>
   At least the rest of the world, it seems, loves America's
sexually troubled president. On Monday, as the president's
videotaped testimony to Kenneth Starr's grand jury was being
televised across the country, the United Nations General Assembly
in New York welcomed Bill Clinton with rhythmic clapping and a
standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   A day later, on a farewell visit to the White House, South
Africa's President Nelson Mandela underlined the point: he would
not desert ``a friend of South Africa and Africa.''
</P>
<P>
   Similar sentiments came from Britain's Tony Blair and Germany's
Helmut Kohl, who last weekend told Die Zeit that the public
scrutiny of Clinton's relationship with Monica Lewinsky ``is
something -- and I don't use the expression casually -- that makes
me vomit.''
</P>
<P>
   Genuine sympathy for an embattled colleague? Doubtless so, since
surely in no other country would a head of government, whatever his
misdeeds, have to endure the relentless probing and prurient detail
that have characterized Starr's investigations.
</P>
<P>
   But there is another element at work. As Kohl added: ``With all
the problems that we have, from the financial crisis in Asia to
genocide in central Africa and the civil war in Kosovo, I really
hope that the Americans can pull their socks up and be capable of
acting.''
</P>
<P>
   The translation is obvious. America, the one superpower and the
global economy's consumer of last resort, cannot be an effective
leader of the world if its own leader is so distracted. And, if
America cannot lead, then the world's troubles will only grow.
</P>
<P>
   The logic seems powerful enough. Indeed, Americans who regard
the president's misbehavior and its consequences as anything but
trivial make a similar argument.
</P>
<P>
   Lamar Alexander, a former (and probably future) Republican
candidate for the presidency, this week asked: ``When it comes to
foreign policy, who is minding the store?''
</P>
<P>
   He went on to list the developments allegedly missed or
mishandled by the president in the eight months since Starr began
delving into the Monica Lewinsky affair: the nuclear tests by India
and Pakistan; Iraq's suspension of UN weapons inspections; the
launch by North Korea of a missile or satellite over Japan;
Russia's slide into economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The list could go on. Last May, for example, the secretary of
state, Madeleine Albright, presented a plan to revive the Middle
East peace process, complete with an ultimatum for its acceptance
by Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   When Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, called Mrs.
Albright's bluff, Clinton's support for her was conspicuous by its
absence. She may now try again -- but how hard, given that once
bitten is twice shy?
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Serbia's Slobodan Milosevic has been forcibly
repressing Kosovo's ethnic Albanians regardless of NATO's threat
that Serb brutality would not be tolerated.
</P>
<P>
   Japan has yet to put its economic house in order, despite
repeated American warnings of the global repercussions of delay.
</P>
<P>
   But is this dismal litany truly the consequence of presidential
distraction? It is just as plausible to argue that the fault lies
not with the Starr investigation but with the president himself.
</P>
<P>
   After all, it is in foreign policy that a smart president (and
no one doubts Clinton's political intelligence) can find
distraction from domestic difficulties, rather than vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the cynics will say Clinton appreciates that point
perfectly: hence the ``Wag the Dog'' coincidence of America's
missile strikes in Sudan and Afghanistan the day Monica Lewinsky
again testified to the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Less cynically, historians will note that Richard Nixon,
throughout the Watergate saga, proved both active and effective in
foreign affairs. In October 1973, the Arab-Israeli war was settled
without the intervention of a nuclear-armed Soviet Union; and in
June 1974, only two months before his resignation, Nixon was
signing arms treaties in Moscow with Leonid Brezhnev.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, if Clinton proves ineffectual on the world
stage, the fault lies with him -- and predates the arrival of Starr
as his grand inquisitor.
</P>
<P>
   It is a tempting conclusion. Back in 1992, when Bill Clinton was
campaigning for his first term, he made a virtue of his disdain for
foreign-policy issues. ``It's the economy, stupid,'' was the
wounding taunt against George Bush, an incumbent president who was
famously interested in foreign affairs.
</P>
<P>
   True, Clinton moved swiftly to squash the annual squabbling in
Congress attached to China's ``most favored nation'' trading
status, but it is not entirely glib to say that much of the
administration's foreign policy has seemed pretty improvised. The
acceptance in 1996 of the Helms-Burton legislation on Cuba, and the
much-touted presidential visits to Latin America last October and
Africa last March, certainly smack not so much of a vision of the
world as of a calculated appeal to domestic American
constituencies.
</P>
<P>
   There is, however, a reply to Clinton's critics. Of course there
will be issues on which a president is free to act without
Congress's say-so, and on which the country as a whole will rally
to the president. The attacks on Osama bin Laden's camps in
Afghanistan and the Sudanese pharmaceutical factory are a case in
point (made easier by the soldiers' ability, after the casualties
suffered in Somalia five years ago, to rely on technology rather
than manpower).
</P>
<P>
   But many foreign issues are not like that. Today's most pressing
crisis is financial, and therefore economic, rather (yet) than
political. Arguably, ``It's the economy, stupid'' applies now not
just to America but to the world as a whole, and Clinton -- a
policy wonk of the highest order -- is the man who ought to be
offering solutions.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is that such solutions cannot be delivered without
the support of Congress. Earlier in September, in a speech in New
York, Clinton described the contagious problems that began with the
collapse of the Thai baht last year as ``the biggest financial
challenge facing the world in a half-century,'' adding that ``the
United States has an absolutely inescapable obligation to lead.''
</P>
<P>
   That meant working with Japanese, Europeans and others, but it
also meant that ``Congress must live up to its responsibility'' by
agreeing to finance ``our obligations'' to the IMF.
</P>
<P>
   Will Congress oblige on this, or on paying America's dues to the
UN, or on keeping American troops in the Balkans or persuading
North Korea to step away from the nuclear edge?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps in the end it will, but it will demand some kind of
price, and the fact is that, whether or not the Lewinsky saga
distracted the president, it has certainly weakened his ability to
bargain.
</P>
<P>
   He wants Richard Holbrooke to be his new UN ambassador -- but,
because some potential conflict-of-interest questions hang over
Holbrooke, he dares not send him for confirmation by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   As things grow bloodier in Kosovo, the president wants the right
for NATO to strike against Serbia -- but fears the reluctance of
his allies and the opposition of Russia (though this week Russia
did seem to bend a bit).
</P>
<P>
   No wonder America's friends are worried. No wonder its enemies,
in Baghdad and elsewhere, are chuckling.

   But is this dismal litany truly the consequence of presidential
distraction? It is just as plausible to argue that the fault lies
not with the Starr investigation but with the president himself.
</P>
<P>
   After all, it is in foreign policy that a smart president (and
no one doubts Clinton's political intelligence) can find
distraction from domestic difficulties, rather than vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the cynics will say Clinton appreciates that point
perfectly: hence the ``Wag the Dog'' coincidence of America's
missile strikes in Sudan and Afghanistan the day Monica Lewinsky
again testified to the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Less cynically, historians will note that Richard Nixon,
throughout the Watergate saga, proved both active and effective in
foreign affairs. In October 1973, the Arab-Israeli war was settled
without the intervention of a nuclear-armed Soviet Union; and in
June 1974, only two months before his resignation, Nixon was
signing arms treaties in Moscow with Leonid Brezhnev.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, if Clinton proves ineffectual on the world
stage, the fault lies with him -- and predates the arrival of Starr
as his grand inquisitor.
</P>
<P>
   It is a tempting conclusion. Back in 1992, when Bill Clinton was
campaigning for his first term, he made a virtue of his disdain for
foreign-policy issues. ``It's the economy, stupid,'' was the
wounding taunt against George Bush, an incumbent president who was
famously interested in foreign affairs.
</P>
<P>
   True, Clinton moved swiftly to squash the annual squabbling in
Congress attached to China's ``most favored nation'' trading
status, but it is not entirely glib to say that much of the
administration's foreign policy has seemed pretty improvised. The
acceptance in 1996 of the Helms-Burton legislation on Cuba, and the
much-touted presidential visits to Latin America last October and
Africa last March, certainly smack not so much of a vision of the
world as of a calculated appeal to domestic American
constituencies.
</P>
<P>
   There is, however, a reply to Clinton's critics. Of course there
will be issues on which a president is free to act without
Congress's say-so, and on which the country as a whole will rally
to the president. The attacks on Osama bin Laden's camps in
Afghanistan and the Sudanese pharmaceutical factory are a case in
point (made easier by the soldiers' ability, after the casualties
suffered in Somalia five years ago, to rely on technology rather
than manpower).
</P>
<P>
   But many foreign issues are not like that. Today's most pressing
crisis is financial, and therefore economic, rather (yet) than
political. Arguably, ``It's the economy, stupid'' applies now not
just to America but to the world as a whole, and Clinton -- a
policy wonk of the highest order -- is the man who ought to be
offering solutions.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is that such solutions cannot be delivered without
the support of Congress. Earlier in September, in a speech in New
York, Clinton described the contagious problems that began with the
collapse of the Thai baht last year as ``the biggest financial
challenge facing the world in a half-century,'' adding that ``the
United States has an absolutely inescapable obligation to lead.''
</P>
<P>
   That meant working with Japanese, Europeans and others, but it
also meant that ``Congress must live up to its responsibility'' by
agreeing to finance ``our obligations'' to the IMF.
</P>
<P>
   Will Congress oblige on this, or on paying America's dues to the
UN, or on keeping American troops in the Balkans or persuading
North Korea to step away from the nuclear edge?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps in the end it will, but it will demand some kind of
price, and the fact is that, whether or not the Lewinsky saga
distracted the president, it has certainly weakened his ability to
bargain.
</P>
<P>
   He wants Richard Holbrooke to be his new UN ambassador -- but,
because some potential conflict-of-interest questions hang over
Holbrooke, he dares not send him for confirmation by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   As things grow bloodier in Kosovo, the president wants the right
for NATO to strike against Serbia -- but fears the reluctance of
his allies and the opposition of Russia (though this week Russia
did seem to bend a bit).
</P>
<P>
   No wonder America's friends are worried. No wonder its enemies,
in Baghdad and elsewhere, are chuckling.

<P>
   It was, said Michael McCurry, the president's genial spokesman,
``arguably an unnecessary day in the life of our country, an awful
day''; and this is a common response to Bill Clinton's video
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   After watching the president being put through four hours of
questioning Monday, most people seem simply to have felt sad. The
president did not damage himself by losing his temper. He did not
disclose anything new. He merely discussed his sex life in
excruciating detail.
</P>
<P>
   Surely, the conventional wisdom goes, America should have spared
itself this humiliating spectacle.
</P>
<P>
   But the conventional wisdom is wrong, and its wrongness says
much about the country's political culture.
</P>
<P>
   Americans do not like their politicians to admit to being
politicians, or openly to press the interests of their party. In
the language of Washington, calling someone ``partisan'' is a
withering insult, whereas ``bipartisanship'' is a state of heavenly
enchantment.
</P>
<P>
   When Congress took delivery of the Starr report early this
month, its leaders promised to consider it in a ``bipartisan way.''
Then, after Congress released the president's taped testimony,
McCurry hit back with the P-word, accusing the Republican majority
of ``rank partisanship.''
</P>
<P>
   Two days later Newt Gingrich, the Republican leader in the
House, responded by convening a bipartisan meeting to decide the
next steps in the Lewinsky business.
</P>
<P>
   Because partisanship is held to be a sin, congressmen try to
present impeachment as a legal, not a political, process. ``This is
about carrying out the law,'' says Tom DeLay, the Republican House
whip. ``This is in the end about the rule of law,'' chimes
Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   True to this spirit, congressmen pour through the boxes of
evidence supplied by the independent counsel, Kenneth Starr,
seeking to decide whether the president broke laws; they talk as
though this question alone will decide whether he should be
impeached or not. They say things like, ``Perjury clearly meets the
constitutional standard for impeachment,'' as though they were
merely following a legal standard laid down by the founders, rather
than making a political judgment.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble with this legalism, as has been often pointed out,
is that the constitution lays down no precise standard for
impeachment. It holds that a president may be impeached for
``treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors,'' but it
neglects to define these categories.
</P>
<P>
   There is no statutory law to clarify this mystery, and precious
few precedents to work from. The usual characteristic of a legal
judgment -- that its scope for discretion is tightly bounded by a
complex code -- does not apply.
</P>
<P>
   On the contrary, the opportunity for discretion is wide, and no
guiding code exists. ``An impeachable offense,'' said Gerald Ford
famously, ``is whatever a majority of the House of Representatives
considers it to be at a given moment in history.''
</P>
<P>
   And so the talk of ``carrying out the law'' in Congress turns
out to be a pose: even though presidential perjury prompted the
current mess, the decision to impeach is not really a legal one. It
is instead political, meaning that congressmen must exercise their
judgment on behalf of the voters.
</P>
<P>
   This is why it was right to release Clinton's taped testimony to
the public.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, release mired the country in a depressing spectacle.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it polarized America: it deepened the anger of the
president's enemies, who watched him splitting hairs over the
meaning of words like ``truth'' and ``alone,'' while also deepening
the indignation of the president's sympathizers, who find his
inquisitors preposterously intrusive.
</P>
<P>
   But voters need to know the facts of a case in which they are in
effect the jurors. Because impeachment is political, it should be
public. Because it is public, it is likely to be nasty, brutish and
tiresomely long-winded.
</P>
<P>
   Only a country bent on denying its political side could possibly
object to this.
</P>
<P>
   After Watergate, the American urge to deny politics prompted the
creation of an independent counsel, who was supposed to apply
objective, legal methods to the problem of misbehaving presidents.
This has not changed the political nature of impeachment; it has
merely obscured it.
</P>
<P>
   Starr, a former judge, has used the legal apparatus of subpoena
and plea bargain to compile evidence against Clinton, prompting the
president to respond in kind with his own legal defenses. This has
encouraged the legalistic talk in Congress, and the public hope
that Clinton's fate can be decided in some objective legal manner.
</P>
<P>
   But this hope is forlorn, and in fact damaging. It lulls the
country into a sense that it can avoid the trauma of a drawn-out
political fight.
</P>
<P>
   And, now that the trauma has begun, it fuels the country's
frustration with the president, with Starr, and more generally with
government.
</P>
<P>
   Because Americans have tried to consign the Lewinsky mess to
legal technicians, the scandal seems headed down a path that many
find regrettable. According to the opinion polls, a majority of
voters do not think Clinton should be removed from his job. But,
because congressmen are making a show of being unpolitical, they
are not swayed by this. Instead, they are determined to press on,
to pore through Starr's documents with lawyerly stamina, and
eventually to draw up articles of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   A few Democrats are proposing that the president should be
censured and then pardoned. This would reflect public preferences.
But it would be political, so Republicans do not seem interested.
</P>
<P>
   In many areas of life, Americans cheerfully accept that the law
intrudes too much: they accept the case for tort reform, and they
dislike self-important judges.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to politics, however, Americans depart from this
pattern: they dislike politicians and partisanship even more than
they mistrust lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   But there are times when bare-knuckled politics are inescapable,
and now is one of them. Impeachment, as Alexander Hamilton wrote at
the time of the founding, can ``seldom fail to agitate the passions
of the whole community''; it is bound to ``enlist all their
animosities, partialities, influence and interest''
</P>
<P>
   Ignoring Hamilton's unsettling insight will only make these
passions messier.

`CUPID' TAKES A SHOT AT GENDER WARS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Meet Trevor Hale. He's either the Roman god of love or a
certified head case. Portrayed effectively and affectionately by
Jeremy Piven, still smug but less obnoxious than his ``Ellen''
character, he zips through ``Cupid'' like a freight train in a
hurry.
</P>
<P>
   His rush? The guy's thoroughly convinced that love isn't
something that stops to check off items on an ideal-mate list, that
it will be chemistry _ not compatibility _ that makes a married
twosome go at it on the dinner table 10 years down the road.
</P>
<P>
   This runs comedically and poignantly counter to the 15 years of
study, training and practice of psychiatric/relationship expert
Claire Allen (Paula Marshall), who happens to be stuck with Trevor
since his release from a psychiatric ward.
</P>
<P>
   Claire thinks women ought to wake up from their fairy tales and
not settle for the guy on the white horse _ unless he relaxes with
Mozart, drives a Volvo and wants to raise 3.6 children in the
'burbs, just like you. Compatibility, not chemistry, means
longevity, she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Six months, if you're lucky,'' is Claire's take on biochemical
unions. Then it's back to her theory, ``... negotiation,
compromise, friendship.''
</P>
<P>
   Trevor prefers the kind of in-your-face, fearless technique that
gives this comedy drama its spin. ``Make a move,'' he says to
singles in the hunt. ``Get in the game. Get hurt. Have a beautiful
train wreck.''
</P>
<P>
   I enjoyed this episode of ``Cupid'' (9 p.m. CDT, ABC). It's
witty, romantic, funny, mythical. It positions itself as a voice in
the gender wars that says we ought not to be so tentative,
contrived and psychoanalyzed when it comes to love. Too much mind
kills the heart.
</P>
<P>
   That's Trevor's thing when he busts up Claire's group session in
the opening episode (He calls it a ``pop psychology sensitivity
awareness festival for people shackled by fear''), but maybe we're
getting ahead of ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   The deal with Trevor is that he may or may not be Cupid. His
story is that he was banished from Mount Olympus for losing his
touch. To work his way back, he must take on the guise of a mortal
and match 100 couples without the benefit of magic.
</P>
<P>
   This lands him in the nuthouse, where he eventually convinces
Claire that, yeah, he was psychotic but is now cured. The moment he
walks out the door, he's eyeing souls to match.
</P>
<P>
   Claire finds him more of a professional nuisance than anything
else. ``Fifteen years of training has prepared me to help these
people,'' she says of her group-session participants.
</P>
<P>
   Never caught without a snappy comeback, Trevor unloads: ``And
being the Roman god of love for 3,000 years has prepared me for
what, a desk job at Hallmark?''
</P>
<P>
   Snappy writing is part of ``Cupid's'' charm. Another part will
be watching subplots weave in and out of each episode, dealing with
love lost and found. In the engaging pilot, Trevor uses a plot
device from ``The Way We Were'' to bring a couple together.
</P>
<P>
   Through all this, something appears to be smoldering between
Trevor and Claire. Hmmm. In TV, we call that chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   Also premiering Saturday night:
</P>
<P>
   DE PLANE TRUTH: You'd think the challenge facing ``Fantasy
Island'' (8 p.m. CDT, ABC) is how it can satisfy original fans
while capturing newcomers with its darker, more mystical tone.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps. My take is that executive producer and visionary Barry
Sonnenfeld (''Men in Black'') isn't all that interested in dusting
off former ``Fantasy Islanders'' and plopping them down in front of
the tube.
</P>
<P>
   The show's more engaging devices _ taking two to three stories
per show and playing them out over an hour _ remain, and Sonnenfeld
has added the kind of touches that certainly give it a different
sheen from what you might remember.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike UPN's campy ``Love Boat: The Next Wave,'' ABC is
fashioning the new ``Fantasy Island'' as adult fare with creepy,
wild-eyed Malcolm McDowell as Mr. Roarke. Gone are the white suits;
this Mr. Roarke is all-Armani. In black.
</P>
<P>
   His sidekicks or facilitators helping out with fantasies include
Cal (Louis Lombardi), Harry (Edward Hibbert), and Ariel (Madchen
Amick), who has the chameleonlike talent for becoming anyone she
chooses. It appears that none of them is there of his own free
will.
</P>
<P>
   On the mainland, Fisher (Fyvush Finkel of ``Picket Fences)''
presides as a tour guide who books these often nightmarish jaunts.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night's episode involves three stories, all dealing
with heavier-than-usual life-affirming circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fantasy Island'' wants to be the new ``Twilight Zone.'' Not a
bad goal to reach for.
</P>
<P>
   KUNG-FU FIGHTING: ``Martial Law'' (8 p.m. CDT, CBS) is the
wacky, hilarious drama introducing Hong Kong martial-arts star
Sammo Hung. Here he's Sammy Law, a Shanghai cop who joins the LAPD.
He's fat, fast and funny. The action is completely cartoonish,
often moving in fast-forward. Good for a laugh. But if dialogue is
your thing, read a book.

   People in Israel are getting fairly perplexing bits of news
about missile proliferation in their region.
</P>
<P>
   These usually come from the American government rather than
their own. The biggest shock came in July, when the American
Defense Department detected the test-flight of an Iranian rocket
called the Shahab-3, whose 1,300-kilometer (800-mile) range could
put Israel, and much of Saudi Arabia and Turkey, at risk.
</P>
<P>
   Some, but not much, reassurance was provided by the later news
that the Arrow-2 anti-missile missile, being developed in Israel
with American help, had this month intercepted and destroyed a
computer-simulated target.
</P>
<P>
   For defense experts who are wrestling with the technical
challenge of ``hitting a bullet with a bullet,'' the Arrow's
success offered a ray of hope after a run of disappointments. A
separate, all-American effort to develop an anti-missile shield for
overseas troops and bases -- known as THAAD -- has been dogged by
technical failures.
</P>
<P>
   But even the Arrow's most enthusiastic advocates acknowledge
that it will not provide Israel with an impenetrable shield. And
its success has done nothing to cool the tempers of Israeli
strategists, arguing hotly about the system's price and purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Reuven Pedatzur, an Israeli airman turned political scientist,
reckons that Arrow will cost many times more than its list price of
$1.6 billion, without providing any guarantee against what he says
is the real threat of the next decade: the fact that some of the
missiles within range of Israel will be nuclear-tipped.
</P>
<P>
   He argues that instead of bankrupting itself with faulty
shields, Israel should, if necessary, ward off the nuclear
challenge by making public its own nuclear arsenal -- and its
willingness to use it.
</P>
<P>
   Iran's test flight came as a nasty surprise to both America and
Israel, indicating that the Iranians were at least a year further
forward with developing missiles than hitherto believed.
</P>
<P>
   Curt Weldon, a Republican congressman from Pennsylvania who has
championed the need for anti-missile defenses, believes the
Shahab-3 may already be operational. The previous, cozy assumption
of defense experts that some time must elapse between testing and
deployment no longer holds good.
</P>
<P>
   Weldon also believes that as early as next year, Iran will be
able to test (and presumably soon deploy) another system, the
Shahab-4, with a 2,000-kilometer range that runs deep into Central
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, even for Israelis, the most troubling recent development in
missile proliferation was the news on Aug. 31 that North Korea had
launched a three-stage missile, known as the Taepo Dong, which is
apparently capable of reaching the western fringes of Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   On past experience, whatever rocket technology appears in North
Korea will then spread rapidly to Pakistan and Iran.
</P>
<P>
   There is, of course, no simple correlation between the range of
a country's rockets and the fear it arouses. For instance, the West
is not particularly alarmed, at least for the moment, by the fact
that Saudi Arabia has rockets that can go farther than any other in
the region. Saudi Arabia's missiles were quietly obtained, during
the 1980s, from China -- which, ironically, may have bought the
technology from Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The states whose arsenals keep western and Israeli security
people awake at night are Iran and Iraq. Although Iraq is banned
under UN sanctions from deploying systems with a range of over 150
kilometers, it may have secretly saved a few of its old rockets
from destruction -- and might be able to rebuild a medium-range
missile capacity fairly rapidly once sanctions are lifted.
</P>
<P>
   After lobbying vigorously to stem the flow of Russian technology
to Iran, Israel appears to have accepted that nothing is likely to
stop the Shahab series of missiles from being developed.
</P>
<P>
   But it stresses the point that other countries besides itself
could be in Iran's sights. ``The threat is not only to us, but to
many others in the region,'' said Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel's
prime minister, on Sept. 21.
</P>
<P>
   He might have added that Israel is probably not even
particularly high on Iran's list of concerns. Iran has been
impelled into missile-building by memories of its weakness during
its war with Iraq in the 1980s, when it was unable to retaliate in
kind to the Iraqi missiles that caused panic, and thousands of
civilian deaths, among its urban population.
</P>
<P>
   Its immediate enemy is the Taliban in Afghanistan who have
threatened -- albeit not all that seriously -- to deploy their Scud
missiles against Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Iran's defense minister, Adm. Ali Shamkhani, is
relishing the consternation that the missile test has caused. ``God
willing, this will not be the only time that dedicated and
mobilized workers of our defense industry surprise Israel's defense
machinery,'' he gloated.

SOMETHING WRONG WITH THE LAWS OF GRAVITY?

<TEXT>
<P>
   Out in the far reaches of the solar system, beyond the orbits of
Neptune and Pluto, something strange is going on. Two space probes,
now speeding away into the interstellar void, are not behaving as
they should.
</P>
<P>
   They appear to be experiencing an unexplained extra tug from the
sun -- raising the possibility that there is something amiss with
the laws of gravity.
</P>
<P>
   Physicists are used to predicting spacecraft trajectories with
great accuracy. For the Pioneer 10 and Pioneer 11 probes, launched
toward Jupiter in 1972 and 1973 and now heading away from the sun
in opposite directions, they have done it with the help of a piece
of computer software called the Orbit Determination Program (ODP).
This calculates how the gravitational influence of the sun and the
planets -- suitably tweaked to fit with the general theory of
relativity -- affects each probe's motion.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, by analyzing radio signals from the two
probes, precise measurements of the Pioneers' actual trajectories
can be made. As each craft zooms away from the solar system, the
radio waves it transmits back to earth are slightly stretched out,
causing a change in frequency (known as a Doppler shift) that
depends on the craft's speed relative to the earth.
</P>
<P>
   With enough number-crunching -- taking into account the motion
of the earth around the sun and its wobbles as it spins on its axis
-- the position and acceleration of each Pioneer can then be worked
out.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is that the predicted and measured trajectories do
not match. Instead, there seems to be an additional pull (in
effect, an acceleration) in the direction of the sun that is not
predicted by the ODP. The anomaly is almost imperceptible: about
one ten-billionth of the acceleration due to gravity at the earth's
surface (at that rate, an apple would take a day to drop to the
ground from the branch of a tree). But that is still big enough to
raise questions.
</P>
<P>
   Astronomical discoveries often hinge on the analysis of wobbles,
discrepancies and errors. The existence of Neptune was deduced from
minute deviations between the predicted and observed orbits of
Uranus. An anomaly in the orbit of Mercury provided one of the
first clues that the laws of gravity as described by Newton were
incomplete, which, in turn, led Einstein to general relativity.
</P>
<P>
   So John Anderson, one of the members of the Pioneer 10
navigation team at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena,
California, says he feels a professional responsibility to make his
sums add up. His latest attempts to explain the anomalous
acceleration will be published next month in Physical Review
Letters.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson and his team start by considering all the possible
forces that might be acting on the Pioneer craft but have not been
included in the ODP. Could any of them account for the slight
acceleration towards the sun?
</P>
<P>
   Gas leaks, and the minuscule push provided by infra-red
radiation from the crafts' electricity generators, were ruled out.
Both would be too feeble, and would be unlikely to press in the
sun's direction anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the pressure exerted by sunlight, and the force
exerted by the emissions from each probe's radio antenna, were
dismissed: again, both are too weak, and they would tend to push
the probes away from the sun, not toward it.
</P>
<P>
   Next, the gravitational influence of objects not included in the
ODP was considered. But the forces exerted by objects in the Kuiper
belt (a collection of small bodies orbiting the sun beyond the
orbit of Pluto), or by the galaxy as a whole, were also far too
weak to be responsible.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility that exotic ``dark matter'' could be the culprit
was also ruled out: the researchers found that if the solar system
contained enough dark matter to influence the space probes, it
would have already had a noticeable effect on the orbits of the
planets.
</P>
<P>
   There is also the possibility that the anomaly is somehow
specific to the design of the two Pioneer probes, which are
identical. But analysis of the motion of Ulysses, another space
probe, has shown that it, too, is affected by the mysterious
acceleration.
</P>
<P>
   Could the anomaly stem from a bug in the software used to
predict the probes' trajectories? Apparently not. An independent
analysis of Pioneer 10's trajectory by software used in the
satellite industry produced the same results: the anomaly was still
present.
</P>
<P>
   So perhaps the predicted trajectories are correct after all, but
the flaw lies in the Doppler-ranging method used to measure the
probes' actual trajectories.
</P>
<P>
   Conveniently, more modern spacecraft than the Pioneers include
separate range-finding hardware, which can be used to test the
accuracy of the Doppler method. But when such a comparison was
carried out using the Galileo probe, which is currently orbiting
Jupiter, the two answers matched.
</P>
<P>
   If overlooked forces and man-made errors cannot account for the
anomaly, what is left? As Sherlock Holmes observed: when you have
eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable,
must be the truth. In this case, the improbable conclusion -- given
that the anomalous acceleration is toward the sun -- is that the
laws of gravity need an extra post-Einsteinian tweak.
</P>
<P>
   This could cause serious difficulties. The existing laws of
gravity predict the motions of the planets extremely well, making
it hard to modify them to cater to the errant ways of a couple of
pesky space probes. Anderson and his team considered some of the
proposed modifications to gravity, and found that any adjustment to
explain the anomalous acceleration would conflict with the observed
orbits of the planets.
</P>
<P>
   There is, however, scope for new laws of gravity that affect
light and heavy objects differently, or involve a modification of
the concept of inertia.
</P>
<P>
   After years of investigation, Anderson is not jumping to any
conclusions. The most likely explanation, he says, is an
undiscovered error, rather than a breakdown in the laws of gravity.
</P>
<P>
   But he reckons that there is a small possibility his team has
discovered something important. A mission to Pluto, planned for
2001, could provide vital clues.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the case of the anomalous acceleration remains
unsolved.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Out in the far reaches of the solar system, beyond the orbits of
Neptune and Pluto, something strange is going on. Two space probes,
now speeding away into the interstellar void, are not behaving as
they should.
</P>
<P>
   They appear to be experiencing an unexplained extra tug from the
sun -- raising the possibility that there is something amiss with
the laws of gravity.
</P>
<P>
   Physicists are used to predicting spacecraft trajectories with
great accuracy. For the Pioneer 10 and Pioneer 11 probes, launched
toward Jupiter in 1972 and 1973 and now heading away from the sun
in opposite directions, they have done it with the help of a piece
of computer software called the Orbit Determination Program (ODP).
This calculates how the gravitational influence of the sun and the
planets -- suitably tweaked to fit with the general theory of
relativity -- affects each probe's motion.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, by analyzing radio signals from the two
probes, precise measurements of the Pioneers' actual trajectories
can be made. As each craft zooms away from the solar system, the
radio waves it transmits back to earth are slightly stretched out,
causing a change in frequency (known as a Doppler shift) that
depends on the craft's speed relative to the earth.
</P>
<P>
   With enough number-crunching -- taking into account the motion
of the earth around the sun and its wobbles as it spins on its axis
-- the position and acceleration of each Pioneer can then be worked
out.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is that the predicted and measured trajectories do
not match. Instead, there seems to be an additional pull (in
effect, an acceleration) in the direction of the sun that is not
predicted by the ODP. The anomaly is almost imperceptible: about
one ten-billionth of the acceleration due to gravity at the earth's
surface (at that rate, an apple would take a day to drop to the
ground from the branch of a tree). But that is still big enough to
raise questions.
</P>
<P>
   Astronomical discoveries often hinge on the analysis of wobbles,
discrepancies and errors. The existence of Neptune was deduced from
minute deviations between the predicted and observed orbits of
Uranus. An anomaly in the orbit of Mercury provided one of the
first clues that the laws of gravity as described by Newton were
incomplete, which, in turn, led Einstein to general relativity.
</P>
<P>
   So John Anderson, one of the members of the Pioneer 10
navigation team at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena,
California, says he feels a professional responsibility to make his
sums add up. His latest attempts to explain the anomalous
acceleration will be published next month in Physical Review
Letters.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson and his team start by considering all the possible
forces that might be acting on the Pioneer craft but have not been
included in the ODP. Could any of them account for the slight
acceleration towards the sun?
</P>
<P>
   Gas leaks, and the minuscule push provided by infra-red
radiation from the crafts' electricity generators, were ruled out.
Both would be too feeble, and would be unlikely to press in the
sun's direction anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the pressure exerted by sunlight, and the force
exerted by the emissions from each probe's radio antenna, were
dismissed: again, both are too weak, and they would tend to push
the probes away from the sun, not toward it.
</P>
<P>
   Next, the gravitational influence of objects not included in the
ODP was considered. But the forces exerted by objects in the Kuiper
belt (a collection of small bodies orbiting the sun beyond the
orbit of Pluto), or by the galaxy as a whole, were also far too
weak to be responsible.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility that exotic ``dark matter'' could be the culprit
was also ruled out: the researchers found that if the solar system
contained enough dark matter to influence the space probes, it
would have already had a noticeable effect on the orbits of the
planets.
</P>
<P>
   There is also the possibility that the anomaly is somehow
specific to the design of the two Pioneer probes, which are
identical. But analysis of the motion of Ulysses, another space
probe, has shown that it, too, is affected by the mysterious
acceleration.
</P>
<P>
   Could the anomaly stem from a bug in the software used to
predict the probes' trajectories? Apparently not. An independent
analysis of Pioneer 10's trajectory by software used in the
satellite industry produced the same results: the anomaly was still
present.
</P>
<P>
   So perhaps the predicted trajectories are correct after all, but
the flaw lies in the Doppler-ranging method used to measure the
probes' actual trajectories.
</P>
<P>
   Conveniently, more modern spacecraft than the Pioneers include
separate range-finding hardware, which can be used to test the
accuracy of the Doppler method. But when such a comparison was
carried out using the Galileo probe, which is currently orbiting
Jupiter, the two answers matched.
</P>
<P>
   If overlooked forces and man-made errors cannot account for the
anomaly, what is left? As Sherlock Holmes observed: when you have
eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable,
must be the truth. In this case, the improbable conclusion -- given
that the anomalous acceleration is toward the sun -- is that the
laws of gravity need an extra post-Einsteinian tweak.
</P>
<P>
   This could cause serious difficulties. The existing laws of
gravity predict the motions of the planets extremely well, making
it hard to modify them to cater to the errant ways of a couple of
pesky space probes. Anderson and his team considered some of the
proposed modifications to gravity, and found that any adjustment to
explain the anomalous acceleration would conflict with the observed
orbits of the planets.
</P>
<P>
   There is, however, scope for new laws of gravity that affect
light and heavy objects differently, or involve a modification of
the concept of inertia.
</P>
<P>
   After years of investigation, Anderson is not jumping to any
conclusions. The most likely explanation, he says, is an
undiscovered error, rather than a breakdown in the laws of gravity.
</P>
<P>
   But he reckons that there is a small possibility his team has
discovered something important. A mission to Pluto, planned for
2001, could provide vital clues.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the case of the anomalous acceleration remains
unsolved.

   BEAUVOIR-PHILOSOPHY (Undated) _ ``I don't consider myself a
philosopher,'' Simone de Beauvoir wrote in the second volume of her
autobiography. For decades, most philosophers have agreed with her.
But now, fueled by the discovery of previously unpublished diaries
and correspondence, a growing group of philosophers and Beauvoir
scholars declare that she deserves the rarefied title of
philosopher herself. Some even argue that she was the prime
influence on Jean-Paul Sartre. In the process, they are helping to
reverse the slide Beauvoir's reputation took a decade ago after
some of the less-than-noble details of her relationship with Sartre
were published. By Patricia Cohen. (1700 words)

But now, fueled by the discovery of previously unpublished diaries
and correspondence, a growing group of philosophers and Beauvoir
scholars declare that she deserves the rarefied title of
philosopher herself. Some even argue that she was the prime
influence on Jean-Paul Sartre. In the process, they are helping to
reverse the slide Beauvoir's reputation took a decade ago after
some of the less-than-noble details of her relationship with Sartre
were published. By Patricia Cohen. (1700 words)

ZOINKS! YOU CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT REALLY WENT ON IN THE MYSTERY
MACHINE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ERIC CELESTE 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If Kenneth Starr were interrogating Scooby-Doo, he might ask the
following question:
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Doo, why is it that now, some 29 years after your network
debut, you and Shaggy and the whole gang are still so incredibly
HOT?'' Is it because you are, and always have been, shall we say,
BAKED?''
</P>
<P>
   For decades, since its 1969 introduction, people have been
trying to figure out why Scooby-Doo is so popular _ Mike Myers is
penning a live-action Scooby movie _ as well as trying to decipher
the show's socio/sexual/political leanings. (Witness the online
``Scooby-Doo for president'' party, the Scoobapublicans.)
</P>
<P>
   Kids may think it's just a show about a goofy Great Dane who
can't pronounce his W's. But adults who grew up watching Scooby now
know better. It has long been argued that Scooby-Doo contains
subtext encompassing hippiedom, drug use and various other
influences from the late '60s, early '70s.
</P>
<P>
   With the release this week of a new made-for-video movie,
``Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island'' ($19.96, Warner Home Video), we'll
take the opportunity to debunk some common misconceptions and air
our theories as to what Scooby, Shaggy, Fred, Daphne and Velma were
REALLY up to while tooling around in the Mystery Machine.
</P>
<P>
   Misconception: Scooby-Doo is popular because he's so lovable. As
Don Messick, the original voice of Scooby, once said, ``I think
it's because he embraces a lot of human foibles. He's not the
perfect dog. In fact, you might say he's a coward. Yet with
everything he does, he seems to land on his four feet.''
</P>
<P>
   Our theory: We are lemmings. We love familiarity, and every
Scooby-Doo episode is the same. Ghost/monster scares locals,
Mystery Machine happens upon town, crew is told of local
ghost/monster, Shaggy and Scooby freak, the gang investigates,
shenanigans ensue, ghost/monster is unmasked and turned over to
local authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, Shaggy says, ``Zoinks,'' Scooby laughs his
hee-hee-hee laugh, Velma loses her glasses and says, ``Jinkies,''
Daphne says, ``Jeepers,'' Fred asks Shaggy and Scooby if they'll
undertake some ridiculous scheme ``for a Scooby Snack.'' Every once
in a while, Dick Van Dyke or Tim Conway or some other '70s star
shows up.
</P>
<P>
   Misconception: Scooby and Shaggy are all about drug use. The
Scooby Snack recipe from the Scooby Web `O' Rama
(web.paticafe.by.net/TelevisionCity/1145) lends support to this: 2
cups flour, 1 cup dry oatmeal, 1/2 cup cocoa, 1/2 cup sugar, 1
stick butter, 2 eggs, 1 tablespoon vanilla, 1 teaspoon walnut
extract. Optional: 1 ounce of finely ground herbal medicine.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Combine all ingredients in large
mixing bowl. Stir five minutes, add milk to aid mixing if needed.
Place on lightly greased cookie sheet and bake for 10 to 12
minutes, depending on how large you made your cookies.
</P>
<P>
   Our theory: The whole gang suffers reefer madness. They hang out
in the Mystery Machine; they say ``groovy''; they see ghosts and
talk to dogs, fer cryin' out loud.
</P>
<P>
   Misconception: Velma _ the frumpish nerd with the unisex haircut
_ is a lesbian. Consider what she said after her comely sidekick
Daphne delayed the mystery-solving process by having her picture
taken: ``Women! Wait a minute. What am I saying? I'm a woman!''
</P>
<P>
   Our theory: When you're right, you're right.
</P>
<P>
   Misconception: Fred and Daphne are secret lovers. According to
Stephanie, a 13-year-old who runs Steph's Groovy Scooby Site
(members.tripod.com/(TILDE)scoobz/pages/main.html) from her home in
Vancouver, British Columbia: ``Daphne and Fred were in love. You
could see it in their eyes. They were always flirting around.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, note the work of well-known Internet Scoobicians Mark
Dorr, Tim Solley and Chad Holder, whose seminal Scooby-Doo essay
argues that, taken separately, the Scooby-Doo gang ``each portrays
a certain degree of disillusionment found in all of us
(Gen-Xers).'' The esteemed troika argue that ``Fred's orange
`neckerchief' made him appear as though he was the consummate gay
male. In actuality, it was his secret weapon for hooking up with
Daphne.''
</P>
<P>
   Our theory: Fred was gay, while Daphne and Shaggy were secretly
in love.

MARKET FOR CHIPS BELONGS TO BUYER 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Competition is a wonderful thing, and nowhere is that more
evident than in the personal computer business. It's brought PC
users breathtaking innovation and power at ever-lower prices.
</P>
<P>
   Competition is particularly strong in the microprocessor market.
If you're interested in buying a new computer that uses Microsoft's
Windows 98 or NT as its operating system, you've got an excellent
selection of chips from which to choose.
</P>
<P>
   Intel Corp. is the market leader. Its competitors develop
powerful processors that undercut Intel's prices in an attempt to
steal some market share. Intel, in turn, has responded by slashing
the prices on its products and producing others that compete
directly in the low end of the chip market.
</P>
<P>
   You, the PC buyer, are the delighted beneficiary. Here's a look
at today's processor landscape:
</P>
<P>
   _ Pentium MMX: Adios, mi amigo! This Intel chip is a case study
in computer-industry obsolescence. Just 18 months ago, this was the
second coming of the Pentium processor. Today, it's yesterday's
news.
</P>
<P>
   Pentium MMX processors are found in some portable computers
running at a maximum 266 megahertz, and in the sub-$1,000 desktop
market with maximum clock speeds of 233 megahertz. They are
perfectly capable of running most software available today, and are
an excellent choice if all you do is word processing, connect to
the Internet and juggle the family finances on your PC. They also
handle most children's educational programs with ease.
</P>
<P>
   But the next generation of high-end games and graphics software
coming in 1999 will bog these chips down. If you're a serious
gamer, or want to manipulate images on a PC, you'll want something
more powerful.
</P>
<P>
   _ Pentium II: This is the Intel's current, state-of-the-art
processor, and a compelling choice if you've got the cash. The
newest versions of the chip run at a top speed of 450 megahertz.
</P>
<P>
   This is the chip of choice for power users, hard-core gamers and
those who want to be as far ahead of the curve as possible. It's
got the MMX instruction set _ extra code to help with audio and
video _ and a 512-kilobyte cache, a buffer that helps speed data
into and out of the chip.
</P>
<P>
   But the Pentium II will undergo a major change early next year.
A new version of the chip, code-named Katmai, will debut in the
first quarter of 1999. With initial speeds of 450 and 500
megahertz, it will include code that will help improve 3D graphics,
but only if software developers write programs to take advantage of
it.
</P>
<P>
   Also coming next year in the Pentium II family _ chips at speeds
of 600 megahertz and beyond, with larger built-in caches and
increased system board speeds. Current Pentium IIs are plugged into
system boards that send data from other devices to the main
processor at 100 megaherz _ a boost from earlier boards that worked
at 66 megahertz. Sometime in 1999 you'll see system boards that run
at 133.
</P>
<P>
   _ Celeron: These chips got a bad rap when they initially were
offered by Intel, and deservedly so. They lacked a built-in cache,
making them pitifully slow.
</P>
<P>
   But the latest versions, which run at 300 and 333 megahertz, now
have a 128-kilobyte cache. There are other improvements that result
in excellent performance. In fact, this may be one of the best
processor bargains out there.
</P>
<P>
   You'll find these newer Celeron chips in systems in the $1,000
price range, making these great machines for gamers on a budget.
The new Celerons handle power-hungry games like Unreal and Quake II
with ease.
</P>
<P>
   Look for Celeron chips to accelerate to 366, then 400 megahertz
next year.
</P>
<P>
   _ AMD K6/K6-2: The K6 chip is Advanced Micro Devices' answer to
the Pentium MMX from Intel, and the K6-2 is a newer version that
addresses some of the shortcomings of the K6 design in an
interesting way.
</P>
<P>
   The K6 is not as good as Intel's chips at handling
floating-point math calculations, which are used in some 3-D games
and applications. But AMD has jumped ahead of Intel by including a
set of 3-D instructions called 3D Now! _ similar in concept to
Intel's Katmai product _ that developers can exploit. AMD is now
trying to get software programmers, and particularly those who make
3-D games, to take advantage of 3D Now!
</P>
<P>
   To show the possibilities, AMD worked with id Software to create
a special version of Quake II that uses the 3D Now! features. Tests
with this version show that, depending on other variables, the K6-2
chip can outperform some Pentium II systems when 3D Now! is
invoked.
</P>
<P>
   The K6-2 is found in systems that are priced equal to or
slightly less than those that use Celeron or Pentium MMX chips,
making it another good bargain, particularly for gamers. However,
with speeds of up to 350 megahertz and faster versions on the way,
it's also an excellent chip for general computing.
</P>
<P>
   _ MediaGX/MII: Cyrix, now owned by National Semiconductor, has
been selling for some time a chip called the MedixGX. It's
equivalent to the Pentium MMX, and it's found in many sub-$1,000
and even sub-$500 systems. However, I can't recommend this chip.
</P>
<P>
   The MediaGX steals two megabytes from the system's random access
memory for use as video memory. That means if you buy a low-end
system that comes with only 16 megabytes of RAM, you actually are
only able to use 14 megabytes.
</P>
<P>
   Given that you can spend a couple hundred dollars more and get a
system that doesn't play cheap tricks with memory, it's best to
stay away from PCs that use this chip.
</P>
<P>
   The MII, however, is another story. It's essentially a beefed-up
version of Cyrix's 6x86 chip that runs at speeds of up to 333
megahertz, with 350 megahertz models on the way. Cyrix has priced
it to be competitive with Celeron and K6 processors, so you're most
apt to find it in sub-$1,000 systems.
</P>
<P>
   While I haven't tried a system that uses this chip, the reviews
of it look good.
</P>

CLOSE PROGRAM BOX GIVES PC USER CONTROL WHEN MACHINE MESSES UP 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: In Windows 95, when one enters Control-Alt-Delete on the
keyboard, a window called ``Close Program'' comes up. Can you
kindly tell me what exactly is contained in this window? I have not
been able to find any detailed explanation in any of the Windows 95
books that I have. Are these programs that have been loaded into
memory? Are they running (there's no evidence of this in some
cases)? Are they in RAM but dormant?
</P>
<P>
   A: That window does indeed show the programs that currently are
running in your system's memory. But, don't be surprised if you
aren't familiar with all of them.
</P>
<P>
   In the pre-Windows 95/NT days, doing a Control-Alt-Delete (also
known among the grizzled, old compu-guard as the ``three-fingered
salute'') was used to reboot your system. Now, it gives you access
to the programs running on your system, and in Windows NT it's also
used to log on to a computer.
</P>
<P>
   From the Close Program dialog box you can, of course, close any
of the programs you see there. Just click on the one you want to go
away and click the End Task button. You also can shut the entire
computer down from here.
</P>
<P>
   The real purpose of it arises when a program misbehaves.
Sometimes, a Windows 95/98 program will just stop working, while
the rest of your PC hums merrily along. If you bring up the Close
Program box, you'll likely see the words ``Not responding'' next to
the name of the program. Your best bet is to close that program
using the End Task button.
</P>
<P>
   You may get a secondary window that pops up asking whether you
want to wait a bit longer, or just kill the program.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the things you see listed in the Close Program dialog
box may not be familiar to you. They are programs running in the
background, or components of Windows itself. For example, one of
them is SYSTRAY. This stands for System Tray _ the area on the far
right of the Windows taskbar that contains the clock, the speaker
icon and possibly other icons.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a Logitech mouse, one of the items will be
``emexec'' _ this is the program that controls some of the mouse's
special features, such as a wheel or a third mouse button.
</P>
<P>
   One of the items also will be Explorer. Some people will
occasionally use End Task on the Explorer if the Windows desktop
starts behaving oddly.
</P>
<P>
   When you do this, however, any program icons that normally
appear in the tray will disappear. That means you'll have to
restart them in order to regain access to their capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I just upgraded to Windows 98 from Windows 95, and I like it
pretty much. However, for some reason Windows 98 dropped a Network
Neighborhood icon on my desktop. I don't have a network connection
_ just a dialup connection to the Internet. I can't delete the icon
by dragging it to the Recycle Bin; Windows won't let me. I've
discovered TweakUI from your column and tried to use it, but I get
a warning that there may be problems if I delete it. What should I
do?
</P>
<P>
   A: Go ahead and let TweakUI remove the Network Neighborhood icon
from your desktop. I've never had a problem using TweakUI in this
way.
</P>
<P>
   One precaution, though: Check and record your dialup networking
settings before you do this. Look in the Network module in the
Control Panel, as well as the Connection/Settings area in the
Dialup Networking folder.
</P>
<P>
   After you've removed Network Neighborhood, sign on to your
Internet service provider and make sure everything works. If not,
go back and reset your original settings.

HUDSON COUNTRY ESTATES OFFER A GLIMPSE AT THE RIVER'S RICH
HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Sept. 27)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By FRANCES INGRAHAM  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   RENSSELAER, N.Y. _ The sun dances like diamonds as one looks
from the east side of the Hudson River. The reflections are so
brilliant that on a sunny day sunglasses are a must, especially for
the drive beginning on Route 9J out of Rensselaer to points south
in Columbia and Dutchess counties.
</P>
<P>
   One of the grander, private mansions along the way is Callendar
House in Clermont, between Tivoli and Barrytown, which was built on
a bluff overlooking the river in 1794 by Henry Livingston. The
house has a Federal-style core, with one-story wings added in 1828.
The veranda across the west front dates from around 1830. In 1860,
the house was purchased by American Express founder Johnston R.
Livingston, and his heirs lived there until the 1970s. As a result
this privately owned house remains very much the same as when it
was built.
</P>
<P>
   The present owners have appointed the house with French
antiquities recalling the Livingston family's love of France.
</P>
<P>
   Callendar House is one of the many mansions built between the
late 1700s to the early 1900s that dot the landscape along the
Hudson River from Albany to as far south as Yonkers. In between
these massive groomed luxe residences are stately, yet smaller
privately owned mansions that are situated in parklike settings,
many of which are marked only by pillared drives and ``keep out
private drive'' signs.
</P>
<P>
   Driving down along the river, one can't help but sense the
majesty and grandeur of this early era of great wealth that built
so many family country seats.
</P>
<P>
   Although many of these estates are hidden from the road, they
are still visible from the river, or at least sections of the house
and groomed acreage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Much of the riverfront was cleared for farming and for the
views,'' said Ruth Piwonka of Kinderhook, who is a regional
historian. ``There are beautiful views going east over the Kingston
Rhinecliff Bridge. You don't see many landmark houses, as they are
obscured by trees and shrubs that have grown up over the centuries,
but you do see a groomed patchwork quilt of tilled fields. It's
very impressive.''
</P>
<P>
   The land on the east side of the Hudson River undulates in low,
rolling hills with excellent soil for growing crops and grazing
animals. The east side of the river also offered better access to
the river than the west side. It's also the side of the river that
the railroad first went through in 1851, creating a new and faster
mode of transportation to and from Manhattan, especially in the
winter when the river froze.
</P>
<P>
   The railroad may have been a convenience, but it often cut the
estates off from the river, as well as river access to the general
public.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the low elevation of Washington Irving's home,
Sunnyside, the tracks almost came through his living room,'' said
Winthrop Aldrich, deputy commissioner for historic preservation for
the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic
Preservation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Irving sued, but the railroad had eminent domain. Some
landowners were paid for what they lost.''
</P>
<P>
   These country estates, many of which evolved from Dutch land
grants, were built along the river in areas that were originally
settled along the estuaries and tributary streams by Native
Americans. The Dutch were the first to colonize the east side of
the valley in the 17th century after Henry Hudson's exploration.
</P>
<P>
   With the area rich in timber, fur trapping and natural
resources, the Dutch West India Company established a system that
flourished in Holland since the Middle Ages, that of the feudal
manor.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the Hudson River was settled by the late 17th and early
18th centuries with humble farmhouses. Merchant landowners were
soon constructing grander dwellings.
</P>
<P>
   The first patroon to invest in this New World manor was
Amsterdam diamond merchant Kiliaen Van Rensselaer, who purchased
the acreage in the mid-1600s that makes up today's area of Albany
and Rensselaer counties.
</P>
<P>
   Following the first patroon's lead, 18 other manors were created
by the English between 1664 and 1715 that at one time consumed huge
tracts of land. Among them were Livingston Manor (160,000 acres to
eventually close to 1 million acres) in Columbia County;
Philipsburg Manor (originally comprised of 52,000 acres) in the
Village of Sleepy Hollow, Westchester County; Van Cortlandt Manor
(originally 86,000 acres) in Croton-On-Hudson, Westchester County;
Van Rensselaer Manor (700,000 acres), just north of Albany and
Beverwyck Manor, in North Greenbush.
</P>
<P>
   Aldrich lives at Rokeby in Barrytown, the riverfront estate his
family has held title to for 11 generations.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were about 400 of these grand estates along the Hudson
River,'' Aldrich said. ``Today, less than half survive. I find that
people who are moving here to buy these homes, when they become
available, do so because they are interested in American history,
enjoy older houses, want to be on the river for the view and are in
many cases trying to create a world for themselves and their future
generations, just as the Livingstons did.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very few people buy these grand homes on speculation,''
Aldrich said. ``The ideal is to put down roots and keep a home for
generations. It's a marriage where you have to work at the upkeep,
but these dwellings repay it time and time again. It's not a
turnkey operation.''
</P>
<P>
   However, in the 20th century many of these properties have been
subdivided.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1940s, Edgewater _ another estate in Barrytown _ and a
small amount of acreage was split off from it's original tract.
Author Gore Vidal owned it for almost 20 years, before selling it
to financier Richard Jenrette in 1969, who has since restored the
house while making aesthetic additions.
</P>
<P>
   Architectural styles flourished along the Hudson River Valley,
as many of the estates were designed by the most distinguished
architects of their time. Most notable were Alexander Jackson Davis
and Andrew Jackson Downing. Other architects and landscape
designers to leave their mark were Richard Morris Hunt, Calvert
Vaux, Richard Upjohn and Frederick Law Olmsted, and McKim, Mead and
White.
</P>
<P>
   The largest concentration of estates, which remain largely
intact, lies along the east bank of the river between Poughkeepsie
and Hudson. It was designated as the Hudson River National Historic
Landmark District in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   This district features 40 rural mansions that were established
between 1790 and 1940 on land grants made to the Livingstons,
Schuylers and Beekmans in the late 17th and early 18th centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Within the historic district, there are nine sites that are open
to the public. They include:
</P>
<P>
   _ Clermont, the oldest of the mid-Hudson estates, built by
Chancellor Robert Livingston in Germantown.
</P>
<P>
   _ Montgomery Place, an Alexander Davis design in
Annandale-On-Hudson.
</P>
<P>
   _ Locust Grove, in Poughkeepsie, another Davis design built for
painter and inventor of the telegraph, Samuel F. Morse.
</P>
<P>
   _ Wilderstein, in Poughkeepsie, an imposing late-19th century
frame country home in Rhinebeck.
</P>
<P>
   _ Olana, in Hudson, the home and studio of Hudson River School
artist Frederick Church.
</P>
<P>
   _ Mills Mansion in Staatsburgh, a superb neoclassical,
Beaux-Arts mansion in Hyde Park by McKim, Mead &AMP; White.
</P>
<P>
   _ Vanderbilt Mansion, built in the early 1830s at a cost of $3
million.
</P>
<P>
   _ Springwood, the home of Franklin D. Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   _ Val-Kill, the private country retreat of Eleanor Roosevelt and
the FDR Library &AMP; Museum.
</P>
<P>
   After the great stock market crash of 1929 and later, World War
II, construction of huge estates nearly ceased along the Hudson. In
the years to follow, many of these grand homes would fall into
disrepair, be subdivided or demolished. Several were turned into
educational or charitable institutions or broken up into apartments
or condominiums.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, there was a renewed interest in these residential
guardians of the river. Many have been renovated and converted back
into picturesque country homes or donated to the state.

MUSIC INDUSTRY HEARS FOOTSTEPS OF A REVOLUTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID BLOOM  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A week before their 30th wedding anniversary, a
man decides to give his wife a personalized collection of the songs
they listened to when they first met. With a few clicks on a Web
site, he compiles a custom CD, picks the song order, titles and
decorates the disc, and pays for it. By the time of the celebration
they're dancing to the CD.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, the world's greatest bar band rolls into town. The
nightclub's sound man plugs a cable into the mixing board, sending
a live feed from the concert onto the Internet, giving anyone with
a computer and a connection a prime seat as the band sizzles
through three sets.
</P>
<P>
   After the show, band members tell newly converted fans their Web
site address. At the site, the faithful can check tour dates, buy
the band's music and T-shirts, listen to live recordings, and hook
up with other like-minded listeners.
</P>
<P>
   While the talk has been about television and the computer,the
Internet and the digital revolution behind it are turning the music
world on its ear. Internet ``radio'' services, for instance, offer
genres of music never heard on a broadcast station, while other
sites feature jam sessions and live concerts, broader visibility
for unsigned bands or the chance to rediscover long-out-of-print
music by better-known artists.
</P>
<P>
   But for every new winner in a revolution, there's an old loser.
Record company and retail store executives are worried about losing
money to online competitors and to piracy as note-perfect illegal
copies can be shipped in a heartbeat around the world.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, they reason, there's nothing stopping them
from cashing in _ if they can just figure out how.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not going to happen by itself, but musicians have to
realize we're in a digital age,'' said Wendy Hafner, Intel Corp.'s
director of music marketing. ``One hundred million PCs will be
shipped this year all over the world. It's a huge, huge opportunity
for the music business to take advantage of.''
</P>
<P>
   NEED FOR SPEED: The explosion in Internet music the past year
has been driven by a series of improvements in technology: faster
Internet connections, better compression programs and players,
higher-quality computer sound cards and speakers. The result is
sound quality at least as good as FM radio and approaching that of
CDs, with access to a dizzying variety of music.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things I enjoy about working in this field is how
quickly things have progressed,'' said Nicholas Wild, director of
technology at the House of Blues new media division, which Netcasts
three live concerts and up to 10 album ``listening'' parties every
week. ``When I started first using the Net, I was downloading text.
Now you see video getting integrated into Web sites.''
</P>
<P>
   To keep ahead of the changes, the House of Blues is installing
full digital production studios at all six of its clubs so it can
easily create broadcast-quality concert videos anywhere, Wild said.
For all its quick adoption of technology, it still may not be able
to keep pace with all the changes, company executives say.
</P>
<P>
   On Web &UR;  &LR; sites like MusicMaker.com, a visitor can page through
more than 100,000 legally licensed tracks by a wide range of
artists, pick out favorites and have the Internet company create a
made-to-order CD.
</P>
<P>
   Other sites will sell a legal, digital copy of music that will
play on their computer using technology such as Liquid Audio or A2B
that encrypt the music so it can't be duplicated. And if they have
a recordable CD drive, they can even create their own custom CDs
with the music.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an opportunity to re-create some of the magic of the
1950s, when you had a hit single and could break a record in a
region,'' said David Kessel, a musician and CEO of the Internet
Underground Music Archive, whose Web site features music by and
information on unsigned bands.
</P>
<P>
   A BOOST FOR RADIO: ``Radio'' has blossomed on the Internet, too,
including Net-only music programmers _ such as Spinner.com in
Burlingame _ that don't even broadcast over the airwaves.
</P>
<P>
   Spinner, for instance, slices more than 100,000 tracks of music
into 104 genres, including many that just can't be found in
American broadcast radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not going to go to any market in this country and get a
Delta blues format, or a Celtic format, or an all-Baroque format,''
said Scott Epstein, Spinner's vice president for marketing and
content.
</P>
<P>
   Epstein said the Internet has fast become &UR;  &LR; a home for music for
three simple reasons: ``control, variety and simplicity.'' For the
first time, music fans can easily decide when they want to listen
to their favorite kinds of music.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forget having four or five rock stations in a market,'' said
music consultant Ted Cohen. ``You're going to have hundreds or
thousands of choices.''
</P>
<P>
   And even more musical choices will abound when record labels
start putting their massive back catalogs of out-of-print music
into digital format and make it available for purchase online,
Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   Such an approach solves the industry's unwillingness to print
CDs of old music, only to have it gather dust on warehouse shelves,
while allowing fans to custom create CDs of their own design, Cohen
said.
</P>
<P>
   THERE'S SOME DISCONTENT: Music industry leaders acknowledge
digital music's many possibilities, but cite some deep concerns in
the next breath.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're excited about the technology,'' said Michael Greene,
president of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences.
``Fifty thousand albums are released a year. We know there's a lot
of great music out there that consumers can't get to. The next
three to four years provides amazing opportunities for individual
labels and groups that radio has ignored.''
</P>
<P>
   Sites like Kessel's IUMA, Scour.net and the Ultimate Band List
already provide fans with ready access to thousands of bands whose
music they otherwise might never hear.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to allow people more information about every single
piece of music product they can get their hands on,'' said Tom
Roli, publisher of the online magazine WebNoize, which will sponsor
a three-day seminar on digital music in Universal City in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an opportunity for a rebirth of the music industry,''
Roli said. ``It's the best thing for everybody, demand programming.
What you want when you want it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Greene and others in the record business fret over piracy _
illegal, high-quality copies of music that can be easily duplicated
and distributed through the multiplicative magic of a wired world.
</P>
<P>
   ``From an intellectual property perspective, all of our
traditional concerns are multiplied by a thousand on the
cyberfrontier,'' Greene said. ``As (Electronic Frontier Foundation
co-founder) John Perry Barlow put it, we are used to protecting not
the wine, but the bottle it comes in. So what happens now that we
are selling wine with no bottles?''
</P>
<P>
   PIRATES AHEAD: People like Greene are afraid of people like
Chris Ward of Valencia, a Northwestern University student and big
fan of the MP-3 computer audio format, which creates a
high-quality, highly compressed file that can be easily stored or
transferred over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   College students in particular use freely available software to
encode a standard CD song into the MP-3 format on their computers.
Hundreds of sites have copies of illegal MP-3s available for
downloading, which takes seconds on a college campus' high-speed
Internet connection.
</P>
<P>
   Ward paid for none of the 50 MP-3 songs on his computer, but
says he wouldn't have bothered to buy most of them otherwise. He
did find MP-3s of a new favorite band, Guster, that in turn led him
to buy a CD of the band he didn't already have.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing I like is you can decide you like a song, spend
maybe 10 minutes on the Web looking for it and if you can find it,
great. If not, OK,'' Ward said.
</P>
<P>
   To stamp out access to illegal MP-3s, the Recording Industry
Association of America (RIAA) uses automated software that snoops
through the Internet looking for sites offering hundreds of illegal
songs each, said Brandy Thomas, whose Virginia company, Online
Monitoring Services, does the cyber-sleuthing for the RIAA, the
Association of Songwriters, Composers, Artists and Publishers
(ASCAP) and other large entertainment organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Once found, large sites' owners face legal action and shutdown,
Thomas said. Those threats have driven most of the big pirate sites
underground.
</P>
<P>
   ASCAP, which represents about half of all music publishers and
songwriters, is more concerned about getting sites to pay license
fees than stop using music, Thomas said. His company's software
will issue licenses to Web sites using ASCAP-owned music, and set
up a billing process.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, Thomas said, it helps ensure people in the music
business still have a business.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's our main concern, retention of all rights,'' said
producer Jeffrey Weber, co-owner of a small Beverly Hills label,
Weberworks. ``We spend a lot of money making music. We don't want
people getting it for free.''
</P>
<P>
   MARKETING BONANZA: At the same time, many bands are giving music
away on the Internet, or at least samples of it. That makes it
easier to get noticed, though it doesn't guarantee success, some in
the business point out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're reducing the barriers of entry, but once you're in, it's
the equivalent to being the opening slot of a 10-band bill,'' said
Cohen. ``If you just hang your shingle up and say, `Hi, I'm here,'
it's the equivalent of playing in a parking lot in the middle of
Nebraska.''
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Stonefield of Global Music Outlet, a Culver City company
that sells music online, said getting known is still a challenge,
but ``the Internet is like a living color brochure for a band.''
</P>
<P>
   Even some notable musicians and bands are using the Net to
promote their music or reward loyal fans. Beastie Boys, Hole, Live,
Massive Attack, and Jesus and Mary Chain have given away tracks in
recent months through the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   And Frank Black, a former member of the Pixies, is selling his
entire new album, ``Frank Black and the Catholics,'' on the
Internet through Goodnoise, a new Palo Alto-based label dedicated
to selling music in digital form.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's giving people instant access to what they want,'' Cohen
said. ``We've been at the mercy of whoever's programming our life.
The whole thing is to turn people on to music. I don't know of
anything else that's come along that could do that.''

TV GETS SERIOUS ON SATURDAY NIGHT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEITH MARDER 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Saturdays have become no laughing matter.
</P>
<P>
   Four networks, 12 hours of programming and not a sitcom in the
bunch.
</P>
<P>
   ABC adds ``Fantasy Island'' and ``Cupid'' to an hour of
``America's Funniest Home Videos.'' CBS slides ``Martial Law''
between ``Early Edition'' and ``Walker, Texas Ranger.'' NBC leads
off its night with ``Wind on Water,'' which premieres in October,
followed by ``The Pretender'' and ``Profiler.'' As for Fox, it will
stand pat with ``Cops,'' more ``Cops'' and ``America's Most Wanted:
America Fights Back.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
FANTASY ISLAND &QC;
</P>
<P>
   This is the darker, more sinister Malcolm McDowell-as-Mr.-Roarke
remake of the '70s hit ``Fantasy Island.'' And the show wastes no
time establishing the differences between the two versions.
</P>
<P>
   Roarke rummages through his closet, which has an endless supply
of identical white suits. He eventually settles on the one black
ensemble in the lot.
</P>
<P>
   That's what happens when Aaron Spelling, master of light
entertainment, is replaced as executive producer by Barry
Sonnenfeld, director of ``Men in Black.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with the suits, the Tattoo character is also replaced. The
new resort staff includes bell-ringing ox Cal (Louis Lombardi),
Cal's partner Harry (Edward Hibbert) and Roarke's beautiful
assistant Ariel (Madchen Amick).
</P>
<P>
   In the pilot episode, the trip to the island was sandwiched
between two wonderful scenes in a dreary travel agency. People
happen upon Fisher (played by the wonderful Fyvush Finkel of
``Picket Fences''). He knows what their fantasy is, and soon enough
they are booked on a trip to Fantasy Island. The final scene of the
show was ``Bill Clinton'' entering the agency. The show ends before
we find out what his fantasy is, but I'd imagine you have a pretty
good idea.
</P>
<P>
   The moral of each story is still the same: ``Be careful what you
wish for'' and ``appreciate what you have.'' And the rule stands _
no one is ever allowed to know about your experiences on the
island.
</P>
<P>
   The show mixes action, morality and humor rather nicely. Filmed
in Hawaii, this is a visually appealing program, and there are
above-average special effects. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
CUPID &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Cupid (Jeremy Piven) is in Chicago, and boy does he have a lot
of work to do. He's shooting for 100 lasting romances (sans bow and
arrow) or he'll never be let back onto Mount Olympus.
</P>
<P>
   That is, if he is Cupid at all.
</P>
<P>
   He may just be Trevor Hale, a delusional mental patient who
thinks he is Cupid. His psychiatrist _ relationship expert Dr.
Claire Allen (Paula Marshall) _ doesn't want to hear any of this
Cupid garbage.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting battle between science (years of medical training)
and romance (3,000 years as the Roman god of love) is an
interesting, different and certainly entertaining series.
</P>
<P>
   Allen, a hard-edged and probably too-practical woman, is ready
to scrap plans to write a book on love and romance but may be
inspired to forge ahead with the project after meeting the title
character, who is too idealistic for his own good.
</P>
<P>
   He is set free in society and, against her advice, starts to
make matches. As the first ends in disaster, and the second hits a
major snag, Cupid realizes his assignment is not a simple one.
</P>
<P>
   His roommate Champ (Jeffrey D. Sams) is a struggling
African-American actor who refuses to take roles written for black
characters (for example, ``the sacrificial `Star Trek' crew
member'').
</P>
<P>
   There are some holes in the story and very predictable parts,
but in all, this is a fine romantic comedy.
</P>
<P>
   Piven (``Ellen'') stands out, adding plenty of humor to his role
as the self-assured mythological character or nut case. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
MARTIAL LAW &QC;
</P>
<P>
   ``Martial Law'' opens with a great action sequence in a Shanghai
warehouse as a portly martial artist kicks butt and legs and
chests.
</P>
<P>
   Who says there's nothing different on television?
</P>
<P>
   Sammo Law (Hong Kong martial-arts superstar Sammo Hung) comes to
help the Los Angeles Police Department crack an international
car-theft ring.
</P>
<P>
   He is especially interested in the case because one of his
fellow officers and students, Chen Pei Pei (Kelly Hu) has gotten
wrapped up in the mess.
</P>
<P>
   His style is unconventional, but his ways seem to work. He knows
when to make a move and when to stay still.
</P>
<P>
   Upon arriving at LAX, Law is scammed by a fake cabdriver who
steals all of his possessions. Instead of fighting his way out of
the situation, he studies the perps, gets detailed information
about their cars and makes positive identifications, leading to
their arrest and the return of his suitcase.
</P>
<P>
   In other scenes, he beats a suspect with his own shoe and uses a
chalkboard eraser to beat back a racist cop. Later he revives a
woman who faints by massaging her feet.
</P>
<P>
   This is no ordinary action hero.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the first episode, he and the bad cop are part of
an overseas officer exchange, allowing Law to hang around for the
TV season.
</P>
<P>
   He is teamed with detectives Dana Doyle (Tammy Lauren) and Louis
McGray (Louis Mandylor), a good-looking duo to counterbalance
Sammo's skunk-striped hair and big belly.
</P>
<P>
   Law is a unique and charming character, surrounded by a fine
supporting cast. He will either become a cult hit, adopted by the
``Walker, Texas Ranger'' crowd, or be ignored by an American
audience that likes its heroes to have washboard stomachs.

   PH0ENIX - The fish counter at 99 Ranch Market in Phoenix gives
no indication of a problem, with its wide range of selections.
</P>
<P>
   The processing rooms of East Coast Seafood in Phoenix are full
with all kinds of fish, moving maybe 30 tons a day to Valley
restaurants and grocery stores, showing no hint of a shortage.
</P>
<P>
   Seafood is big in Phoenix, swept away on the promise that it is
good for you.
</P>
<P>
   But a new tide has been rising, first in environmental and
scientific circles, then moving into the regional mainstream press
and now washing over the public at large. If we continue eating
anything and everything from lake or sea, pretty soon there won't
be any left.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got serious overfishing problems,'' says Mia Tegner, a
scientist with the Scripps Institute of Oceanography in La Jolla,
Calif., ``without even talking about by-catch, ghost fishing and
habitat changes.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether it's catching too many fish, methods of fishing that
bring up too much unwanted catch _ known as by-catch, fish farming
without regard for pollution, or just a growing appetite that will
not subside, mankind has continued to fish without regard for our
ability to catch anything tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   Seafood makes up the last wild creatures that are hunted and
consumed in large quantities, says Merry Camhi of the National
Audubon Society's Living Oceans Program, which does business from
offices on Long Island, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The world's oceans will not be able to sustain the current
demand for long, she says. In fact, she says, the worldwide catch
has declined since 1989, even though more and more fishing boats
are sailing the high seas.
</P>
<P>
   Some species are especially in trouble:
</P>
<P>
   - The Atlantic swordfish, which many chefs have taken off menus
in a protest against overfishing. According to the U.S. National
Marine Fisheries Service, the number of breeding-age creatures is
only 30 percent of what it was in the '60s, when a fishing
technique called long lining became popular. Replacing traditional
harpoons, long lines of 25 to 40 miles long _ baited with hundreds
of hooks _ are sunk to the depths of an ocean and bring up
thousands of fish.
</P>
<P>
   The catch began to decline in 1989, and now is less than half of
what it was then _ although almost twice as many long lines are in
place.
</P>
<P>
   - Red snapper and drum in the Gulf of Mexico have been targeted
since the time chef Paul Prudhomme first blackened redfish (and
later, other regional fish) and made it popular about 20 years ago.
The fishery was developed, fished, crashed and closed within 15
years.
</P>
<P>
   - The catch of ground fish _ haddock, flounder and cod _
declined 65 percent in waters off New England from 1976 to 1986.
The New England yellowtail flounder lost 94 percent of its breeding
population in that same period.
</P>
<P>
   - The sardine fishery that enabled John Steinbeck to write
``Cannery Row'' is now history, as any visitor to California's
Monterey Bay Aquarium can see. In 1936, it pulled in 800,000 tons
of fish. The catch had dropped to 10,000 tons by 1953, and it had
collapsed altogether by 1967. Only now have sardines recovered
enough to reopen a small fishery there.
</P>
<P>
   - Tuna has been fished to its limits in many parts of the ocean,
in part because of the popularity of sushi. A bluefin tuna _ a
single fish _ can bring in an average of $20,000. The International
Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tuna estimates the
number of adult tuna has dropped 90 percent since 1970.
</P>
<P>
   - Orange roughy, which became popular with Americans in the
'80s, were thought to be plentiful around New Zealand. Before the
fish even could be studied, fishing vessels removed an estimated 80
percent of the fish. Only later did scientists learn that the fish
grow so slowly that it takes them 25 to 30 years to reach breeding
age. As a result, it may take a century or more for the stocks to
recover.
</P>
<P>
   - Shrimp are plentiful in some parts of the ocean but not in
that part of the ocean closest to Arizona, the Gulf of California.
For every pound of shrimp caught, there are seven pounds of
unwanted by-catch. What's more, shrimp farming _ which provides
half the world supply _ has pollution problems _ ranging from
destruction of oceanside habitat to water pollution.
</P>
<P>
   This list comes not from environmental organizations, which
consumers and industry representatives might feel have ulterior
motives. Instead, it comes from the government's National Marine
Fisheries Service, which under federal law must publish lists of
sea creatures that are overfished and devise plans to deal with the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   Camhi of the National Audubon Society says the basic problem is
that the world's population has grown, as has its appetite for
fish.
</P>
<P>
   Most adults can remember a time when a fish meal consisted of
breaded fish sticks out of the oven. Now, most groceries complement
their frozen supplies with fresh-fish counters. What's more, almost
every restaurant has seafood choices.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Boyce, a former fisherman who now works for East Coast
Seafood in Phoenix, says news reports about the health benefits of
seafood fueled the demand that resulted in such bounty.
</P>
<P>
   His company has gone, in a period of about 20 years, from
providing fresh shrimp, crab legs and lobster tails _ supplemented
by a few frozen varieties _ to a full-service company that imports
fish from all around the world. On any given day, Boyce said, East
Coast may handle 80 species.
</P>
<P>
   Times have changed, however. Prices for fish such as North
Pacific rockfish, North Atlantic cod and orange roughy have doubled
over the past few years as supplies have diminished, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Audubon Society's Camhi, who specializes in sharks, says
many species have become overfished in less than 10 years _ since
sharks started being promoted as an alternative to swordfish and
tuna, which were under stress even then.
</P>
<P>
   Tegner at Scripps says that California's abalone fishery has
been closed and that less and less high-quality seafood is being
caught.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are eating lower and lower on the food chain,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   As the fishing industry has tried to keep up, it not only has
identified alternatives but has developed more sophisticated
methods of fishing.
</P>
<P>
   In the past 20 years, Camhi says, technology has improved
substantially, enabling the industry to catch fish more easily and
thus more easily deplete supplies. More ships have taken to the
ocean to catch fish. Practices such as long lines and bottom
trawling _ likened to clear-cutting the ocean floor _ bring up not
just a desired catch but tons of by-catch, most of which goes to
waste.
</P>
<P>
   It's a long way from a pole, a baited line and a bobber.
</P>
<P>
   Fish farming has filled some of the gap _ much of our salmon,
trout, catfish and shrimp come from fish farms. However, even that
is not problem-free, with prices to be paid in habitat destruction,
pollution and fish affected by disease, antibiotics or pesticides.
</P>
<P>
   Camhi hopes continued government oversight, more efficient
fishing that cuts down on by-catch, and perhaps a reduction in
demand will result in a healthy, productive fishery over time.
</P>
<P>
   For now, where does it leave a consumer who hopes to act
responsibly?
</P>
<P>
   Boyce and Camhi, coming from different directions, say education
is a key.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumer awareness is a real issue,'' Boyce says. ``We should
all be concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   Camhi says consumers should make themselves aware of what kinds
of fish are in trouble, and then avoid them.
</P>
<P>
   Besides those listed above, they include shark and grouper,
Pacific rockfish, some types of salmon, and scallops.
</P>
<P>
   Camhi also recommends choosing the right fish to feed the
seafood craving. Those include Pacific cod, striped bass, mackerel,
herring, farm-raised trout and catfish, most salmon, crab and
squid.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a choice,'' she says, ``and it is a meaningful
choice.'' &QL;

DESERT SHRIMP FARMING A REALITY  
 (PHOTOS HAVE BEEN SENT TO NYTNS PHOTO CLIENTS)
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDY WALKER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - The ponds are edged with tumbleweeds, surrounded by
cotton fields in the center of nowhere, not far from Gila Bend,
Ariz. Standing in the desert heat and staring at them, it is hard
to imagine that at the bottom of the ponds wiggle thousands of
pounds of white freshwater shrimp.
</P>
<P>
   Shrimp farming looks like these 25 acres of big ditches that are
5 feet deep, with floating aerators that kick up spray. There is no
fishy odor _ only a hint of the future hangs in the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shrimp may sound unusual now, but in five years, it may sound
like the only thing that's going to be practical to raise here,''
said Gary Wood, who has taken on marketing duties for his family
company, Wood Brothers Farms Inc., whose principals include his dad
and uncle.
</P>
<P>
   Their cotton farm never made a profit, Wood said, and several
years ago the company had to decide whether to abandon the farm or
go into something else. They decided to focus on specialty
products.
</P>
<P>
   So, Gary Wood is growing shrimp, and he wants to sell them to
the shrimp lovers of Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Wood's favorite way to eat shrimp is just lightly cooked with a
hint of garlic. He wants to get some local chefs down to the farm
to see and taste the quality of his product, because he would love
to see Arizona-grown shrimp _ harvested the same day _ on state
menus.
</P>
<P>
   ``With 5 million people in Arizona eating the national average
of 15 pounds of seafood per year, we consume 75 million pounds,''
said Kevin Fitzsimmons, coordinator for aquaculture research at the
Environmental Research Laboratory at the University of Arizona in
Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   ``We produce less than 2 million pounds in the state, so we are
probably importing 73 million pounds into Arizona per year. That's
quite a market niche to fill.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's other shrimp farm, near Yuma, is run by longtime
farmers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shrimp'' to Arizonans most likely means the giant blues sold
in the nearest seaport, at the Rocky Point fish market in Sonora,
Mexico, on the Gulf of California. However, in the off-season or
when the boats don't bring back enough, Fitzsimmons said, even the
shrimp in the Rocky Point market are farm-raised.
</P>
<P>
   Globally, domestically farmed shrimp and seafood could ease the
U.S. trade deficit and help the global environment, Fitzsimmons and
promoters of fish farming agree. The huge amount of shrimp imported
into this country mostly come from Third World countries, where
``rapacious and primitive'' farms have destroyed huge tracts of
mangrove forests, according to a recent ``Nutrition Action
Healthletter,'' published by the Center for Science in the Public
Interest. Farms in the desert, however, don't threaten fragile
marsh and bay areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go inland, and there's no environmental concerns, no diseases,
and no exotic species getting mixed in,'' Addison Lawrence said in
a ``Christian Science Monitor'' story on shrimp farming earlier
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence is a professor at Texas A&AMP;M University's Aquaculture
Experimental Station in Port Aransas, Texas, and reportedly is
working on a grant to develop a huge private shrimp farm in this
area.
</P>
<P>
   Texas A&AMP;M is a leader in shrimp farming in arid lands and is
participating in research at Wood Brothers Farm.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, when we started this three years ago, we didn't tell
anybody,'' Wood said. ``They all thought we were crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   The company has invested $2 million to $3 million in the shrimp
farm, Wood said, and this is the first year the firm has had enough
harvest, about 100,000 pounds, to warrant publicity.
</P>
<P>
   Because brood shrimp and their offspring are shipped worldwide,
the farm is biosecure to ensure a sanitary environment. It is not
open to the public. Pesticides are not allowed anywhere near the
shrimp ponds, and no chemicals, antibiotics, preservatives or
weight enhancers are used in the production of these critters, Wood
emphasizes.
</P>
<P>
   Desert Sweet Shrimp starts growing in these ponds in March, Wood
said. The one-cell eggs that start dividing to become embryonic
shrimp are laid by Hawaiian disease-resistant brood shrimp _ the
real moneymakers here. Brood shrimp, worth $40 to $50 each, are
bigger and more pampered than their for-the-table offspring. Brood
shrimp spend the winter in a greenhouse on the farm.
</P>
<P>
   Shrimp eat a diet of algae, supplemented by a commercial feed
that contains a small percentage of squid, a favorite shrimp food.
The fact that algae grow well here might be one reason
desert-raised shrimp seem to grow faster than anyplace else, Wood
suspects.
</P>
<P>
   A system of pipes and canals circulates water through the ponds.
After the water is used for the shrimp, it waters other crops.
</P>
<P>
   The water goes on maize (not corn) and 40 acres of an olive
grove. Many more tree cuttings are waiting in a greenhouse nearby
to be planted. The olive trees are expected to yield fruit in 2002,
when they will be shipped to California for table olives.
</P>
<P>
   One of the reasons the company quit raising cotton was
environmental concerns, such as the use of chemicals, Wood said.
</P>
<P>
   Wood Brothers managed the large Paloma Ranch near Gila Bend for
decades, Wood said, and at one time managed a big shrimp farm for
the owners in Ecuador in the 1980s. Ecuador, Thailand, Indonesia,
the Philippines and India are the main global producers of
farm-raised shrimp. The Ecuadorean shrimp were shipped to France as
a gourmet product, Wood said.
</P>
<P>
   The flat desert ponds seem a world away from France or Ecuador,
as great blue herons swoop among the ponds, picking up the
occasional shrimp that manages to flip out of the water. In Texas
shrimp ponds, coyotes reportedly have learned to scoop up shrimp
dinners, but here, dragonflies are the main predator when shrimp
are in the larval stage. Power failures are the biggest fear. All
electrical systems have backups, and workers live on the site in
case of outages. Oxygen must be pumped into the water with aerators
at all times; oxygen levels are monitored four times during the
night.
</P>
<P>
   The shrimp are harvested when ponds are drained, immediately put
on ice, and are shipped to a downtown Phoenix processor, where they
are bagged fresh and taken to stores or deheaded and individually
quick frozen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a science and an art,'' Wood said of shrimp farming.
``We're learning something here.'' &QL;

ARIZONA FARMERS LOOK TO FISH AS WAVE OF FUTURE  
 (WITH SHRIMP) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDY WALKER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Farm-grown Arizona fish are swimming around in more
places than you ever dreamed.
</P>
<P>
   Experimental live eels, along with more standard fish crops of
tilapia, channel catfish and largemouth bass, are being grown at
Sweetwater Farms, near Firebird Raceway on the Gila River Indian
Community. Almost all the Sweetwater fish goes to Oriental markets
and restaurants in the Phoenix area, says Mark Lauch, a Sweetwater
fisheries biologist.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to edible species, Arizona fish farmers raise
minnows for bait, aquarium fish, decorative koi and carp, which are
used instead of chemicals to clean ponds and canals.
</P>
<P>
   State fish farmers raised about 1.5 million pounds of tilapia,
trout, catfish and shrimp last year in about 500 acres of ponds,
and sold it for $2.6 million, said Kevin Fitzsimmons, who is
coordinator for aquaculture research at the Environmental Research
Laboratory at the University of Arizona. Almost all of it is going,
live, to ethnic markets, where customers prefer to select their
dinner while it's swimming.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aquaculture is the fastest growing sector of agriculture
worldwide and nationwide,'' Fitzsimmons said. ``I'm not sure if
it's the fastest growing in Arizona, but it's one of the fastest.
We just think that with all the financial and social and
environmental pressure that farmers are under here, this is going
to be one thing that really helps them.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike ostrich farmers, who must educate consumers about their
product, there is a ready market for fish.
</P>
<P>
   About 20 percent of all seafood in the world is farm-raised.
Americans consume so much imported seafood that it's one of the
biggest contributors to the trade deficit, ranked fourth after
petroleum, electronics and automobiles, Fitzsimmons said.
</P>
<P>
   Shrimp and fish ponds, some experts predict, may become
relatively common in tomorrow's deserts. Fourteen high schools in
Arizona have aquaculture projects for future farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Because the state pumps so much water for agriculture,
Fitzsimmons said, the water, the land and a nice long growing
season already exist. His research deals with integrating fish
farming into regular irrigated agriculture and getting twice the
use out of the water by growing a fish crop and then using the
water on plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Waste from fish is great fertilizer for plants,'' Fitzsimmons
said. ``The farmer gets two crops and can use less chemical
fertilizer, it's more organic, and there are fewer problems with
fertilizers contaminating the groundwater.''
</P>
<P>
   As the government drops subsidies, farmers must be more
efficient with land and water, he said. They already have some of
the basics needed for fish farming: tractors to pull nets to catch
the fish, silos to store fish food, and contacts with feed
suppliers and market outlets.
</P>
<P>
   However, James T. Hicks, president of the Arizona Aquaculture
Association, said, ``There's no do-it-yourself kit for fish
farming.''
</P>
<P>
   For more than 15 years, agricultural farmers who have tried to
get rich quickly with fish farming have failed, he said. Fish
biology in an arid environment is totally different from anywhere
else, and the big learning curve disenchants people whose main goal
is to make money.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was natural for farmers to get involved,'' he said. ``But
there's a big difference between growing plants vs. growing an
animal.'' &QL;

NFL IS DOUBLING AS SENIOR QB TOUR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL MULLER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Though I somehow missed the press release, the NFL
apparently decided to honor the past Sunday with its first
unofficial old-timers day.
</P>
<P>
   Playing for the Jets,  &UR; Vinny Testaverde used his long years of
experience to toss four touchdown passes against the Colts.
 &UR; Randall
 &UR; Cunningham (still scrambling, slowly) helped the Vikings beat the
Lions with five (yawn) field goals, and Denver dusted off  &UR; Bubby
 &UR; Brister's old bones to euthanize the Raiders.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere,  &UR; Joe Theismann is warming up.
</P>
<P>
   I think more than one fan thought  &UR; Boomer Esiason could have
sprinted straight from the ``Monday Night Football'' booth and done
a better job than  &UR; Danny Kanell against the Cowboys. I'm sure
Boomer did.
</P>
<P>
   I mean, is Kanell from the Planet Earth? He has at least heard
of
 &UR; Deion Sanders, right?
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, all these old fogies are fighting their way into
the lineup because NFL quarterbacks have the life expectancy of a
Mediterranean fruit fly these days.
</P>
<P>
   For fantasy owners, it's time to take stock of the quarterback
position. If you drafted  &UR; Brett Favre,  &UR; Steve Young,  &UR; Mark Brunell
or
 &UR; Drew Bledsoe, you're grinning a big grin about now.
</P>
<P>
   We are not amused.
</P>
<P>
   Well, I guess things could be worse.  &UR; Dave Brown could be
starting somewhere. Still, as disasters go, it's right up there
with ``Black Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   In Baltimore,  &UR; Jim Harbaugh is essentially a large welt, meaning
always-the-bridesmaid  &UR; Eric Zeier is the answer. The question: How
will the Ravens lose 10 games this year?
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde's solid performance against the Colts makes the Jets
quarterback situation a mess for fantasy owners. Amazingly, Coach
 &UR; Bill
 &UR; Parcells is more worried about winning games that having one
quarterback with good statistics. Parcells reportedly has invested
in a giant cane that he'll use to yank  &UR; Glenn Foley at the first
sign of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile,  &UR; Charlie Batch (Charlie Batch?) is starting for the
Lions, but for how long is anyone's guess. He did an incredible
 &UR; Scott
 &UR; Mitchell impression Sunday (40 attempts, 20 completions, two picks
and no touchdowns), much to the chagrin of  &UR; Bobby Ross.
</P>
<P>
   The young guys haven't done much better. Chargers quarterback
 &UR; Ryan
 &UR; Leaf is scanning the schedule for Oregon State, and Indianapolis
quarterback  &UR; Peyton Manning has finally realized the significance
of wearing a horseshoe on your head.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, you're going to get stepped on.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a glimmer of hope. A few quarterbacks who probably
went undrafted in your league are putting up decent numbers.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington,  &UR; Trent Green looks like he'll hold on to the
starter's job for a while. Cunningham should produce solid numbers
while  &UR; Brad
 &UR; Johnson is on the mend. And  &UR; Tony Banks always has the potential
for a big day in St. Louis, though  &UR; Isaac Bruce has been plagued by
a bad hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, in Dallas, there's  &UR; Jason Garrett, whose SAT
scores were waaaay higher than yours. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Tip of the week &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Denver is riding high and headed for a letdown Sunday in
Washington. Green,  &UR; Terry Allen and  &UR; Michael Westbrook might just
be worth starting. Cincinnati quarterback  &UR; Neil O'Donnell should
have a bounce-back game against Baltimore. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Waiver wire &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The running back situation is a mess. In Baltimore,  &UR; Jay Graham
and
 &UR; Errict Rhett have been benched in favor of obscure backup  &UR; Priest
 &UR; Holmes. In Dallas,  &UR; Sherman Williams or  &UR; Chris Warren will start if
 &UR; Emmitt Smith can't go. In St. Louis,  &UR; Greg Hill's broken leg means
more time for  &UR; Robert Holcombe. In Jacksonville,  &UR; James Stewart is
done for the year, meaning  &UR; Fred Taylor will start. &QL; 
 &QL; 
One-hit wonder &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This week, it's Jets running back  &UR; Leon Johnson, who scored
three touchdowns against the Colts. He shall be Leon, and he shall
be a flash in the pan. &QL;

TEN MORE `SLEEPERS' FROM AN OLD-CAR GURU 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN R. WHITE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every year, the resident old-car guru of Hemmings Motor News and
the magazine Special Interest Autos, Dave Brownell, offers his list
of ``sleepers,'' a compendium of 10 models of the past likely to
become valued collectibles of the future.
</P>
<P>
   The Brownell ``Prospectus of 10'' is offered up as part of the
annual Hemmings Press Day festivities, in which members of the
motor press are briefed on the state of the old-car hobby, the
current condition and lastest activities of the Hemmings publishing
empire, the latest cause of its socially aware publisher, Terry
Ehrich, and then given the opportunity to drive old cars. Driving
the ancient vehicles in the Hemmings fleet gives rise to
conflicting thoughts; it is good to revisit the technology of
yesteryear so as to appreciate more the technology of today (and
the endurance and strength of yesteryear's drivers), to admire
these grand old cars and trucks _ but why would a sane man want to
own and drive them if he didn't have to do it?
</P>
<P>
   It is a question answered by the vagaries and illogic of
hobbyists. Why do anything difficult? For enjoyment, for the
camaraderie of fellow sufferers, notoriety, or just for the sheer
pleasure of doing it. The larger question for the writer, however,
is why do I want to publish the latest predictions of this rascally
seer of old car values when all it will serve to do is drive up the
price of still another old car I'd like to own.
</P>
<P>
   Brownell after all is the expert who predicted that the
Volkswagen Beetle would become a collectible, thereby bumping up
the price of the car I was haggling to own and killing the deal.
Then came the ``new'' Beetle and a rush to the old Beetle.
</P>
<P>
   Now the man is doing it again, predicting this year that the
1951-'52 Chevrolet Bel Air convertibles and hardtops will be seeing
``upward potential.'' Collectors crave the cars of their youth _
you can't get the youth back, but at least you can have the car.
This is a car of my youth, that I couldn't afford then and still
can't find enough spare change to own. The closest I came to owning
one was buying a new bumper for a nifty yellow '51 ragtop _ because
I hit it with my rusty '47 Buick.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble with Brownell's predictions is that they are too
good, too frequently come to be realized; he has considerably more
hits than misses and reminded us painfully of that by documenting
the rise in price of several old memories of youth.
</P>
<P>
   Well, in the interest of fair play and truth in journalism,
here's the Brownell list for this year.
</P>
<P>
   He leads the list with a curious selection, the Willys station
wagon built from 1949 into the early '60s. Rugged with 4-wheel
drive, they were the first all-steel station wagons _ or were they
the original SUVs? Available, Brownell says, for between $1,600 to
$2,500, an odd collectible available for an agreeable price.
</P>
<P>
   The '51-'52 Bel Airs, he reminds us, are pleasing cars to look
at, pleasing to drive and the ``simple, straight-forward
mechanicals make them easy to and economical to restore and
maintain.'' An ideal ``starter'' for the new hobbyist, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Another of my youthful ``likes'' _ certainly not a passion _
that Brownell sees as a comer is the 1953-'54 Plymouths, cars that
had ``disappointing sales when new'' but offer pleasing compact
design with a tough chassis and engine, Brownell says.
</P>
<P>
   A ``nearly forgottten'' compact of the '60s, the '64-'67 Mercury
Comet Caliente in hardtop or convertible is next on the Brownell
list. Derived from a Ford Falcon, these distinctive cars were
available with either I-6 or V-8 engines and are quite rare today,
but fairly cheap, Brownell says, commenting that Hemmings listed
one as ``rust-free'' for $1,600.
</P>
<P>
   Next is the '67-'69 Cougar in hardtop or convertible style.
Essentially, these are upscale Mustangs, he reminds us, but have
not achieved the inflated values of their Ford siblings. Recent ads
for a rust-free '67 XR-7 with a 289 CID V-8 in storage asked
$2,900. Probably gone by now, and after Brownell's list gets
around, never to be seen again. Thanks, Dave, for ruining another
dream.
</P>
<P>
   Alfa-Romeo 1966-'69 Duetto Spyders are next on his tout list _
no dream of this writer's. Admitting they are ``prone to rust'' and
``mechanically temperamental,'' (an understatement), Brownell sees
them in a favorable light for good looks, available parts, and club
support.
</P>
<P>
   The 1969-'76 Triumph TR-6 makes the list for ``performance,
appearance, and attractive current price levels.'' Why these cars
haven't become warmer in the market is a mystery, since British
sports cars, no matter how troublesome or rust prone, seem to be
coveted by collectors and hobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   Buick 1968-'70 GS400 hardtops and convertibles, ``solid and well
engineered'' cars in Brownell's words, are next up and, with their
Wildcat 400 CID engines and Burst three-speed shifters, are
desirable cars. Figure to pay $6,000, he says _ until the owners
read this stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously looking to put some humor into his Top Ten List,
Brownell finishes with the Pontiac Fiero, ``one of the most
innovative cars to come out of General Motors.''  &UR;  &LR; He admits to
``initial quality problems'' _ a euphemism for a fire-prone car _
and tells us these mid-engined, plastic-skinned cars matured into
``quick, great-handling two-seaters.''
</P>
<P>
   That's got to be the punch line. Plastic they were; quick, they
were not. The six-cylinder version was a maintenance monster; the
four-cylinder versions were lead sleds with decent handling.
Although the skin won't rust, most everything underneath might;
although the skin won't dent or ding, it will rip and tear.
</P>
<P>
   Oh well, at least there's no harm in that one.

`CUPID,' `FANTASY ISLAND' MAKE SATURDAY NIGHT WORTH WATCHING
AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABC has a history of airing decent shows on Saturday night, such
as ``Relativity,'' ``Cracker,'' ``C-16,'' ``Nothing Sacred,'' ``The
Practice.'' Its record of keeping the shows alive is less
spectacular. Only ``The Practice'' remains on the schedule, having
since moved to Monday, then to Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   It's enough to make even a confident bettor leery of plunking
down the kids' tuition on the chances of ``Fantasy Island'' and
``Cupid'' making it to next season. Like ``The Practice,'' which
won this year's Emmy for best drama, both new shows have the
potential to be among the best in prime time, but being on ABC
means they also have the potential to vanish before Thanksgiving.
So, if you like them, tune in and tune in often.
</P>
<P>
   First to appear, at 9 o'clock, is ``Fantasy Island,'' a remake
of the series that America embraced in the late '70s and early
'80s. The premise is identical: Subscribers to the
other-man's-grass-is-always-greener theory are granted a
``fantasy'' vacation on a tropical isle, complete with whatever
experiences they've always coveted, only to learn that their own
fescue is probably better, crabgrass and all.
</P>
<P>
   A pleasant addition to this edition is an odd travel agency run
by Fyvush Finkel, who has dibs on Fantasy Island referrals. Once
ticketed, the travelers still arrive by float plane and they're
still greeted by Mr. Roarke.
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm McDowell plays the new Mr. Roarke, white-haired but
dark-suited _ he had the white ones burned _ perhaps to remind us
that ``Fantasy Island'' has undergone some renovations. McDowell's
Roarke is a few shades darker than Ricardo Montalban's, but he
retains the mystical powers that Montalban's character exhibited in
the latter stages of the original series. Tonight, for instance,
Roarke is a tourism director's dream, changing cloudy skies to
sunny with the snap of a finger.
</P>
<P>
   Metaphorically, he does the same for visitors to the island,
including a man who thinks he married the wrong woman, a woman who
wants to know everything, and an adventurer who is seeking the
ultimate challenge. In the end, the fantasy is never as fantastic
as imagined, and everyone goes home satisfied with their humdrum
lives.
</P>
<P>
   This steady predictability puts considerable pressure on the
writers to keep things from sliding into the sewage lagoon in the
weeks ahead. ABC is banking on the abilities of executive producer
Barry Sonnenfeld, the film director responsible for such
black-humor hits as ``Get Shorty'' and ``Men in Black.'' His
production company, the same outfit that gave us this summer's
marvelous diversion, ``Maximum Bob,'' is doing ``Fantasy Island.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Mr. Roarke and his mysterious assistants _ they all seem
to be ``doing time'' on the island _ are essential, guest stars are
key to the show's success. As long as the producers stay away from
the tendency to invite faded movie and TV stars onto the set, it
looks as if ``Fantasy Island'' is worth a return visit.
</P>
<P>
   Ditto for ``Cupid,'' a thoroughly captivating romantic
comedy/drama about a guy who claims to be Cupid and the skeptical
psychiatrist who treats him.
</P>
<P>
   Jeremy Piven (``Ellen'') chucks the diaper and archery set in
favor of normal street clothes, lending Cupid, a k a Trevor Hale, a
tough, real exterior that keeps the show from being too cute for
its own good.
</P>
<P>
   Cupid/Hale claims he has been sent to Earth to relearn his
craft; the high divorce rate has given him a bad rep among the
deities. His mission: make 100 successful matches.
</P>
<P>
   Psychiatrist and relationship expert Claire Allen (Paula
Marshall) encounters Cupid when he's sent to a mental institution.
She wins his release on the condition that she keep him under
observation. He starts in on his matchmaking with the singles group
that Dr. Allen counsel.
</P>
<P>
   The sparks between Cupid and Claire arc regularly, but the
current clearly alternates between aversion and attraction.
Together, Piven and Marshall concoct an enticing blend of sexual
tension, mutual attraction and subtle humor.
</P>
<P>
   Against the violence of CBS's ``Walker, Texas Ranger'' and the
darkness of NBC's ``Profiler,'' ABC has a bright, entertaining
alternative for Saturday stay-at-homes. Let's hope they give
``Cupid'' a chance.
</P>
<P>
   There is also some tongue-in-cheek humor in ``Martial Law,'' a
new companion to CBS's rock-'em-sock-'em standby, ``Walker, Texas
Ranger.'' But don't expect much else.
</P>
<P>
   Sammo Hung, a colleague of Hong Kong icons Bruce Lee and Jackie
Chan, still struggles with English, so his conversation is kept to
a minimum. As Chinese supercop Sammo Law, he speaks instead with
quick kicks and smart jabs, the only sort of dialogue thugs seem to
understand.
</P>
<P>
   Law has come to Los Angeles in pursuit of a former
prot &UR; gfacute &LR; eg &UR; gfacute &LR; e, Chen Pei Pei (Kelly Hu), who has fallen
in with the bad guys. His partners in crime-fighting are L.A.
detectives Dana Doyle and Louis McGray, played with little
distinction by Tammy Lauren and Louis Mandylor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Martial Law'' is from the same producer responsible for ``Nash
Bridges,'' and it delivers the same lightweight entertainment in a
much more violent package. Though not bloody _ Sammo Law doesn't
carry a gun _ it is extremely violent, as dialogue is frequently
interrupted by bodies flying through the air with the greatest of
tease.
</P>
<P>
   Folks attracted by these kick-to-the-head come-ons will be
enchanted, but ``Martial Law'' is utterly pointless, unless
full-figured men are able to find a new role model in the
well-padded Sammo Hung.

his experience to help other men confront their illness at a local
prostate cancer support group. (Jerry Lara/Hearst News Service

BIRDS COMPLEMENT A GARDEN 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun. Sept. 27) 
(JT) 
 By CASS PETERSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The hummingbirds will be leaving soon for their annual
peregrination. They've been here since the lilacs bloomed in May.
Possibly they arrived sooner, but lilac time is usually when I
first notice them.
</P>
<P>
   I hear hummingbirds before I see them. The noise of their tiny
wings beating furiously as they flit from one flower to the next
sounds like the sputtering engine of a distant dirtbike. It's a
noise I hear often as the season progresses and the hummingbirds
find each flower in its prime. They hover around the beard tongue
in June, the impatiens in July, the Mexican sunflower in August.
</P>
<P>
   A garden's birds are a fine complement to its flowers and
vegetables. Not even cornflowers can match the blue of an indigo
bunting; no rose is as vividly red as a scarlet tanager. Even
drab-colored birds improve the landscape, like plants grown as a
quiet background.
</P>
<P>
   There are birds in the garden all year, as there are evergreens
to make a show when the herbaceous plants are dormant. But the
arrival of spring's first robin is as eagerly anticipated as the
first jonquil, both being signs that winter has loosened its hold
on the earth.
</P>
<P>
   A neighbor watches for the first barn swallow, in the belief
that when the swallows arrive, frost will not visit again, and it
is therefore safe to put out the tomato seedlings that have been
getting spindly on the windowsill. Barn swallows have been known to
be wrong on that count, but they are a welcome sight anyway,
wheeling joyously behind the tractor and snapping up flying insects
that the machine has disturbed.
</P>
<P>
   Where there are many barn swallows, there are few mosquitoes,
which is reason enough to tolerate their mud nests in the barn
eaves.
</P>
<P>
   When it's time to till a field for early peas and potatoes, the
tractor will make a slight detour around the spot where a killdeer
has constructed her nest on the ground. The killdeer likes to nest
where the soil is well drained and exposed to the southern
sun-exactly the right spot for early garden crops-so this annual
conflict is inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   It would be almost impossible to detect this nest, with its four
brown-speckled eggs, except that the killdeer is very good at
calling attention to it. She plants herself, shrieking like a
harridan, in front of the tractor as it approaches the site. In the
spring, the tractor tool box includes a supply of small, orange
flags to mark killdeer nests.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer, when the peas have all been picked and the field
cleaned up for a fall crop of broccoli or turnips, there will
likely be a small section of pea trellis left standing. House wrens
and sparrows like to build their nests in the pea trellis.
</P>
<P>
   This year, a house wren chose a pot of artemisia on a bench
outside the greenhouse as a nesting site. The artemisia was
supposed to be planted in the spring, next to a clump of daylilies
in a new perennial bed. Watching the mother wren fuss over her
brood, and applauding as the last youngster teetered on the edge of
the bench before launching into flight, was worth the delay. Fall
planting is good for perennials, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Some birds are said to be pests in the garden, including crows
and mockingbirds. It's true that crows will eat newly sown seeds,
delighted to find their dinner so neatly arranged in a row, and
mockingbirds are fond of berries.
</P>
<P>
   But the four-crow squadron that patrols my fields (the same
birds every year) is a familiar part of the scenery, and
mockingbirds keep me company in the winter, when most of their
compatriots have fled to warmer locales. I don't begrudge them a
share of the produce. A piece of netting over the newly seeded
squash or ripening blueberries prevents large losses.
</P>
<P>
   More often, birds are allies in the garden and field, devouring
quantities of insects and weed seeds. When the dandelions go to
fluff, bright yellow finches come to gorge on the seeds, arriving
in such numbers that it looks like the dandelions have bloomed all
over again.
</P>
<P>
   Robins work at ground level, gobbling up grubs and cutworms, and
swallows handle aerial duties. In the evening, swallows fly low
over the vegetable plants, brushing the leaves lightly with their
wings, then bank sharply around to grab any leafhoppers thus
dislodged.
</P>
<P>
   Kestrels, hawks, and owls hunt down rodents, and turkey vultures
_ so ungainly on the ground, so magnificently graceful riding a
summer thermal in great, lazy circles _ do their part as
scavengers.
</P>
<P>
   Like many gardeners, I favor hummingbirds. Fearless in their
pursuit of nectar, they fly right into the greenhouse through open
vents, heading first, always, to the double red impatiens.
</P>
<P>
   This year a young hummer mistook the greenhouse poly cover for
open sky, and stunned herself trying to fly through it. I carried
her to a basket of impatiens, where in due time she regained her
wits. When mother came looking for her, chirping anxiously, the
youngster was well enough to fly away.
</P>
<P>
   To grow beautiful flowers and fine vegetables is a gardener's
joy. But to hold an iridescent hummingbird in one's hand is an
experience that is not likely to be repeated. That one, I hope,
will return when the lilacs are next in bloom.

MAINSTREAM RESEARCHERS TAKE A SERIOUS LOOK AT ALTERNATIVE
TREATMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: saw palmetto is CQ)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ULYSSES TORASSA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Diagnosed 10 months ago with non-Hodgkin's
lymphoma, Terry Reinhard had already had 12 weeks of chemotherapy
and another month of radiation treatment when he learned in July
that his one tumor had turned into three.
</P>
<P>
   Reinhard, 56, of San Francisco, hasn't given up on conventional
treatment _ he's scheduled to start a new round of chemotherapy
Oct. 5.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to go off the deep end with all the oddball
drugs and things that are out there, but I think there are a lot of
alternative things like meditation, centering, acupuncture, herbal
remedies'' that could help, Reinhard said. ``I want somebody to
look at me as a whole person, that I'm a spiritual person, and I
want someone who has the conviction that there are other things
that can heal.''
</P>
<P>
   Exactly what might work, however, remains a mystery to Reinhard
_ and to scientists. Which is a big reason why the University of
California at San Francisco has opened the new Osher Center for
Integrative Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Funded largely by a $10 million grant from the Bernard Osher
Foundation, the center aims to use scientific methods to separate
the wheat from the chaff in the fast-growing, sometimes
mind-boggling world of alternative healing.
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, don't look for university researchers to give
coffee enemas or pass magnets over their subjects' injuries,
therapies still considered on the outskirts, even of alternative
medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Like Reinhard, the Osher Center is initially focusing on some of
the more near-mainstream therapies. Projects planned so far involve
yoga, guided imagery and support groups for women with breast
cancer; Tibetan and Chinese herbs for other breast cancer patients
as well as for menopausal women, and a study of acupressure
wristbands (often used to prevent motion sickness) to see if they
reduce nausea from chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   Dean Ornish, the nutrition guru, is also leading a study on
whether a low-fat, plant-based diet and other lifestyle changes can
reverse prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   They aren't ruling out more far-out therapies, but so far
research is focused on questions scientists have said they wanted
to pursue, said Andrew Avins, the center's director of research.
Figuring out how to dole out limited funds will be hard, and Avins
already fields many calls from people wanting the center to prove
that this or that therapy really works.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a fairly wide-open field with a very poor evidence base,
which makes choosing questions very difficult. It becomes, on some
level, a matter of guesswork, but that's the nature of where things
are now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another challenge will be figuring out how to measure benefits
of the therapies, which often improve quality of life and patient
satisfaction, rather than simply extend life spans, Avins said.
</P>
<P>
   The ever-present placebo effect, which is believed to play a
large role in benefits many patients derive from alternative
medicine, is also tricky, he said. Even though placebos are
harmless, medically inactive pills or other treatments, people
taking them often show some improvement in their condition. Using
placebos in conventional medicine is considered a form of deception
and therefore unethical, but Avins sees the situation differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``The placebo effect may be enormously powerful and beneficial
to patients, and we are learning how it works,'' Avins said. ``How
to harness the placebo effect in an ethical manner? Those are some
very tough questions.''
</P>
<P>
   The University of California at San Francisco, other leading
medical centers and the government are getting into alternative
medicine research because huge numbers of people are flocking to
it. Surveys have shown that at least one in three people in the
United States has used non-traditional therapy in the past year.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford University and the University of California at Davis
also are involved in scientific evaluation of alternative
therapies. Both schools have grants from the National Institutes of
Health's Office of Alternative Medicine to open centers.
</P>
<P>
   At Davis, scientists are looking at various treatments for
asthma and the immune system. Stanford's center focuses on
developing scientific standards for evaluating alternative
therapies. The center recently opened a clinic offering
acupuncture, meditation, support groups and biofeedback to
patients.
</P>
<P>
   Avins, who considers himself squarely in the mainstream, said he
decided to study the benefits of the plant extract saw palmetto for
enlarged prostates because so many of his patients said they were
using it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, it made me nervous,'' he said. ``I don't know whether
my patients who are taking this are really onto something or
whether they are poisoning themselves, and they don't know
either.''

A NIGHT OUT WITH DOMINIQUE SWAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sun., Sept. 27)  
(JT) 
 By DAVID COLMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On her first visit to a New York nightclub, Dominique
Swain said she had more in common with the title character in
``Pecker'' than the one for which she is known. That is ``Lolita,''
of course.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Swain had just seen the premiere of ``Pecker'' _ John
Waters' film about a naive young Baltimore artist whose life runs
amok when he is discovered by a hot-shot Manhattan dealer _ and she
had made her way to the post-premiere party on Thursday night at
Veruka in SoHo.
</P>
<P>
   The general fabulousness of the downtown movie and art crowd
seemed to intimidate Ms. Swain, who grew up in a rural canyon in
Malibu, Calif., where there are still more rattlesnakes than Range
Rovers. Despite signing more autographs and posing for more
pictures at Veruka than any of the ``Pecker'' principals, including
Waters and the film's star, Edward Furlong, Ms. Swain acted unsure
of herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel like I belong here,'' she said, hiding out in a
booth, after introductions to the artists Cindy Sherman (who has a
cameo in ``Pecker'') and Nan Goldin. ``It's all so larger than
life. I feel like a bee in Queen Mary's bonnet, in the midst of all
this elite.''
</P>
<P>
   At such moments, Ms. Swain seems younger than she is, three
years after making ``Lolita'' at age 15. The much-debated film,
which had trouble finding an American distributor because of its
subject matter, was first seen on Showtime and finally opened in
theaters on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Swain girlishly reported how Furlong had said he liked
``Lolita.'' She spoke of the fairies she's been making out of
Sculpy, a modeling clay, and sipped cranberry juice through a
straw.
</P>
<P>
   But along with such innocent enthusiasms, she also vamped her
way past the flashbulbs on her way into the club with the amused,
youthful indifference with which Lolita put on lipstick. She wore
an azure fun-fur zip-up jacket and a butterfly pin in her blond
hair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love posing for photos,'' she said with a shrug. ``I've
always been kind of attention-hungry.''
</P>
<P>
   With her boyfriend, Charlie Bambrook, who held her hand
throughout the night, Ms. Swain headed straight for the back of the
room _ to the food. As a tray of sushi went by her, she took a
piece, and then another. And another. The party was looking up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frederick's of Hollywood,'' she said with a conspiratorial
smile about the source of the glitter speckling her eyelids. ``I
went in and bought it at the store. But I was 18, so it was OK They
didn't even ask for ID.''
</P>
<P>
   If she shares one thing with the character Lolita, it's a
seeming carelessness toward things that others might kill for _
like stardom at a tender age. The insouciance might have made her
perfect for Adrian Lyne's remake of ``Lolita,'' but it could well
stymie any attempts to continue a career in movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``My agent says I don't try very hard,'' Ms. Swain sighed, while
trying to catch the sushi bearer's eye. ``If it's a part like
Lolita, I would really go after it, but all these other auditions,
I just think, I have to spend all day memorizing lines, and I might
not even get it? It's such a waste of time.'' She rolled her eyes,
and decided it was about time to leave.

DOCTOR SPEAKS PASSIONATELY ON MANIC DEPRESSION _ BECAUSE HE'S BEEN

<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Mood disorders can make life terribly
difficult, Dr. Sam Barklis says philosophically.
</P>
<P>
   He was an assistant professor at the University of Illinois
Medical School in 1957 when he suffered his first significant
high-low episode.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was up for about three months, and just as suddenly, I
crashed down,'' Barklis recalls. ``At times I could be so buoyant,
talking faster and faster. The flow of ideas was amazing, but I was
easily distracted. I never went anywhere in a straight line.

   ``When you are manic, you can be so very convincing and
charming. Some say they could sell the Brooklyn Bridge; some become
grandiose _ free-spending, as if they have the money when they
don't. You have a very heightened sex drive and get into
relationships you have no business being in,'' he says. ``It's
exciting, but very destructive of everything around you.''
</P>
<P>
   Barklis was 32 when his manic depression was diagnosed.
</P>
<P>
   His doctor immediately put him on lithium, which was being used
throughout Europe. It would be 14 more years before lithium, now
the gold-standard drug for manic depression, would be approved by
the Food and Drug Administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was lucky to be with the University of Illinois
Neuropsychiatric Institute, a medical doctor with manic depression
and lithium at his fingertips,'' says Barklis, a doctor with a
specialty in psychopharmacology.
</P>
<P>
   Barklis is passionate and personal when he talks about mood
disorders (depression and manic depression) and anxiety disorders
(phobias).
</P>
<P>
   And he talks about them often.
</P>
<P>
   He presents free educational programs for the Depressive and
Manic Depressive Association of Fort Worth and Tarrant County the
second and fourth Friday of each month.
</P>
<P>
   The National Depressive and Manic Depressive Association
recently honored Barklis as medical adviser of the year for his
work with its Fort Worth-Tarrant County chapter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NDMDA has been remarkably successful, especially in the
last 10 years, in educating the public about mood disorders and in
promoting support groups for those affected and their families,''
Barklis says. The local group ``has reached thousands of people
over the past decade with effective programs. I am grateful to have
participated.''
</P>
<P>
   Barklis came to Fort Worth in 1968 as vice president for science
and technology for Alcon Laboratories. He was directing his own
pharmaceutical research and development company 10 years ago when
he decided to go back into private practice.
</P>
<P>
   He currently practices at the Anxiety, Mood and Phobia Center in
Fort Worth along with three psychotherapists, including his wife,
Dr. Carolyn Self.

COMPANIES FIND NEW WAYS TO REACH FUTURE STARS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By L.M. SIXEL 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Good employees are tough to find. And expensive.
</P>
<P>
   For an executive-level post, it's typical for a company to pay a
headhunting firm 25 to 33 percent of an employee's first-year
salary and bonus to find just the right person.
</P>
<P>
   But some companies are finding ways to circumvent those fees by
doing more of the work themselves.
</P>
<P>
   They're finding their own candidates. They're going back to
previous employees to see if they'd consider coming back. And
they're using recruiting firms that are willing to work by the
hour.
</P>
<P>
   Such an approach was used by Loran Kaminsky, senior executive
recruiter for Ernst &AMP; Young in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Kaminsky thought about ways he could hire the best at the
cheapest price and came up with an arrangement that let him to
identify potential job candidates instead of using a full-service
recruiter.
</P>
<P>
   He asked partners to identify people who would make good
partners at Ernst &AMP; Young. The partners came up with the names of
about 20 competitors, former colleagues and folks that they know in
the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Kaminsky then hired the Alexander Group for an hourly fee to
find the targeted candidates and talk them into considering a job
with Ernst &AMP; Young. The Alexander Group is a recruiting firm based
in Houston. It has offices in Boston, San Diego and San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   About seven of the candidates indicated they were interested in
the partner job and met with Kaminsky. Ernst &AMP; Young ended up
hiring one of them and probably will hire a second one from that
group.
</P>
<P>
   Kaminsky said he paid a fee of about $9,000 and figures he saved
about $250,000 in full-service commissions for the new partners.
</P>
<P>
   The search procedure yielded such great candidates and saved so
much money, Kaminsky said, that he is trying to implement it
nationwide. The same system should work just as well to find
managers and other types of employees.
</P>
<P>
   Companies are increasingly interested in ways to cut down on
their recruiting costs, said Jane Howze, managing director of the
Alexander Group. But the traditional recruiting fee structure is an
impediment to coming up with innovative ideas, said Howze, whose
firm charges between $90 and $250 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Howze recently conducted a search for one employer that wanted
to track down 100 former employees that the company had identified
as stars to see if they could be talked into returning.
</P>
<P>
   They were scattered all over the world _ England, Switzerland,
Germany _ and Howze asked them why they decided to leave and if the
problem could be straightened out.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, the employees reported they didn't get along with
their supervisors or had too long a commute or they wanted a
project with more challenges. When those issues were addressed, the
company, which didn't want to be identified, was able to rehire
five of the employees.
</P>
<P>
   It's a lot cheaper to hire good people who already have worked
for you or who you've already identified as solid performers than
new ones, said John Lamar, managing director of the Alexander
Group.
</P>
<P>
   Lamar conducted a search for an accounting firm in which he
contacted people the firm had offered jobs during the previous two
years but had turned them down. Five or six people decided to go
with the firm after they were reapproached.
</P>
<P>
   That's an interesting way of recruiting, but many times
companies want someone they don't know or who may come from an
entirely different industry, said Lou Rieger, vice chairman of
SpencerStuart in Houston, a blue chip recruiting firm that charges
the traditional 33 percent fee of the first year's cash
compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Rieger said he recently did a search for a big oil company
looking for a general manager of its worldwide engineering
operations. Company officials said they have 20 people they could
have promoted to the $300,000-a-year job, but they didn't want
someone who would do the same job as the person before. Rieger said
he found an engineer at a consulting firm who was used to looking
at projects from the other side of the table.
</P>
<P>
   SpencerStuart has 575,000 rising stars in its database, which
includes resumes and interview notes, so if a recruiter in Chicago
is interested in an engineer who works for a Houston company, the
recruiter can check to see who has interviewed him and what his
impressions were.
</P>
<P>
   It saves money and time because recruiters aren't flying to
another city to interview someone who wouldn't be an appropriate
candidate, Rieger said.

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: Joe and Bubba in Miami Beach
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ At first glance I thought I'd received a piece
of fan mail. And so it was.
</P>
<P>
   Only problem, instead of me, it was for my Cousin Bubba.
</P>
<P>
   That's the way it's been most of our lives. Everybody always
liked Bubba best, especially the women.
</P>
<P>
   Eva Young of Longview, Texas, is no exception. Here's what her
letter says:
</P>
<P>
   ``You have been writing about Russia and France and England, and
even down in Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   ``All those places are interesting and far away, but I'm an old
woman who is more interested in family and friends, and I tend to
worry about them if I don't hear from them often.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you know how long it's been since I've heard from Bubba?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's been nigh on to a year since you have written
anything about Bubba. He seems to be the kind of fellow who needs
worrying about, and I'm plum worried about Bubba.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish you would devote a column to Bubba so I would know how
he's getting along.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, Bubba's doing just fine, thank you for asking.
</P>
<P>
   As regular readers may recall, we are first cousins, born just
19 days apart.
</P>
<P>
   We grew up on the same block, ran with the same crowd in high
school and dated the same girls.
</P>
<P>
   When we were starting out families of our own, we bought houses
across the street from one another.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays we may go weeks without getting together in person, but
we talk on the phone most every day. Mostly we talk about taking
off on a trip, just the two of us, like we did when we were young
and single.
</P>
<P>
   For a fact, we finally did this year. I was in Florida looking
for stories, and Bubba flew down and met up with me for a
sentimental journey of sorts.
</P>
<P>
   More than 35 years ago, we made much the same trip, driving
Bubba's brand-new Ford Fairlane 1,000 miles or more nonstop from
our little hometown of Lufkin, Texas, to Miami Beach.
</P>
<P>
   We were poor-boying it back then. I don't remember the actual
name of the place we stayed, but we dubbed it the River Rat Arms.
Heck of a floor show, though. Refugee circus acts from Cuba were
practicing in the courtyard several floors below our window.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly we hung out around the lobby of the elegant Fontainebleau
Hotel, dressed up like we belonged, and on the lookout for movie
stars and hotel security.
</P>
<P>
   This last trip we had intended to stay at the Fontainebleau. But
it was full up, and we ended up next door at the Eden Roc. Neither
place is what it used to be, but neither are we.
</P>
<P>
   Highlight of the trip was a meal at Joe's Stone Crabs, where
nobody can get reservations, except that I happen to know a guy and
Bubba and I were able to walk right past the crowd and be escorted
directly to a table that was being held for us.
</P>
<P>
   That may be the only time in my life that I've ever managed to
impress Bubba.
</P>
<P>
   No matter. He was a hit with the staff, especially the women.
Next time he'll probably be the one who gets us a table.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know how many trips together we have left in us. I keep
trying to talk him into going to Europe. I think that would make a
good story, Bubba in Russia and France and England.
</P>
<P>
   But if not there, maybe Louisiana. I'll keep you posted.

COVERING THE INK WITH PANCAKE 
</HEADLINE>
 YORKER-$ADV27-NYT  (For release Sun., Sept. 27) 
(JT) 
 By ALEX KUCZYNSKI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ David Remnick, once a rumpled writer for The New
Yorker, appeared on ``The Charlie Rose Show'' on Sept. 13 to
discuss his appointment as editor of the magazine. Gone were the
oversize horn-rimmed glasses readers saw on the jacket of his
Pulitzer Prize-winning book, ``Lenin's Tomb,'' and Remnick appeared
to have treated himself to an $80 haircut, a stylish,
windowpane-check suit and a plump silk tie.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's gone downtown,'' said the Time magazine columnist
Margaret Carlson, who watched the broadcast. The key to the new
Remnick sophistication? ``High-care fibers,'' she noted.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere on the way from Watergate to Zippergate, members of
the press _ once the embodiment of tattered, inky credibility,
their integrity magnified by their degree of frumpishness _ have
become polished, sparkling, talking television heads, deft with a
stick of pancake makeup and savvy about sitting on the tails of
their suits.
</P>
<P>
   Never has the trend been more apparent than during the last two
weeks, when the all-consuming presidential crisis has delivered a
flood tide of punditry-spouting press reporters before the hot
television-studio lights. Last week, David Talbot, the editor of
Salon, the online magazine that broke the Henry Hyde story,
appeared on both the network and cable talk shows, while Newsweek's
Howard Fineman and Michael Isikoff, Time's Karen Tumulty and the
presidential biographer David Maraniss cruised the cable networks.
All _ including Isikoff, who is not usually known for paying avid
attention to his grooming habits _ were uncommonly dapper-looking.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Jonathan Alter of Newsweek, who appears regularly on
NBC News, the ``Today Show'' and MS-NBC, gets his makeup advice
from Bobbi Brown, the makeup superstar who does Vogue cover models.
(She is Alter's neighbor in New Jersey.) If a Newsweek staff member
calls Alter, his wife has been known to respond: ``Can he get back
to you? Jonathan's on the treadmill.''
</P>
<P>
   When Tucker Carlson, a newcomer to the television game and a
writer for The Weekly Standard, made one of his first appearances
on CNN a couple of years ago, a makeup artist pulled him aside
after the interview, looked at his bright-orange tie and announced:
``Tucker. Your tie. It scares me.'' Carlson now pays close
attention to his neckware.
</P>
<P>
   Messrs. Alter, Carlson and Remnick are all part of a growing
writer beautification program, sponsored by the networks that
invite them to speak. In the last two years, as all-news networks
have proliferated _ MS-NBC, Fox News Network and CNN require guests
24 hours a day _ press journalists have been more and more in
demand. (Unless they are paid consultants to a network, they are
also, it should be noted, free.)
</P>
<P>
   But the problem for the networks has been that press journalists
spend their days hunched over computer screens, they have poor
posture and their accountants don't deduct hair-styling costs from
their taxes. The men's jackets ride up; the women wear glasses.
Unpopular in high schools where looks were highly ranked in the
popularity competition, future newspaper journalists tended to
follow their hearts into print, where the power of words would
convey the beauty deep inside them.
</P>
<P>
   So what's a network to do when it gets a member of the press to
a broadcast and he shows up in a suit from Today's Man, with a soup
stain on his tie? ``We say something to people,'' said Gail Evans,
the head of booking for CNN. ``You say, `Hey, wear that blazer,'
because you once saw them in a blazer that fit. And now they seem
to be listening.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, members of the press who used to look disdainfully at
their blow-dried cousins have embraced broadcast with open arms. A
magazine writer in New York who is a frequent on-air guest said
coming back to work with a layer of pancake is a badge of pride in
his newsroom (although he was too squeamish on the subject to be
identified).
</P>
<P>
   Time magazine has installed a television studio in its offices
on the Avenue of the Americas, so magazine reporters can go live on
CNN with breaking news. Formerly disheveled journalists are
catching on to their expanded roles. ``Reporters now know things
like not to wear stuff that will assault television viewers,''
Carlson said.
</P>
<P>
   Newsweek staff members marvel at how Alter has apparently
slimmed down. One former Newsweek staff member said, ``You can see
real effort there.'' Another Newsweek journalist suggested that
Alter had been bleaching his teeth on the sly, to which Alter
responded ``No!'' and squeaked out a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Carlson of Time, who appears with some regularity on CNN,
uses under-eye concealer and makeup, but stops at hair spray. ``If
God had wanted your hair not to move, he would have made you like
Pamela Harriman,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Kurtz, a Washington Post reporter who covers the news
media and is himself a regular on television, said: ``There is this
voracious appetite, and a small army of bookers trying to grab
less-than-telegenic reporters because they know something about the
Lewinsky story. And they can be identified as representing
impressive news organizations.''
</P>
<P>
   Remnick's spokeswoman at The New Yorker conceded he had
purchased new clothes, especially evening wear, for his more
visible role. But she denied what some New Yorker staff members
have lately been speculating about _ that his new title comes with
a clothing allowance, like top editorships at some other Conde Nast
magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Skip Smith, the senior makeup artist at CNN in Washington, said
that press reporters are exhibiting new signs of television savvy
these days.
</P>
<P>
   ``They used to come and say, `I don't need that stuff,''' Smith
said. ``Now, they come in and say, `Hey, where's the makeup guy?'
The worst kind are the ones that halfway know what they're doing,
and they bring their own stuff, and we're like, `No, we really
don't want you to do that,' and we have to gently take it out of
their hands. But they get very excited about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Marina Ein, a publicity agent for The National Journal, who
often places journalists on talk shows, noted a difference between
Washington and New York reporters. ``The glamorous print reporter
is more of a New York thing,'' she maintained. ``In Washington,
they look frumped, frazzled and frantic. In the days following the
Monica Lewinsky story, Mike Isikoff barely looked dressed and he
occasionally looked positively uncombed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I just got a haircut!'' Isikoff, the Newsweek reporter, who
had the Lewinsky story first, protested. He revealed that he cashed
in a gift certificate to a tony Georgetown salon that a pitying
friend gave him.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ein said: ``Because of the press of political events and the
number of programs that these people appear on, there is no time
for styling in Washington. In New York, you spend time with a
makeup guy. There's time for styling.''
</P>
<P>
   Talbot, the Salon editor, who appeared on ``Good Morning
America,'' CNN, MS-NBC and several Fox Network shows last week,
said that the most important thing to remember was not makeup or
clothes. ``It's all-nude mud-wrestling shows right now,'' he said.
``Except for Charlie Rose. So the only thing you can do now is try
and keep your dignity.''

<P>
   ``I don't consider myself a philosopher,'' Simone de Beauvoir
wrote in the second volume of her autobiography. For decades, most
philosophers have agreed with her.
</P>
<P>
   For them, the French novelist and intellectual who wrote ``The
Second Sex,'' creating modern feminism in a single, electrifying
stroke, was Jean-Paul Sartre's philosophical sidekick, a Dr. Watson
to his Sherlock Holmes. She may have promoted and applied his
French brand of existentialism, but she was not, they argued, a
philosopher in her own right.
</P>
<P>
   But now, fueled by the discovery of previously unpublished
diaries and correspondence, a growing group of philosophers and
Beauvoir scholars declare that she deserves the rarefied title of
philosopher herself. Some even argue that she was the prime
influence on Sartre. In the process, they are helping to reverse
the slide Beauvoir's reputation took a decade ago after some of the
less-than-noble details of her relationship with Sartre were
published.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always thought that Beauvoir was original in her thinking,''
said Margaret Simons, a philosophy professor and the director of
women's studies at Southern Illinois University at Edwardsville,
who will publish some of these new findings in ``Beauvoir and `The
Second Sex': Feminism, Race and the Origins of Existentialism''
next year. Beauvoir's contemporaries thought the same thing. An
eminent philosopher who sat on both Sartre's and Beauvoir's
university examination committees recalled that ``everybody agreed
that, of the two, she was the real philosopher,'' according to
Deirdre Bair's 1990 biography.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly enough, no one would more vehemently disagree with the
claim that Beauvoir was a full-blown philosopher than Beauvoir
herself. Slamming her fist on a table for emphasis and flashing her
cornflower-blue eyes, she repeatedly swore that she was Sartre's
pupil. Until the end of her life, in 1986, Beauvoir insisted that
``Philosophically I only had the role of a disciple.''
</P>
<P>
   That unflinching subordination turned their more than 50-year
partnership into one of the most fascinating and frustrating
pairings of the 20th century. As Ms. Bair describes it, the
godmother of modern feminism would drop whatever she was doing to
chauffeur, make love to, find lovers for, nurse, edit, sit with,
read to and travel with Sartre. In 1940, Beauvoir put aside her own
novel ``without the slightest pang,'' because, she wrote, ``his
theory was worth so much more than any novel I could have written
then.''
</P>
<P>
   Her letters to Nelson Algren, whom Beauvoir called ``the only
truly passionate love in my life,'' recently published in ``A
Transatlantic Affair'' (New Press, 1998) poignantly underscore the
point: She would have given up everything to be with Algren _
everything, that is, except Sartre.
</P>
<P>
   Some scholars, however, refuse to take Beauvoir at her word.
They believe that she was so caught up in protecting the image of
their ideal communion that she quashed her own contributions.
</P>
<P>
   For Ms. Simons, the proof of Beauvoir's originality lies in some
pages from her unpublished diary. In a passage written on July 10,
1927, when she was a 19-year-old philosophy student at the
Sorbonne, two years before she met Sartre, Beauvoir wrote: ``I must
rework my philosophical ideas . . . go deeper into the problems
that have appealed to me . . . The theme is almost always this
opposition of self and other that I felt at beginning to live.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't believe it,'' Ms. Simons said. ``This is
earthshaking to me. She is from the beginning very interested in
the problem of otherness.''
</P>
<P>
   For Ms. Simons, this entry and others like it contain the guts
of the existentialist theory that has long been credited to Sartre:
the idea that an individual's identity or essence isn't preordained
by God, by biology or by human nature, but begins only with the
individual's existence. What you think and do defines who you are.
</P>
<P>
   So in 1943, when Sartre wrote his existentialist manifesto,
``Being and Nothingness,'' he believed that nothing _ not money,
not social convention, not physical limitations _ could check one's
freedom. Even though an individual would always be at odds with
others, each person is totally free to choose what he does or does
not do and thus is totally responsible for all his decisions. Of
the individual's complete freedom, Sartre wrote, ``Nothing can ever
happen to it from outside.''
</P>
<P>
   Beauvoir was much more sensitive to the ways in which society
could hobble one's independence and freedom, particularly if one
belonged to the ``other'' sex, the second sex. Eleanor Holveck,
chairman of the philosophy department at Duquesne University,
explains that ``If woman is the `other,' then she can be
restricted.'' Prejudice, lack of power or unquestioned assumptions
about who brings home the bacon and who cooks it could so confine a
person's activities and imagination, that she could become unable
to ``transcend'' her particular circumstances and reach her
potential. Her freedom would be restricted.
</P>
<P>
   As Beauvoir famously wrote in ``The Second Sex:'' ``One is not
born, but rather becomes, a woman ... it is civilization as a whole
that produces this creature.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea that men are the universal gold standard and women a
second-rate alloy runs through Beauvoir's life as well as her work.
``I went to schools where girls were given textbooks exhorting them
to think like a man,'' Beauvoir said, according to Ms. Bair's
biography. ``My father praised me for having the brain of a man . .
. . No wonder I had to spend so much time thinking and writing
about myself, who and what I was.''

FORD SUPER DUTY TRUCKS ARE SUPER TOUGH, SUPER LUXURIOUS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ford's F-series pickups have been the nation's best-selling new
vehicles for more than 15 years, and the best-sellers in Texas for
the past several years. Chevrolet comes in a close second in the
Lone Star State and across the country.
</P>
<P>
   The remake of the F-150 for 1996 and the F-250 for 1997 gave the
Fords an even stronger market position over the Chevy full-size
pickups, which are just now getting updates for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   But Ford introduced yet another series of new full-size pickups
for 1999, bigger and stronger than the F-150 and F-250 models that
arrived in '96 and '97.
</P>
<P>
   They are the completely redesigned F-series Super Duty models,
introduced at January's North American International Auto Show in
Detroit. They went on sale in March, way ahead of the new
regular-duty Chevrolet and GMC full-size pickups for '99, which are
just now arriving in showrooms.
</P>
<P>
   These new Fords are the serious work trucks of the F-series
pickup line, and they are quite different from the F-150 and F-250
models that were introduced earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Designed and built on an entirely different chassis, the Super
Duty trucks _ the F-250 and F-350 _ have completely different
exteriors from the regular-duty F-150 and F-250, and are the first
heavy-duty pickups to offer four doors as the standard
configuration in the extended-cab models.
</P>
<P>
   The front end of these trucks is stronger and more
muscular-looking than the regular-duty F-series, with a pronounced
domelike hood, bright chrome grille, massive all-steel bumper and
aerodynamically styled headlights flush with the sheet metal.
</P>
<P>
   The main technical differentiation between regular-duty and
heavy-duty Ford trucks is their maximum load; the regular F-series
is designed for a gross vehicle weight (empty weighty plus
passengers and cargo) of 8,500 pounds; the Super Duty trucks are
built on a tougher steel frame for gross weights of up to 11,200
pounds.
</P>
<P>
   The Super Duty trucks come in three trim levels _ XL, XLT and
Lariat _ and are available in regular, club and crew-cab versions
with either two- or four-wheel drive.
</P>
<P>
   Our test truck for the week was the F-250 Lariat crew-cab,
long-wheelbase model, the top of the line, which has a base price
of $25,030 plus $2,810 for the Lariat package (including leather
seats) and $640 transportation.
</P>
<P>
   The crew cab has a full back seat with full-size rear doors like
a Ford Expedition or Chevy Suburban. This is the perfect vehicle
for people who routinely chauffeur adults around in the back seat
(as in a work crew, hence the ``crew cab'' designation), but also
need the pickup bed for hauling.
</P>
<P>
   The back seat is nice for the kids, too, and not quite as
crowded as that of the Super Cab models.
</P>
<P>
   Designed primarily for small-business and ranch use, these
trucks are also popular in some places _ such as Texas _ as
personal transportation, particularly by people who have active
lifestyles that involve pulling horse trailers or fifth-wheel
campers.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, you don't have to pull a trailer to justify buying
one of these. Two minutes behind the wheel of our test vehicle and
I was ready to buy one just to negotiate rush-hour traffic on the
local freeways.
</P>
<P>
   There are some drawbacks, of course. For one, it's too big to
fit in the average parking space. But out on the freeways, it's
just the thing to tame the aggressive jerks in their boy-racer cars
and pickups. Ain't nobody gonna mess with you when you're driving
one of these, I'll guarantee.
</P>
<P>
   Three engine choices are available, beginning with the 5.4-liter
Triton V-8, cranking out 235 horsepower and 335 foot-pounds of
torque. You can upgrade to the 6.8-liter Triton V-10, with 275
horsepower and 410 foot-pounds of torque. Both of these engines
operate on regular gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   If you're into serious hauling, such as a huge horse trailer
with living quarters, you might opt for the 7.3-liter turbocharged
V-8 diesel (a $4,445 option), with 235 horsepower (at just 2,700
rpm) and a whopping 500 foot-pounds of torque (at just 1,600 rpm).
This was the engine on our test truck, and the power the diesel
offered made the truck truly a joy to drive.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing not to like about these trucks. The interior is
remarkably comfortable and carlike, a clear indication that Ford
understands that people who drive these vehicles often virtually
live in them on long cross-country trips. The ride is remarkably
smooth; the suspension won't beat you to death, even on bumpy side
roads.
</P>
<P>
   Standard on the diesel models is a six-speed manual
transmission, but our test vehicle came with the optional
four-speed automatic ($970), which helped make the truck even more
carlike. Although I know there are manual-transmission purists who
would rather shift gears themselves, the automatic makes driving a
lot easier, especially when pulling a trailer on a long trip.
</P>
<P>
   There is ample room for three adults in the front seat, but if
you're alone or traveling with only a front passenger, you can fold
down the center of the seat between the driver and passenger to
form a combination armrest and mobile desk. This includes a bin
that is large enough to hold a laptop computer or portable fax
machine, and there is an extra power outlet besides the one used
for the cigarette lighter.
</P>
<P>
   A driver's side air bag is standard; a passenger air bag is
optional on XL and XLT models but was standard on our Lariat. It
comes with a deactivation switch on regular and Super Cab models so
you can put a rear-facing infant seat up front. On the crew cab
models like ours, the baby seat would have to go in the back seat.
</P>
<P>
   The cab is very carlike, with convenient and easy-to-operate
controls; big, readable instruments, and two large cupholders.
Cloth or vinyl seats are offered in base and midlevel models.
</P>
<P>
   Standard four-wheel disc brakes replace the previous front
disc/rear drum configuration, and rear-wheel antilock brakes are
standard. Four-wheel antilock brakes, included on our test vehicle,
are a $500 option _ a good safety feature to add to your list of
extra equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Other options on our vehicle included limited-slip rear axle
($260), trailer-towing package ($190), spare tire and wheel ($270),
premium in-dash AM/FM/cassette/compact disc stereo ($190), roof
clearance lights ($55), chrome rear step bumper ($150) and
trailer-hitch receiver ($150).
</P>
<P>
   Total price was $34,195, including transportation and a $1,405
options-package discount.
</P>
<P>
   F-350 Super Duty versions are available in the dual-rear-wheel
configuration commonly referred to as a ``dually,'' and even though
this is a cool truck with its wide rear end, it's a bit tough to
maneuver in city traffic. The dual rear wheels are meant for heavy
trailering.
</P>
<P>
   Fuel-economy ratings were not provided to us for any of these
trucks; the EPA does not require manufacturers to publish ratings
on vehicles over 8,500 pounds. The fuel tank on long-wheelbase
models holds 36 gallons.

 UNDATED: I was.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A pinched sense of freedom can come not only from a hostile
world, but also from friends and lovers. As Ms. Simons says of
Beauvoir, she was also all too familiar with ``the problem of
losing your self in loving the other so much that you fuse your
identity with the other.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it was Beauvoir's sensitivity to the web of relations
among people that led her to develop a full-fledged ethical theory,
says Kristana Arp, a philosophy professor and Beauvoir scholar at
Long Island University in Brooklyn. ``To will oneself free is also
to will others free,'' Beauvoir wrote in 1946 in the ``Ethics of
Ambiguity.'' Ethics were a footnote in ``Being and Nothingness,''
says Ms. Arp, but Beauvoir believed that ``in order to develop my
freedom, I have to work to develop the freedom of others.''
</P>
<P>
   Edward and Kate Fullbrook, British scholars, make the most
ambitious and controversial claim of all in their new book,
``Simone de Beauvoir: A Critical Introduction,'' (Polity Press,
1998): ``Beauvoir, and not Sartre, was the intellectual force
behind some of the key ideas which characterized French
existentialism in its most influential phase.''
</P>
<P>
   Using Sartre's wartime diaries and letters from Beauvoir, the
Fullbrooks discovered that Sarte had read an early manuscript of
Beauvoir's philosophical novel ``L'Invitee'' (``She Came to Stay'')
before he started writing ``Being and Nothingness,'' not after, as
had previously been believed. The Fullbrooks conclude that
Beauvoir's ideas in ``L'Invitee'' about relations between people,
the body, as well as the temptation to deceive oneself, or ``bad
faith,'' were not simply an application of Sartre's ideas, but the
reverse: the source of his own work.
</P>
<P>
   That's too much for even diehard Beauvoir fans. ``If she says
she got the notion of human freedom from Sartre,'' Ms. Holveck
says, ``I personally would hesitate to say that she didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   So who is the chicken and who is the egg? The truth may lie
somewhere in between. As Bob Stone, a philosophy professor at C.W.
Post College at Long Island University, says: ``It's altogether
possible that these ideas were in some sense originated by
Beauvoir, but in creative couples, there is such intense
interchange and development of ideas, it's very difficult to say
who originated the idea and who wrote it down.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, interest in Beauvoir is already ``exploding,'' says
Stone. Next year there will be a 50th anniversary celebration of
``The Second Sex,'' an international conference on the book and a
shelf full of new scholarly books published on Beauvoir.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the degree of interest isn't the only change; slowly and
subtly the sentiment surrounding Beauvoir's legacy seems to be
shifting too. Fewer than 10 years ago, when Beauvoir's and Sartre's
correspondence and diaries were published, with their disturbing
revelations of their tortured sexual lives and their manipulation
of other people, both reputations were tarnished. Shortly after
Deirdre Bair wrote her Beauvoir biography, she was stunned by how
many women she heard from, young and old, housewives and
professionals, who felt betrayed by their idol, Beauvoir. As one
said: Beauvoir ``told us she lived a perfect feminist life, so we
believed her and she inspired us, and now we don't have that
inspiration anymore. We believed her and she let us down.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the fallen idol is being picked up and dusted off. One
reason may be that feminist philosophers don't have many idols to
spare. ``Women philosophers are aware of how men discount the work
of women,'' Ms. Arp says. ``You look back and it's all Sartre,
Sartre, Sartre. What about Beauvoir? She wasn't his lap dog.''
</P>
<P>
   Another reason Beauvoir is being rehabilitated may have
something to do with the drift of feminist theory. Sonia Kruks, a
professor of political theory and the director of the women's
studies program at Oberlin College suggested that the last wave of
gender theorists, ``went too far'' in declaring that it is culture,
not biology, that determines what are male and female traits.
``People are beginning to grope for some other way to answer that
question of what is a woman.'' And that has led scholars back to
Beauvoir. Like her friend Maurice Merleau-Ponty, a philosopher,
Beauvoir investigated ``the way our bodies shape how we can
experience the world and how we can act in the world,'' Ms. Kruks
says.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the recent sympathetic fascination with Beauvoir
represents a softening in today's culture. If the mania for
exposing secret, sordid details has blunted society's sense of
shame, maybe it has also humbled the rush to judgment. People may
be more accustomed to _ if not more understanding of _ how far
short people can fall of their own ideals.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the cause, Beauvoir's philosophical rise happens to
coincide with Sartre's declining reputation and the demise of
French existentialism in general. Still, one can't help wonder
whether Beauvoir, who sacrificed so much for Sartre while they were
alive, would find much joy in finding herself elevated above him
after their deaths.

SATELLITES TO ALTER PLANES' LANDINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - A recent Continental Airlines flight that would put a
weary business traveler to sleep gave Honeywell's Michael Smith
cause to cheer.
</P>
<P>
   The flight, which started in Washington, stopped in Newark,
N.J., and landed in Minneapolis, marked the first commercial flight
using global positioning satellites to track and guide planes as
they land and take off.
</P>
<P>
   For travelers, the system promises safer landings, fewer
weather-related delays and less time thumbing through old magazines
while the plane sits on the tarmac.
</P>
<P>
   For airlines, it stands to cut down on congestion and provide
more precise data on where planes are. It also will allow airports
to consider alternative landing paths _ a big bonus for angry
people who live under existing paths.
</P>
<P>
   And for Smith, Honeywell's vice president and general manager in
Phoenix, it's a step toward the airport of the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``This landing system that we demonstrated (Monday) is one step
toward . . . the way that airplanes are going to be managed as time
goes on,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It requires the perspective of Roy Fuhrmann, aviation noise and
satellite program manager at the Metropolitan Airports Commission
in Minneapolis, to grasp the dynamics of aviation technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a whole new style of navigation capabilities that we
haven't seen for the last 30 to 40 years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The GPS landing system, called SLS-2000, was developed by
Honeywell's Glendale-based Airport Systems division and Pelorus
Navigation Systems Inc. of Calgary, Alberta.
</P>
<P>
   In the works since 1994, it is the first GPS landing system to
get full approval from the Federal Aviation Administration. And
it's expected to quickly woo the world's airports and airlines.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so good and it's so cheap . . . that there's a likelihood
that it will be adopted relatively fast,'' said Fred Abbott, vice
president of flight operations for Continental Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Honeywell is leading a government-involved consortium that will
install the system at 18 major airports and modify the aircraft of
10 airlines. The Federal Aviation Administration is expected to
kick off the consortium before the end of the year, and the planes
should be using the new equipment by this time next year.
</P>
<P>
   Most major U.S. airports use an instrument landing system. It
shoots a beam into the air about five miles out that the pilot
lines up with and follows in to land the plane. It requires pilots
to directly approach the runway, rather than coming in on a curve.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the Honeywell/Pelorus system puts equipment on the
plane that allows global positioning satellites to track its
location. A ground station processes that information, finds the
best path for the plane to land and gives exact landing directions
to the pilot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives us the opportunity to know the precise location of an
aircraft at any given time, and it gives pilots the opportunity to
fly to a specific point'' rather than tracking a beam, Fuhrmann
said.
</P>
<P>
   While an instrument landing system costs up to $1.5 million and
must be placed at the end of each runway, a single GPS ground
station runs about $500,000 and can control all runway ends within
a 30-mile radius.
</P>
<P>
   Upgrading the planes costs between $40,000 and $100,000,
depending on the kind of plane and the equipment used. That price
is expected to drop over time.
</P>
<P>
   Since the system individually maps the best route down, the
pilots can come in at a curve rather than having to follow a beam
straight into the runway.
</P>
<P>
   That's an earful for those who live near noisy flight paths.
</P>
<P>
   Don't get too excited though, Fuhrmann warns. ``The GPS doesn't
take noise out of air. It gives the community the opportunity to
more precisely define where it is that they want that noise to
go,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Also, limitations in existing technology force the airport to
require longer lag times between plane landings during bad weather,
Fuhrmann said.
</P>
<P>
   The accuracy offered by SLS-2000 should mean flights can stick
to their scheduled departure times during storms and snow flurries.
</P>
<P>
   It also will provide advantages as airports become more crowded
over the next several years. Some airports have runways so close
together that they might not allow flights to land at the same
time. The SLS-2000 should allow planes to zip in on both runways,
Abbott said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the system is just one element Honeywell is working
on to improve efficiency at airports.
</P>
<P>
   Other projects include using global positioning satellites to
track all vehicles at the airport. And Honeywell offers a lighting
system to control traffic on the tarmac. &QL;

SAME OLD FANTASY ON `ISLAND' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
FANTASY ISLAND 
Starring: Malcolm McDowell, Madchen Amick, Louis Lombardi, Edward
Hibbert, Fyvush Finkel, Sylvia Sydney 
On: ABC 
Time: Saturday at 9 p.m. 
Rated: TVPG 
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The new ``Fantasy Island'' looks absolutely fantastic. Shot on
location in Hawaii, it's a slick, inviting travel brochure of
gorgeous oceanscapes, pristine beaches, and lush green wilderness.
The mountains are majestic, and the island skies are full of drama,
with muscular clouds that speed up and slow down according to the
whims of our tasteful host, Mr. Roarke. A British gentleman with a
debonaire manner, Mr. Roarke dresses strictly in basic black,
requesting that all his predecessor's tacky white outfits be
torched.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it looks like a million bucks, but in its soul, the new
``Fantasy Island'' is still the old ``Fantasy Island,'' a
collection of superficial vignettes that are obvious, corny, and
moralistic. The darkly magical affectations are thanks to the
show's executive producer Barry Sonnenfeld, director of visually
splendid movies like ``The Addams Family'' and ``Men in Black,''
but the fluffy plot lines bear the stamp of the original show's
executive producer, a well-known cheese magnate by the name of
Aaron Spelling.
</P>
<P>
   And that's too bad, because the new ``Fantasy Island'' could
have been a latter-day ``Twilight Zone,'' with surreal adult
fantasies that delve into some unusual psychic corners. Instead,
the visitors to the island are subjected to adventures that are as
psychologically inventive as a game of Mystery Date and as familiar
as Charles Dickens's ``A Christmas Carol,'' or ``It's a Wonderful
Life.'' Tonight, a man who thinks he married the wrong woman gets
to date the right woman, who turns out to be the wrong woman;
competitive sisters go head on in a game of Jeopardy; and a man who
likes life-threatening sports activities learns to appreciate life.
By the end, all the characters have had the correct realizations.
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm McDowell is the new, improved Mr. Roarke, the wizard
behind this tropical Oz. He's part Rod Serling, part Robin Leach,
as he welcomes his guests to the island with a mysterious but
cordial air. Instead of a midget assistant named Tattoo, who sights
visitors, yelling ``Da plane, da plane!,'' he has a trio of
indentured sidekicks who quietly help him cast his spells. One of
them, played by Madchen Amick, has the ability to morph into other
physical identities. All three are bound to Roarke in some way that
may become clearer as the series develops.
</P>
<P>
   A sweet new gimmick has each episode begin and end in a musty
old travel agency on a city street, where a kindly man played by
Fyvush Finkel greets visitors destined for the island. His prickly
assistant, played by Sylvia Sydney, adds a touch of class. But the
pair might as well be planning trips for UPN's remake of ``The Love
Boat.'' It's not as good-looking as the new ``Fantasy Island,'' but
it's just as much of a throwback.

</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve-sponsored bailout of a high-flying hedge
fund Thursday signals the rest of the financial world that it's
time to race for the exits.
</P>
<P>
   Like the dreaded shout of ``Fire!'' in the apocryphal crowded
theater, the quick shuffle organized by the New York Fed to save
Long-Term Capital Management L.P. may ignite a surge.
</P>
<P>
   If Wall Street insiders can have their bacon saved by a $3.5
billion emergency bailout by other Wall Street biggies, why should
all the other likely victims of what may become a planetwide
economic retrenchment swallow their losses and sulk in silence? If
this proves to be a one-time-only favor to accommodate some
extremely well heeled insiders, then the deal will begin to smell
like a five-day old haddock.
</P>
<P>
   Long-Term Capital went short-term, disastrously, after making
its rich investors even more rich. The Wall Street Journal says
that John Meriwether's for-rich-guys-only outfit had profits of 17
percent, 41 percent, and 43 percent the past three years. And while
it is true that the emergency bailout is money from other financial
houses, the New York Fed's role in midwifing the bailout will not
escape all the other folks who stand to get hurt in this worldwide
economic swoon.
</P>
<P>
   America's farmers, for instance, are getting slaughtered by the
drop in Asian demand, an across-the-board sag in prices, and keener
foreign competition. Result? Net farm income in the United States
will fall by 16 percent this year, says the government.
</P>
<P>
   When the sodbusters of Iowa and Nebraska, and the cowpunchers of
Texas and Oklahoma, realize that their income is dropping 16
percent, while the Big Boys on Wall Street are saving each other's
bacon, there will be hell to pay. And all those Sunbelt and
Midwestern congressmen who are messing around with
What-Monica-told-Linda-about-Bill's-drawers are going to be flogged
royally if they don't deliver some fast federal relief.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Paxton's nifty tune satirizing the Chrylser bailout could
serve as an anthem for those whose interests are sacrificed by
Congress in order that the already rich stay rich. ``We were hardly
up and walking,'' croons Paxton, ``before money started talking,''
and, ``If you're a corporate Titanic, and your failure is gigantic,
down in Congress there's a safety net for you.''
</P>
<P>
   A Congress that gorges on soft money stuffed down its greasy
throat by special interests is not a Congress that will win much
sympathy when the peasantry starts to revolt. And our super-hot
economy is in danger of derailing into Gluttony Gulch.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration still predicts 2.4 percent growth for
this year. But the rest of the world is dragging us down. No one in
authority anywhere is saying things will not get worse before they
get better. Evidence keeps emerging, like fossils tossed up by a
melting glacier, that financial institutions around the world are
shakier than anyone comprehended. The gold rush mentality of the
'90s created a worldwide credit bubble that is in the process of
breaking.
</P>
<P>
   Last week one of Britain's savviest politicians came through
Boston on a book tour. Chris Patten, the last British governor of
Hong Kong, handed over the go-go Asian financial capital to the
Chinese, and then wrote a very readable and timely assessment of
what's going on in Asia, titled: ``East and West; China, Power, and
the Future of Asia.''
</P>
<P>
   Patten believes that the West obsesses about _ but fails to
understand _ China. While it has a quarter or a fifth of the
world's people, the United States exports as much to Australia (16
million people) as to China (1.2 billion). ``They're approaching a
real deflationary period in China,'' warned Patten. Then he dropped
this clue: ``I suspect their dollar-denominated debt is much
greater than they acknowledge.''
</P>
<P>
   Gulp. The big banks of Japan are under water, sucked down by
vast debts that are now virtually uncollectible. The big banks of
Europe _ France and Germany and Switzerland _ got on the Asian
gravy train early, and got off too late. Think about what happened
to the train in the Bridge over the River Kwai.
</P>
<P>
   Patten mused wryly about ``the ball-and-chain job that will be
done on the (Japanese) economy when they start closing banks,''
which everyone outside Japan regards as an inevitability. It used
to be that Asian investments were funded by government money; now
it's private capital that's at stake, and much of it will be lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``Large short-term `hot' money flows into countries with
inadequate regulation of financial services is asking for
trouble,'' shrugged the former chairman of Britain's Conservative
Party. And the piper is at the door, demanding to be paid. Patten
says private investors ``should pay a price for being rescued.''
His philosophical bottom line: ``A lot of people behaved as
greedily and stupidly as ever. I don't know how you legislate
avarice out of the human condition.''
</P>
<P>
   The US Congress _ dumber than the Duma in the collective
tendency to fiddle while financial Rome burns _ is going to face
searing heat this fall to bail out this interest or that one. It
could be worse than the S&AMP;L bailout of the '80s. And the
Republicans who just voted down the hike in the minimum wage are
going to be squirming when their pals from Wall Street show up in
``that great receiving line.''

RUSHDIE WELCOMES CHANCE TO LEAD A NORMAL LIFE AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
  (bl)  
 By SARAH LYALL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ What he longed for most of all, Salman Rushdie said,
describing nine years of living under a death sentence that clouded
his every thought, was the simple freedom to open his front door
and stroll casually down the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``Normality is a very simple thing, and yet it's the thing I've
been denied,'' Rushdie, 51, said at a jubilant news conference
here, a day after the Iranian government announced that it was
formally dissociating itself from the threat against Rushdie's
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spontaneity _ to make one's own decisions without reference to
anyone else,'' the Indian-born British writer explained. ``To do
something at the precise moment that you feel like doing it, such
as going for a walk. These are the things that are impossible when
one is in a security net. And all I've ever looked for is a return
to real life, or at least let's say the normal life of a
professional writer, and that's what I hope I can now very rapidly
regain.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in the offices of Article 19, which has campaigned
vigorously for him over the years, a relaxed, ebullient and often
very funny Rushdie said he was completely confident that the long
campaign against his life _ which began in 1989 when Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini, then Iran's supreme leader, issued a fatwa, or
religious edict, against him, accusing him of blaspheming Islam in
his novel ``Satanic Verses'' _ was finally over. But he did say
there was ``a small continued need for caution.''
</P>
<P>
   While he said he was not sure what kind of security, if any, he
will need now that the fatwa is effectively over, Rushdie said the
British authorities had persuaded him to his satisfaction that the
Iranian government no longer considered him a target.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fatwa and the bounty are matters of profound embarrassment
to the Iranian government, and I don't think we'll be hearing about
them anymore,'' Rushdie said, referring to the $2.5 million reward
for his killing that was said to have been offered by a
revolutionary group in Tehran. ``I think they're going to wither on
the vine.''
</P>
<P>
   As far as the Muslim groups who have publicly declared in the
last two days that they still believe the fatwa exists, he called
them ``dinosaurs'' who ``represent absolutely nobody.''
</P>
<P>
   Saying that anyone who tried to collect the reward ``might find
they'd gone to a lot of trouble for nothing,'' Rushdie added,
``Many of my friends are in the literary and artistic world, and
not all of them have a lot of money, and yet I'm happy to say that
nobody's tried to cash in.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As a reward for its decision to disavow the fatwa, Iran has been
granted a full restoration of diplomatic relations with Britain.
British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook told BBC radio that Britain
would work with Iran to enforce sanctions against Iraq and to help
control the drug trade from Afghanistan, and would press Iran to
take a firm line against nuclear proliferation.
</P>
<P>
   Friday was a truly strange day for Rushdie, who since 1989 has
become one of the world's most prominent proponents of freedom of
expression, published two novels, gotten married and fathered a
child, but has been unable to receive mail at his house, shop in
his local supermarket or make even the simplest excursion without
rigorous advance planning and a team of bodyguards from the Special
Branch of the British government.
</P>
<P>
   The threat to his life has been real and all-encompassing. In
July, 1991, the Japanese translator of ``The Satanic Verses,''
Hitoshi Igarashi, was stabbed to death in Tokyo. That same month,
the book's Italian translator, Ettore Capriolo, was beaten and
stabbed by a man demanding Rushdie's address; Capriolo survived.
And in October 1993, Rushdie's Norwegian publisher, William
Nygaard, was shot and seriously wounded outside his home in Oslo.
</P>
<P>
   And, Rushdie said, on a number of occasions Islamic extremists
suspected of coming to Britain to carry out the fatwa have been
expelled form the country.
</P>
<P>
   Even Friday, he and Article 19 were forced to hold their news
conference in the group's cramped offices in north London, after a
frightened tenant objected to his presence in a building down the
road.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the most worrying things around me in these years has
been the climate of fear,'' he said. ``I have been inhibited by
other people's fear. In situations where I believed there was
nothing to be afraid of, other people would be alarmed.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said he hoped that the new political developments would
put an end to all that, as well as bringing a profound new freedom
to his own life, which he said had been ``deformed'' by the fatwa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel that there is a small continued need for caution, but
it's of the sort faced by many people who for whatever reason
become prominent,'' he said. ``There are cranks that come out of
the woodwork and attack such prominent figures. This is a problem
which is real and needs to be addressed, and can be dealt with
without the colossal apparatus of state protection.''
</P>
<P>
   Again and again, Rushdie paid tribute to those who have helped
him over the years _ friends, publishers, translators, writers,
ordinary people, strangers who have expressed their support in
innumerable ways _ and said he felt very deeply that the cause went
far beyond his own situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just because somebody's life was in danger, because
the world is full of people whose lives are in danger,'' he said.
``Some incredibly important things were being fought for here. A
thing that is important to me _ the art of the novel. Beyond that,
the freedom of the imagination, and the great, overwhelming,
overarching issue of freedom of speech. The right of human beings
to walk down the street of their own country without fear.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he has struggled against it, both personally and as a
writer _ ``as a writer, I didn't want to be a creature of the
fatwa,'' he said _ Rushdie said that he had gone through terrible
times in the last decade, probably none worse than in the early,
bewildering days, when he was moving to a new house every few days
and tens of thousands of people were demonstrating against him
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had nothing to do with fear,'' he said. ``It was the shock
and grief. It's an extraordinary thing to see people walking down
the streets of foreign cities, carrying your picture with the eyes
poked out and calling for your death. It's as if somebody were to
break your picture of the world, and everything you think about
somehow ceases to be true. That's one definition of insanity.''
</P>
<P>
   Even still, he said he did not regret writing ``The Satanic
Verses,'' and would not consider for a moment withdrawing the book,
or apologizing for it. ``We have not fought a battle for freedom of
speech to give in at the last moment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that he wanted the book to return in people's minds to
``the place it belongs: the bookshelf, the bedside, the armchair
where readers read, and perhaps even the beach.'' The time had
come, he said, to leave the book to its fate, where ``people can
either like it or dislike it.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``The battle has been about free speech, and free
speech is about disagreement. And so we disagree. What I'm saying
is, `end of story. Time for next story.' ``

`I STAND ALONE': DESPAIR AND FANTASIES OF REVENGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes at end of review.)  
(lb) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Which of us hasn't at one time or another felt at
least a twinge of the despair, fury and misanthropy that engulf the
unlucky protagonist of Gaspar Noe's devastating film ``I Stand
Alone''?
</P>
<P>
   The story of an unemployed 50-year-old Parisian butcher
(Philippe Nahon), whose disgruntled bitterness accumulates into a
sustained psychotic rage, suggests a darker sequel to ``Taxi
Driver,'' filtered through Dostoyevsky by way of Godard with an
added touch of ``Hard Copy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I Stand Alone'' probes as relentlessly into the psychology of
nihilism as any movie has ever attempted. It uses the most extreme
images and jarring sound effects to brand its character's searing
message onto our brains whether we like it or not.
</P>
<P>
   Those devices include the use of amplified gunshots to demarcate
scenes, unblinking close-up images of shuddering violence (a
pregnant woman is repeatedly kicked and punched in the stomach, a
girl is shot in the throat and writhes in agonized death throes), a
swatch of hard-core pornography and a continual torrent of hateful
epithets directed at almost everybody but especially at those
suspected of being homosexual.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the harsh language isn't spoken aloud but is the
unedited, voice-over stream-of-consciousness in the boiling mind of
a man who sees the entire world as his implacable enemy.
</P>
<P>
   In the most disturbing passages of his monologue, he insists
that all human love is essentially self-interested and acquisitive,
that no matter what we tell ourselves, we are each of us forever
unutterably alone in a meaningless universe. The movie's
animalistic imagery, which includes close-ups of human hands
slicing and manipulating large chunks of red horse meat,
underscores this view of human life as essentially bestial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I Stand Alone'' begins as a staccato recap of the butcher's
life until 1980, when the story begins. As an impersonal male voice
recites his history, snapshots tracing his life and screaming
black-and-white tabloid headlines announce such themes as
``justice'' and ``morality.'' Those headlines keep appearing
through the rest of the film.
</P>
<P>
   As the story opens, the butcher has already done prison time for
assaulting a man who he mistakenly believed had raped his daughter.
With the girl institutionalized, our anti-hero, determined to start
life over, has moved from Paris to Lille, where he shares a cramped
apartment with his pregnant lover and her mother. Unable to find
employment at a deli counter (his refusal to smile when told to
brighten up costs him the job), he sinks into a despondent rage.
</P>
<P>
   After a brutal domestic quarrel, he returns to Paris and his
bleak old neighborhood, where he takes a room in a fleabag hotel
and futilely seeks employment in the meat industry.
</P>
<P>
   Each rejection spurs his increasingly violent fantasies of
revenge. Reuniting with his daughter, he takes her back to his
hotel, where he broods on how to spend the last three bullets left
in his gun. As surges of tenderness and self-pity mingle with his
vivid fantasies of incest, murder and suicide, the movie offers the
tiniest glimmer of redemption.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these glimmerings, ``I Stand Alone,'' which the New York
Film Festival is showing on Sunday at 9:45 p.m. and Tuesday at 6
p.m., is unrelievedly grim. Fleshy, hollowed-eyed and glowering
impassively, Nahon's butcher suggests a walking piece of meat wired
with dynamite. The movie's triumph _ if that's what it is _ is in
the force of its assault. It takes one man's unbearable truth and
bashes us in the skull with it. The hurt lingers.
</P>

   WASHINGTON _ Handing out emergency teaching credentials and
loading classroom duties on new teachers is the wrong way to deal
with America's overcrowded classrooms, the nation's two largest
teachers' groups said Friday.
</P>

   ``Our members know that one incompetent teacher, one unprepared
teacher in a school is one too many,'' said Sandra Feldman,
president of the American Federation of Teachers (AFT). ``They know
the children suffer and when they get those children the following
year, they suffer.''
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, more than 50,000 teachers lacked the training
required for their jobs and entered teaching on emergency or
substandard licenses, according to a 1996 report of the National
Commission on Teaching and America's Future.
</P>
<P>
   Compounding the problem, new teachers are given excessive
workloads and too little mentoring, said Bob Chase, president of
the National Education Association (NEA).
</P>
<P>
   ``Many districts talk about putting a qualified teacher in every
classroom, but in reality too often there is a sink-or-swim policy
for new teachers,'' said Chase. ``The trouble with this approach is
when a teacher sinks so do his or her students.''
</P>
<P>
   Chase suggested that new teachers' work days be divided into two
parts, one devoted to teaching and one focused on training.
</P>
<P>
   The educators' comments came at a conference on teacher quality
sponsored by the NEA, which represents more than 2.4 million
educators, and the AFT, an affiliate of the AFL-CIO labor union
confederation. Participants included teachers, school board
members, superintendents, government officials and others from 80
communities across the country.
</P>
<P>
   The conference came at a time when the nation's schools are
facing severe teacher shortages.
</P>
<P>
   In Austin, Texas, for example, public school officials this year
raced to fill 116 teacher vacancies for its 98 campuses before the
start of school Aug. 12. Most openings were for high-demand math,
science and certified bilingual and special education teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Conference participants said the outlook for solving the
shortage issue is bleak. Nearly 50 percent of new teachers in urban
schools leave within their first five years of teaching, but an
estimated 2 million new teachers will be needed in the next 10
years.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Feldman also criticized school vouchers _ public stipends that
allow low-income children to attend schools of their choosing. She
said vouchers would not solve the declining quality of education
and that more emphasis should be placed on reducing class size and
increasing teacher training.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think to experiment with America's poor children is wrong,''
Feldman said. ``We need to put in programs that we know work and
have a proven record of working.''
</P>
<P>
   Feldman and Chase said a joint council has been formed to
address such issues, and that solutions to these problems lies on
the local level. They encouraged city and state groups to continue
working on ways to prepare students for the challenges they will
face after graduation.
</P>
<P>
   Education Secretary Richard Riley also addressed the conference
and said that increased parental involvement is needed in schools
and that the ``cumbersome'' teacher certification needs to be
revamped.
</P>
<P>
   Riley suggested the enactment of student loan forgiveness
programs for students who choose teaching as a profession and
grants to help states improve their teacher certification
standards.

basketball underclassmen and even high school players head for the
pros. Experts say to look for the exodus when the two leagues
merge, or one folds. Niesha Butler, high school basketball player
in New York who is headed to Georgia Tech, wrote a piece for the
ESPN website arguing that players should have the option to go pro
early. However, college stars such as Holsclaw at Tennessee don't
seem eager to challenge the rule. (Fish, Atlanta

public as the real thing or a glorified intramural program? The
issue was brought to the forefront when the Big East Commissioner
approved an arrangement where injured UConn star Nykesha Sales got
an uncontested basket at the start of a game to give her a scoring
record. Would the same deal have been okayed for a men's game? We
talk to other commissioners about the controversy and analyze
perhaps the first popular women's sports topic on the talk shows

   Smile, cutie, and welcome to East Texas
</P>
<P>
   By Gary Borders
</P>
<P>
   Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   News item, from the Associated Press: ``Twelve Safeway employees
</P>
<P>
   have filed grievances over the supermarket chain(pi)s
</P>
<P>
   smile-and-make-eye-contact rule, complaining that they are being
</P>
<P>
   propositioned by shoppers who mistake company-required
friendliness for
</P>
<P>
   flirting.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the employees who filed the grievance said she is hit on
every day
</P>
<P>
   by men who think she is coming on to them.
</P>
<P>
   Let (begin ital) me (end ital) decide who I am going to say
hello to
</P>
<P>
   with a big smile,(pi)(pi) Richelle Roberts said in the AP story.
She added: aaA
</P>
<P>
   woman knows where and when not to open that door for certain
men.(pi)(pi)
</P>
<P>
   The company has a new policy, called ``Superior Service,'' which
requires
</P>
<P>
   employees to be friendly, and even uses undercover shoppers to
catch surly
</P>
<P>
   workers, according to the AP.
</P>
<P>
   The complaints come from Safeway workers in the San Francisco
area. The
</P>
<P>
   complaints will be heard by the National Labor Relations Board,
since the
</P>
<P>
   workers are unionized.
</P>
<P>
   I have a few observations to make:
</P>
<P>
   Any man who mistakes a cashier's smile and greeting as a
flirtation by a
</P>
<P>
   potential new love bunny has got a serious case of
swell-headedness,
</P>
<P>
   compounded by possible hallucinatory spells. He needs to take a
hard look in
</P>
<P>
   the mirror and realize that no, he is decidedly (begin ital)not
(end
</P>
<P>
   ital)God's gift to women.
</P>
<P>
   In East Texas particularly, any man delusional enough to think
every
</P>
<P>
   cashier that smiles and drawls, ``Y'all come back, now'' is
coming on to him
</P>
<P>
   likely will face at least two consequences:
</P>
<P>
   The cashier will threaten to sic her husband, boyfriend or
brother on
</P>
<P>
   the miscreant. This gentleman will be the size of a side-by-side
</P>
<P>
   refrigerator. His name will either be Bubba, or he'll have a
double name,
</P>
<P>
   such as Joe Don. The deluded Don Juan will know Bubba's name
because he will be wearing a western belt that has the name stiched
on the back. The masher might end up with the name stenciled on his
backside, if he doesn't
</P>
<P>
   immediately apologize and promise to never take liberties with
the cashier
</P>
<P>
   again.
</P>
<P>
   Or, the cashier will erupt into hysterical laughter, let her
co-workers
</P>
<P>
   in on the joke and make the masher feel about three feet tall:
``Didja heah
</P>
<P>
   what that peckerwood said to me? He thinks he's Gawd's gift to
women, and he looks lahk he got whupped by an ugly stick. Doesn't
that beat all-get-out?''
</P>
<P>
   Last, who would want to live somewhere where friendly service is
so rare
</P>
<P>
   that men think women workers who smile and say ``Hi!'' are
lusting after them?
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, folks in East Texas are friendly. We still
wave at
</P>
<P>
   pedestrians as we drive by, still allow cars to ease out of
parking lots in
</P>
<P>
   front of us on our busy streets, and still expect clerks and
cashiers to say
</P>
<P>
   thank you and hurry back.
</P>
<P>
   I said for the most part. There are some exceptions out there,
some old
</P>
<P>
   grumps and some young ones too. Sadly, even in our friendly
little town,
</P>
<P>
   there are people who don't deliver service with a smile.
Luckily, they are
</P>
<P>
   the exception.
</P>
<P>
   Rare as it may be, nothing gets on my last nerve more than a
surly
</P>
<P>
   waitress, fast-food worker or cashier. Fast-food places in my
unscientific
</P>
<P>
   view have more unfriendly and unhappy workers than other service
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The grumps are still in a minority, but there are too many folks
who will
</P>
<P>
   hand you a bag full of burgers and fries without so much as a
``thank you.''
</P>
<P>
   These workers are invariably young, and perhaps did not learn
manners as
</P>
<P>
   children. I usually try to teach them, by sarcastically saying
``you're
</P>
<P>
   welcome,'' to these future captains of industry, but I'm not
sure they get
</P>
<P>
   it.
</P>
<P>
   My policy is simple. If a hamburger or taco joint has rude or
indifferent
</P>
<P>
   workers, I go somewhere else. Lord knows there are plenty to
choose from.
</P>
<P>
   A smile and pleasant greeting go a long way. Most folks who deal
with the
</P>
<P>
   public know that. Just because a few dunderheads out there
mistake that
</P>
<P>
   friendliness for animal magnetism or some such nonsense is no
reason to quit
</P>
<P>
   doing it. Tell the Romeo wannabe to buzz off or you'll call his
wife.
</P>
<P>
   For those few in our neck of the woods who can't seem to muster
a smile or
</P>
<P>
   a thank you to their customers, I offer this bit of advice:
</P>
<P>
   Move to the big city as soon as possible. They're apparently
used to such
</P>
<P>
   behavior.

   WOMEN-EARLY _ It's only a matter of time before college
basketball underclassmen and even high school players head for the
pros. Experts say to look for the exodus when the two leagues
merge, or one folds. Niesha Butler, high school basketball player
in New York who is headed to Georgia Tech, wrote a piece for the
ESPN website arguing that players should have the option to go pro
early. However, college stars such as Holsclaw at Tennessee don't
seem eager to challenge the rule. (Fish, Atlanta

   WOMEN-SALES _ Is the perception of women's sports with the
public as the real thing or a glorified intramural program? The
issue was brought to the forefront when the Big East Commissioner
approved an arrangement where injured UConn star Nykesha Sales got
an uncontested basket at the start of a game to give her a scoring
record. Would the same deal have been okayed for a men's game? We
talk to other commissioners about the controversy and analyze
perhaps the first popular women's sports topic on the talk shows

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    By Colin Bessonette
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail
him at q&AMP;a(at)ajc.com
</P>
<P>
   Q: I know that if President Clinton resigns, or is impeached,
convicted and removed from office, Al Gore becomes president and
Gore would appoint a new vice president to replace himself. If that
happens, and then Gore is impeached, would that vice president
become president? Or would Newt Gingrich become president?
</P>
<P>
   A: In your scenario, the vice president who had been nominated
by President Gore would become president if Gore were impeached and
convicted (or if he died, resigned or left office for any reason).
Then that president would nominate another vice president, who
would be subject to congressional confirmation.
</P>
<P>
   The only way succession would come into play would be if both
the office of president and the office of vice president became
vacant at the same time; for example, if both were assassinated or
resigned. In presidential succession, the following government
officials would be next in line to the presidency, if they are
American-born: speaker of the House; president pro tempore of the
Senate; secretary of state; secretary of the treasury; secretary of
defense; attorney general; and so on down a specified line.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are legal aliens eligible for Social Security benefits?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, but several conditions must be met, said Social Security
Administration spokeswoman Patti Patterson: The person must be
lawfully admitted into the United States; must be authorized to
work; must work under a job that is covered by Social Security; and
must meet all eligibility requirements to receive Social Security
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've heard that Army is now a member of a football league.
What is it, and what other teams are members?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's Conference USA. These are all the teams: Army Cadets,
Cincinnati Bearcats, East Carolina Pirates, Houston Cougars,
Louisville Cardinals, Memphis Tigers, Southern Mississippi Golden
Eagles, Tulane Greenwave. Before this season, Army was an
independent.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What will comprise the Monet exhibit in Boston, and how can
we get tickets?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``Monet in the 20th Century,'' at Boston's Museum of Fine
Arts, is made up of more than 80 paintings. The works include
Monet's early views of his gardens at Giverny, France, with a
concentration on the Japanese bridge paintings of 1900; views of
London (1900-1904) and Venice (1908); a partial re-creation of
Monet's water lily exhibition of 1909, featuring more than 20
canvases painted between 1903 and1908; views of the water lily pond
done in Monet's new bold style between 1914 and 1918; later, more
abstract views of the famed weeping willow and Japanese bridge; and
a gathering of the enormous water lily murals painted between 1919
and 1926, some measuring more than 18 feet long.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit, which opened Sunday, closes Dec. 27. Ticket
information: 617-542-4632; general museum information:
617-267-9300. Information also can be viewed at www.mfa.org online.
After leaving Boston, the exhibition will travel to the Royal
Academy of Arts in London, where it will be on view Jan. 21-April
18.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where does the name Caesar salad originate?
</P>
<P>
   A: Imperial Julius doesn't figure into it. Nor does ``Prince''
Mike Romanoff, who popularized the salad at his Hollywood
restaurant decades ago. The salad _ made with romaine lettuce,
garlic-flavored olive oil, lemon juice, grated parmesan cheese,
Worcestershire sauce and garlic-flavored croutons (anchovies
optional) _ is generally credited to Caesar Gardini, who ran
Caesar's Place, a restaurant in Tijuana, Mexico. According to the
story, one day in the early 1920s many more hungry tourists than
expected stopped at his restaurant on their way north from the
bullfights, races, beaches and other Baja California attractions.
So he improvised a salad from the ingredients he had on hand. The
result: Caesar salad. At one time a raw or coddled egg was another
ingredient, added tableside during preparation _ but for safety
reasons, that isn't done anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We frequently see that old photo of the young Bill Clinton
shaking hands with President John F. Kennedy. Has Clinton ever said
if that meeting with Kennedy was what sparked his interest in
politics?
</P>
<P>
   A: Clinton has said that his meeting Kennedy in the White House
Rose Garden, in the summer of 1963, made him want to run for
president. The teen-ager was an Arkansas delegate to Boys Nation, a
Washington conclave sponsored by the American Legion. In
interviews, Clinton still lists that meeting as the most memorable
day of his childhood. ``I never made a secret of the fact that when
I was 16 years old, I decided, if I can do that, that's something
I'd like to do,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   But his interest in politics is said to have begun earlier, at
age 9, when he watched the Democratic and Republican nominating
conventions on television. Clinton's first political campaign was
for Congress in 1974, when he was 27. By the time he launched his
first campaign for president, Clinton had been in 17 primary and
general election campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I would like to send a letter of support to the president and
his family. What is the address?
</P>
<P>
   A: President Bill Clinton, The White House, 1600 Pennsylvania
Ave., Washington, DC 20500.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you have an address for Kenneth Starr? We want to send him
our thanks and appreciation for what he is doing.
</P>
<P>
   A: Kenneth Starr, Office of Independent Counsel, 1001
Pennsylvania Ave. N.W., Suite 490 North, Washington, DC 20001.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Television coverage of the funeral of former Alabama Gov.
George Wallace showed that his casket, as it was being carried into
the Alabama Capitol, was covered with a white cloth with a red X.
What was that about?
</P>
<P>
   A: The casket was draped with the Alabama state flag, which
bears a crimson cross on a white field. The X is enormous,
stretching across all four corners of the flag. World Book
Encyclopedia notes that the cross is suggestive of the Confederate
battle flag.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What does the B.C. stand for in the recent Professional
Golfers Association tour event, the B.C. Open in Endicott, N.Y.?
</P>
<P>
   A: Endicott is in Broome County in south-central New York state.
The Broome County Community Charities has sponsored the B.C. Open
since it began _ as the Broome County Open _ in 1971. The event's
name was abbreviated in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who was the first American pilot shot down and captured in
Southeast Asia in the '60s?
</P>
<P>
   A: Several names are sometimes mentioned, but the Dictionary of
the Vietnam War and the Encyclopedia of the Vietnam War agree that
he was Lt. (jg) Everett Alvarez Jr. of San Jose, Calif. He also was
listed as first in a People magazine interview in February 1990 in
connection with a book he co-wrote about the experience, ``Chained
Eagle.'' Piloting an A-4 Skyhawk from the USS Constellation, he was
shot down over North Vietnam on Aug. 5, 1964. Four aircraft taking
part in the air raid, code-named Pierce Arrow, were lost. Alvarez
was transferred to the prison nicknamed Hanoi Hilton and spent the
next eight-plus years as a prisoner of war.
</P>
<P>
   He was among the first group of American POWs granted freedom
after the Paris truce agreement was signed in January 1973. When he
returned home, he was awarded a Silver Star, two Legions of Merit,
two Purple Hearts and several other medals. He continued in a desk
job with the Navy until retirement in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Alvarez subsequently earned a law degree from George Washington
University and served as deputy director of the Peace Corps and
deputy administrator of the Veterans Administration (now the
Department of Veteran Affairs). At last report, he was a computer
consultant in Rockville, Md.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are President Clinton's medical records available to the
public?
</P>
<P>
   A: Generally speaking, no. They aren't public documents, said
White House spokeswoman Megan Maloney. They're his own personal
business, just like anybody else's records, she added. However, in
October 1996, before the general election in November, the White
House released Clinton's most recent such records to the media. It
was done as part of a briefing by press secretary Mike McCurry.
Internet sleuths can find it on the White House Web site _
www.whitehouse.gov _ by searching by term or by date (October
1996), Maloney said.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you refresh my memory about Victoria Woodhull, who once
ran for the presidency? Also, doesn't the Libertarian Party
frequently put women on its ticket?
</P>
<P>
   A: Victoria Claflin Woodhull (1838-1927) indeed did run for the
presidency, in 1872, as a candidate of the new Equal Rights Party.
Women's voting rights groups admired her stand in favor of allowing
women to vote, but they rejected her candidacy on other issues she
supported, such as the right of women to have love affairs, whether
married or not. She co-founded a newspaper, then used it to promote
communism, free love and legal prostitution. It also was her
platform to expose the sexual shenanigans of a powerful New York
minister, a move that led to her own jailing. In 1870, Woodhull and
her sister, Tennessee Claflin, established the first stock
brokerage firm owned by women, in New York. After divorcing her
second husband, Woodhull fled in 1877 to England, where she married
a British banker and lived until her death in 1927.
</P>
<P>
   No women have run for president on the Libertarian Party ticket,
but two _ Tonie Nathan in 1972 and Jo Jorgensen in 1996 _ have run
for vice president, said Bill Winter of the Libertarians'
Washington headquarters. Winter added that the party doesn't keep
records on women candidates who have run for all offices
nationwide. ``We don't break (candidates) down by age, race or
sex,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Have there been any other female presidential candidates
besides Victoria Woodhull?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, quite a few. Here's a sample of those in recent years,
with their party affiliation. 1968: Charlene Mitchell, Communist.
1972: Linda Jenness, Socialist Labor; Shirley Chisholm, Democratic.
1976: Margaret Wright, People's. 1980: Ellen McCormack, Right to
Life; Maureen Smith, Peace and Freedom; Dierdre Griswold, Workers
World. 1984: Sonia Johnson, Citizens. 1988: Lenora Fulani, New
Alliance; Willa Kenoyer, Citizens. 1992: Fulani; Helen Halyard,
Workers League; Isabell Masters, Looking Back; Glorida La Riva,
Workers World. Q: President Andrew Johnson was impeached by the
House of Representatives for firing a Cabinet member. Johnson was
acquitted by one vote. Who was that Cabinet member? What were the
circumstances of his removal? And did he get his job back?
</P>
<P>
   A: Johnson fired Secretary of War Edwin McMasters Stanton on
Aug. 12, 1867, and nominated Gen. Ulysses S. Grant to replace him.
The Tenure of Office Act, passed the previous March, made consent
of the Senate necessary for such removals. Stanton vacated his
office, but under protest.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate, at its next reassembling, refused to sanction
Stanton's removal, and Grant at once resigned in his favor. Then
Johnson again removed Stanton and appointed Gen. Lorenzo Thomas to
the office. The Senate declared that the president had exceeded his
authority, and the House passed a resolution, 126-47, that he be
impeached for high crimes and misdemeanors. Votes on conviction
fell just one short of the two-thirds required. Stanton then
resigned and returned to his law practice. He didn't get the
secretary of war position back, in other words.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, Grant succeeded Johnson as president and nominated
Stanton for the Supreme Court. Stanton died on Dec. 24, 1869, four
days after the nomination.

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    By Colin Bessonette
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: Q: President Andrew Johnson was impeached by the House
of Representatives for firing a Cabinet member. Johnson was
acquitted by one vote. Who was that Cabinet member? What were the
circumstances of his removal? And did he get his job back?
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is meant by the term ``the Beltway''? I heard it
referred to by a commentator in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   A: The Capital Beltway is Washington's Perimeter, I-495, which
cuts through the Virginia and Maryland suburbs. In England, ``ring
road'' is the term for the same thing. Think of a belt around one's
waist, and you have the idea.
</P>
<P>
   But the meaning here is not so literal. In referring to
Washington matters, ``inside the Beltway'' refers to the pols and
others with a government-centered mentality, and the business they
do; ``outside the Beltway'' refers to all the rest of
nongovernment-centered America.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Does President Clinton actually own a house anywhere? Does he
even own a car?
</P>
<P>
   A: Neither the president nor first lady owns a house, according
to a White House spokeswoman. Clinton does, however, own a car, a
'66 Mustang convertible which he purchased in 1991 from his
half-brother, Roger Clinton. When Clinton left Arkansas for the
White House, the car _ painted a 1960s metallic shade of blue _
stayed behind in Little Rock. It subsequently was put on display at
the Museum of Automobiles atop Petit Jean Mountain in Morrilton,
Ark. Clinton has said that he planned to retrieve the car from the
museum at the end of his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm interested in the prayer that President Clinton read when
he was addressing ministers last Friday at a prayer breakfast in
Washington. It was beautiful. Can you print it?
</P>
<P>
   A: It was a passage from a Yom Kippur liturgy contained in the
liturgy book ''Gates of Repentance,'' which Clinton said was given
to him recently by a Jewish friend. This is what he read:
</P>
<P>
   ``Now is the time for turning. The leaves are beginning to turn
from green to red to orange. The birds are beginning to turn and
are heading once more toward the south. The animals are beginning
to turn to storing their food for the winter. For leaves, birds and
animals, turning comes instinctively.
</P>
<P>
   ``But for us, turning does not come so easily. It takes an act
of will for us to make a turn. It means breaking old habits. It
means admitting that we have been wrong, and this is never easy. It
means losing face. It means starting all over again. And this is
always painful. It means saying I am sorry. It means recognizing
that we have the ability to change. These things are terribly hard
to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``But unless we turn, we will be trapped forever in yesterday's
ways. Lord help us to turn from callousness to sensitivity, from
hostility to love, from pettiness to purpose, from envy to
contentment, from carelessness to discipline, from fear to faith.
Turn us around, oh, Lord, and bring us back toward you. Revive our
lives as at the beginning. And turn us toward each other, Lord, for
in isolation, there is no life.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: More than 65 percent of the American public has indicated
through numerous polls that we do not want impeachment proceedings
against President Clinton. If Congress decides to act contrary to
the wish of the people, is there any procedure by which the people
(apart from their elected representatives) can take formal steps to
petition and direct the Congress to comply with the wish of the
people?
</P>
<P>
   A: Other than voting against your representative at the next
election if he or she doesn't act in accordance with your wishes,
there's no formal means for voters to ``order'' Congress to do
anything. But Emmett H. Buell, professor of political science at
Denison University in Granville, Ohio, says there's a ``mistakenly
static frame of mind'' inherent in the question. Polls may change,
and public support for Clinton may erode, as inquiries progress.
There was a time, for example, when most Americans didn't think
President Richard Nixon should be forced from office, Buell said,
but as evidence steadily mounted that he had lied and abused his
power, his support eventually eroded in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Buell also pointed out that a majority isn't always right,
especially if it has limited information on which to base its
judgment. Members of the House of Representatives have more
information than private citizens do, he said, adding: ``They're
making a good deal of it available to us, however, and more
information may indeed change the public's mind. But in any case,
the idea that a partially informed majority is always right, as
reflected in a simple poll question, is not what the Founding
Fathers intended for this system, and is not the best means of
making important decisions like the one facing the country today.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: What was the date when Rep. Bob Barr (R-Ga.) first called for
impeachment of President Clinton?
</P>
<P>
   A: Barr wrote a letter in March 1997 to Rep. Henry Hyde
(R-Ill.), chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, asking Hyde to
consider beginning an impeachment inquiry of Clinton and Vice
President Al Gore. An article in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution
on March 15, 1997, reporting Barr's request, quoted Rep. John
Conyers of Michigan, the ranking Democrat on the committee, as
saying most members of Congress would reject Barr's call. ``His
activity is on the political margins and won't be taken
seriously.'' Barr responded to that by saying, ``I haven't taken a
cheap shot. It is a very measured request. I have not asked for
articles of impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Will you print the exact text of the U.S. president's oath of
office? Where is the wording stipulated?
</P>
<P>
   A: Article II, Section 1, clause 8 of the Constitution sets out
the words that every president has restated at inauguration
(capitalization as in the Constitution): ``I do solemnly swear (or
affirm) that I will faithfully executive the Office of President of
the United States, and will to the best of my Ability, preserve,
protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   The oath is the only part of the inaugural ceremony required by
the Constitution. Only Franklin Pierce in 1853 affirmed, rather
than swore, to faithfully execute the office that he was about to
enter. The practice of adding the words ``so help me God'' at the
conclusion of the oath was begun by George Washington at the first
inaugural ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What would President Clinton's pension be if he resigns? What
if he is impeached? Would he still be eligible for other perks, and
in what amount?
</P>
<P>
   A: If he resigns, Clinton will be eligible for a pension of
$151,800 a year, said Pete Sepp of the National Taxpayers Union.
Under the Former President's Act of 1958, he is entitled to that
pension only if he is not impeached. He can resign, he can stick it
out to the end of his term, and he even can be convicted outside
the impeachment process _ such as in a criminal case or civil suit
after he leaves office _ but if he is impeached and convicted by
Congress, he forfeits the pension as well as his office allowances.
Those allowances can be as much as $650,000 a year, Sepp said.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have been impressed by the insights in the national media
from George Stephanopoulos. Will you refresh my memory about the
circumstances surrounding his departure from the White House? What
was the official explanation?
</P>
<P>
   A: It was in December 1996 that Stephanopoulos, after five years
on President Clinton's White House team _ first as communications
director and later as senior adviser _ accepted a visiting
professorship at Columbia University, teaching a subject he knows
well: political science. He also announced his intention to join
ABC News as a contributing correspondent.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews in 1996, Stephanopoulos said this about his career
change: ``It just felt perfect. . . . I love New York. Columbia's
not only a top-ranked university, it's my alma mater.'' (He
graduated in 1982 with a bachelor's degree in political science,
summa cum laude, before going on to earn a master's in theology as
a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford).
</P>
<P>
   He admitted that it would be ``very hard'' to leave the White
House, adding, ``I'm going to miss him (Clinton) and it's tough to
leave the excitement of the White House. But it's time.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Was a list of the victims aboard Swissair Flight 111 ever
released?
</P>
<P>
   A: You can find the names (passengers and crew) on the Internet:
www.cnn.com/WORLD/americas/9809/04/victim.list.01/
</P>
<P>
   Q: Mark McGwire has been taking some type of muscle stimulant
medication. Is Sammy Sosa also taking this?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's been widely reported that McGwire has been using
Androstenedione _ legal in baseball, but banned in the NFL,
Olympics and NCAA _ for more than a year. The over-the-counter drug
raises levels of the male hormone testosterone, which builds lean
muscle mass and promotes recovery after injury. Sosa says he
doesn't use Androstenedione or any other testosterone booster, but
admits to using the muscle-builder Creatine, an amino-acid powder,
after games to keep up his weight and strength. For energy before
games, Sosa says he takes the Chinese herb ginseng. McGwire also
says he takes Creatine.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Does the violinist Midori have any other name? When did she
start playing?
</P>
<P>
   A: Midori hasn't used her last name, Goto, professionally since
1986. She was born Oct. 25, 1971, in Osaka, Japan. Her father was
an engineer and her mother, Setsu Goto, a professional violinist.
Her mother began teaching her to play when she was 3, and when she
was 6, Midori gave her first public recital. She made her U.S.
debut at the 1981 Aspen Music Festival in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A newspaper column listed presidents who were involved or
rumored to have been involved in affairs before or during marriage.
George Bush was mentioned in connection with a Jennifer Fitzgerald.
Where did that information come from? I've never heard or read
about that.
</P>
<P>
   A: The list in the column you saw was compiled by the Fort Worth
(Texas) Star-Telegram. But long-whispered rumors about the
relationship have circulated, mainly outside the mainstream press,
for some time. The rumors were never substantiated, despite
investigations by a number of news organizations.
</P>
<P>
   It's no secret that Fitzgerald worked closely with Bush when he
was ambassador to China in 1974, and, in 1975, she was his personal
assistant at the CIA. She did the same job for Bush when he became
vice president. As president, he made her deputy chief of protocol.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, that doesn't mean there was any untoward relationship.
But rumors nevertheless cropped up. For example, at the end of the
1988 presidential campaign, the Los Angeles Weekly, an alternative
newspaper, printed an old tale that she had been Bush's mistress.
In a recap two years later, the Independent of London wrote: ``Wall
Street prices briefly plunged for fear that mainstream newspapers
would pick up the story, destroy Mr. Bush's image as a family man
and dissolve his commanding lead. . . . The story was reprinted
abroad but ignored by the U.S. news media.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, the tabloid New York Post printed an article based on
the book ``The Power House'' by Susan B. Trento, a former
congressional aide. Asked about the newspaper report, Bush said,
``I will not respond to it. I have not responded to it in the
past.'' He then continued, ``Except to say it's a lie.'' Mary
Matalin, the Bush campaign's political director, blamed Democrats
for peddling the story.

AUDITOR'S REPORT ADDS WELCOME FUEL TO RAGING DEBATE OVER
SUBSIDIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Mark Funkhouser's name is probably mud in
local development circles, but his challenging analysis of Kansas
City's favorite business tax incentive is nevertheless a highly
important contribution to the public policy debate hereabouts.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Kansas City auditor focused exclusively on Kansas
City projects, the questions that his findings raised probably will
influence future tax-subsidy policy throughout the area.
</P>
<P>
   Funkhouser's report called into question the economic
assumptions used to sell tax incentives as a spur to commercial
development. The concept in question assumes that revenues
initially forgone by governments to encourage development will be
more than recouped later from economic activity generated by the
development.
</P>
<P>
   In Kansas City's case, the incentive of choice is known as tax
increment financing, or TIF. It allows diversion of some new taxes
from real estate developments to reimburse developers for eligible
costs. The auditor's review of two dozen projects showed revenue
falling far short of estimates initially used to help justify tax
breaks for those developments.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the city's Tax Increment Financing Commission, John
Crawford, called Funkhouser's work ``profoundly flawed'' because it
didn't account for all the revenue that should be attributed to the
developments.
</P>
<P>
   Crawford's criticism probably will be only the first such salvo
fired at the auditor's study, because there's a lot of room for
debate when it comes to this issue. A good argument can be made, in
fact, for the rationality of public subsidies for private projects
in some cases. Critics, however, say the tax-subsidy concept is
used to indefensible excess.
</P>
<P>
   TIF defenders argue that it's a much better tool than, say, tax
abatement because it requires its beneficiaries to be more
accountable. Opponents counter that some TIF deals still create too
much risk for taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   This is why Funkhouser's study is a valuable addition to the
debate about public-private cooperative ventures. It gives the
skeptics more leverage to force developers and their public-sector
advocates to justify subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   Taxpayer considerations aside, such subsidies can encourage
misallocation of capital and result in failures that are costly to
the community in many other ways. In a grander sense, Asia's
horrendous problems serve as a dramatic reminder of how badly
things can go wrong if capital gets misallocated to economically
unsound investments.
</P>
<P>
   The problem isn't just TIF, and it's not just Kansas City. It's
the entire national panoply of tax breaks often conferred whether
merited or not.
</P>
<P>
   Funkhouser's willingness to challenge the economics of
questionable tax incentives as a development tool makes the city
auditor a rarity for a public official. Seldom does anyone inside
City Hall decide to fight City Hall. Such policy challenges usually
are mounted from outside the establishment by maverick anti-tax
watchdog groups.
</P>
<P>
   Funkhouser may get beat up in this battle, if indeed a battle is
what is made of it. What he will accomplish, though, is to remind
all those with a stake in the process that tax incentives for
business aren't always slam-dunk, win-win propositions for the
community.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes they are, sometimes they're not. If Funkhouser brings
more judiciousness to the process, he will have won his place in
the taxpayers' Hall of Champions.

   UNDATED: but not impeachable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The country isn't in crisis. The media and political systems
are the ones...'' said Iowa State University history professor
Hamilton Cravens. ``We're at the point of eviscerating the
presidency so that anyone can be driven out of office by a
sophisticated public relations campaign. There's your crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats hope that the time is ripe for a compromise,
especially after Clinton's videotaped testimony that actually
helped him in the polls. They are talking up different censure
proposals, including one that would have Clinton coming to the Hill
and trying to explain himself.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans don't seem to be buying, many taking the tack of
Sen. John Ashcroft of Missouri, to whom censure is meaningless.
</P>
<P>
   Partisanship is part of the problem, Cravens said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who's going to broker that deal _ Newt Gingrich and Dick
Gephardt?'' he asked, referring to the combative party leaders in
the House. ``The situation is too polarized. Everyone's speaking
through megaphones.''
</P>
<P>
   Erik Smith, a spokesman for Minority Leader Gephardt, on Tuesday
said that ``there is no such thing as censure at this point,''
because Congress has no constitutional blueprint for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The polls and talking heads are getting way out ahead of
themselves. They're negotiating options in the media that don't
exist.''
</P>
<P>
   And Speaker Gingrich on Wednesday indicated that Republicans
weren't interested in negotiating before a House investigation is
finished. Any compromise now ``simply puts the cart in front of the
horse,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   - Impeach: to challenge the practices or honesty of; accuse;
esp., to bring a public official before the proper tribunal on
charges of wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Impeachment proceedings would stretch several months, amounting
to what Democratic U.S. Sen. John Kerry described as ``water
torture'' for the president.
</P>
<P>
   Still, 41 percent of Americans polled this week by ABC News
favor this option _ and not necessarily because they all want
Clinton out of office.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we truly believe our constitutional system is a good one,
I'm perfectly happy to let the institutions work,'' said Loomis.
``It might be ugly, but that may be the best option for the country
in the long run.''
</P>
<P>
   A legion of academics say impeachment _ divisive as it it sounds
_ may be the only route to closure. It's how Congress is supposed
to address questions of alleged ``high crimes and misdemeanors'' by
the president. In the end, the scholars note, Clinton could survive
the process and history may grant him a measure of sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   The impeachment process begins with a series of U.S. House
hearings and resolutions _ part legal and part political. But it's
in the Senate, which currently holds 45 Democrats, where Clinton
would be tried. Conviction and removal from office requires a
two-thirds vote of all 100 senators _ a tall order in any event.
</P>
<P>
   Even ferocious White House critics such as Larry Klayman,
director of Judicial Watch, say the country would best be served by
witnessing Clinton's impeachment. He believes removal could be then
followed by criminal prosecution for alleged obstruction of
justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Presidents should be held accountable,'' said Klayman. ``A
resignation would merely return us to 1974, when (President Nixon)
got off scot-free, received his pension and, in some corners, was
ultimately vindicated as a leader. It sent a signal that a
president is above the law.''
</P>
<P>
   - Drop it: to stop, end or have done with.
</P>
<P>
   Now you're dreaming, say Washington watchers.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the beltway, dropping it remains a rather popular
option. Between 30 and 50 percent of Americans have told pollsters
from the start that the sex scandal is insignificant, certainly not
worth the full-bore attention of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people have already decided: they don't want to listen to
this,'' argues professor Cravens.
</P>
<P>
   To lobbyist Clemente, the motivation is: ``the Republicans get a
two-fer. It distracts the country away from any substantive issues
at election time. And it's likely to increase the turnout of people
who hate Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank Luntz, a GOP pollster, agreed that the scandal is driving
other legislative issues ``not only off the front pages, but also
off the inside pages.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, backers of the movement to set national standards
for HMOs and managed-care plans _ a hot campaign issue a few months
ago _ now say their proposals are all but dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``HMO reforms are getting buried in Monica Lewinsky's
skirttails,'' said Jamie Court of the political action group
Consumers for Quality Care. ``The sex scandal has turned attention
away from the real tough issues. A lot of politicians running for
re-election are pretty glad about that.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the Pew Center for the People and the Press, 36
percent of adults are following news of the president's problems
``very closely.'' That's double the attention they say they're
paying to news about instability in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   But by Pew's measures, the sex scandal wasn't even the top story
of the summer (45 percent of people said they paid very close
attention to the shootings of police officers at the U.S. Capitol).
Indeed, more than 100 news events of the past decade drew equal or
greater attention in the Pew Center surveys than has the Clinton
sex scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Then why can't Washington let it go?
</P>
<P>
   ``People still want to hear about education, Social Security and
those issues,'' said Pew Center director Andrew Kohut. ``But we're
also seeing an uptick in (concern for) morality as an issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Uptick or turnoff, the scandal will be with us for months.
</P>
<P>
   ``No way they'll drop it,'' said Clemente. ``It's herd
mentality. It's what everyone hates about politics.''

 UNDATED: being misunderstood.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A shy, aloof boy, Lindbergh was the son of two sadly mismatched
parents who spent much of the time apart, and his experience of
their contentious marriage seems to have left him with a lasting
sense of displacement.
</P>
<P>
   Although his marriage to Anne Morrow, the daughter of an
American ambassador, was a love match, their relationship soon
became a one-sided affair, with Lindbergh setting the agenda and
Anne doing her best to accommodate and please. After the birth of
each of their six children, Berg observes, Lindbergh would take his
wife away on a long plane journey _ often weeks in length _ as a
way of ``weaning'' her from her children. He bristled at her
displays of emotion (even in the wake of the kidnapping) and
rebuked her when she complained of writer's block.
</P>
<P>
   Anne's growing independence, which sprang largely from
Lindbergh's encouraging her to find her own voice as a writer,
apparently provoked ``greater intolerance'' on his part. Lindbergh
was constantly on the road, on business or pleasure, and Anne, Berg
suggests, began to welcome his long absences from home.
</P>
<P>
   Although the highly private Lindbergh loathed his own celebrity,
he determined to use it to promote causes he believed in, including
commercial aviation, conservation and, during the early '40s, the
isolationist America First movement, which aimed to keep the United
States out of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Lindbergh was not simply concerned about the adverse effects the
war might have on America; he saw the conflict as marginal to the
country's interests. In one speech, he asserted that it was not a
war ``in which our civilization is defending itself against some
Asiatic intruder,'' that it was ``not a question of banding
together to defend the white race against foreign invasion.''
</P>
<P>
   He complained that American Jews were pushing the country into
the war, and declared that ``their greatest danger to this country
lies in their large ownership and influence in our motion pictures,
our press, our radio and our government.''
</P>
<P>
   During a trip to Berlin in 1938, Lindbergh accepted a decoration
for his services to world aviation from Goering, and he would speak
frequently of his admiration for aspects of Nazi Germany. ``I
shared the repulsion that democratic peoples felt in viewing the
demagoguery of Hitler, the controlled elections, the secret
police,'' he explained. ``Yet I felt that I was seeing in Germany,
despite the crudeness of its form, the inevitable alternative to
decline _ a challenge based more on the drive to achieve success
despite established `right' and law.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Berg quotes such damning statements by Lindbergh, and
also quotes anti-Semitic passages that were expurgated from
Lindbergh's published diaries, he does little to explain why, in
his words, the pilot ``buried his head in the sand when confronted
with the crimes of inhumanity that repelled so many others.''
</P>
<P>
   At times, Berg sounds as though he were trying to rationalize
Lindbergh's actions. He writes that ``the Lindberghs were hardly
alone in being swayed by Hitler's magnetism.'' He writes that
Lindbergh's interest in ``race betterment'' _ which came at the
same time that Nazi Germany was obsessed with eugenics _ was an
unfortunate ``coincidence that would not be lost on future
detractors.''
</P>
<P>
   And he argues that Lindbergh's critics often judged him by his
fanatical followers (like the Rev. Charles Edward Coughlin),
although Lindbergh himself ``never associated with any pro-Nazi or
anti-Semitic organization; he never attended any Bund meetings; and
since more than four months before the outbreak of war in Europe,
he had neither consorted nor consulted with anyone known to have
any connections with the Third Reich.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Berg's depiction of Lindbergh as ``naive in war as
he had been in peace'' is insufficient _ particularly when
Lindbergh never recanted his most explosive isolationist
statements, when he never even conceded, as his wife did, that ``we
were both very blind, especially in the beginning, to the worst
evils of the Nazi system.'' It is a serious flaw in a biography, a
flaw that casts a dark shadow over the dazzling writerly
achievement on display in the first half of this uneven volume.

NATION WAITS FOR WHEEL OF WASHINGTON ROULETTE TO STOP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICK MONTGOMERY  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: In this game of Washington roulette, a restless nation
waits for the spinning to stop and for President Clinton's fate to
be decided.
</P>
<P>
   One space on the wheel says ``resign,'' but few are betting on
it. The pointer appears to be clicking past a peculiar space
labeled ``censure'' and moving toward another marked ``impeachment
hearings.''
</P>
<P>
   Public opinion polls _ no small factor in this game _ reveal an
audience torn in all directions in month nine of the Monica
Lewinsky scandal. Everybody thinks they know what's best for the
Republic.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 newspapers have called for Clinton's resignation.
White House spokesman Mike McCurry has replied, ``Absolutely not.''
</P>
<P>
   Most Democrats seem to favor an immediate ``censure'' of
Clinton. There's even a variety of ``censure-plus'' proposals,
including some carrying fines or involving a criminal trial of the
president on charges of perjury and obstruction of justice when he
completes his term.
</P>
<P>
   To that, constitutional scholars scratch their heads. The rules
of this contest don't even include ``censure,'' not to mention
censure-plus, they say.
</P>
<P>
   At least you can find impeachment not only on the wheel, but in
the Constitution, say Republicans, who like the odds.
</P>
<P>
   A insider's tip. Don't bet on the space marked ``drop the
matter,'' the one that would end the game.
</P>
<P>
   A glance at each possibility:
</P>
<P>
   - Resign: to give up an office, position of employment, etc.,
esp. by formal notice.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers that have joined Republicans calling for the
president to short-circuit the system range from USA Today to The
Topeka Capital-Journal. The Chicago Tribune piped in last week:
``If he truly cares about the nation, and not just himself, he will
step down and spare us the constitutional crisis toward which his
recklessness has propelled us.''
</P>
<P>
   This option runs into several obstacles.
</P>
<P>
   First is the widespread belief among Clinton observers _ friends
and foes _ that the president holds too high of an opinion of his
skills to quit over a partisan inquest into sex and lies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nope,'' said Frank Clemente, executive director of the Public
Citizens Congress Watch, a consumers lobby in Washington. ``Just
isn't in his personality,''
</P>
<P>
   Public opinion presents a second barrier. For all the poll
numbers that refect a growing distrust of Clinton, Americans
dislike the media even more. Fifty-five percent of Iowans surveyed
by a Republican polling company said it was ``inappropriate'' for
the media to call for the president's resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, a CBS News poll after the airing of Clinton's
testimony showed his job-approval rating at 68 percent. Six of 10
respondents said he should finish his term, compared to 38 percent
who said resignation would be ``better for the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Others argue that a second presidential resignation in a
quarter-century would mark a trend, one that could erode the
stability of the office and undermine the federal system of checks
and balances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm somewhat appalled to hear eveyone today say `resign,' ''
former Nixon aide Alexander Haig told The Wall Street Journal.
``That's not what our founding fathers had in mind, and I don't
think it's due process for our president.''
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, which operates under a parliamentary system, four
prime ministers have resigned in five years. Parliamentary regimes
place heads of state at the mercy of the ruling power in the
legislature. A change in party rule or a collapse in support
trigger changes at the top.
</P>
<P>
   Framers of the Constitution sought something else: a president
separate from the legislative branch and just as powerful.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Clinton decides to resign next week,'' said University of
Kansas political science professor Burdett Loomis, ``then
essentially the key players in this whole scandal become Ken Starr
and the media.''
</P>
<P>
   - Censure: a condemnation as wrong; strong disapproval.
</P>
<P>
   Although this option is not spelled out in the Constitution,
legislators regard censures as formal reprimands that carry no
legal penalty and require only a majority vote.
</P>
<P>
   The House has conducted censure proceedings against its own
members 36 times, the last three for allegations of sexual
misconduct. The Senate has censured nine members, including
anti-communist crusader Sen. Joe McCarthy.
</P>
<P>
   The only U.S. president to be censured was Andrew Jackson in
1834. The Senate on a 26-20 vote took the action after Jackson _ a
critic of the Bank of the United States _ fired his Treasury
secretary for refusing to deposit federal revenues in state banks.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution charged that he ``assumed an exercise of power
not granted him by the Constitution (and) dangerous to the
liberties of the people.''
</P>
<P>
   Senators who pushed it ``were making up the rules as they went
along,'' said Harold Moser, editor of Jackson's papers at the
University of Tennessee. ``It was all politics.''
</P>
<P>
   The popular Jackson _ ``Old Hickory'' to his contemporaries _
worked the showdown to his advantage. He argued that members of
Congress were obliged to protect the interests of states and
districts, and only he, the president, represented all Americans.
In the final weeks of Jackson's second term, the Senate expunged
the censure. It was literally blackened out of the legislative
record.
</P>
<P>
   Opinion polls portray the public as more supportive of a Clinton
censure over impeachment or resignation. One survey, however, found
that four out of 10 Americans ``don't know what censure means.''
</P>
<P>
   Some experts see it as a compromise measure against behavior
that may be disturbing but not impeachable. MORE

GROUP URGES INCREASED SPENDING ON PROSTATE CANCER RESEARCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A group led by Michael Milken, the former junk bond
king, urged Congress Friday to significantly increase funding for
prostate cancer research, bolstering its call with 500,000
petitions from around the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sad fact is that men have not spoken out,'' Milken told a
news conference in front of the U.S. Capitol. As a result, Milken
said ``prostate cancer funding is too low.''
</P>
<P>
   Prostate cancer is the No. 2 cancer killer of American men.
</P>
<P>
   Milken, who has battled the cancer since 1993, founded a private
organization _ called CapCure _ that funds promising prostate
cancer research programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We absolutely must do more to fight this dreadful disease,''
said John Kelly, vice chairman of the American Cancer Society's
board of directors. ``We need a nationwide commitment to expand
prostate cancer research efforts in order to better understand and
prevent this disease.''
</P>
<P>
   Jay Hedlund, the president of the Washington, D.C.-based
National Prostate Cancer Coalition, said the government had ignored
the statistics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite nearly 20 percent of all cancers diagnosed each year
being prostate cancer, until now less than four percent of total
federal funds for cancer research have been devoted to prostate
cancer,'' said Hedlund, standing next to more than a dozen boxes
filled with petitions from prostate cancer survivors, their family
members and others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prostate cancer research money has been left behind,'' Hedlund
said.
</P>
<P>
   The news conference coincided with a rally in Washington this
weekend that seeks more federal research into all types of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The petitions, gathered from all 50 states and the District of
Columbia, call on Congress and President Clinton ``to commit to
eradicating prostate cancer, the leading form of cancer in men, by
increasing funding for research and making prostate cancer a
national priority.''
</P>
<P>
   The petitions and steady lobbying by those advocating stepped up
spending on prostate-cancer research may be having an effect on
Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate wants to boost the National Institutes of Health's
annual prostate cancer budget to about $175 million, from this
year's $114 million. Those lobbying for more research spending also
are confident that the Pentagon will provide $60 million. The
Defense Department provides more than $100 million each year for
breast cancer research.
</P>
<P>
   Some 184,500 men will be diagnosed with carcinoma of the
prostate this year, making it the most diagnosed cancer in the
United States next to highly curable forms of skin cancer. Nearly
40,000 American men will die from the cancer, while lung cancer
will kill 93,000 American men, according to the American Cancer
Society.
</P>
<P>
   But prostate cancer research receives comparatively little from
the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   Breast cancer and prostate cancer killed about the same number
of Americans in 1997 _ 43,900 women and 41,800 men, respectively _
while about 14,000 people died from AIDs-related illnesses over the
same period.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the NIH (which includes the National Cancer Institute) spent
about $107,214 in AIDS research for every AIDS-related death in
1997; $9,362 in breast cancer research for every death; and $2,512
in prostate cancer research for each person who died from the
disease.
</P>
<P>
   One explanation for the lopsided funding, Milken said, is that
men are too embarrassed to speak out about the disease because
treatments can curtail sexual function and urinary continence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too late to be quiet,'' Milken said. ``It's time prostate
cancer comes out of the closet.''

HIS WORK DOES THE TALKING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID GREENBERG  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Sergio Aragones arrived in New York City in the
summer of 1962 with $40 in cash, a portfolio of cartoon strips and
dreams of making it big.
</P>
<P>
   Although he knew only a few words of English, the Spanish-born
artist managed to sell a few cartoons to small adventure and adult
magazines. To earn spending money, he performed the works of slain
Spanish poet and playwright Federico Garcia Lorca on street
corners, then passed the hat. He lived on salami sandwiches and
tomato soup made by dumping ketchup into hot water.
</P>
<P>
   And, eventually, Aragones went mad.
</P>
<P>
   Or, more precisely, he went to MAD _ the offbeat monthly
magazine with an international following of fans loyal to its
irreverent parodies. Struck by Aragones' lampoons during their
first meeting, the magazine's editors bought 10 cartoon strips for
$200. And Aragones launched the career he had dreamed of since he
was a child.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm doing exactly what I was doing in the third grade _
telling stories to my buddies,'' said Aragones, 61. ``Only the
teacher doesn't yell at me anymore, and people pay for my
stories.''
</P>
<P>
   From a cluttered studio above a Radio Shack in Ojai, where he
has lived since 1983, Aragones creates the pointed jibes that have
won him a following among MAD readers and admiration from fellow
cartoonists around the world. He has the distinction of being part
of MAD's ``usual gang of idiots'' _ the way the magazine's masthead
lists its staffers and regular contributors.
</P>
<P>
   Aragones possesses a cynical outlook that is perfectly suited to
MAD, a 500,000-circulation magazine that mocks everything and
everybody: war, schools, work, marriage, vacations, holidays,
movies, television, politics and social issues.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to ``A MAD Look At ...'' _ contributions that carry
his ``Serge-in General Dept.'' tag line _ Aragones is known for his
tiny but thought-provoking visual japes in the margins of other
cartoonists' strips.
</P>
<P>
   In his MAD strips and his series of limited-edition comic books,
Aragones satirizes the lighter side of everyday life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cartoons are a therapy for everything in life,'' he said.
``There is a balance. I'm angry about something, but I'm also happy
about something.''
</P>
<P>
   His offbeat humor and immediately recognizable style have won
him several awards from the National Cartoonists Society, including
Best Cartoonist honors in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sergio's one of the most admired cartoonists in the
business,'' said Charles M. Schulz, the legendary creator of the
``Peanuts'' strip. ``It does not matter what cartoonist it is. They
all think he is wonderful. He simply draws everything funny.''
</P>
<P>
   When Aragones is not drawing, he is thinking about what to draw.
Everything he sees and hears has the potential to evolve into a
cartoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Cartoonists) are basically critical of everything,'' Aragones
said. ``They see the foibles of man. The weaknesses of man. The
abuses that man inflicts onto men.''
</P>
<P>
   It is from that point of view that Aragones created ``MAD's
Do-It-Yourself Complete Clinton Scandal Guide,'' ``The Mall-Rat
Olympics'' and ``A Typical Religious Fanatic Tract,'' which
advertises a make-believe book titled ``Inspirational Divine
Institute of Total Salvation'' _ a tome with the acronym IDIOTS.
</P>
<P>
   Aragones' oblique outlook is easily woven into the MAD fabric,
according to Al Jaffee, another legendary MAD cartoonist, whose
work first appeared in 1955, when the magazine was just 3 years
old.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just a natural-born cartoonist,'' Jaffee said. ``He's a
cartoonist's cartoonist because he's admired by all. He makes it
look easy. He makes it look like anyone could do it. And of course,
anyone can't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Jaffee added that Aragones has a ``tremendous
personality,'' Aragones himself warns that he and his peers are
serious people _ even boring at times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to be funny on paper,'' Aragones said. ``I go to a
party, and I'm the guy who sits there and listens to the jokes. I
don't know how to tell a joke. I forget the ending.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, outside the office, he is not above moments of impromptu
silliness.
</P>
<P>
   During a trip to Italy, for instance, Aragones and other MAD
staffers were among the tourists snapping photographs of the
Vatican when a group of local shoe factory workers marched by in
protest of their low wages.
</P>
<P>
   Aragones quickly borrowed one of the picket signs and stomped
back to his friends, screaming, ``Americans go home! Americans go
home!''
</P>
<P>
   The situation become amusingly chaotic, he recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American (tourists) who didn't know us ran away,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Aragones is admittedly an emotional man, prone to hysterical
laughter and volcanic outbursts _ born from frustration rather than
raw anger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Latinos come down very fast,'' he said. ``We get very excited,
we shout, then _ boom _ it's off.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a personality that evolved from the years Aragones spent
with his politically outspoken father, who moved the family to
France when civil war swept through Spain. When France fell under
siege by Hitler, the family fled again _ this time to Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   A habitual doodler, Aragones fondly recalled drawing mocking
caricatures of his teachers while attending school in Mexico City.
After being chastised for not paying attention, he learned how to
simultaneously sketch and listen, and he joyfully irritated his
teachers by giving correct answers when called on in class.
</P>
<P>
   To please his parents, who wanted to place a security blanket
around their would-be starving artist son, Aragones enrolled in the
University of Mexico to study architecture. He dropped out after
three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I was going to make it as a cartoonist,'' he said.
``There couldn't have been another life for me.''
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1962, Aragones headed for New York. In the
spirit of Beat icon Jack Kerouac, Aragones slept on the bus at
night and spent his days touring cities that looked like they had
something to offer. Then he hand-bathed in bus station bathrooms
and hopped the next bus headed to Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   After finally arriving in Pennsylvania Station, Aragones spent
his first night in New York sleeping on a park bench by the East
River. The owner of El Flamenco, a coffeehouse on McDougal Street,
befriended him and gave him food, money and a cot in the basement.
But he forgot Aragones was downstairs when he locked up for the
night, so the struggling artist found himself a prisoner until the
owner returned the following day.
</P>
<P>
   ``My second day, I just saw New York from a window,'' Aragones
said.
</P>
<P>
   When money was tight, Aragones often survived on a loaf of bread
and package of salami. When money was tighter, he mixed ketchup and
crushed saltines into a cup of hot water, creating a facsimile of
tomato soup.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're young, you don't care,'' Aragones said.
</P>
<P>
   Although he had regularly read MAD while in Mexico City _ he was
a big fan of the irrepressible gap-toothed mascot Alfred E. Neuman
_ he shied away from the magazine's offices, then located on Third
Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never ever fathomed I would work for them,'' Aragones said.
``They were too good and in another country in a language I didn't
know.''
</P>
<P>
   But while Aragones had problems with the language barrier, his
characters did not. Then, as today, they speak not in words but
through facial expressions, movement, body language and dress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sergio actually talks with his drawings,'' Jaffee says. ``He
does things with pictures that are easier to read than some of the
cartoons with words in them.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, at the urging of his new Greenwich Village friends,
Aragones decided to give MAD a shot. At the magazine's
headquarters, he asked for Antonio Prohias, the Cuban-born
cartoonist known for his ``Spy vs. Spy'' serial.
</P>
<P>
   The two had a lot in common and bonded immediately. Like
Aragones, Prohias spoke only Spanish. And like Aragones'
characters, the enemy spies in Prohias' column _ one dressed in
black, the other in white _ also never spoke.
</P>
<P>
   Aragones asked Prohias to introduce him to the MAD editors, but
the veteran cartoonist declined.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `You have to introduce yourself because I don't speak
any English either','' Aragones recalled.
</P>
<P>
   His work has appeared in every MAD since that fateful day in
1962, save one issue during the late 1960s when the cartoons he
mailed while traveling in Europe failed to arrive. He has published
more than 7,000 marginal drawings and thousands more ``A MAD Look
At ...'' strips.
</P>
<P>
   He moved to Los Angeles in 1970 and Ojai in 1983 after visiting
the area to hear the Indian philosopher J. Krishnamurti.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an atmosphere of a small town. Everybody was very
friendly,'' Aragones recalled. ``There is a feeling of security
around here. And, more than anything else, it's very beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   His studio, just a few miles from Aragones' home, is cluttered
with hundreds of Donald Duck and other cartoon figurines, books,
files, hand-carved masks, back issues of MAD and numerous awards.
There, Aragones works into the wee hours of the morning, producing
a page of cartoons a day.
</P>
<P>
   For Aragones, life is a constant stream of simple pleasures that
he never takes for granted: finding a rare toy in the flea market;
watching a good movie, particularly ones that embody a relevant
point of view or contain samurai warriors; spending time with wife
Charlene and their 21-year-old daughter, Christen; taking long
walks through Ojai; or appreciating quality art.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could spend hours watching a glass blower or a ceramist
making a pot,'' Aragones said.
</P>
<P>
   And he is an avid traveler, having visited more than 100
countries over the years. He has met hundreds of cartoonists during
his journeys, and he doesn't hesitate to offer them advice if he
believes they are serious about their craft.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cartoonists are an international community,'' he said. ``I can
go to any country in the world, meet a cartoonist and have a
friend, a brother.''

GOODNESS GET GREEN LIGHT

By KEITH MARDER 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Rabbi Harold Schulweiss stands before his
congregation every week, imparting words of wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   But is anyone listening? You bet. Schulweiss' proof will be
broadcast on television tonight.
</P>
<P>
   The final two installments of Showtime's six-part series,
``Rescuers: Stories of Courage,'' are scheduled to air back-to-back
starting at 8 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The two one-hour films share with TV audiences one of
Schulweiss' most passionate subjects _ the righteous Christians who
risked their own lives to save Jews during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helped transform my whole theology,'' said Schulweiss,
senior rabbi at Encino's Valley Beth Shalom. ``I was so depressed
whenever I came to the Holocaust. I wondered: How could I talk to
each individual being created in the image of God and essential
goodness ... and at the same time, there not being any shred of
evidence of that goodness?''
</P>
<P>
   Stories about the rescuers were a revelation. And he made it his
mission to shed more light on the people who prove there is
goodness in the world.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the rabbi has been bringing the heroes to speak at
his temple. He created the Jewish Foundation, which raises about $1
million a year for the rescuers. And from his pulpit, Schulweiss
often reminds his congregation of the largely unsung efforts of
those men and women.
</P>
<P>
   His message inspired two of his congregants, Gay Block and Malka
Drucker, to write a powerful book, ``Rescuers: Portraits of Moral
Courage in the Holocaust'' (Koen Book Distributor; $29.95).
</P>
<P>
   And in a coincidence that is every bit Hollywood, their book
landed on the desk of Showtime's then-newly named president of
programming, who also happened to be a longtime member of Valley
Beth Shalom.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Offsay had come in to the office to meet his staff a
couple of days before starting at Showtime. His soon-to-be
secretary had a package for him and asked whether she should pass
it on to him or hold onto it until his first day.
</P>
<P>
   He took it home. The package contained Block and Drucker's
``Rescuers'' _ and Offsay stayed up reading until 3 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   His mind was made up by the time he got to the afterword,
written by none other than Schulweiss.
</P>
<P>
   After a brainstorming session with Showtime executives, the idea
for six separate one-hour films was solidified. All Showtime needed
to green-light the deal was a powerful name to back the project and
attract top-notch writers, directors and actors. Enter Barbra
Streisand and Cis Corman's production company. And the rest is
television history.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the most commercial subject matter,'' Offsay said,
``but subject matter like this does not come along very often. It
was another important step in reshaping the network. For the people
who did see it, it may very well be the most satisfying experience
they have had while watching television in a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   The first two hours of the Showtime series were shown in
October, the second couplet in May. Sunday's segments are subtitled
``Two Families,'' and consist of ``Malka Csizmadia'' and ``We Are
Circus,'' both adapted from first-person accounts in Drucker and
Block's book.
</P>
<P>
   The first, a love story, stars Robin Tunney as the title
character and Michael Rapaport as Szarany, a Jew living in the
ghetto near Malka's home in Hungary. Malka, who helps Szarany and
his friends escape, falls in love with the Jewish soldier. However,
he falls for her sister Irena (Caterina Scorsone) and they marry.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Circus,'' Tim Matheson and Daryl Hannah play Adolph and
Maria Althoff, master and star of a traveling circus that performed
acrobatic stunts, rode an elephant and harbored Jewish escapees
during the war. Eventually, aerialist Hans (Joe Bostick), whose own
family was killed during a bombing raid, informs the authorities
about the Jews in hiding. Then, the Althoff Circus has to slip past
their enemies and convince the Allies that they have no political
affiliation with Hitler.
</P>
<P>
   These are only a few of the other Oskar Schindlers who saved so
many lives.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the authors' contracts, the rescuers depicted in the
series will receive money from the production company, Drucker
said. It's well-deserved, Schulweiss adds, since many rescuers _
now in their 80s _ have not led great lives because their homeland
never regarded them as heroes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ignorance about this is appalling,'' he said. ``I think it
is because we are afraid of goodness. We are much more comfortable
with evil. We dote on evil. We know more about (high-ranking Nazis
Heinrich) Himmler and (Adolf) Eichmann than the family who risked
their lives to hide Anne Frank because, compared to them, we're
great people.''
</P>
<P>
   But listening to the rescuers' stories can only make us all be
better people, Schulweiss said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a battle for our own moral survival, otherwise we will
turn cynical and pessimistic, and it destroys faith,'' he said.
``If you destroy faith in man, you cripple man.''
</P>
<P>
   Drucker, an author of children's books, heard every word of the
rabbi's message. She was so inspired by his teachings that she is
now an ordained rabbi. And the book is dedicated to Schulweiss, a
man whose influence she says has been ``phenomenal.''
</P>
<P>
   The feelings are mutual.
</P>
<P>
   ``She and Gay Block did this marvelous book where people were
inspired,'' Schulweiss said. ``To honor people who are honorable is
a great mandate.''

GERMANS VOTE SUNDAY IN RACE TOO CLOSE TO CALL 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAMBURG, Germany _ As a hard-fought German election campaign
comes to a vote on Sunday, one of the most striking features is
that the two leading parties are fighting about very little.
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates for chancellor defend Germany's generous social
programs. Both support plans to abandon the German mark for the
euro, the new European currency. Both give top priority to tax
reform, though their plans differ in the details. And both would
continue Germany's existing foreign policy, including a role in
peace-keeping forces abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Billboards for Gerhard Schroeder and his left-of-center Social
Democrats boast, ``We don't want to change everything, just make it
much better.'' Chancellor Helmut Kohl and his right-of-center
Christian Democrats promise ``Security, not Risk.''
</P>
<P>
   This matches the country's mood. German voters may be eager for
a change of government, but there is little popular pressure for
sweeping changes in policy or in Germany's protective social-market
economy. This may help to explain why the race remains far too
tight to call, with opinion polls showing a large number of voters
still undecided.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a basic feeling that we don't want to see Kohl's face
anymore, but I am not sure that people want a basic change in
policy,'' said Theo Sommer, co-publisher of the weekly newspaper
Die Zeit. ``There is no debate between Thatcherism on the one hand
and state socialism on the other hand. It is about nuances.''
</P>
<P>
   Sommer's co-publisher is a former chancellor, Helmut Schmidt,
who was ousted by Kohl in 1982. Die Zeit has never been pro-Kohl,
but a rival publication, the conservative daily Die Welt, drew
strikingly similar conclusions about the country's mood in an
editorial this week. ``What is better for this country, continuity
or change?'' it asked. ``The answer being given is clear: both.''
</P>
<P>
   German elections usually lack sharp differences on issues, and
most of Germany's post-1945 governments have been coalitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the way it is in every election battle,'' said Mario
Ohoven, president of the Federation of Mid-Sized Industry, in
Duesseldorf. ``It is not driven primarily by the content of
policies, but rather by the question of power. The policy-making
doesn't begin until the day after the election.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, business leaders argue that there is a basic
difference in the tendency of the two parties _ and they are
solidly behind Kohl's coalition. Even if both sides embrace similar
principles, they pull in different directions: Social Democrats
place less importance on stimulating business or reducing taxes,
while the Christian Democrats generally push toward further
de-regulation and less government spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a basic issue in this election, which is that the
Social Democrats still stand for the old German idea of more
caretaking by the state,'' said Berthold Leibinger, president of
Trumpf GmbH, which makes advanced machine tools just outside
Stuttgart.
</P>
<P>
   Germany has some big problems. Unemployment is above 10 percent.
Taxes consume nearly half the average paycheck. Many elementary
schools are so pinched for money that students are simply sent home
when a teacher is out sick.
</P>
<P>
   But those issues played little part in a campaign intent on
small details: Is Kohl, at 68, too old and tired? Has his Christian
Democratic Union run out of steam? Would the 54-year-old Schroeder
bring more youth and skill to get things done? Would a new
political coalition somehow be able to break through the gridlock
that has paralyzed efforts like tax reform?
</P>
<P>
   With both candidates fighting to capture the political center,
neither wants to alarm constituents. Schroeder's once substantial
lead over Kohl has narrowed to just two or three percentage points,
and at least 20 percent of voters are undecided. It is possible
that neither will muster a majority of votes with their most
obvious coalition partners, and that their parties will have to
govern in tandem in a ``Grand Coalition.''
</P>
<P>
   This month, as the race narrowed almost to a dead heat, the
debate has sharpened somewhat. Kohl spent more time warning that
the Social Democrats and the more leftist Green Party may form an
alliance with the successor to East Germany's Communist party.
Schroeder has muted the vaguely pro-business parts of his stump
speech and re-emphasized traditional Social Democrat themes like
social justice.
</P>
<P>
   In specific policy disputes, the candidates have focused on
marginal differences. Both parties have singled out tax reform as
their biggest priority, and both would lower top tax rates and
eliminate loopholes. Kohl would reduce the overall tax burden by
about 3 percent; Schroeder would not lower the overall burden but
would shift more of it to wealthy people and companies.
</P>
<P>
   Business executives overwhelmingly prefer Kohl and his tax plan,
which Social Democrats blocked in Parliament last year. But even
Kohl's plan leaves executives complaining that he was too cautious
and too willing to cut deals.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Ronald Reagan pushed for tax reform, he explained it in
clear and understandable terms,'' said Wilfried Prewo, president of
Hanover's Chamber of Commerce and Industry and an advocate of
deeper tax cuts across the board. Kohl's party, he said, ``took an
originally good idea and watered it down.''
</P>
<P>
   ``By getting so entangled in compromises, they endangered the
purity of the tax reform and everybody was confused,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   But the Social Democrats have hardly been a beacon of clarity.
Their most prominent proposals have been to roll back a handful of
Kohl's modest attempts to reform pension and labor laws. They have
yet to propose a way to salvage Germany's generous pension system
from bankruptcy, which looms when today's baby boomers reach
retirement age.
</P>
<P>
   One issue that does divide the parties is the treatment of
immigrants, of which Germany now has about 7 million.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl has called for tougher border controls and immediate
expulsion of immigrants who commit crime, and the calls often
generate the loudest cheering and applause in his speeches.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder has been much quieter about the issue, though he
echoes the demand for immediate expulsion of foreign criminals. The
Social Democrats are big beneficiaries of ``foreigners,'' because
changes in citizenship law have allowed more than 100,000
German-born Turks to become citizens, and those voters are
adamantly Social Democratic.
</P>
<P>
   On the one issue where Social Democrats could have easily picked
a major fight with Kohl, they did not. The chancellor considered
the euro, the new European currency, his final and most important
project, even though most Germans opposed abandoning their trusted
marks. The Social Democrats decided more than a year ago that they
would not attack the euro, and contented themselves with
criticizing Kohl's steps along the way.
</P>
<P>
   Some say it is only natural that there is little heated economic
debate, despite high unemployment. After long years of slow growth,
German voters sense a turnaround, and are relishing their stability
in light of crises in Asia, Latin America and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't detect that despair or despondency that I keep reading
about,'' said Sommer, at Die Zeit. ``The economy is improving, and
there have been changes. People feel we aren't actually doing that
badly, that we are on the right track.''

`GODS AND MONSTERS': PORTRAIT OF THE ARTIST AS A GAY MAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes at end of review.)  
(lb) 
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``Gods and Monsters'' is an unalloyed success at the
New York Film Festival, with a performance by Sir Ian McKellen that
richly deserves to be remembered at the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Like John Hurt in ``Love and Death on Long Island'' (giving a
similarly splendid performance, though in a narrower role), he
works wonders with the character of a marvelously urbane English
homosexual who becomes obsessed with an Adonis from a wildly
different world. In this case it's Brendan Fraser, also impressive,
as the hunk who mows the lawn.
</P>
<P>
   It happens that the English gentlemen in both these films find
themselves incongruously embroiled in American popular culture.
This time, it's the still-grand Hollywood of 1957, the year the
director James Whale, whom McKellen plays, met his mysterious
death. It was Whale who directed the famous Frankenstein movies.
(``I just directed the first two,'' he points out tartly here.
``The others were done by hacks.'')
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of a long career, he also painted, worked as an
actor and made many other films (among them ``The Invisible Man''
and the original ``Waterloo Bridge'').
</P>
<P>
   Taking off from Whale's complex nature and the unknown
circumstances of his last days, the film adapts Christopher Bram's
hypothetical novel about the filmmaker into an immensely touching
character study that is heightened by well-chosen glimpses of
Hollywood's past.
</P>
<P>
   Written and directed by Bill Condon, who had his own fling with
tongue-in-cheek horror when he made the oddball ``Strange
Behavior'' and ``Strange Invaders,'' ``Gods and Monsters'' creates
a deeply resonant portrait of Whale and the gay Hollywood of his
era.
</P>
<P>
   One day, while having a marvelous time playing cat-and-mouse
games with an overeager young interviewer visiting him at poolside
(the Whale pool is used by its owner strictly as an instrument of
seduction), Whale succumbs to a small but debilitating stroke. He
is physically unimpaired afterward, as coy and debonair as ever,
but his mind has begun playing tricks.
</P>
<P>
   Sudden sensations and painful thoughts of the past begin to
overwhelm him, in a manner that Condon illustrates with haunting
grace. (Carter Burwell's beautifully mournful score enhances these
moments.) At the same point in his life, he sees a tempting
opportunity when the gardener appears outside.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suppose we say phooey to the hedges!'' Whale suggests to
handsome Clayton Boone (Fraser). ``Can you spare an hour after
lunch to sit for me?'' Clayton, who proves a far more
multidimensional figure than might be expected, is suspicious at
first of Whale's desire to draw him, but the old slyboots does a
dauntless job of getting under the young man's skin.
</P>
<P>
   Condon is at his most impressive when weaving their peculiar
bond into the spirit of the Frankenstein movies, something he does
with tenderness and insight. An inspired section of the film finds
all of its principals watching ``The Bride of Frankenstein'' on
television and responding to it in revealing ways.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, Condon segues deftly through memory into the
moviemaking process itself. Here and elsewhere, real Hollywood
figures (Elsa Lanchester, Boris Karloff) are ably impersonated.
Particular attention is paid to George Cukor, a target for Whale's
cattiness and an emblematic figure in the closeted gay subculture
of his time.
</P>
<P>
   With a cast that also includes Lolita Davidovitch as Clayton's
occasional girlfriend and Lynn Redgrave, warmly attentive and
unrecognizably plain, as Whale's devoted housekeeper, ``Gods and
Monsters'' has been capably made in all regards. What especially
elevates it is the razor-sharp cleverness of McKellen's
performance, which brings unusual fullness and feeling to a most
unusual man.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gods and Monsters'' will be shown Saturday night at 6 and
Sunday at 1:30 p.m. as part of the New York Film Festival.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Hedge funds lost their luster in a big way last week when
Long-Term Capital Management, once the brain-trust darling of Wall
Street, came within a hair's breadth of bankruptcy and investors
were said to be left with 20 percent or less of their stakes.
</P>
<P>
   But even as some giant hedge funds have been tanking, banks,
investment firms and private money managers have been aggressively
marketing a relatively new type of product that they call a
low-risk way to play the hedge fund game. Indeed, if you have
$100,000 or more to invest, your broker or private banker may have
already pitched the investment idea: a fund of hedge funds.
</P>
<P>
   The structure is a pretty simple. A fund of hedge funds takes
your money and divides it among anywhere from 6 to 80 hedge fund
managers _ like Long-Term Capital or, of course, some
better-performing fund.
</P>
<P>
   The goal, on the one hand, is to put your money in the care of
savvy managers who do not limit themselves to investments as
mundane as stocks and, on the other hand, to spread the risk. The
managers can sell equities short, making bets that the market will
decline. They can invest in currencies, play with derivatives, pile
into commodities and make outsized bets on the direction of
interest rates. And because hedge funds often use futures, they can
pack leveraged punch, giving investors exaggerated returns _ good
or bad. Their aim is to turn a profit no matter what happens in the
stock market.
</P>
<P>
   In funds of funds, the idea is that, because your money is
spread among multiple hedge funds, you can avoid volatility.
</P>
<P>
   But how have funds of funds been performing in one of the
rockiest stock markets in recent years? It depends on your
expectations. In an awful August, the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock
index slid 14.5 percent, the Morgan Stanley Capital International
World index was down 13.4 percent and the 3,600 general equity
mutual funds tracked by Lipper Analytical Services skidded an
average of 16.7 percent. But the 212 funds of hedge funds tracked
by Managed Account Reports, a monthly hedge fund newsletter, posted
a relatively modest median decline of 6.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   For the year through Aug. 31, the funds of funds had a median
return of 2.3 percent. By contrast, the mutual funds fell 10.3
percent.
</P>
<P>
   In each of the last three years, however, both the S&AMP;P 500 and
the mutual funds clobbered funds of hedge funds. In 1997, the S&AMP;P
500 returned 33.4 percent and the mutual funds returned 25 percent.
Funds of hedge funds mustered only 17.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics say funds of hedge funds did not offer enough
protection during the selloff. Lois Peltz, managing editor of
Managed Account Reports, said many were insufficiently diversified
and were too heavily weighted in emerging markets.
</P>
<P>
   Gilbert de Botton, chairman of the London-based Global Asset
Management Ltd., which runs hedge funds, funds of hedge funds and
mutual funds in the United States and overseas, disagreed.
``Overdiversification neutralizes everything you do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Because funds of funds beat their peers during the selloff, they
will be attractive to some investors; after all, most people are
interested in hedging against downturns, not updrafts. And the fund
minimums _ now as low as $100,000 _ are likely to fall further.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will probably become more democratic, because there is a
desire for investors to participate in investments that are not
dependent on market direction to generate a return and provide
diversification,'' said Steven Eckenberger, senior vice president
at AIG International Asset Management, which runs a fund of hedge
funds in partnership with Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of money in funds of funds has risen to an estimated
$29.5 billion this year, from $4 billion five years ago, according
to Hennessee Hedge Fund Advisory Group, a New York firm that
advises hedge fund investors.
</P>
<P>
   How can you judge a fund of hedge funds as a prospective
investment? As in mutual funds, you can look at the manager's
tenure, the fund's performance against the S&AMP;P 500 and the fund's
turnover rate _ taxwise, many are highly inefficient.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to weigh the relative merits of different funds of
hedge funds because their managers are not required to disclose
their strategies and holdings, as mutual fund managers are. And
most hedge funds of funds let investors withdraw their money only
at the end of a month, quarter or year.
</P>
<P>
   It is also hard to stomach the fees. Hedge fund managers have
long charged a 1 percent management fee and taken 20 percent of
profits. But with funds of hedge funds, the extra layer of managers
gets a healthy slice of the cake, too.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Bankers Trust last year started a fund of hedge
funds, named Topiary, that oversees $1 billion and uses 80
managers. It takes a 1 percent annual management fee that is paid
quarterly, said Nicola Meaden, chief executive of Tass Management,
a London-based firm that tracks hedge funds. That's on top of what
the underlying hedge funds are charging. Bankers Trust also gets a
cut of the profits: 10 percent after the fund's performance exceeds
the Treasury Bill rate, a very unaggressive benchmark.
</P>
<P>
   Those fat fee structures have provoked some sharp words from
critics, including Byron Wien, chief U.S. investment strategist at
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, which does not market a fund of funds.
He argues that payment should be based on performance alone. ``I
would give them 50 percent of the amount by which they beat the
S&AMP;P,'' Wien said.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, you should understand the risk involved in any
hedge fund. As Long-Term Capital proved, hedge funds can be risky
business, indeed.

BANK STOCKS: BATTERED, YES, BUT NOT TO BE FORGOTTEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Sept. 27)  
 (bl)

<P>
   With the world's financial system in turmoil, it makes a certain
amount of sense that financial stocks, especially those of banks
and brokerage firms, have been pounded.
</P>
<P>
   Since its peak in the middle of July, an index of 24
money-center and superregional bank stocks compiled by Keefe,
Bruyette &AMP; Woods, a firm that researches bank stocks, has declined
by 27 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Yet many banks don't have a dime of exposure in Asia or Russia,
let alone Long-Term Capital Management LP. They are still doing
basic blocking and tackling close to home and are not losing money.
</P>
<P>
   Keefe research director David Berry took a few minutes late last
week to discuss whether the world has really changed all that much.
</P>
<P>
   Q. On Thursday, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said the
problems at Long-Term Capital posed no systemic risk to our
financial system. What shape is the banking system in?
</P>
<P>
   A. The banking system is not as good as it was a few months ago,
but it is still in pretty good shape. And it is in much better
shape than it was in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the last time
there was a serious crisis. The industry today is much more
profitable, much more efficient and has lower levels of problem
assets than it did then. Unfortunately, that does not mean you are
going to make money in the stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is that to say you don't like the group?
</P>
<P>
   A. No, these stocks are attractive, but it is going to take a
while to calm people down.
</P>
<P>
   The money-center banks, which have fallen the most, are the
high-risk, high-return plays and are the focal point of investor
fears. Both they and the big investment banks need some restoration
or normalcy in the capital markets before folks start to relax. And
it is very possible regional bank stocks, particularly the
superregionals, will begin to recover when they start to report
third-quarter earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Assuming that an investor doesn't want to roll the dice with
a money-center stock, which companies look good to you now?
</P>
<P>
   A. The prudent, safe and sane thing is to avoid money centers
and invest in strong, superregional banks that are stable and
probably don't lend much to hedge funds.
</P>
<P>
   We like organizations like Suntrust, National City Corp. in
Ohio, Mellon Bank and State Street of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What do you expect third-quarter earnings to look like?
</P>
<P>
   A. Most of the bad news is out there. The biggest damage is in
money-center land, and we think the hit there is about $2.4 billion
more than we did a few weeks ago. To put that in perspective, the
entire commercial banking system earned $16 billion in the second
quarter. So we will fall short of that by about 15 percent. That is
a big and noticeable amount, but not staggering.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Last week Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal
Reserve, seemed to signal that he is prepared to cut short-term
interest rates. That should help the banks, right?
</P>
<P>
   A. It would help if we get some upward slope to the yield curve,
where short rates are lower than longer-term rates. But even if we
get a rate cut, it is not guaranteed that the yield curve will turn
positive. With the federal funds rate at 5.5 percent, even a
half-point cut wouldn't give you that upward slope. I have been
concerned that in the face of all that is going on, the Fed might
choose not to act.
</P>
<P>
   And yet over the last couple of days, the Fed approved the
Travelers-Citicorp merger. We got a fairly clear indication from
Mr. Greenspan that rates are coming down, possibly this week. And
we have this effort coordinated by the New York Fed to support
Long-Term Capital. That is a lot of very concentrated activity.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is the consolidation trend over for now?
</P>
<P>
   A. There is a good case to be made that we are in for a hiatus.
The level of certainty that bank chief executives have today is
probably less than it was three months ago. Put another way, having
your stock price get knocked down by one-third hurts your
confidence and makes you less bold. Also, sellers are interested in
getting a certain price on a deal. Right now, they are not likely
to get it.
</P>
<P>
   Longer term, secular forces for consolidation are still there.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What is your take on 1999 for the banks?
</P>
<P>
   A. We are walking around with the view that the economy will be
slower next year and that interest rates will be lower.
</P>
<P>
   For the banks, that means slower revenue growth and a refocus
back on the expense side of the equation. That outlook is not as
robust as it was a couple of months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Still, compared with other stocks, banks will show good earnings
momentum next year. I feel comfortable with the basic statement
that banks will show a bit better earnings growth than the Standard
&AMP; Poor's 500.

ECONOMIC VIEW: POLICY MEANS NOTHING IF SHELVES ARE BARE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Sept. 27)  
 (bl)

<P>
   Anyone who thinks all this global market turmoil is mostly about
devalued currencies, deflation and doomsday scenarios should try to
check in with Anwar Ibrahim. He's a bit hard to reach these days.
</P>
<P>
   Until a few weeks ago, Anwar was the insightful, canny finance
minister of Malaysia, the man anointed to take over as prime
minister some day, and the symbol of his country's astounding
transition from a backwater of rubber plantations and tin mines to
a leading maker of computer chips and cellular phones.
</P>
<P>
   Today he is sitting in jail, held under Malaysia's Internal
Security Act, a law first used 30 years ago to detain suspected
communist insurgents without trial. Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad
is now wielding it to put down an economic insurgency led by Anwar.
The new subversives have the temerity to suggest that for Malaysia
to make the next leap, it must embrace the discipline of global
markets and stop rewarding Mahathir's cronies.
</P>
<P>
   Anwar's descent from the finance minister's suite to solitary
confinement is the story of a seemingly successful authoritarian
regime cracking under economic pressure _ the same pressure that
toppled President Suharto in Indonesia and brought chaos to Russia.
</P>
<P>
   But it is also a humbling warning to economists whipping up
strategies for putting the world back on track. Bad economics _
horrendous misjudgments made worse by misguidance from the
International Monetary Fund _ may have set off the Asian crisis.
But not even a perfect economic solution, if someone had one, could
stuff the genie back in the bottle.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly this is a crisis about power politics and national
cultures. No economic elixir will work if it is politically
unpalatable to Muscovites searching empty shelves or to Indonesians
again desperate, as they were a generation ago, at the prospect of
unaffordable rice. No wonder the IMF, stuffed with more than 1,000
Ph.D. economists with little background in national politics, keeps
getting wiped out in Kiev and Surabaya.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's fair to say that we misjudged the kind of
political currents that the crisis would unleash,'' a senior
official of the IMF conceded a few weeks ago. ``It's not the way
people in this building have ever been trained to think. If they
did, they would work at the U.N.''
</P>
<P>
   So now, 14 months into the crisis, the countries of the world
can be divided into three broad categories: the Defiant, the
Drifters and the Dutiful.
</P>
<P>
   The Defiant are the most interesting: the countries that, after
a year of dueling with global markets, have chosen to wall
themselves off. Malaysia is the prime example.
</P>
<P>
   While Anwar was echoing the language of Treasury Secretary
Robert Rubin and the IMF, talking about austerity, transparency and
market reforms, his prime minister was spinning dark conspiracy
theories about how George Soros and a cabal of secretive financiers
were plotting ``new forms of colonialism.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually that cognitive dissonance grew too great, and Anwar
was sacked and accused, apparently spuriously, of sodomy by
Mahathir. Now acting as his own finance minister, Mahathir imposed
exchange controls and declared the country's currency worthless
outside its borders, leaving terrified international investors _
and Malaysia has plenty, from Intel to Motorola to Coca-Cola _ to
wonder if they will be able to repatriate their profits.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, where tax collection never took hold, never mind market
economics, is speeding into the Defiant camp as well. Its new
economic team, appointed last week, has been dealing with the
country's creditors by decree, with threats to default if the
country is not given more IMF aid on Moscow's terms. Meanwhile, it
is flouting the fund's prescriptions by printing money to pay off
unhappy miners and, more important, the restive rocket corps
officers who command the nuclear silos.
</P>
<P>
   Concern that the ranks of the Defiant will grow explains why
Washington is so worried about the Drifters, countries like
Indonesia and Japan that seem unable to get any traction because
their banks have collapsed and their leadership is paralyzed.
``These are nations that could go either way,'' one White House
economic adviser noted the other day. ``They could stumble through,
or try to wall off the world.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there are the Dutiful, following the Western
prescriptions and enduring the pain of slashed budgets and high
interest rates, who wonder hourly whether they are obedient
optimists. Brazil and Mexico lead the Dutiful pack and have staved
off disaster so far. There are signs of hope elsewhere: Interest
rates have fallen in Thailand and South Korea, the only two nations
to fully implement IMF programs. But the cranes in Bangkok still
aren't moving, and Korea's giant conglomerates have failed to
downsize in the face of street protests.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the future for all three groups depends most on the
outcome of the longer political struggle between the Anwars of the
global economy and the Mahathirs of cronyism and isolation. No
econometric model can forecast a winner in that fight.

`ARM CANDY': ONE-NIGHT STUN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Sept. 27)  
(lb) 
 By ALEX KUCZYNSKI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The other night at Saks Fifth Avenue, Jonathan
Farkas, the Alexander's department store heir, was escorting Darah
Sowell, a sometime model, at a glittery party for British
designers. Farkas, who is a private investor in Manhattan, has a
steady girlfriend, but she wasn't available. He wasn't looking to
two-time his steady. He wanted Ms. Sowell along for another
purpose.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a very pretty girl and it's fun to go out with her,'' he
said. ``Other women sense that and think you're great.''
</P>
<P>
   When Bill Maher, the host of the talk show ``Politically
Incorrect,'' was master of ceremonies for an evening honoring
Esquire magazine at a comedy club in New York a couple of years
ago, he showed up with a special companion _ the kind of vivacious,
long-legged blonde who leaves men slack of jaw and damp of brow,
and makes the paparazzi elbow for position. Except that Maher had
only just met his escort, and after they appeared together in
public, he never saw her again.
</P>
<P>
   And not long ago, a well-known publisher in his 50s called a
single woman he knew slightly and asked her to a benefit dinner for
several hundred at the Plaza. It was not a date; the man had a
serious girlfriend. He needed something else. ``Would you be my arm
candy tomorrow night?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Arm candy. The phrase is bracing in its candor, implying a
beautiful object to attach to your arm, for others to feast their
eyes upon. In the image-obsessed 1990s, when a dominant mood is the
desire to inspire fits of envy in one's friends, a woman (and
sometimes a man) in the role of arm candy expresses the
quintessential modern relationship.
</P>
<P>
   It's a one-night nothing, a postsexual image enhancer and ego
booster. In the conventional pairing _ powerful older man, stunning
young woman _ her presence ensures the seething jealousy of other
men and guarantees the intrigued interest of other women.
</P>
<P>
   Going to a benefit for the Museum of Modern Art? How about that
crowded Oscar-night party at Elaine's? A splashy movie premiere?
The best companion is arm candy: beautiful, well-behaved,
soft-spoken. Although the goal is sometimes to land your picture in
the gossip columns or society party pages, just as often the target
audience is the rest of the room.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about getting the most beautiful woman to walk into the
room with you so that everybody else eats their heart out,'' Farkas
said.
</P>
<P>
   Lest the arrangement sound horribly exploitive, an arm-candy
outing can be beneficial for both parties _ the young woman gets to
generate a little public heat and light for herself, while the man
gives the titillating appearance of having a beautiful lover.
</P>
<P>
   (Arm candy is not to be confused with ``beard'' _ a woman who
escorts a gay man, thereby masking his sexual orientation. In the
classic arm-candy relationship, the man is heterosexual, but no
romantic relationship is sought _ or at least consummated. Unlike
real romance, the arm-candy arrangement is a no-muss, no-fuss and _
perhaps most important _ no prenup relationship.)
</P>
<P>
   Mark Baker, a party promoter who has connections among models,
nightclub owners and restaurateurs, said he is often asked to set
people up on dates ``for decoration.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been approached by people on a regular basis to provide
decoration,'' he said. ``I've always managed to keep it aboveboard
and correct. I don't do the one-on-one, end-up-at-my-hotel thing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I call them the compulsive Christmas trees,'' he said of the
men he helps set up. ``They won't go out of the house without
decoration. It's a fundamental insecurity at some level.''
</P>
<P>
   Farkas, 49, who was once married but is now divorced, conceded
that the notion of arm candy reveals the inner pathos of the modern
urban bachelor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had no egos, and I would get my ego from a beautiful
woman,'' he recalled of his youthful years, when he pursued arm
candy more than today. ``When I was younger, arm candy was a big
thing. Those were the days when you only brought Ford models out
with you, because that was the thing to do. And among the guys, we
had this competition. Were you getting a $3,000-a-day model or a
$4,000-a-day model?''
</P>
<P>
   Farkas still escorts models, including the superstar 1970s model
Marisa Berenson, whom he took to a round of polo matches in
Bridgehampton in July. But the older he gets, he said, the more he
thinks about a woman who is going to be there for the long run.
``There's a difference between having a fun evening and having a
life,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Michael Caruso _ now editor in chief of Details
magazine, but then a staff editor at Vanity Fair _ was asked by his
magazine to escort the model Vendela, in the role of arm candy, to
the annual White House correspondents' dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were rows of paparazzi like a firing squad,'' Caruso
recalled. ``So we got the full-on fusillade of flashbulbs and I
smiled as best I could.'' A week later, Caruso appeared beaming in
a picture with his beautiful date in a Newsweek article about the
correspondents' dinner. The picture appeared along with those of
Colin Powell, Barbra Streisand and President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the really hilarious part,'' Caruso said. ``It was
like that game on `Sesame Street' _ you know, `Which one of these
pictures does not belong?'''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because there is no romantic link, being someone's arm
candy does not always leave a lasting impression. Through a
spokeswoman, Vendela said she had no memory of Caruso.
</P>
<P>
   Maher explained how his arm-candy date for the Esquire party
came about. ``I hadn't lived in New York for over a year,'' he
said. ``And I didn't know anybody, so I asked a friend to set me
up. What are the chances you're going to like somebody on a setup?
Frankly I would rather have been alone. And I wasn't into this
person romantically or physically.''
</P>
<P>
   Maher added that he rarely uses the term ``arm candy'' _ which
he defined as ``to have somebody on your arm just for the purpose
of looking good'' _ with its implications of friendly chastity.
``Because, and this is going to sound really politically
incorrect'' _ Maher rarely hesitates at plugging his show _
``anybody I'm with, I'm usually intending to have sex with or am
having sex with already.''
</P>
<P>
   But he did concede that he took the model Amber Smith to the
American Museum of the Moving Image for a benefit in 1995, and it
was a chaste, one-date relationship. ``We had one date, and she was
beautiful,'' he said. ``But she had that supermodel `I have a
headache' reaction to me. I never saw her again.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who fulfill the requirements of arm candy are not limited
to the merely model-beautiful. Norah Lawlor, the society editor of
Hamptons magazine, said some men in New York prefer that their arm
candy come from the Social Register. ``She should have gone to
Harvard,'' Ms. Lawlor said, ``plus be gorgeous, plus have a great
last name, plus be blond. Oh, and plus she should be 21.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The expression ``arm candy'' is the latest in a long line of
similarly blunt and, to be sure, sexist terms. Frank Sinatra used
to refer to a pair of beautiful women, one on each arm, as ``cuff
links.'' And in the 1980s, ``arm piece'' _ perhaps the precursor to
``arm candy'' _ was used to describe an attractive date.
</P>
<P>
   The term ``walker'' refers to a man, often gay, who escorts
genteel ladies of some social standing to events because their
husbands are unavailable or uninterested.
</P>
<P>
   Few women who are characterized as arm candy appreciate the
term. Ms. Sowell, Farkas' date at Saks two weeks ago, said, ``I
just don't think it's really flattering.''
</P>
<P>
   But men are by no means excluded from the category. Kate Bohner,
a correspondent for CNBC, said she once attempted a ploy to attract
the attention of a potential boyfriend. ``I called Chris Cuomo, who
is classic arm candy,'' Ms. Bohner said, referring to the
broodingly good-looking son of Mario Cuomo, the former New York
governor. Ms. Bohner invited Cuomo, who is a lawyer and a
correspondent for a Fox Network news magazine, to go to the Grammy
awards with her in 1996. But the plan didn't work as she expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``He stood me up,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   When Cuomo was told last week that he had been labeled ``arm
candy,'' he replied, ``It's unfortunate that people need to define
other people by their looks.''
</P>
<P>
   The arm-candy game has complicated rules. Jason Binn, the
publisher of Hamptons and Ocean Drive magazines, said that savvy
men can detect when another man is escorting arm candy, rather than
a woman whom he genuinely likes but who happens to be drop-dead
gorgeous.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real sharks are the guys who say, `So, how long have you
two known each other?''' Binn said. ``Because if she says, `Oh, I
met Bill last Friday night,' then the guy knows she's arm candy.
They're all wondering: `Is this a piece of candy? Or is this
someone intimately involved?' When they find out she's just
decoration, that's when the arm candy loses its appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   Binn, who is 30 and a bachelor, said most men don't want people
``to talk to their arm candies.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're going to a big premiere and Madonna's going to be
there, or a Barneys party or a Peggy Siegal screening or the
Bulgari openings, you want to walk in and feel like you're
somebody,'' he said. ``The safety is that no one talks at these
things. You're not having conversations. You get as far as, `Hi,
how are you.' You're not bringing arm candy to a small dinner
party. These guys want to bring a girl that people will look at and
say, `Wow!' And because the conversation never gets deep enough, no
one knows if they're friends or arm pieces or lovers.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Binn invited out a model, Nikki Novak, as arm candy,
but she turned the tables. ``I had always heard he liked to take
out arm candy,'' Ms. Novak, 27, said. ``But then the first time he
took me out, it was to meet the president. And the second time, it
was to meet George Clooney. So in reality I was actually using him,
and it's interesting how women _ or men, if they're the arm candy _
can turn it around. In secret, I was the one who was winning out,
rather than him just having a pretty girl on his arm.''
</P>
<P>
   In a scenario that might make a postmodern Hollywood romantic
comedy, Binn and Ms. Novak exploited one another so frequently that
they fell in love. While out on a ``no strings attached'' date,
Binn learned that his mother had fallen ill. When she died shortly
after that, Ms. Novak was with him. His sorrow brought them closer,
and now they say they are a real couple.

<P>
   CHAPARE JUNGLE, Bolivia _ When he was Bolivia's military
dictator in the 1970s, Gen. Hugo Banzer relied on the army to keep
tabs on political enemies and to prop up his regime.
</P>
<P>
   Today, as Bolivia's democratically elected president, Banzer has
a new mission for the army. He has ordered troops to keep tabs on
coca farmers and destroy every illegal coca plantation in the
nation within five years.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly one-third of the world's cocaine is made from coca
leaves grown in the Chapare jungle in central Bolivia. Under
pressure from Washington to get tough on drugs, Banzer adopted a
``no tolerance'' policy and has sent squads of machete-wielding
soldiers into the jungle.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials say that after a decade of failures and false
starts, Bolivia has at last joined the drug war in earnest.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's just an incredible amount of commitment by this
government,'' said a State Department official. ``They realize that
being No. 2 in the world in the production of cocaine is nothing to
be proud of.'' Colombia is No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   But such scorched-earth tactics have provoked violent protests
in normally peaceful Bolivia. Since forced eradication began in
April, more than a dozen people have been killed in clashes with
police and soldiers, according to human rights groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been proven time and time again that the militarization
of such areas is only going to lead to an increase in human rights
abuses and that the actual amount of land under coca cultivation is
not going to decrease,'' said Winifred Tate, a research associate
at the Washington Office on Latin America, a private organization
that monitors human rights and democratic change in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the resistance to forced eradication stems from coca's
unique place in Bolivian culture.
</P>
<P>
   Quechua and Aymara Indians have chewed the leaves for centuries
to relieve hunger pangs. Coca tea is a popular drink and
recommended as an anecdote for altitude sickness. About 30,000
acres of coca are legally grown in the Yungas region of northern
Bolivia to supply this local demand.
</P>
<P>
   But coca is also a matter of survival for thousands of
impoverished families. Landlocked Bolivia, which is three times the
size of Montana, is the poorest nation in South America. Annual per
capita income in some rural areas is less than $200, according to
U.N. statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Since the mid-1980s, when low prices led to a collapse of
Bolivia's tin production, thousands of out-of-work miners from the
Andean highlands migrated to the Chapare jungle to grow coca. U.S.
officials claim that nearly all of the Chapare coca is sold to
traffickers, who export cocaine to the United States and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Bolivia at first tried voluntary eradication programs that paid
farmers about $1,000 per acre to switch from coca to alternative
crops. But growers often pocketed the money and planted new coca
fields.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried for 10 years to convince the peasants, but you
can't,'' said Lt. Col. Teovaldo Cardozo, as he watched about 160
soldiers lay waste to a coca plantation in the Chapare last week.
``Voluntarily, the peasant won't change his coca for anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, many are being forced to give up their coca at
gunpoint.
</P>
<P>
   Banzer, who took office last year, unveiled what he called the
``Dignity Plan'' to wipe out coca by the end of his term in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The program is backed by about $50 million in U.S.
counter-narcotics aid this year. U.S. involvement is so obvious
that a Bolivian army officer asked permission from an American
adviser before taking reporters along on a helicopter tour of
eradication sites.
</P>
<P>
   Few analysts believe that Banzer's goals can be met. But given
his authoritarian past, they are not surprised by his approach.
Banzer first took power in a 1971 military coup. He ruled Bolivia
for seven years and, at one point, outlawed political parties and
trade unions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the same method that was used during the general's
dictatorship,'' said Alex Contreras, who covers the drug beat for
Los Tiempos, a newspaper in the central city of Cochabamba. ``You
use force to solve your problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Others say the plan is directly related to U.S. pressure. Each
year, the State Department requires that Bolivia and other
countries show progress in the war on drugs in order to avert
economic sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fundamental reason they want to get rid of the coca is
because the U.S. is leaning hard on them,'' said Jamie Fellner, a
Bolivia expert at Human Rights Watch in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Today, about 1,800 soldiers plus 1,200 police officers have
turned parts of the Chapare jungle into a military zone. Since
April, they have razed 17,000 acres of coca.
</P>
<P>
   Bolivian politicians had long resisted the idea of army
involvement in the drug war, fearing that officers would be
corrupted.
</P>
<P>
   The most high-profile example was Gen. Luis Garcia Meza, who
took power in 1980 in what became known as the ``cocaine coup'' due
to his ties to narco-traffickers. Garcia Meza is now serving a
30-year sentence in a Bolivian jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the early 1980s, the army had an active role (in the war on
drugs) and the corruption was just rampant,'' said one U.S.
official. ``Garcia Meza did quite a bit to sell that image.''
</P>
<P>
   Until this year, eradication efforts were delegated to the
police. But Bolivian soldiers are better equipped and more
intimidating. After troops broke up roadblocks manned by coca
growers in the Chapare in April, they were ordered to begin
eradication operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The drug fight should not rely on just one sector. You need
all of the country's forces involved,'' said Gen. Walter Cespedes,
commander of the army's 7th Brigade, which is overseeing the
effort.
</P>
<P>
   Banzer's ``Dignity Plan'' includes carrots as well as sticks.
</P>
<P>
   The government will relocate hundreds of families to farming
areas outside the Chapare and will target more money for crop
substitution, packing plants, roads and other infrastructure. Areas
sown with palm hearts, pineapples, citrus and other legal crops
have doubled in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any family that really wants to support itself through
alternative crop production can do it in the Chapare,'' said an
official with the U.S. Agency for International Development in La
Paz, the Bolivian capital. ``The farmers are now coming to us,
pleading to get involved. We no longer have to do any promoting.''
</P>
<P>
   Foreign and local companies have invested more than $19 million
in the Chapare this year. One investor is building a $5 million
country club with an 18-hole golf course.
</P>
<P>
   Despite such progress, the Chapare's coca crop has remained
steady for the past six years at about 100,000 acres, according to
U.S. estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem is that the soil in much of the Chapare is
too thin to grow anything else. Coca sprouts like weeds and can be
harvested up to three times a year. As the eradication brigades
move forward, coca farmers have pushed deeper into the jungle and
have recently invaded national parks.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't see themselves as part of the narcotics business.
They see themselves as farming a valuable and useful product. They
want to sell it, and they think it's outrageous that it's being
eradicated,'' Fellner said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, there has been a sharp increase in reports of human
rights abuses by Bolivian troops. Peasants have been tear-gassed
and beaten by soldiers. Several policemen and about a dozen
peasants have been killed, said Lee Cridland of the Andean
Information Network, an independent group that monitors U.S. policy
toward Bolivia.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Bolivia, the violence this year has been incredible,''
Cridland said.
</P>
<P>
   In response, hundreds of coca growers marched 400 miles from the
Chapare to La Paz last month to demand a military withdrawal and
the end of forced eradication. But the government called it a
``narco march'' and refused to meet with the protesters.
</P>
<P>
   Saying that Bolivians are ``not a violent people,'' the State
Department official played down the violence and said that many of
the reported deaths were ``unconfirmed.'' She predicted that, for
the first time ever, Bolivia will show a substantial decrease in
coca production by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Another U.S. official claimed that most Bolivians no longer view
the coca growers as victims and that last month's march to La Paz
was much smaller than earlier protests.
</P>
<P>
   ``The current government is in a position where they can be a
lot tougher because they have public opinion on their side,'' he
said.

ACTIVISTS FIND COCOA PRODUCTS A TOUGH SELL 

</HEADLINE>

c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COCHABAMBA, Bolivia _ Eguil Paz, a devoted evangelical
Protestant and a retired army officer, hasn't sniffed cocaine in
his straight-laced life.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he is one of Bolivia's most ardent defenders of coca, the
tropical plant and source of one of the world's most destructive
drugs. Paz is the founder of Coincoca, a tiny factory run out of
his daughter's house that makes tea, holistic medicines, ointments
and toothpaste out of coca leaves.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when U.S.-backed eradication teams are bent on wiping
out coca crops in South America, Paz is one of a handful of
activists trying to promote the healthful properties of coca and
convince the world that coca is not cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people would use coca as coca, it would be very
beneficial,'' Paz said at the Coincoca plant in the Bolivian city
of Cochabamba. Demonizing the leaf ``is like condemning sugar cane
because it's used to make alcohol, or iron because it's turned into
tanks and weapons of war.''
</P>
<P>
   Cocaine, the narcotic alkaloid extracted from the coca leaf with
the help of numerous chemicals, was invented by Europeans in the
late 1800s and lauded by Sigmund Freud in his influential article
``Uber Coca.''
</P>
<P>
   But the domestication and use of the coca leaf in its natural
state dates back to about 2500 BC. It was one of the first
cultivated crops in South America and was viewed by Indians as a
gift from the Sun God.
</P>
<P>
   When chewed, the leaves act as a mild stimulant and ward off
hunger and thirst. Although they were first repulsed by the
practice, Spanish conquistadors in South America eventually
endorsed coca since it allowed Indian slaves to work longer hours
in the silver and gold mines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forced labor in the mines was founded on the practice of
chewing coca leaves,'' said Jorge Hurtado, a psychologist who has
opened a coca museum in the Bolivian capital of La Paz and has an
Internet Web site dedicated to the plant.
</P>
<P>
   Coca leaves are high in calcium and vitamins and facilitate the
oxygenation of the blood, which is why coca tea can help offset the
affects of altitude sickness and is often served to tourists in the
Bolivian highlands.
</P>
<P>
   Hurtado is also experimenting with the leaves as a way to wean
addicts off cocaine, similar to the way methadone helps heroin
addicts. In neighboring Peru, the National Coca Enterprise, a
state-run agency, is investigating ways to sell legal coca products
and has produced videos and books aimed at changing public
attitudes toward the plant.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Indians, students, miners and truck drivers all chew
coca. Indians also use the leaves in religious ceremonies. The
Bolivian government allows the legal cultivation of about 30,000
acres of coca for internal consumption, and huge bags of the leaves
are sold at open-air coca markets.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban President Fidel Castro, Queen Sofia of Spain and former
Spanish President Felipe Gonzalez chewed coca leaves during state
visits to Bolivia. Coca tea is served at embassies in La Paz and
sold at duty-free shops at the international airport.
</P>
<P>
   But efforts to promote coca leaf products, which could provide
an alternative market for coca farmers who usually sell to drug
dealers, have been waylaid by misconceptions and the U.S.-sponsored
war on drugs in South America.
</P>
<P>
   In Colombia, Peru and Bolivia, U.S.-backed police and soldiers
are attempting to chop down or fumigate thousands of acres of coca.
Yet impoverished peasant farmers are sowing new fields just as
fast.
</P>
<P>
   This refusal to differentiate between the plant and the drug was
sanctioned by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Coca leaves contain just 0.5 percent of the alkaloid cocaine,
and there is no evidence that they are addictive. But after heavy
U.S. lobbying at the 1961 U.N. Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs,
the world body placed coca on its Schedule One, the list of the
most dangerous and restricted substances.
</P>
<P>
   As an officially blacklisted plant, the leaves and natural
coca-leaf products cannot be exported, except for a small amount
used in the flavoring of Coca-Cola.
</P>
<P>
   When former President Jaime Paz Zamora tried to bring coca
leaves to Seville, Spain, to promote coca products at Expo '92, the
shipment was impounded by customs agents. Carlos Prado, an Indian
healer in Cochabamba, said restrictions are so tight that he was
unable to bring 20 coca leaves with him to a recent conference of
holistic doctors in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Even coca tea has been the source of major controversies because
it contains tiny traces of cocaine. During World Cup soccer
qualifying matches in Bolivia in 1993, two players failed doping
examinations and were suspended until investigators concluded that
they had been sipping coca tea.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a mix of mystery and prejudice that surrounds coca,''
said Marcelo Ferofino, general manager of Hansa Ltd., a La Paz firm
that wants to export coca tea to Asia, Europe and the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people think that drinking a cup of coca tea will
automatically make you high,'' he said. ``Some will try to put 10
tea bags in a cup, but nothing will happen.''
</P>
<P>
   This lust for narcotic pleasure and the resulting demand for
cocaine and crack in the world's industrial democracies has tainted
the image of what should be a respected and valued plant, according
to Andrew Weil, the holistic physician and best-selling author.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is clear is that our civilization's failure to understand
the sacred leaf of South American Indians, how to respect it and
use it wisely, has cost us dearly,'' Weil wrote in a 1995 essay in
The New Yorker.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the market for coca tea and coca-based ointments
and syrups _ which are sold as digestive aides, laxatives, and as
treatments for rheumatism and hemorrhoids _ is limited. There is
little official support for the industry at home and exports are
banned.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. lawyer, who has made frequent trips to Bolivia, points
out that if alternative coca products caught on, farmers at the
bottom rung of the drug trade could earn just as much by selling
their leaves to legitimate buyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to know what would happen because no one has really
tried,`` she said. ``If coca wasn't used in cocaine, it would be
seen as a completely acceptable herb that's probably better for the
body than coffee.''

COCA IS AMONG SOFT DRINK'S `REAL THING' INGREDIENTS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (For release Sunday, Sept. 27) 
 
By JOHN OTIS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHIPIRIRI, Bolivia _ As he sipped Coca-Cola from a plastic glass
at the coca market in this jungle village, Marcelo Jancko proudly
pointed out that he plays a small role in the making of the world's
No. 1 soft drink.
</P>
<P>
   A coca farmer, Jancko sells some of his crop to an export
company that ships the leaves to the United States. There, a
pharmaceutical firm removes the cocaine alkaloid and sends the
mulch to Coca-Cola as flavoring, a State Department official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes they buy everything in the market,'' Jancko said.
</P>
<P>
   In the nearby town of Sacaba, Bolivian Army Col. Gaston Orellana
said that buyers for Coca-Cola had recently stopped by the local
coca market. He pulled out a shipping document for 22,000 kilograms
of coca leaves stamped with a U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration
seal.
</P>
<P>
   Because coca is on the U.N. list of dangerous substances, it can
only be exported in small quantities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all very closely supervised,'' said Francisco Alvarez,
head of the U.S. State Department's Narcotics Affairs Section in
Bolivia.
</P>
<P>
   He estimated that Coca-Cola buys about 200 metric tons of coca
leaves annually for its formula. A spokesman at Coca-Cola
headquarters in Atlanta declined to comment on the soft drink's
secret formula.
</P>
<P>
   Today, many soft drinks are laced with caffeine. But a century
ago, the promise of a lift from the small traces of cocaine found
in coca-based beverages was their main appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola was invented in 1864. A turn-of-the-century ad
boasted: ``Tired? Then drink Coca-Cola. It relieves exhaustion.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1914, cocaine alkaloid was removed from the coca leaves used
in Coke's formula after a fierce campaign by Harvey Wiley, a
Protestant minister, according to Jorge Hurtado, who runs the Coca
Museum in La Paz. Wiley's drive led to the prohibition of cocaine
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bolivia produces far more coca than Coca-Cola requires,
peasant farmers still find it a bit odd to see U.S.-funded
eradication teams chopping down acres of coca.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola ``is a huge company that uses (coca), and now they are
trying to wipe it out,'' said Maximo Olivera, a coca farmer in
Chipiriri.

FOR LEWIS, THE PROOF IS IN THE PUNCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNCASVILLE, Conn. _ There are many ways to look at the unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Fear is one way. Confusion and misunderstanding are another. And
then there is the way World Boxing Council heavyweight champion
Lennox Lewis looks at it.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, like most heavy-handed knockout artists, likes to get to
the point. So when the question under discussion is the challenge
posed to him by an unknown Croatian with a Mohawk haircut, the
heavyweight champion of at least one-third of the world is succinct
in his commentary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who's punched him?'' Lewis asks, in a tone that indicates
somebody intends to Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   When you think about it, that is as good a way as any to judge a
heavyweight boxer. So just who has punched Zeljko Mavrovic?
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, until this fight, at least, 27 nobodies.
</P>
<P>
   That trend will surely come to a concussive end early this
evening for the 29-year-old European champion. Not long after he
enters the 5,000-seat temporary arena at the Mohegan Sun Casino,
Lewis will be standing there waiting for him with right arm poised
to be thrown like Thor's thunderbolts.
</P>
<P>
   When that thunder crashes down on him from out of the starry,
starry night, Mavrovic may well see stars himself. What flows from
that (assuming it's not a sea of blood) will let us all know more
about the unknown. Or at least more about the unknown Croatian
challenger.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Mavrovic will be able to withstand Lewis's crushing
right hand, with which he has knocked out 27 victims while twice
winning the WBC title. Perhaps he will prove he can box as well as
his trainer, John ``Darkie'' Smith, says he can. Perhaps he will
expertly parry and counter all of Lewis's advances, slip to and
fro, escape the worst of it while delivering his own blows.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps he will show that his 22 knockouts against fighters of
less than world-class ability stand for something even if his
opponents couldn't stand up for long. In that case, HBO's audience
and an expected packed house at Mohegan Sun would be in for a bit
of a surprise.
</P>
<P>
   But what's far likelier is that after the 220-pound Mavrovic
(27-0) gets hit by Lewis a time or two, he will suddenly realize
that who is hitting him is all that matters when men in excess of
200 pounds are throwing the bombs. Regardless of the outcome, that
experience will be far different from being biffed and banged by
guys like Dannell Nicholson, Kimmuel Odom, Marion Wilson, and James
Pritchard, and how he reacts cannot be known until it happens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lennox Lewis is a big man,'' his Hall of Fame trainer, Emanuel
Steward, said this week of the 250-pound champion. ``In the last 25
years, there's only been about four born-from-the-cradle punchers.
Sonny Liston, Mike Tyson, George Foreman, and Lennox Lewis.''
</P>
<P>
   Born-from-the-cradle punchers are boxing's version of
natural-born killers. They are lethal and often ill-tempered, and
Mavrovic has never been in with such an opponent. Then again,
ignorance is bliss, which perhaps explains why Mavrovic's trainer
has been so willing to point out the champion's weaknesses and his
fighter's strengths.
</P>
<P>
   ``Zeljko has the potential to be the best heavyweight in the
world,'' Smith said, ``but you can only do what you're asked to do.
If Lewis expects us to say he'll beat Zeljko, then Lennox Lewis is
an idiot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a lot of respect for Lewis, but I believe Mavrovic will
beat him. That's not insulting. It's what I believe. After watching
the Lewis-(Shannon) Briggs fight, we were very confident. Nothing
has changed since then.''
</P>
<P>
   That night, Briggs rocked Lewis early before succumbing to
fist-to-the-face-induced exhaustion. He collapsed to the floor
after missing a wild roundhouse left hand in the fifth round after
having been knocked down four times, and the referee looked at that
and came to one conclusion _ say good night, Shannon.
</P>
<P>
   Many who watched believe Lewis was in big trouble in the opening
round when Briggs appeared to hurt him badly, but the champion
himself was not among them. When he thinks back on that March
evening, he has little recollection of being in trouble. What he
remembers is who was punching Shannon Briggs and what happened
after he did that a few times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't that hurt, but it made it real exciting for the
public,'' Lewis said. ``You can't walk in the ring without getting
hit. In a fight situation, there's always a chance you'll get hit.
Shannon Briggs pulled out all the stops, and that gave him a
glimmer of hope that he was almost there.''
</P>
<P>
   That glimmer was extinguished quickly by the thing Lewis
believes in most: his right hand. When Lewis landed it, Briggs did
not react well, ending up too often on his knees. Thus, from
Lewis's point of view, we're talking about the familiar _ another
knockout victory.
</P>
<P>
   But a few feet from the ring that night in Atlantic City sat
Mavrovic, and what he saw was Lewis tottering backward on rubbery
legs after Briggs nailed him in the opening round. That is the
image he has retained from that night as his own time approaches,
wiping from his memory any thought of who was hitting Briggs at the
end while focusing on who was hitting Lewis at the start.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I saw was a fighter who didn't have the motivation for
the training,'' Mavrovic said. ``I saw a fighter who has a problem
with his mind and his motivation. He didn't prepare well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I prepared 11 months for this fight. I always train very
seriously, and I can fight. I know his good points and his bad
points. During all my preparations, I thought about Lennox Lewis.''
</P>
<P>
   The same couldn't be said for Lewis. While Mavrovic talks only
of the WBC champion, the WBC champion talks only of the World
Boxing Association-International Boxing Federation champion,
Evander Holyfield.
</P>
<P>
   It is Holyfield whom Lewis most wanted to be getting in with. It
is Holyfield who has what Lewis craves _ the respect of the
American boxing public. Most of all, it is Holyfield who is on
Lewis's mind even for this fight, despite the presence of a
different challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since I came into boxing, what I always wanted to be was
undisputed champion of the world,'' Lewis said. ``My mouth was
watering watching Holyfield against (Vaughn) Bean (whom Holyfield
beat in a nondescript 12-round decision last Saturday). But I know
if I lose this fight, there is no after-fight. If I lose this
fight, there is no Holyfield fight. So I got to keep it going.''
</P>
<P>
   To do that, Lewis must do more than defeat Mavrovic. Steward
believes Lewis must dispose of him quickly, not only destroying his
challenger but uplifting himself in contrast to Holyfield's
lackluster victory over Bean. Such desires can open a man up to
possible disaster if they're not pursued with some care. But Lewis
seems to believe that Mavrovic is ultimately not unlike the
opponent he saw in Briggs and so many others.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect him to try and box, to go into survival mode,'' Lewis
said. ``He'll try to use the ring to his advantage. He believes he
can elude me for 12 rounds. That's a big mistake. I'll search and
destroy. I don't plan on this guy going the distance.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because, unlike Zeljko Mavrovic, Lennox Lewis knows full
well who will be punching the unknown Croatian Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   The heavyweight champion of the world will be. And, to put it in
the vernacular of the gym, he ain't no Kimmuel Odom.

HIGHER HOPES AND MORE COMPETITION FOR THE INDIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By PETER M. NICHOLS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Twenty years ago it was a simpler world for
Warrington Hudlin and other young filmmakers who gathered in New
York for the first Independent Feature Film Market. ``There were no
expectations then,'' he said Thursday at a lunch to celebrate the
market's 20th anniversary. ``Camaraderie was incredible because
you'd made a choice not to make a Hollywood movie. You had to
reassure yourself that you weren't crazy, and the mutual support
kept you going.''
</P>
<P>
   This week, though, other things were on the minds of hundreds of
aspiring directors and writers who crowded the market, called IFFM,
in lower Manhattan to screen their work at the Angelika Film Center
and mingle with distributors, agents, and scouts from film
festivals and movie studios. Kinship had its place, of course, but
the emphasis was on the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Expectations now run high among the independents. Films like
``Shine'' and ``Fargo'' and, more recently, ``The Opposite of Sex''
and ``The Spanish Prisoner,'' may never be mistaken for
blockbusters at the box office, but their relative success makes
them legitimate economic properties and elevates the breed into
what has become a sleek and increasingly pampered genre.
</P>
<P>
   Why shouldn't that raise expectations? ``People feel if you come
to the market and don't get that `Roger and Me' deal, it's not
worthwhile,'' Hudlin said.
</P>
<P>
   These days even the Hollywood studios, all of them equipped with
``independent'' divisions like Miramax and October Films, are on
the lookout for material. They and a throng of smaller distributors
were on hand at the market, which is staged every fall by the
Independent Feature Project, an alliance of filmmakers and
production and distribution companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you make a great film, somebody will want to show it,''
John Waters, director of ``Pink Flamingoes,'' told a group of young
filmmakers at a panel discussion at the Anthology Film Archive.
</P>
<P>
   For a young moviemaker with a project to sell, that's heady
talk, especially from a man who began his career in the underground
with experimental and exploitational films. There were qualifiers,
of course. ``The film has to make money, let's not forget,'' Waters
said.
</P>
<P>
   Another panel participant, Mary Harron, director of ``I Shot
Andy Warhol,'' reminded the filmmakers that while production was
up, distribution was abbreviated, with films quickly being shunted
from theaters to make way for other films.
</P>
<P>
   Waters, whose latest film, ``Pecker,'' opened Friday solidly in
the mainstream, agreed. ``A picture has to work fast,'' he said.
``There's absolutely no time for word of mouth any more.''
</P>
<P>
   Later at lunch, he, Ms. Harron, Hudlin and several other
filmmakers sat amid the din at Monzu and talked about what young
filmmakers should take away from their experience at IFFM. First,
they shouldn't put so much stress on finalizing a deal, which
happens infrequently at the market and usually only after much
cultivation later.
</P>
<P>
   ``All this talk about it being a golden time is misleading,''
said Joe Berlinger, director of ``Brother's Keeper'' and other
acclaimed documentaries, who was a fledgling himself when he
brought his work to the market 10 years ago. ``It's very difficult
to get into major distribution.''
</P>
<P>
   Berlinger sensed more pressure than usual at this year's IFFM.
``Expectations have been ratcheted so much higher,'' he said.
``There's a lot of desperation now.''
</P>
<P>
   The veterans' advice was to relax, make connections with people
you will work with (and who might back your project later if they
don't agree to do so now), learn the craft.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the market you're beginning to get a sense of the size,
velocity and competitiveness of the business,'' said Matthew
Harrison, director of ``Kicked in the Head.'' For years before he
sold the film, he said, he went to the market, set up a table in
the Angelika and concentrated on learning from those he
encountered.
</P>
<P>
   He and the others offered the following tips. First, look for
future collaborators, and don't be offended if they have money.
Filmmaking is 25 percent making the film and 75 percent business.
``Form a limited partnership and get money,'' Waters said. ``From
anywhere,'' he added. ``Always be nice to relatives with money.''
And don't be afraid of losing it. ``You don't go bankrupt at
20-something; you just burn the parents' money,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At IFFM, unlike a festival where the emphasis is solely on
selling films, distributors look for talent more than a particular
project. People wear badges color-coded according to occupation _
director, distributor and the like. Buyers sometimes don't wear
their badges so they won't be besieged by directors, who
immediately jump on people not wearing badges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buying movies is a weird game,'' Harrison said. ``Buyers come
here and they don't wear the badge, but then they track people.
It's an efficient place to locate talent. Kids who understand that
and come here with that approach have a better time.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, IFFM is a perfect place to learn about audiences. It's
never comfortable, but sit with people during test screenings. Try
not to be upset at their reactions, especially if they walk out.
During the panel, Todd Solondz, director of ``Welcome to the
Dollhouse'' and the much-anticipated ``Happiness,'' to be shown
Oct. 9 and 10 at the New York Film Festival, said that he always
went to screenings of his films. ``I like to see when they're
yawning,'' he said. ``And then when the eye finally closes.''

power decentralizatrion to strengthen the United Kingdom by
instituting a kind of quasi-federalism, the result as been to
actually at heat to the fires of independence. In the course of the

   RUSSIA-BARTER _ ENGELS, Russia _ The good news for Trolza, a
mammoth assembly plant and major employer in this depressed town on
the Volga River, was a recent deal worth $25 million to produce
buses for several Russian cities. The bad news: No cash will be
exchanged and no profits will result. Barter made the deal
possible. In a country with a sick economy, a flimsy currency and a
sea of debt, barter accounts for more than two-thirds of all
transactions in Russia. In the West, ``cashless society'' conjures
21st century images of ``smart'' credit cards and high-tech cash
registers and instant electronic debits from a bank account.
Russia's cashless society is from a century in the other direction.
It emerged from a Soviet-era economy that never quite made the
transition to capitalism. The Russian marketplace is hamstrung by
failing banks, the falling ruble, government corruption and an
oppressive tax system. The result is survival-by-barter from the
corner fruit stand to the highest levels of industry. (Holmes, Cox
News Service).

   BARTER-BOX _ SARATOV, Russia _ ``It involves a lot of time and

director of Sapkon/Neftemash, a company in southern Russia that

year, it took a dozen negotiators from his company and others more
than two months to complete a barter deal involving $100,000 worth
of equipment. Here's how it unfolded. (Holmes, Cox News Service).

   RIDERS _ WASHINGTON _ In what has become an annual congressional
struggle, Democrats and Republicans, environmentalists and
regulated interests are going down to the wire over ``riders'' that
have been attached to the Interior Department's appropriation for
next year. These amendments would weaken or at least change various
existing environmental laws. Environmental groups hate them and
President Clinton has promised to veto them, with support among
most congressional Democrats and a few Republicans. With fiscal
1999 beginning Thursday, a Clinton veto over environmental riders
could end up shutting down the government, or much of it. (Nesmith,

fact, combined with the coming winter, will give them a better
chance to find him. Bearhunting season starts Oct. 12, but federal
officials will meet with hunters in Andrews, N.C. to ask for their
participation and remind them of safety tips because agents will
also be in the woods. Bearhunters use tracking dogs, and it's
possible one could stumble on the fugitive or unearth some
evidence. We'll also round up everybody else still in the woods:
feds are now up to 80 agents, and there are a few hangers-on and

Hocking College and Jackson's Rainbow Push Coalition will sponsor
an economic roundtable to discuss ways to expand economic
development in the region. (Hundley, Dayton Daily News). 12.

<P>
   OZONE _ In May, smoke and haze from hundreds of forest fires in
Mexico darkened the skies above Texas. At the time, state officials
were concerned mainly about the potential health effects. Now their
concern has shifted to a new question: Did the smoke and haze cause
elevated ozone readings in Austin, San Antonio, Houston and other
cities? Officials believe it did and have asked the federal
Environmental Protection Agency to ignore those readings. An EPA
official told the state's top environmental officer last week that
the request would be granted. But now the federal agency says it
isn't so sure. The question is not academic. Cities deemed in
violation of the ozone standard are likely to be required to adopt
costly and inconvenient pollution-control measures, including
vehicle-emission inspections, reformulated gasoline and
restrictions on industrial expansion. (Haurwitz, Austin
American-Statesman).

   UT-ASIAN-STUDIES-PROGRAM _ University of Texas administrators
begin their search this week with a series of ads for a professor
to head up an Asian American Studies program to start in the fall
1999 semester. The search culminates a three-year-effort by UT
students and faculty members to rectify what they consider a gaping
hole in the university's ethnic studies programs. While UT has
offered courses African American and Mexican American studies to
students, issues related to the experience of Asian Americans _ who
are the second largest minority group on campus _ has been limited
to the odd class or two. We also explore the place of ethnic
studies in universities nationwide who are still digesting the
Hopwood doctrine. (Shah, Austin American-Statesman)

SAN FRANCISCO SYMPHONY: RUNNING HOT AND COLD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (lb) 
 By ALLAN KOZINN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Now in his fourth season as music director of the San
Francisco Symphony, Michael Tilson Thomas has unquestionably made
his mark as an assembler of fresh and often surprising programs. By
revisiting neglected scores, finding new works that he can make a
case for without seeming doctrinaire, and giving these nearly equal
time with big works from the standard canon, he has persuaded his
listeners to trust him.
</P>
<P>
   His season programs, like those of Esa-Pekka Salonen, in Los
Angeles, have become models of how modern symphony orchestras can
inhabit the present without neglecting the past. Not
coincidentally, his programming has become a truncheon that critics
can use to beat up on Thomas' less adventurous colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   There is, of course, more to a music directorship than
programming, namely, getting an orchestra to play with brilliance
and precision, and perhaps a quality of sound that sets it apart
from its competitors. Here, Thomas' success has been less complete,
or at least, less consistent.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, the all-Gershwin concert with which Thomas and
his San Franciscans opened Carnegie Hall on Wednesday evening was
stunning; yet on Thursday evening, when Thomas conducted works by
Henry Cowell, Berg and Mahler, the playing ran hot and cold, with
lukewarm as the frequent median.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas' program, which moved backward in time, created an
interesting effect. Cowell's generically titled ``Music 1957''
hopped around wildly, with Asian-inspired percussion nestled
happily amid shards of 1950s American popular culture.
</P>
<P>
   Brief glimpses of bright, wind-heavy theatrical writing gave way
to passages that would been at home in the score for a western, and
others that were more overtly folksy. There was little of the
dissonant tone-cluster writing for which Cowell was known; instead,
the piece glanced at romanticism by giving its own time a romantic
gloss.
</P>
<P>
   Berg's early Three Pieces (Op. 6), did a similar trick, if less
flippantly. Their textures, dark mood, sweeping gestures and
portentous hammer strokes look back at Mahler, who died only two
years before these pieces were written, yet they brought their own
anxieties to the table. When Mahler turned up after the
intermission, in the form of his Symphony No. 1, he sounded almost
cheery by comparison.
</P>
<P>
   The orchestra started in fine form, negotiating the changeable
textures and bright hues of the Cowell with an appealing vigor and
solidity. The Berg, with its murkier, busier textures, presented
challenges that the players were not always able to meet.
Entrances, particularly in the brass, sometimes went awry, and
although Thomas' elegant shaping of the work presented its
pessimism unmistakably, there was something missing in the way of
intensity and focus.
</P>
<P>
   That problem was magnified in the Mahler. In the big climactic
moments _ the end of the first movement, the beginning and end of
the last _ the players pulled out all the stops and let it wail.
But what of the rest of the work? Often, Thomas' tempos dragged and
the players' response was reserved and unanimated.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, fine details _ the pointed wind phrasing and some
bracing viola playing, in the third movement _ were offset by
awkward ensemble and occasional pitch problems. The result of these
deficiencies was a dissipation of structure that left the work
sounding episodic rather than unified. But perhaps that was Thomas'
goal: It linked the Mahler to the deliberately scattered Cowell.

DEMOCRATS FACE SCANDAL FALLOUT AT POLLS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For Release Sunday, Sept. 27)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Although President Clinton continues to be buoyed
by polls showing most Americans don't want him to resign or be
impeached, Democrats nonetheless are bracing for a wave of voter
reaction against their congressional candidates on Nov. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats who last summer boasted they might take back the House
now say their main goal is preventing a GOP landslide or maybe even
gaining a seat or two.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Republicans are confidently predicting a gain of 10
or more seats in the House _ if they correctly handle the tricky
politics of the White House sex scandal. The House now has 228
Republicans and 206 Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are in a pickle: If they don't push the impeachment
process, Republicans won't fire up conservative voters to get out
and vote. On the other hand, if they are too aggressive, GOP
congressional candidates risk alienating key swing voters.
</P>
<P>
   Added to this volatile mix is the unknown impact of releasing
yet more evidence from the 445 boxes of grand jury material that
independent counsel Kenneth Starr turned over to the House
Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The impeachment controversy is virtually certain to turn a
sleepy, low-turnout mid-term election into a pulse-quickening
series of races. All 435 House seats are up, as are 34 Senate
seats.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis Gans, director of the Center for the Study of the
American Electorate and an acknowledged expert on voter turnout,
predicted in June that turnout this November ``could possibly be
the lowest in American history.''
</P>
<P>
   This month he's changed his forecast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly we have a much more volatile situation than existed
three months ago,'' Gans said in an interview. ``I'm in the
business now of hedging my bets in ways I wasn't in June..MDNM/''
</P>
<P>
   Polls are sending mixed signals about how heavily the scandal
weighs on voters' minds. A New York Times-CBS poll last week showed
respondents by wide margins don't think impeachment hearings should
be held and don't think Clinton should resign. But the same poll
showed 53 percent of the most likely voters preferring a Republican
House candidate, compared to 41 percent for a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Much could depend on how much of each party's faithful shows up
to vote on election day.
</P>
<P>
   After the release on Sept. 11 of Starr's report, pollsters on
both sides were predicting Republican voters would be energized and
that Democrats would stay home.
</P>
<P>
   But now polls suggest that contrary to expectations, release of
Clinton's videotaped testimony last Monday actually helped the
president. Further, polls also show that many Americans just want
the whole thing to go away.
</P>
<P>
   The result: Democrats feel the momentum may be swinging back
towards them.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans who go full tilt for impeachment are ``playing with
fire, and I think they're going to get burned,'' said Democratic
political consultant and pollster Mark Mellman.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic charges that House Republicans have overstepped their
bounds by releasing salacious material and pushing impeachment
``may excite (the Democrats') hardcore partisans, but it's not
going to play to the bulk of Americans out there,'' predicted Ed
Goeas, a Republican pollster and consultant.
</P>
<P>
   Goeas said polling done by his organization, The Tarrance Group,
shows the Republican vote hardening while the Democratic vote
softens. Polls notwithstanding, Americans have made up their minds
about Clinton's liability in the scandal, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are in the process of coming to a decision about what
the punishment should be,'' Goeas said. ``To take public opinion at
a point in process and say `This is what people say' is not only
misleading, I think it's dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the White House sex scandal, Democrats also face
another gloomy reality: Even in normal times, off-year elections
generally bring bad news for the party in power in the White House.
The last time the president's party did not loose seats was 1934,
just as President Franklin D. Roosevelt, a Democrat, was launching
the New Deal.
</P>
<P>
   To get past the sex scandal, some Democrats in tight House races
are putting as much distance as possible between themselves and
Clinton. Most are trying to focus attention on issues such as
health care, Social Security and education.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats also question whether the scandal will have much
impact on the elections at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our chances of regaining the House today would be basically
the same if Monica Lewinsky had never left Beverly Hills 90210,''
said Mellman.

BILL TO FIGHT RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION ABROAD GAINS IN CONGRESS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va., Pa., Okla., Minn., Neb.)  (bl)  
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After months of negotiations, a bill that would
require the U.S. government to punish any foreign country that
persecutes its citizens for their religious beliefs is likely to
become law this year.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This week, senators brokered a compromise that would allow
Majority Leader Trent Lott to fulfill a promise he made to
conservative religious groups to bring a bill up for a vote before
Congress adjourns for the year. The Senate could vote on the
measure as early as next week.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the House overwhelmingly approved a more
restrictive version of the bill, but the main author of that
measure signaled his support for the Senate bill Friday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good bill,'' said Rep. Frank Wolf, R-Va., who predicted
the full House would approve the measure. ``The failure to pass a
bill would result in open season on people's faith.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Countries found to be violating religious freedoms would be
subject to a wide range of penalties, from mild diplomatic protest
to strict economic sanctions. But the Senate compromise gives the
president much more flexibility in deciding those punishments than
earlier versions of the bill.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   White House officials, who had said President Clinton would veto
the earlier House and Senate legislation, expressed cautious
optimism Friday that a handful of sticking points could be
resolved, allowing Clinton to sign the compromise bill and avoid a
risky political showdown with Congress.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With this year's congressional session rapidly winding down,
House and Senate Republican leaders are eager to tout the measure
to their conservative base as a major legislative accomplishment,
and put in the hands of candidates an achievement they can use on
the campaign trail.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, however, have been deeply divided over the bill
with social conservatives like the Christian Coalition saying the
measure is needed to protect religious freedoms, while moderates,
encouraged by the Chamber of Commerce, saying it would alienate
important diplomatic and trade partners.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The breakthrough came Wednesday night when Sen. Don Nickles,
R-Okla., the majority whip, agreed to water down the Senate bill to
win the support of two pro-trade Republicans, Sens. Chuck Hagel of
Nebraska and Rod Grams of Minnesota, whose opposition had bottled
up the bill in committee.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., who wrote the House bill with Wolf,
said in an interview, ``It's not as tough as our bill, but it's the
best compromise we can work out.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Senators and their aides were still ironing out details on the
measure today, and it was still possible some last-minute problem
could unhinge the deal. A few important senators, like Joseph Biden
of Delaware, the ranking Democrat on the Foreign Relations
Committee, were holding out for changes the White House wants, like
fewer required reports on countries that are restricting religious
liberties.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But supporters of the bill expressed confidence that the
modified bill could go to the Senate floor for a vote as early as
next week. ``It should have broad bipartisan support,'' said John
Czwartacki, a spokesman for Lott.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No one in Congress objects to the proposition that the United
States should do more to promote religious freedoms around the
world. The big question has been how.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the legislation cite a shocking stream of
incidents, from the killing of Christians in Pakistan and the
Sudan, to the torture of Tibetan Buddhist monks with serrated
knives and thumb screws, as evidence that tougher measures are
needed.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In May, the House voted, 375-41, to impose automatic sanctions
against countries that permit or endorse a pattern of violent
attacks or other persecution against religious believers. Violators
would face a cutoff in U.S. aid, except for medical supplies and
food, and U.S. opposition to loans from international financial
institutions.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the House bill never stood a chance in the Senate because of
solid Republican opposition to automatic economic sanctions.
Moreover, senators complained that the House approach would
indiscriminately impose sanctions on such allies as Saudi Arabia,
Germany, Greece and Israel.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``If we start picking on our allies and friends, then in the end
we may be doing more harm to ourselves and to the stability of the
world,'' Hagel said Friday.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Over the past several months, Nickles has met quietly with about
half a dozen senators on both sides of the issue to hammer out a
compromise.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Under this week's deal, the State Department would publish an
annual report on religious liberties country by country. As a check
on the administration, an independent commission would also issue a
separate non-binding report. Another State Department report would
identify the countries where the administration was taking steps to
improve religious freedoms.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Whenever the president and his aides decide that a specific
country had risen to the level of a ``particularly severe
violator'' of religious freedoms, the president would have to
impose one of more than a dozen penalties or waive the penalty for
national security reasons or because it would hurt religious
freedoms.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This change significantly weakens both the House and original
Senate versions, which required the government to issue an annual
list of countries declared guilty of religious persecution. The
president will now decide that on a case-by-case basis, sparing
offending countries the stigma of appearing on an annual ``bad
guys'' list, Senate aides said.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not as strong as we'd hoped for,'' said Jeffrey Taylor,
the Christian Coalition's chief lobbyist in Washington, ``but they
are changes we can live with.''  &QL;

PARTY FACES SURGE OF DISCONTENT OVER HANDLING OF STORM CLEANUP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Sept. 27)   (EDs: Photos available on Wieck database)

<TEXT>
<P>
   VENUSTIANO CARRANZA, Mexico _ A year ago, Joaquin Flores Juarez
used to drive his car up the steep slope of this hillside suburb of
Acapulco and park in front of his house.
</P>
<P>
   Then came Hurricane Pauline last October, dumping more than half
of the rainfall this normally wet coastline receives in a year on
Acapulco in less than four hours and sending torrents of water, mud
and rocks cascading down the hillsides.
</P>
<P>
   Now Flores' wife and neighbors do their laundry in the stream
coursing through the house-sized boulders occupying what used to be
a paved road in this slum-like settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the promises of President Ernesto Zedillo and other
political leaders last October that storm damage would rapidly be
cleaned up and repaired, nothing has been done in Venustiano
Carranza, residents complain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Juan Salgado Tenorio came through here four days after the
hurricane and promised us that they would rebuild the road and fix
everything,'' Flores said of Acapulco's former mayor.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when?'' Flores asked.
</P>
<P>
   The extent of the unrepaired damage is mute testimony to
Pauline's power, which struck an unprepared Acapulco, killing
nearly 200 residents and washing homes, businesses and vehicles
into the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   The city's opulent tourist hotel strip was restored in a matter
of days, even while bodies were still being dug out of the mud
farther up the hillsides, while poorer neighborhoods still
languish. Many here see that as a lesson to everyday residents from
Guerrero state's government, long run by the Institutional
Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
</P>
<P>
   It is a lesson that is not lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that their (PRI's) history of lies is causing people
every day to go to other political parties,'' Flores said.
``They've been promising us things for years, but we can't do
anything about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Acapulco, including the hillside community of Venustiano
Carranza, is the largest city and revenue base for the state of
Guerrero; nearly one third of Guerrero's residents live and work
here.
</P>
<P>
   While most tourists in Mexico's flagship beach resort see
air-conditioned, high-rise hotels, classy restaurants and all-night
discotheques, they frequently miss the steamy urban poverty in
which 90 percent of Acapulquenses live.
</P>
<P>
   To date, Acapulco voters have loyally returned a
70-year-succession of PRI mayors to power, watching them go on to
become state party presidents, governors and important national
politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Guerrero remains Mexico's third poorest state.
</P>
<P>
   But the center-left Democratic Revolutionary Party, or PRD, is
making inroads among frustrated voters in Acapulco and the
countryside, and it expects to contend for the statehouse in
elections here next February.
</P>
<P>
   Out in the countryside, another political force is growing.
</P>
<P>
   Guerrillas from the Popular Revolutionary Army (EPR) have been
ambushing state police and Mexican army patrols for more than two
years. Dozens of police officers, troops and guerrillas have been
killed.
</P>
<P>
   Although police and army investigators have uncovered a few EPR
safe houses in Acapulco, the guerrilla group has yet to launch an
urban commando raid within the resort city.
</P>
<P>
   But many say that as the political frustration mounts, the
conditions are ripening, and Acapulco could soon see the kind of
violence now experienced in Guerrero's countryside.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that people are angry enough to join them,'' Flores
said of the EPR.
</P>
<P>
   Maximo Gomez Munoz, a Roman Catholic parish priest who lives
about 60 miles up the coast from Acapulco and who is considered a
kind of patron saint of Guerrero's peasant guerrilla movement,
agreed with Flores.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very difficult to bring that kind of rural warfare into
an urban environment like Acapulco,'' Gomez conceded.
</P>
<P>
   ``It represents a great challenge to the EPR,'' he said. ``But
they have a lot of people there. You will see that.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Venustiano Carranza is an eight-year-old mountainside community
of 241 houses variously built of brick, split palm trunks, or just
palm fronds nailed to 2-by-4 uprights. You can see right through
many of them; others gain privacy by hanging cotton bedsheets
behind the palm fronds.
</P>
<P>
   Marcelino Cedeno Gomez has been community president here for six
years, representing residents' interests to the PRI-dominated
Acapulco city council and the Guerrero state government.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Cedeno how good those governments have been to Venustiano
Carranza and he unleashes a torrent of words only slightly less
powerful than the waters that tore through here last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``People here need streets, lights, water, electricity,
everything,'' Cedeno said. ``We pay our taxes just like everyone
else does, but we get nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``People here are not in agreement with that; there have been
demonstrations and massacres (in other parts of the state). The
government has exploited the most marginalized people to drain our
wealth,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While awaiting help from the city to repair the ruined roads,
Cedeno and others here built their own system of running water,
tapping a mountainside spring and bringing the water to
distribution points in garden hoses. To augment the few utility
poles, electric wires hang from braided steel cables draped in
convenient trees.
</P>
<P>
   In November, community members scraped together 5,000 pesos
(about $600) and gave the money to Acapulco city officials to hire
an earthmover to start roadwork, Cedeno said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But then the mayor quit and the money disappeared, and we were
left with some paint marks on the boulders where they were going to
work,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Cedeno says he is a loyal PRI man and will continue
to support his party.
</P>
<P>
   Right now that party is deeply divided in Guerrero.
</P>
<P>
   At least seven early candidates are vying for the party's
gubernatorial nominations in elections next February. Several
consider themselves reformers, opposed to the near-feudal grip the
traditional wing of the party has had on Guerrero for nearly 70
years.
</P>
<P>
   Six of the seven have threatened to boycott the statewide party
primary because they say outgoing Gov. Angel Aguirre is using state
funds to promote his favorite against them.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the betrayals and the grumblings of many fellow
residents, who say they are going to vote for the PRD, Cedeno said
he would support one of the reform candidates.
</P>
<P>
   His reasoning reveals the hopeful stoicism _ now crumbling in
Guerrero _ that has helped keep Mexico's ruling party in power for
decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have always been a PRIista,'' he said. ``The party
principles are good. It is the local representatives who are bad.''

   MIAMI _ After leaving nearly 300 people dead in a five-day
rampage across the Caribbean, Hurricane Georges slammed into the
Florida Keys with winds of more than 100 miles an hour Friday,
causing widespread flooding and extensive damage to buildings,
homes, roads, harbors and power lines.
</P>
<P>
   No deaths had been reported in the storm's passage across the
extreme southwestern tip of Florida. But fears that heavily
populated areas of Florida's Gulf Coast could be inundated by the
heavy rainfall accompanying the hurricane led authorities to extend
evacuation directives to a total of 1.4 million people. In Tampa
and Miami, shelters were said to be filled to capacity.
</P>
<P>
   The National Hurricane Center here forecast that Georges would
strengthen by late Saturday to a category-three storm, with
sustained winds of at least 115 miles an hour. A hurricane watch
was issued from the Florida panhandle to Morgan City, La.
Meteorologists warned that the storm could make landfall again as
early as Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Packing 105 mile-an-hour winds and storm surges of up to seven
feet, the core of the storm hit Key West just before midday,
creating whiteout conditions much like those of a snowstorm and
knocking out the last remaining electrical power. The storm's
passage coincided with high tide, leading to extensive flooding
throughout the islands of the lower Keys.
</P>
<P>
   In the Dominican Republic, where rescue workers were still
fighting to get to villages isolated by floods and mudslides, the
official death toll rose to 134. But officials said at least
another 800 people are still missing and feared dead. ``In a word,
the picture is one of desolation,'' said President Leonel Fernandez
after visiting devastated areas.
</P>
<P>
   In neighboring Haiti, at least 87 bodies had been recovered, but
authorities feared the death toll would grow as they moved into
rural areas.

 &HT;    Charleston festival digs into southern gardening
 &HT;    By Danny C. Flanders
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLESTON, S.C._Few events do more to re-energize Southern
gardeners after a long, hot summer than the Charleston Garden
Festival.
</P>
<P>
   The Southeast's largest fall gardening extravaganza, set for
Thursday through Oct. 4, will include exhibits, workshops, garden
tours, a marketplace and symposium sure to inspire. The speakers,
several from the Atlanta area, will include:
</P>
<P>
   -- Allan Armitage, a University of Georgia horticulture
professor and author, who will take a look at the joys and woes of
gardening in the South.
</P>
<P>
   -- Mike Shoup, founder of the Antique Rose Emporium in Dahlonega
and Brenham, Texas, who will discuss cultivating old Southern
roses.
</P>
<P>
   -- Philip Watson, internationally known garden designer, who
will discuss ways to add romance and mystery to the garden.
</P>
<P>
   -- Felder Rushing, co-author of ``Passalong Plants'' (University
of North Carolina Press, $16.95), the best-selling gardening book
of 1993, who's guaranteed to make gardeners laugh at their
obsessions.
</P>
<P>
   -- Scott Ogden, a garden designer, author and bulb expert, who
will offer new ideas for Southern plant selections.
</P>
<P>
   The sixth annual festival celebrates ``A Sense of the South''
with special exhibits and lectures honoring two of Charleston's
most beloved gardeners: landscape architect Loutrell Briggs and
author Emily Whaley. ``This exhibit is going to be massive, some
4,000 square feet,'' said Rebecca Gosnell, festival manager.
</P>
<P>
   Another exhibit, by Atlanta garden designer Ryan Gainey, will
highlight ``A Southern Perspective,'' a garden featuring old roses,
boxwood hedges and traditional arbors.
</P>
<P>
   Proceeds will benefit the event's sponsor, the Florence
Crittenton Programs of South Carolina, which provides services for
pregnant and single women.
</P>

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Friday, an intensified Hurricane Georges crossed through the
Straits of Florida, bringing destructive winds and torrential rains
to the Florida Keys. At midday Friday, Sombrero Key recorded a gust
of 113 miles per hour while several feet of sea water washed over
numerous sections of U.S. Highway One.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Georges will churn steadily toward the northwest,
posing a series threat to the central Gulf Coast. Some of the outer
bands of heavy rain should reach coastal Louisiana and the Big Bend
of Florida on Saturday afternoon. As is often the case with
tropical systems, thunderstorms embedded within the rain bands may
spawn isolated tornadoes, especially across western Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Farther north, a surge of unusually warm air will reach the
Northeastern states on gusty breezes from the southwest. Beneath
intervals of clouds and sunshine, afternoon readings will surpass
80 degrees in many locations. As a series of jet stream
disturbances intercept the fast flow of warm air, isolated but
severe thunderstorms will erupt across the Middle West and Great
Lakes. A few of the stronger storms will produce small swaths of
destructive winds and hail. Scattered thunderstorms will also form
along a cold front advancing southeast through the central Plains
and upper Mississippi Valley.
</P>
<P>
   In the West, moist winds circulating around low pressure will
bring clouds and showers to portions of the interior Northwest,
especially in the higher elevations. Meanwhile, the Southwestern
states will be mainly sunny and dry though patchy clouds will hug
the California coast.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Tornadoes and Hurricanes
</P>
<P>
   Twisters and Hurricanes Tornadoes were spotted in Florida on
Friday as Hurricane Georges moved into the Gulf of Mexico. While
hurricanes and tornadoes are very different, the strong winds of a
hurricane promote the conditions necessary for tornado formation.
Typically, the strongest winds of a hurricane are located a few
thousand feet above the ground. Objects on the ground impede air
flow. This effect, called friction, reduces air speed along the
earth's surface. The change in wind speed with height, called wind
shear, creates the twisting motions that can lead to tornado
formation.

 &HT;    Some religious leaders call for judgment on Clinton, others
express willingness to put scandal behind them
 &HT;    By Gayle White
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   While the president darts around the definition of a ``sexual
relationship'' and the question of whether he had one with former
intern Monica Lewinsky, some religious leaders express concern
about another relationship _ that between the president and his own
conscience. The question they ask is, ``Did he or didn't he truly
repent?''
</P>
<P>
   In Judaism, repenting is described as teshuvah, which means
turning. The concept is especially prominent in the Jewish
consciousness this time of year as Jews prepare to mark Yom Kippur,
the annual Day of Atonement, which begins at sundown Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton himself made a connection between his situation and the
concept on the day Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's report was
made public. On that day, Clinton read a modern Yom Kippur prayer
to a group of clergy at a White House prayer breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   It said in part, ``For leaves, birds and animals, turning comes
instinctively. But for us, turning does not come so easily. It
takes an act of will for us to make a turn. It means breaking old
habits. It means admitting that we have been wrong, and this is
never easy. It means losing face. It means starting all over again.
And this is always painful. It means saying I am sorry. It means
recognizing that we have the ability to change. These things are
terribly hard to do. But unless we turn, we will be trapped forever
in yesterday's ways.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What Jewish philosophy says is that God can only forgive you
for what you've done in relation to God,says Rabbi Steven Lebow,
Reform rabbi of Cobb County's Temple Kol Emeth. ``In order to
achieve atonement with fellow human beings, you have to go to them
and say what you've done wrong and ask them to forgive you.''
</P>
<P>
   The president's own faith, Christianity, emphasizes God's
willingness to forgive sinners. Whereas Judaism teaches that people
must atone for their wrongdoing by confessing and apologizing to
those they have wronged and attempting to make restitution,
Christianity accepts the concept of ``substitutionary atonement'' _
that Jesus' death on the cross paid for the sins of all his
followers.
</P>
<P>
   ``What makes Christianity different in my perspective is Jesus
gives us a way to have our sins taken away,'' says Max Lucado, a
San Antonio minister and author whose latest book is the recently
published ``Just Like Jesus'' (Word, $19.99). ``First of all that
gives us the assurance _ you, me and President Clinton _ that I
confess my sins to Christ and they're taken away. My recourse is to
never deny sin, but to always confess sin.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is an expectation that change will be coupled with
confession in true repentance, says George Stroup, professor of
theology at Columbia Theological Seminary in Decatur. ``Repentance
does mean, in the context of Scripture, changing your path and
going in a different way,'' he says. ``To talk about repenting
means to intentionally try to turn one's life in such a way that
one does not continue down the same destructive path that one has
been going down, to do that from a Christian point of view with
God's grace.''
</P>
<P>
   The catch, says Stroup, is that cynics and skeptics may never be
able to know whether the president has truly repented. ``It does
seem to me that a person who has confessed sin and is genuinely
involved in trying to mend his life does not have to have that
observed by the public,'' he said. ``I guess for many of us the
very deep dilemma is in not wanting to be legalistic and
judgmental, to argue that God's grace is about forgiveness. On the
other hand, how do you keep it from becoming cheap grace where
anything goes?''
</P>
<P>
   The president has asked three ministers to be his spiritual
advisers. They are J. Philip Wogaman of Foundry United Methodist
Church in Washington, where the Clintons frequently attend;
evangelical pastor and writer Tony Campolo, a sociology professor
at Eastern College in Pennsylvania; and Gordon MacDonald, senior
minister of the interdenominational Grace Chapel in Lexington,
Mass., who acknowledged an adulterous affair 11 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Some religious leaders have been quick to call for judgment on
the president. Christian Coalition founder and former presidential
candidate Pat Robertson told 3,000 coalition members last week that
they are obligated to forgive ``Clinton the man'' but should demand
impeachment for Clinton the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've heard a lot of discussion about repentance and
forgiveness lately,'' he said, ``but at the same time we recognize
that the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob is a God of law and
justice. ... We know that the Lamb of God is also the lion of
Judah.''
</P>
<P>
   Others already have expressed their willingness to put the
scandal behind them. Some prominent clergy, including several top
black church leaders, signed ``An Appeal for Healing: A Pastoral
Letter to the Nation'' calling for forgiveness of Clinton and a
``return to the real needs of people.''
</P>
<P>
   But neither quick judgment nor unconditional forgiveness may
bring about immediate healing of the country, say other
theologians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forgiveness is not something arrived at easily and involves a
long process of efforts at confession, true contrition, prayer for
healing and prayer for reconciliation,'' said Kathleen M. O'Connor,
a Catholic teaching Old Testament at Columbia, a Presbyterian
seminary. O'Connor said she likes to break the term ``atonement''
into ``at one ment.'' That means, she says, that ``individuals,
community, God and peoples of the earth are celebrated as one.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Forgiveness doesn't follow just because we decide to
forgive,'' she says. ``One has to work through feelings of anger
and betrayal.''
</P>
<P>
   Forgiveness, she says, is a process.
</P>
<P>
   One person who can speak firsthand about the difficulty of
forgiveness is Debbie Morris, a schoolteacher, mother and author of
``Forgiving the Dead Man Walking,'' a recent autobiographical book
about her eventual forgiveness of Robert Willie, the convict whose
story was told by death row chaplain Sister Helen Prejean in her
book ``Dead Man Walking.''
</P>
<P>
   Morris was raped and kidnapped and her boyfriend was killed by
Willie 18 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Willie never asked for her forgiveness, but she gave it ``for
myself,'' she says. ``I needed to be able to let go of the anger
and the pain and the hatred that was harming me. I was being
destroyed by that _ not Robert Willie.''
</P>
<P>
   In cases where there is a relationship to be rebuilt,
restoration requires work beyond forgiveness, Morris says. That is
true of a marriage where there has been betrayal. And that goes for
a country and its president.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I look at the whole Bill Clinton thing, what he expects
after a history of dishonesty and unfaithfulness is to say, 'I'm
sorry. Forgive me. Let's move on.' People can say, 'We forgive you,
but the trust is not there any more.'''
</P>
<P>
   To rebuild that trust and to make something good come of an
awkward time in the nation's history, Americans have to focus on
themselves as well as the president, says O'Connor.
</P>
<P>
   ``From my point of view, the current conversation centers on
sexual sin and cover-up of that sin,'' she said. ``That is a
deflection from other moral issues _ sins of racism, sins that are
involved in our class blindness to the homeless on the street, to
the unemployed. We seem so obsessed with this event that the real
important political and moral issues are being sidestepped and
there's not energy left for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Few people seem to devote the same kind of attention to the use
of military power as they do to questions of the president's
behavior, she said. ``This may be our fault because as a people
we're so inner-focused and so content with our own power.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Franklin, president of Atlanta's Interdenominational
Theological Center, says he also believes that either quick
forgiveness or a race to judgment will deprive the president and
the country of an important period that can be used for
self-examination.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to the annual meeting of the Religion Newswriters
Association in Atlanta last week, Franklin suggested that the
president take some time off _ perhaps to go to a monastery and
write a ``spiritual autobiography.'' The country should
symbolically do the same, says Franklin, who attended the
president's prayer breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to lead us forward, Mr. Clinton may first have to
lead us inward,'' Franklin says. ``For it is only within the
sanctity of this most private and spiritual space where we may
discover, individually and collectively, a moral consciousness that
inextricably ties who we are to what we do.''

 &HT;    Charleston's first lady of gardening pens a final message of fun
 &HT;    By Danny C. Flanders
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLESTON, S.C._Pushing 90, Emily Whaley could still tend her
garden, paint landscapes, give grandchildren dance lessons and bang
out at the piano one rambunctious rendition of ``The Dark Town
Strutter's Ball.''
</P>
<P>
   The Charlestonian drove to a weekly bridge game and, until she
developed back problems several years ago, played golf and tennis.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, at her family's urging, she wrote her first book.
``Mrs. Whaley and Her Charleston Garden,'' which made several
best-seller lists, landed her on the front page of national
newspapers and made her a hot ticket on the lecture circuit,
offered plenty of tips for creating a backyard paradise (``Early to
bed, early to rise, work like hell and fertilize'').
</P>
<P>
   Yet it was her simple recipe for getting the best out of life
that struck the loudest chord with those wrestling with day-to-day
stresses and consumed with materialism. ``You don't live but once _
at least that's all I think I'll get _ but we put a lot of emphasis
on things that don't matter,'' she said. ``We don't take the time
to appreciate what's around us.''
</P>
<P>
   That includes not only the beauty she found in her tiny garden
but in the friends she made while serving up her favorite
Charleston recipes _ a pastime she explores in a new book, ``Mrs.
Whaley Entertains'' (Algonquin Books, $17.95), which goes on sale
today.
</P>
<P>
   For Whaley, a lifelong goal was to be organized so entertaining
``will be no trouble at all ... so that I can sit serenely on the
front porch dressed up like a fiddler's bitch in my beads and
earrings and drink several cocktails and then invite everyone in to
supper and have it be perfectly delicious, just the right
temperature, sitting there in my latest kitchen gadget, the one
with the good-looking white domed lid.''
</P>
<P>
   A perfect hostess, yes.
</P>
<P>
   But above all, like most girls, Emily Whaley just wanted to have
fun. Did she ever _ right up until suffering a stroke June 13 at
her summer home in Flat Rock, N.C., where she died the next day, at
age 87.
</P>
<P>
   Whaley had looked forward to a busy fall schedule on the
speaking circuit with her new volume, said her daughter, Angie
LeClercq, of Charleston. ``She told me, `I'm on top of the world. I
want you to buy us a new camera so we can photograph the garden at
different times of day to explain the effects of light.'''
</P>
<P>
   One of those talks was to have been at next weekend's Charleston
Garden Festival, which will pay tribute to Whaley's work. Her
daughter will deliver the talk her mother had planned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Emily is the perfect person to be honored because she
single-handedly did more to heighten awareness for Charleston
gardens than anyone else by opening her garden to the public for so
many years,'' said Mary Palmer Dargan of Hugh Dargan &AMP; Associates,
an Atlanta landscape architecture firm that began in Charleston.
</P>
<P>
   An instant celebrity
</P>
<P>
   During the 60 years Whaley tended her Church Street retreat, it
became a favorite stop on the city's garden tours. And last year,
after South Carolina novelist William Baldwin collaborated with her
on ``Mrs. Whaley and Her Charleston Garden'' (Algonquin, $16.95),
the 30-foot-wide oasis drew up to 300 visitors a week.
</P>
<P>
   Though Whaley loved the attention, the crowds at her gate often
proved an intrusion for someone who enjoyed nothing better than
sipping an afternoon scotch in the solitude of her back yard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not my thing,'' she muttered last year while graciously
signing books for tourists ignorant of Charleston custom _ that an
open gate is an invitation, a closed one, a hint.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't so much the roses and hydrangeas that lured folks
inside, but the chance to meet a Southern belle unafraid to speak
her mind. In a town where societal standards reach as high as the
palmettos, Whaley cared little about what others thought. If she
chose to decorate her garden with sentimental seashells instead of
saintly statues, so be it. ``A garden is like your bedroom,'' she
said. ``You make memories there. You make mistakes there. But it's
nobody's business what else goes on there.''
</P>
<P>
   Always seizing the moment, Whaley realized tulips
</P>
<P>
   were a short-lived luxury but planted them anyway. ``A big
chocolate cake doesn't last either . . . You wear a wedding dress
once. You plant tulips once,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Always open to change, Whaley never entered her garden without
pruning shears in hand. ``Gardening is like interior decorating,''
she said. ``You move things around. Then one morning you get up and
ask yourself, 'Why the hell did I plant that there?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Her broadmindedness, especially at her age, is what impressed
Shannon Ravenel, editorial director for Algonquin Books and a
childhood friend of Whaley's three daughters.
</P>
<P>
   ``She also was a great role model for Charleston women because
she believed we could get out there and do whatever we wanted,
think independently and stand up for ourselves,'' Ravenel said.
</P>
<P>
   Recipes for friendships. Whaley relished cooking for her
husband, Ben, a prominent Charleston lawyer and state legislator,
and their children almost as much as she did planting her
perennials. As her mother had done, she compiled a cookbook of
family recipes 10 years ago for her own children. They are the
backbone of her new book.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just remember, you can cultivate friendships just as you
cultivate flowers,'' she wrote. ``I have found over my eighty-seven
years that there are about the same percentages of amusing, gifted,
humorous, boring, stingy, and malicious people in every social
drawer. Life is short. Plant and tend a friendship garden that will
grow and flourish.''
</P>
<P>
   She stresses the need to develop confidence while entertaining.
``If the hostess is all aflutter like a butterfly caught in a
net,'' she wrote, then guests will feel, ``as the Irish say, 'I
wish I was to home and the party was to hell!' ''
</P>
<P>
   Whaley knew people were intrgued by the topic of aging but she
approached it head on. ``This categorizing of where old age starts
and what it looks like should be kicked overboard,'' she said. ``It
seems to me that as long we are physically independent and open to
absorbing new and different ways of doing things and incorporating
these news ways into our everyday life, then we qualify as viable,
productive humans.''
</P>
<P>
   She recalled an elderly visitor to her garden, who, after losing
his train of thought, apologized, explaining, ``I'm having a senior
moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Whaley says she often borrowed that expression. But, though her
eyesight was failing, her mind was as sharp as her tongue, said
Baldwin, the McClellanville writer who recorded Whaley's memories.
``When the proofs came in, I'd read the entire text to her,'' he
said. ``She would listen and at certain parts say, 'Boring, boring,
boring.' She had a good ear.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially for music. And Whaley knew how to wake up a party.
</P>
<P>
   A cousin, Bobby Shealy of Columbia, S.C., will never forget a
realtive's wedding reception. ``Nobody was dancing,'' he recalled.
``So Emily comes up, grabs me and asks the band, 'Do you know 'Mack
the Knife?' They did, and she said, 'Hit it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The stoop-shouldered Whaley pulled Shealy to the middle of the
dance floor, where all eyes turned as she led a partner, 50 years
her junior, in a lively shag. ``After that, everyone poured onto
the dance floor,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was just so inspirational, at gardening and everything
else.'' Now, her garden and books will remain an inspiration.
Whaley left her home to her youngest daughter, Charleston artist
Marty Whaley Adams, who plans to continue opening the garden,
LeClercq said, for tours, such as next weekend's garden festival.
The event draws locals as well as tourists, who clog the
cobbletstone streets, visit historic sites such as St. Philip's
Church, where Whaley's ashes were placed near her husband's grave,
and dine in quaint seafood restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   In both books, Whaley couldn't resist giving her favorite
restaurant, California Dreaming, a plug. There, usually with her
good friend, 92-year-old Creighton Frampton, she enjoyed breaking
the rules of the low fat/low salt diets that rule the lives of so
many elderly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The place is always full of young people, a tremendous variety
of people. And very noisy,'' she wrote. ``I pull my chair up to
Creighton. I get my right ear up to him, my good ear. I order a
glass of wine. We always have a grand time. We always order the
fried flounder. And fried potatoes. When we go in there we're not
going to eat a damn thing but fried food and a couple of glasses of
wine.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a ``senior moment,'' Emily Whaley style.

 &HT;    Mrs. Whaley delights us with companion cookbook
 &HT;    By Wendell Brock
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   We may never get around to making Laura's Coffee Jelly or
decorating a wedding cake with ivy leaves made of sugar, but Emily
Whaley did, and she wants to tell us about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mrs. Whaley Entertains'' is a dotingly annotated collection of
recipes and stories that serves as a bookend to last year's popular
``Mrs. Whaley and Her Charleston Garden.'' As good as the recipes
for shrimp pie, hominy bread and fried chicken might sound, the
best ingredient, naturally, is the delicious discourse of this
octogenarian bon vivant.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I finally married, my knowledge of cooking did not fill a
thimble,'' she writes in the opening pages of the posthumously
published volume, assembled for her grandchildren. Imagine a
country girl in a big Northern city, sipping her first martini and
eating her first raw oyster. Or a newlywed bride trying to roast a
chicken in the first electric stove she's ever seen. At her best,
Whaley can be as funny as Lucille Ball, as cheeky as Thackeray's
Becky Sharp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now Aunt Cad was a wonderful, rich personality,'' she writes
in the ``Charleston Seafood'' chapter, most of which happens in
Philadelphia. ``She looked like she had imbibed lots of clotted
cream and lots of everything else. She'd never held herself back.
She must have weighed 185, wore her dresses to her ankle and had
the richest, most wonderful laugh.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like Aunt Cad would have loved Whaley's Chedda Cheese
Souffle and lasagna, her brownies, lemon bars, cakes and fudge.
While many of these recipes could be found in your average church
bazaar cookbook, ``Mrs. Whaley Entertains'' is a fascinating slice
of life from this century of change.
</P>
<P>
   Born into an era of wood stoves and white gloves, Whaley learned
to love her microwave and tennis shoes. Though some of the stories
feel a little half-baked, some of the language a tad stale, the
book is a testament to a way of life that's disappearing. It is a
paean to good manners, the corner grocery and Charleston's
long-vanished door-to-door shrimp salesmen.
</P>
<P>
   Emily Whaley was a self-described ``gadgeteer'' who never met an
asparagus server or a ``bacon triangle'' she didn't like. It was
her way of saving time for all that joie de vivre.
</P>

Baldwin. Algonquin. $18. 247 pages.

NEW MEDICAL CLINIC TO SERVE GAY, LESBIAN COMMUNITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _In another sign that the AIDS crisis has abated in
Los Angeles, the L.A. Gay &AMP; Lesbian Center will open a doctor's
office to cater to the health-care needs of gays and lesbians
beyond just HIV and AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   The new Lambda Medical Group location, which will be staffed by
five family-practice physicians and one ob-gyn affiliated with the
University of Southern California School of Medicine, opens today
at the Museum Square Building, 5757 Wilshire Blvd., Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to offer a safe haven for gay men and lesbians in a
setting that combines sensitivity with quality care,'' said Lorri
Jean, executive director of the L.A. Gay &AMP; Lesbian Center, the
city's largest provider of social and medical services for the gay
community.
</P>
<P>
   Research has shown that lesbian and gay people avoid seeking
medical care because of fear of discrimination from doctors and
other medical workers, Jean said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, some gays and lesbians avoid doctor visits or don't
reveal their sexual orientation, raising the risk of a
misdiagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   The Lambda Medical Group will be the umbrella name for the
center's full range of medical services, which includes a clinic
for people with HIV and AIDS and a women's health clinic. These
services, offered free or on a sliding scale for 15 years, will
continue to be available at the center's headquarters at 1625 N.
Schrader Blvd., Los Angeles. Most insurance, including health
management organization plans and Medi-Cal, are accepted at all
three locations.

DRUG GANGS DEVASTATE INDIAN VILLAGES IN BAJA CALIFORNIA

<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA CATARINA, Mexico _ After five centuries of killing and
pestilence that began with the Spanish conquest, only a few hundred
of Baja California's indigenous people are left alive. And now they
are being hunted down and killed by drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   The violence began two years ago when the leader of an
indigenous village that resisted traffickers' efforts to take over
communal lands for drug cultivation was gunned down, along with
another Indian, in an ambush along a rural road.
</P>
<P>
   While some have resisted, other Indians have been seduced by the
quick fortunes that can reward those who manage desert airstrips or
offer other services to the drug cartels. And that has resulted in
a string of killings in the Indian communities that cling to the
arid hills 60 miles south of the California border.
</P>
<P>
   The violence took on horrifying new dimensions last week when
two entire families of Indians from the Pai-Pai ethnic group, along
with a household of neighbors, were dragged from their homes and
shot to death in a driveway in Ensenada, a coastal city to which
some Indians have migrated. It was Mexico's worst incident of
drug-related bloodshed in memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not many Pai-Pai, and this has devastated our
community,'' said Armando Gonzalez, the commissioner of communal
lands in Santa Catarina, waving across the horizon of wooden huts
and cactus that make up this desert hamlet where seven of the
massacre victims were buried Sunday. ``For us there's never been
anything so calamitous.''
</P>
<P>
   Few institutions or communities in Mexico are being spared the
effects of the multibillion-dollar drug industry, and even the most
remote indigenous communities are no exception.
</P>
<P>
   ``The traffickers are taking advantage of the traditional
conflicts that have plagued these communities, and that is
undermining the fragile sense of cohesion that exists,'' said
Everardo Garduno Ruiz, a graduate student at Arizona State
University who wrote a book about Baja California's indigenous
communities.
</P>
<P>
   The Jesuit missionaries who explored Baja California in the 16th
century estimated the native population at 50,000. The Catholic
Church persecuted the Pai-Pai and speakers of four other indigenous
languages, labeling their traditional healers as pagans. The
Indians resisted all efforts to transform them into sedentary
farmers until the 1930s, when the government finally forced them
onto communal lands. Today only about 1,000 Baja California natives
are left, Garduno said.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, tuberculosis, alcoholism and emigration were
among the main causes of decline, but the disintegration quickened
a decade ago when drug traffickers began to muscle in on the
communities.
</P>
<P>
   San Isidoro, a Pai-Pai village 30 miles southeast of Santa
Catarina, has nearly disappeared since 1987, when the government
loosened restrictions on the sale of communal properties and
traffickers and their representatives began to buy the Pai-Pai's
lands. Many of San Isidoro's Pai-Pai have moved into the nearby
town of Valle de Trinidad.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, in 1996 San Isidoro still had Marcelino Murillo
Alvarez, a Pai speaker, as its community land commissioner. After
the army found marijuana plantations around the village that year,
Murillo told the authorities that he was willing to sign a document
swearing that he and other Pai-Pai were uninvolved in the drug
cultivation, Murillo's brother Federico said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Weeks later, on May 29, 1996, gunmen blocked Marcelino's car and
shot him to death along with a passenger, Federico said.
</P>
<P>
   On May 18 of this year, there was a killing near Valle de
Trinidad. Ramon Valenzuela, the president of the vigilance council
of another, smaller group of indigenous people known as the Kiliwa,
was gunned down along a farm road. A Valle de Trinidad police
official, Roberto Gonzalez, said none of the murders had been
solved.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Valle de Trinidad has turned into a valley of death,''
Federico Murillo said.
</P>
<P>
   The killings of the Indians near Trinidad have attracted renewed
attention since the drug-related massacre of 18 men, women and
children on Sept. 17 near Ensenada. Police said after that crime
that the target had been Fermin Castro, 38, a Pai-Pai from Santa
Catarina who was shot during the attack and is in a coma. He grew
wealthy in the last decade, ostensibly as the owner of a rodeo
production company. Police said Castro had headed a small
trafficking organization.
</P>
<P>
   The Ensenada killings have also caused people in Santa Catarina
to rethink their views on another spectacular killing last year. To
the horror of spectators at a rodeo in May 1997 that Castro
produced near Santa Catarina, a gunman on horseback galloped up to
Eufemio Sandoval, the Pai-Pai Indian who worked for Castro as the
rodeo announcer, shot Sandoval to death at point-blank range, rode
off to a waiting jeep and escaped into the desert.
</P>
<P>
   People here originally viewed Sandoval's killing as part of a
longtime family vendetta. But two people said they now believed
that it had been related to Castro's narcotics activities.
</P>
<P>
   Scores of Pai-Pai attended two memorial services, one last
Saturday in El Sauzal, the Ensenada suburb where the Sept. 17
massacre took place, and the other on Sunday in Santa Catarina's
cemetery. There, five of the seven dead were children aged 6 to 13.
But no one spoke.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess nobody could find the words to express their feelings
about this,'' said Cruz Lopez Ochurte, a villager.

ANALYSIS: HEDGE FUND'S FAILURE RAISES DISTURBING QUESTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ If there has been a single refrain as economic
shock waves rolled around the world for the last year, it is the
importance of spotting and addressing financial risks before they
get out of control.
</P>
<P>
   But after a year of demands by the United States that Asia
strengthen banking supervision and provide better information to
investors, and after unheeded warnings to Russia about the
demanding discipline of the markets, the precipitous fall of a
sophisticated Wall Street firm suggests that the Treasury
Department, the Federal Reserve Board and other regulators nearly
missed a potentially big problem at home.
</P>
<P>
   Right under the noses of the same people who were dispensing
advice to the rest of the world, smack in the middle of the
best-supervised, best-capitalized, most open financial markets in
the world, a single firm, Long-Term Capital Management LP, was
making bets so big that when they went wrong they threatened to
destabilize the whole system.
</P>
<P>
   And no one really knows what other problems might surface on
Wall Street and ripple through the economy as the global crisis
hits the United States with greater force.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are less vulnerable than any other nation in the world by a
huge margin,'' said Roger Altman, a former deputy Treasury
secretary. ``But we are nonetheless vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of us knows for sure whether there is another problem in
this volatile environment which could rear its ugly head soon, and
it might not be a hedge fund but something else,'' Altman said.
``Long-Term Capital Management happened to be a hedge fund. But the
real point was that its failure was judged to be unacceptable, and
that there's so much complexity and leverage in the global
financial system that events like this can occur.''
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the House Banking Committee, Rep. James Leach,
R-Iowa, said Friday that he would hold hearings in the next week or
two to explore the economic and regulatory issues raised by
Long-Term Capital Management's troubles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Questions exist as to whether appropriate national and
international supervision exists and whether funds designed to
hedge risk for individual participants create risk to the system as
a whole,'' Leach said.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the regulatory system worked just as it should.
The Federal Reserve Bank of New York, in its role as monitor of the
financial markets, caught signals several weeks ago that Long-Term
Capital was in trouble. This week it brought together a group of
Wall Street powerhouses to assemble a rescue package that averted a
marketwide problem without calling on taxpayer money.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is how the situation should have played out, given our
current regime,'' said Bert Ely, a consultant to the
financial-services industry. ``However, and this is where the
average citizen should be concerned, it raises public policy
questions about how this got out of control the way it did.''
</P>
<P>
   To some extent, the answer lies in the nature of the financial
instruments being traded by Long-Term Capital Management and other
investment firms and banks. Not only are derivatives so complex
that they are truly understood by only a relative handful of
people, but the trading strategies employed by Long-Term Capital
and other firms are closely guarded secrets.
</P>
<P>
   The hedge-fund industry operates largely outside the scope of
traditional bank and securities regulators, and relies on money
borrowed from a variety of sources, including commercial banks,
which to some degree are gambling with federally insured deposits.
</P>
<P>
   George Soros, perhaps the best-known hedge-fund operator,
described the industry in congressional testimony this month as ``a
daisy chain with many intermediaries, and each intermediary has an
obligation to his counterparts without knowing who else is
involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Soros' appearance before the House Banking Committee on Sept. 15
came more than a week before Long-Term Capital Management's
problems became public. But his firm was almost certainly aware of
the developing difficulties at Long-Term Capital _ it was
approached earlier this month about providing financial help _ and
his description on Capitol Hill of the problems brewing in the
market proved prescient.
</P>
<P>
   After Russia's debt default rocked stock and bond markets around
the world last month, ``many hedge funds and other speculative
accounts sustained large enough losses that they had to be
liquidated,'' Soros said. ``Normal spreads were disrupted, and
professionals who arbitrage between various derivatives, that is to
say, trade one derivative against another, also sustained large
losses.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Soros said, banks were ``frantically trying to
limit their exposure, de-leverage and reduce risk,'' setting off a
global credit crunch that was hurting developing nations and
beginning to squeeze the United States.
</P>
<P>
   With hindsight, the brewing problems at Long-Term Capital were
no doubt a factor in the increasingly explicit hints from Alan
Greenspan, the Federal Reserve Board chairman, and William
McDonough, the president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, that
the central bank might soon reduce interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan specifically mentioned during congressional testimony
on Wednesday that increasing disruptions to the financial system
were one reason that an easier monetary policy might soon be
justified.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, having focused for the last year on the lessons of
Asia's problems, policy-makers in the United States are well aware
of how the bursting of Japan's financial bubble in the early 1990s
and the subsequent credit squeeze have left the world's
second-largest economy moribund.
</P>
<P>
   For the last two years, Greenspan has been making the case that
the Fed has to be concerned with big swings in asset prices as well
as product prices as it sets interest-rate policy, an approach that
seems increasingly justified with each new tremor that hits Wall
Street.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Greenspan has always been reluctant to impose more
heavy-handed regulation on derivatives, arguing that banks and
other financial institutions are better positioned than auditors or
regulators to determine the worth and risk of the securities they
hold and finance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hedge funds are very strongly regulated by those who lend the
money,'' Greenspan told Congress earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   But Greenspan and Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin have been
warning for months about the perils of lenders becoming too
sanguine about risk. And in the case of Long-Term Capital, it
quickly became clear that some of the world's biggest and most
sophisticated banks and investment houses had little if any idea
what bets were being made with the money they lent.
</P>
<P>
   And it raised anew the question of whether the regulatory
approach to hedge funds is adequate today.
</P>
<P>
   Many hedge funds operate under an exemption in the Investment
Company Act of 1940. The exemption was intended to allow family
businesses that invest in securities to avoid federal regulation.
The exemption covered pools of money having fewer than 100
investors, which did not offer shares to the general public.
</P>
<P>
   Funds can also be incorporated offshore and not allow Americans
to invest, thus escaping the jurisdiction of the federal
government. Or hedge funds can operate under the terms of a 1996
amendment to the federal securities laws that exempts from
regulation those funds that limit themselves to fewer than 500
``sophisticated'' institutions or individuals, defined as those
that invest more than $25 million or $5 million, respectively.

COMBATIVE CLINTON STRIKES BACK AT REPUBLICANS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Congress may hold his fate in its hands, but President
Clinton struck back Friday, accusing Republicans of putting
politics over people in this election year.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's combative stance may reflect new polls that show a
public increasingly upset with Republicans for prolonging the
debate over punishment for the president. Clinton maintains he
committed no impeachable offenses despite misleading Americans
about an affair with a former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton went on the offensive in Washington where he signed a
stop-gap spending bill that will keep government operating when the
new fiscal year begins Thursday. The measure will keep government
operating through Oct. 9.
</P>
<P>
   ``The legislation is a regrettable sign that the Republican
majority in Congress has failed to address the urgent priorities of
the American people,'' Clinton said. He noted that the
Republican-led Congress has passed only one of the 13
appropriations.
</P>
<P>
   ``By failing to meet its most basic governing responsibility the
Republican majority in Congress has its priorities wrong;
partisanship over progress, politics over people,'' Clinton said.
``Moreover, on key national goals: improving education, providing
affordable child care, expanding health coverage, protecting our
environment, stabilizing the international economy, the House of
Representatives, in fact, is moving in the wrong direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton continued the theme here as he began a three-day trek to
Illinois, California and Texas where he will raise nearly $4
million for Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., called Clinton's
criticism a ``gratuitous slap'' at Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing our work. Maybe he just hasn't noticed. He's
distracted. What he's trying to do is distract attention from his
problems,'' Lott said, referring to the pending impeachment
inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   A New York Times poll found Clinton's approval rating rebounding
to 67 percent in the wake of the Republican decision to release the
videotape of his testimony before independent counsel Kenneth
Starr's grand jury. The poll found 78 percent surveyed said the
videotape should not have been released and 65 percent responded
that Republicans were unfairly trying to weaken Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The poll suggested a possible backlash against Republicans for
being overly partisan.
</P>
<P>
   The president visited Jenner Elementary School in Chicago's
toughest neighborhood to highlight his education agenda. The
school, located in the heart of the Cabrini-Green housing projects,
has turned around its test scores with help from volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   The school's tutoring program is part of a volunteer effort
called Working In The Schools (WITS), which encourages corporations
to allow employees time to help children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know a lot of you have it pretty tough,'' Clinton told the
children who walk to school through gang-controlled streets with
the help of volunteers. ``I know that life's not so easy for you
when you're out of school. I know that you've seen a lot of things
in your life already that children should never see. But I want you
to know something else. You can do what you want to do with your
lives. You can be happy. You can be fulfilled. You can succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, standing in a stifling hot gymnasium, told the handful
of students and adults allowed into the room that his education
plan would give them the tools they need.
</P>
<P>
   ``This should not be a partisan issue. But the fact is that the
majority of the Congress is in the hands of the other party. And
earlier this year, I gave them an education plan that for both
partisan and ideological reasons they refused to act on, and we
know it could dramatically improve our schools,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also attended a $250,000 fund-raising luncheon for Rep.
Glenn Poshard who is the Democratic candidate for governor.
Poshard, however, remained in Washington where Congress was to vote
on free-trade authority and begin work on the Republican tax cut
measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally, after almost nine months now, eight months, of
virtual complete inaction, some votes are being cast in Congress,''
Clinton said. He said Republicans are counting on few people
turning out for the elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``The enemy of the forces of progress in this election is not
adversity. Adversity is our friend. Our enemy is complacency,''
Clinton told Poshard's supporters.
</P>
<P>
   The president also flew to San Jose, Calif., where he was
expected to raise $600,000 for the Democratic National Committee.
While there, the president was to reunite with first lady Hillary
Rodham Clinton and spend a few hours with daughter Chelsea who is
attending Stanford University in nearby Palo Alto.

COCA COLA CO. HIT HARD BY GLOBAL UPHEAVAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Painting a bleaker picture than many analysts had
foreseen, Coca-Cola Co. revealed Friday that its short-term
business results had been severely battered by global economic
upheaval.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement following an early-morning meeting with Wall
Street analysts in New York, the company warned that earnings would
be flat in the third quarter, compared with the same period last
year, and would fall in the fourth quarter compared with last year.
About two-thirds of Coke's earnings come from markets outside the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Coke said its worldwide case-sales volume would grow only 3 to 4
percent in the third quarter, which ends next Wednesday, compared
with annual forecasts of 7 to 8 percent. Many analysts had thought
volume would come in around 5 to 6 percent. Last year, sales grew
11 percent in the same period.
</P>
<P>
   ``While management is moving to adjust their business plans in
some of the more chaotic markets, the impact will be severe in the
third quarter and even more so in the fourth quarter,'' said
Michael Branca, a beverage analyst for Lehman Brothers, who called
Coke's presentation Friday ``somber but realistic.'' Following the
meeting, Branca said he lowered his earnings forecast for this year
from $1.53 per share to $1.46, and ratcheted 1999 lower as well.
</P>
<P>
   Coke stock fell more than $3 a share as the stock market opened,
but partly recovered to close at $56.25, down 43.75 cents. The
stock has fallen 36 percent since July 15, when it closed at
$88.9375.
</P>
<P>
   Pepsico, Coke's main rival, issued its own third-quarter volume
results Friday as well. The company normally does not release those
numbers ahead of its earnings results, which are not due for
several weeks. In Pepsi's case, global beverage volume rose 5 to 6
percent for the third quarter, though most of that reflects sales
in the United States, since Pepsi's presence abroad is much smaller
than Coke's.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had the data, so we thought it would be useful to put it
out,'' said Richard Detwiler Jr., a Pepsico spokesman. At the same
time, Pepsico also announced appointments for its bottling
business, which many in the soft-drink business expect to be spun
off as a publicly traded company before long.
</P>
<P>
   Coke's news seemed to surprise many analysts, not in its general
outlook but in the depth of the damage done in a relatively short
time. But most analysts said the company's long-range fundamentals,
which were emphasized in the meeting by M. Douglas Ivester, Coke's
chairman and chief executive, and James Chestnut, the company's
chief financial officer, remain impressive.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt that the near term is worse than we
thought,'' said Jennifer Solomon, a beverage analyst with Salomon
Smith Barney. ``And there's no doubt that it took them a little bit
by surprise.'' She said Ivester seemed ``taken aback by the degree
of weakness in the global economy,'' but added: ``I would hardly
call him alarmed or worried.''
</P>
<P>
   No guidance was given as to 1999 earnings, Ms. Solomon said.
``They said they expect to get their volumes within 7 to 8
percent,'' she said. ``But earnings are going to be tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Branca said the company indicated it would take unspecified
steps to manage the economic difficulties. ``Coke's information
systems enable them to assess their business every two to four
weeks,'' Branca said, ``which enables them to make adjustments but
does not give them immunity from severe economic problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Such steps could include cutting prices in some markets and
increasing marketing expenses in others.
</P>
<P>
   Another analyst, Bill Pecoriello of Sanford Bernstein, said he
left the meeting feeling ``still very confident in the long-term
fundamentals, and knowing Coke will emerge stronger when these
global economies turn around.'' Still, he said, ``I remain cautious
for the short run due to continued uncertainties.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the trouble spots for Coke is Japan, which is suffering
one of its worst economic declines and accounts for 17 percent of
Coke's profits. ``Management is hopeful that government actions,
such as a reduced consumption tax and more upbeat political p.r.,
could meaningfully improve that business,'' Branca said. Another
worry is Germany, which accounts for 8 to 9 percent of profits.
Sales in Coke's Greater Europe group are expected to increase just
1 percent to 2 percent in the third quarter, the company said,
while the forecast for the Middle and Far East Group is 2 to 3
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The near-term numbers are weaker than I thought, both in
volume and earnings,'' said Marc Cohen, a beverage analyst for
Goldman Sachs. ``That being said, I was somewhat encouraged by the
enthusiasm they showed for being able to grow 7 to 8 percent from
their 1998 levels.'' The company's discussion of the possibility
that it would accelerate its stock repurchasing program was also
encouraging, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The changes announced at Pepsi make Craig Weatherup, now global
chairman and chief executive of Pepsi-Cola, the leader of the
bottling company, to be called Pepsi Bottling Group. It will be
made up of all of the bottling operations Pepsi owns, which handle
58 percent of the company's domestic volume.
</P>
<P>
   Weatherup, 53, will be chairman and chief executive of Pepsi
Bottling. Craig Jung, 45, president of Pepsi's bottling operations
since last year, will become chief operating officer of Pepsi
Bottling. In addition, John Cahill, 41, was named executive vice
president and chief financial officer of the new bottling company.
</P>
<P>
   Pepsi shares, which have been trading in the $29-31 range for
most of the month, fell 56.25 cents to $30.4375.

 By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Few Russians harvested the spoils of Russia's troubled
encounter with capitalism as feverishly as Vladimir Potanin, a
young Soviet-era bureaucrat who in a few short years had parlayed
his Kremlin ties into a sprawling business empire.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as last year, Potanin was a high-ranking member of
Boris Yeltsin's government. At the same time, he controlled a
cluster of important Russian financial and industrial companies
that employed about 400,000 people, had won the support of Western
investors like George Soros, and was a member of a voracious clique
of Russian businessmen known as the oligarchs.
</P>
<P>
   Deftly exploiting lucrative opportunities that came with
privatization, the oligarchs gained easy access to government
officials, used dubious tactics to snare control of huge industrial
concerns and are widely suspected of siphoning cash from the
companies they acquired.
</P>
<P>
   Many here are saying that the oligarchs' glory days are over.
``There are no oligarchs anymore because they're all bankrupt,''
said Vyacheslav Nikonov, president of the Polity Foundation, a
Moscow research group. ``The government, if it wanted, could always
have destroyed the oligarchs in a minute. But no one wanted to
destroy the banking system.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the breathtaking collapse of the Russian economy, and
the failure of Russia's leadership to deliver on the promises of
free market reform, have severely battered the oligarchs'
businesses. Russia's new prime minister, Yevgeny Primakov, is
likely to be less amenable to their interests.
</P>
<P>
   Still, these are crafty men who negotiated the transition from
Communism to Russia's brand of capitalism with aplomb, and no one
should underestimate their survival skills as circumstances evolve.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is going to change, and the role of the oligarchs
will be less,'' acknowledged Potanin, 37. But he considers himself
above the sordid dealings of the fin de siecle tycoons. ``When the
oligarchs lose their influence, they will lose their negative
influence. But I will not lose my positive influence.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Potanin, though besieged, continues to command
international attention. He flustered financial markets last week
when he warned that Russia would sooner default on its debt than
risk disrupting ``social peace.'' A senior official of the
International Monetary Fund called the statement a form of
``blackmail.''
</P>
<P>
   Among themselves, the oligarchs have engaged in increasingly
vitriolic spats lately, and some of them scoff at Potanin's attempt
to occupy the moral high ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unlike some of my competitors, I don't try to hide what I
have,'' said Alexander Smolensky, the elusive chairman of SBS-Agro,
a large and insolvent savings bank. ``Those who were doing real
banking in Russia will survive. Those who were speculating and
grabbing state property won't.''
</P>
<P>
   But while banks were the foundation of many fortunes in Russia
in the 1990s, they engaged in relatively little ``real banking.''
Instead of playing the textbook role of taking deposits and lending
money to fuel growth, Russian banks, including Uneximbank, became
sprawling, industrial Goliaths gorging themselves on wagers made in
overheated financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   And although they might suffer one another's barbs, the
oligarchs are part of a thuggish, often violent business world that
brooks little opposition. A St. Petersburg journalist investigating
Russian banks was beaten to death last month, and the mayor of a
Siberian town was murdered earlier this year after pressing local
oil companies to pay delinquent taxes and salaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The simple truth is that there was too much corruption in
Russia, and the reforms didn't go far enough,'' said Anders Aslund,
an analyst with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.
``All of this will go down in flames, and the only question is what
will be built afterwards.''
</P>
<P>
   Potanin's career epitomizes an era in which the hopes of Western
investors and governments came to repose in a handful of power
brokers. These big players reaped vast fortunes through
free-wheeling practices in which conflict of interest was endemic
and regulatory scrutiny virtually nonexistent.
</P>
<P>
   Married, with one child, Potanin was born in Moscow into a
privileged family. His father, Oleg, was a high-ranking official in
the Foreign Trade Ministry and guided his son's career. With his
father's sponsorship, Potanin gained entrance to the elite
Institute of International Relations and then joined the ministry
himself. Fluent in French and conversant in English, Potanin was
given a post trading raw materials for the government.
</P>
<P>
   The oligarchs depended on high-ranking Communist Party officials
or former state organizations for their initial funding and
business deals; Potanin was no exception. When he left the
government in 1991 to start his own trading company, Interros, the
state's biggest raw materials exporters backed him.
</P>
<P>
   Attractive as this business was, Interros really hit the jackpot
when Potanin opened Uneximbank in 1993 with funds from the
government's foreign-trade bank. These were still the early days of
privatization, and Uneximbank was one of thousands of new private
banks set up across Russia, ostensibly to finance an economic
rebirth.
</P>
<P>
   Banks could be started by anyone with about $1.5 million in
capital and an office. Western and Russian bankers, along with law
enforcement officials, said many of the smaller and midsize banks
are now controlled by criminals and corrupt officials. The very
biggest _ those that are owned by the oligarchs _ have been used
for building empires and speculating. Few were well-managed or
cautiously operated, including Uneximbank.
</P>
<P>
   But the bank and the young tycoon who owned it grew wealthy
together _ and with blinding speed. By the end of last year, it had
$3.8 billion in assets, small by Western standards but enough to
make it the largest and most prestigious private commercial bank in
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Relatively little is known about Potanin's personal life. He is
said to own a luxurious dacha _ a country house _ outside Moscow.
He travels regularly to Paris and is also a member of Luzhki, an
exclusive country club favored by Russia's newly minted potentates.
And Uneximbank executives clearly like to spoil themselves. Western
bankers said the company's management favors France's Cote d'Azur
for occasional board meetings and other festivities.
</P>
<P>
   Such was Potanin's reputation abroad that Soros backed him last
year to buy a stake in Svyazinvest, a telecommunications holding
company with a majority stake in scores of local telephone
companies throughout Russia. Soros did not return telephone calls
seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   But like most Russian banks, Potanin's institution is now
insolvent. According to Western bankers, Uneximbank has about $700
million in derivatives liabilities that it cannot pay, a figure
Potanin and the bank declined to discuss.
</P>
<P>
   Potanin said his media holdings, including the prestigious daily
newspaper Izvestia, once the official organ of the Soviet state,
are in dire straits. His industrial companies are laying off
workers and cutting back production. He said all of his holdings,
once valued at about $10 billion, are now worth just $2 billion.
But most analysts said Interros' assets are worth only a few
hundred million dollars _ and may be worth next to nothing, given
the current state of the Russian economy.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   The headquarters of Potanin's empire, Uneximbank, resembles a
fortress as much as a financial institution. Armed guards, metal
detectors and electronic gates protect the entrance to the main
building, which is on a commercial boulevard lined with monolithic
slabs housing a series of Russia's leading banks.
</P>
<P>
   But the bank has proved to be the foundation of an empire built
on sand. Its tenuous prosperity rested on a lucrative but unstable
niche in Russian securities markets and an inside track it
navigated with a heavy hand during auctions of formerly state-owned
companies beginning in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Potanin was retained as a consultant to the government and
designed the auction process, known as loans for shares. The
auctions were overseen by Anatoly Chubais, one of his sponsors in
Yeltsin's administration and a leading reformer.
</P>
<P>
   Loans for shares was riddled with cozy deals that put
well-connected businessmen in control of key Russian industries at
fire-sale prices. Chubais' reputation was tarnished last year when
it was revealed that he and several others had accepted a sizable
book advance from a publishing company controlled by Uneximbank.
Likewise, Alfred Kokh, a Russian official who oversaw the
Svyazinvest sale, later got a $100,000 book advance from a Swiss
accounting firm set up by Uneximbank.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, the auctions gave Uneximbank control of Norilsk
Nickel, one of the world's largest nickel producers; Sidanko,
Russia's fifth-largest oil company, and a bevy of other industrial
concerns. Uneximbank was appointed by the government to run the
Norilsk auction _ and somehow won with a bid just $100,000 above
the opening price of $170 million after disqualifying a competing
bid of $350 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was bad,'' Potanin said of the auctions. ``The prices were
cheap. We can stop discussing this. It was bad. But it did solve
the problem of having more efficient owners.''
</P>
<P>
   But the oligarchs have hardly been dynamic managers. Although
Potanin said Uneximbank invested at least $400 million upgrading
Norilsk, financial analysts and others familiar with the company
said little has been done to modernize Norilsk or any other of
Potanin's holdings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The oligarchs were qualified to run banks only because of
their familiarity with the corridors of power,'' said Andrei
Piontkovsky, director of the Center for Strategic Studies in
Moscow. ``Uneximbank never had any interest in improving
manufacturing at any of its companies. It just wanted to channel
money through the bank.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, because of limited financial disclosures and virtually
nonexistent regulatory oversight, it is impossible to know the
terms of any loans the oligarchs' banks made to industrial
companies they controlled. And once loans were disbursed to captive
borrowers, it would have been easy for the money to find its way
back into bankers' pockets. Such scenarios were common during the
U.S. savings-and-loan scandals in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been OK if these loans were made on an
arms-length basis. But they weren't,'' said a financial analyst who
has seen confidential audits of Russian bank loans but requested
anonymity. ``When some banks made loans they didn't specify
interest rates or even when the loans had to be paid back.''
</P>
<P>
   Potanin said Uneximbank has rigorous lending standards, and only
made loans approved by its credit committee. But he declined to
provide information on how much of Uneximbank's lending was steered
toward companies it owned.
</P>
<P>
   Russian banks enlisted the aid of Western accountants, who
helped give at least of a veneer of respectability to the banks'
operations. For example, in March, Deloitte &AMP; Touche gave a highly
conditional thumbs-up to Uneximbank's accounts, warning that they
did not fully meet international accounting standards.
</P>
<P>
   After playing an integral role in Yeltsin's 1996 re-election
campaign, Potanin was named first deputy prime minister for
economic reform, a government post some accused him of using for
personal gain. He left that job early last year.
</P>
<P>
   Potanin said that ``during my stay in the government, Uneximbank
received nothing.'' But while serving in the Yeltsin
administration, he drafted a decree that had the effect of
forgiving huge tax debts owed by companies that included one of his
own, Norilsk.
</P>
<P>
   And in 1997, a few months after Potanin departed from the
government, the Russian Central Bank started an investigation into
accusations that hundreds of millions of dollars of government
money had been diverted to Uneximbank and another private bank.
Shots were fired at the home of the Central Bank chairman shortly
after the investigation began.
</P>
<P>
   Andrei Vavilov, a former deputy finance minister who became
president of an Uneximbank affiliate, MFK Renaissance, after
leaving the government, was accused of being behind the diversion.
The investigation is continuing. Vavilov could not be reached for
comment. Potanin declined to comment specifically on matters
involving Vavilov, but said the charges were baseless.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Like other banks, Uneximbank also minted riches, albeit briefly,
during the speculative fever that infected the Russian securities
market last year. To fill yawning budget gaps, the Russian
government had been issuing short-term treasury bills, known as
GKOs, paying sky-high interest rates to keep investors intrigued.
Banks were required to hold a certain amount of GKOs in their
coffers, but analysts said many _ including Uneximbank _ held far
more than was healthy, because they were captivated by the hefty
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   When it became apparent that the GKO shell game had come to an
end, the government _ realizing it could no longer service its debt
and being pressured by banks to protect their interests _ announced
a catastrophic devaluation and debt moratorium. The economic
collapse that ensued has left Potanin's empire in tatters.
</P>
<P>
   But it could have been worse for the oligarchs had they not
boldly exercised their remaining power over Yeltsin. Although the
Russian government told the world on Monday, Aug. 17, that it
planned to devalue the ruble and restructure its debt, prompting
swan dives by markets around the globe, the oligarchs had been
informed of the Kremlin's intentions the previous Friday night,
according to people familiar with the events.
</P>
<P>
   By Saturday, Aug. 15, Potanin and others were huddled with
leading government officials in Moscow's White House. They
complained that the devaluation and restructuring would ruin them
unless it included a 90-day moratorium allowing them to forgo
repaying foreign debts. The next day, the government acquiesced to
the oligarchs' demands. When the devaluation was unveiled on Aug.
17, a moratorium was part of the package, infuriating foreign
investors and accelerating their flight.
</P>
<P>
   Potanin has warned that he will be unable to pay his foreign
debts unless his lenders renegotiate. Meanwhile Moody's Investors
Service, which has repeatedly downgraded the debt of Russian banks,
lowered the ratings of Uneximbank and others again last week.
</P>
<P>
   And creditors are crying foul, contending that the oligarchs are
hiding loot in offshore accounts. On Thursday, Lehman Brothers
froze about $113 million in the British accounts of Uneximbank and
another Russian bank in an attempt to collect debts. Credit Suisse
First Boston, which is facing large losses from its own overzealous
speculation in Russia, estimated that Russian companies spirited
about $66 billion out of the country from 1994 to last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what the global investment community is seeing is the
irresponsibility of the Russian government in effectively allowing
the confiscation of assets by borrowers under the moratorium,''
said Michael Eggleton, a managing director with Credit Suisse.
``This will be the benchmark for future investment in Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   Uneximbank has a subsidiary based in Cyprus, a popular haven for
offshore investors and money launderers, and the bank has used that
subsidiary to make acquisitions, including the purchase of
Svyazinvest, the telecommunications company. Potanin said that less
than 1 percent of his company's cash is in Cyprus and that nearly
all of his assets remain in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, Potanin may not need to go to Cyprus to shelter
his remaining assets. Earlier this year, he established Interros
Group as a holding company with Uneximbank and other parts of his
dwindling empire as its subsidiaries. He is planning to merge
Uneximbank with two other large but insolvent banks, Menatep and
MOST-Bank, possibly alongside the rapidly deteriorating MFK
Renaissance investment bank, into a new bank named Rosbank.
</P>
<P>
   Potanin said a holding company gives him a ``better business
structure'' that will allow him to ``coordinate investments.'' But
a holding company will also allow him to move assets, like cash,
into some subsidiaries, while leaving liabilities, like large
debts, in other subsidiaries that he can then abandon.
</P>
<P>
   But Potanin said he has no intention of using Interros in such a
fashion. ``I will do everything to make it happen in a civilized
way,'' he said, ``and to assure that investors are happy.''

WHY PINK? WHY NOW? IT'S SIMPLE. SORT OF. 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., Sept. 27) 
(JT) 
 By FRANK DeCARO    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The best clothes on the runway that Friday morning
were pale yellow _ a muted marigold _ and shadowy gray. But the
line of fashionistas waiting at the Chelsea Piers taxi stand after
Mark Eisen's show told another color story entirely.
</P>
<P>
   A woman more Camryn Manheim than Cameron Diaz fidgeted near the
curb in a hot-pink sweater set and a long black skirt. Farther down
the line, a pixieish scribe in a black pants suit and a hot-pink
ribbed shirt interviewed a pregnant woman in front of her. Behind
them, a cell-phone abuser in a black sleeveless shell and gray
pants had tied the sleeves of a hot-pink sweater around her neck,
although not tightly enough to stop her from shouting.
</P>
<P>
   And then there was that Mirabella senior market editor who, in
search of her driver, whooshed by wearing a hot-pink cashmere
sweater and matching hot-pink suede Chanel ballet flats. ``Pink is
it, definitely,'' she said, a bubble-gum-colored blur traversing
the blacktop.
</P>
<P>
   Who could argue with someone in those shoes?
</P>
<P>
   In a season when fashion is married to charcoal, some women are
quietly having a hot-pink love affair. Julia Louis-Dreyfus was the
darling of the paparazzi outside the Emmy Awards in a
cleavage-baring pink Bob Mackie dress. But away from the cameras,
smaller doses of pink are being happily consumed. Last week,
shoppers lovingly eyed the pink-sweater-clad mannequins in the
windows of the Express store on lower Fifth Avenue, for instance.
If gray is the new black, as the magazines say, pink is the new
orange. It is the accent color du jour.
</P>
<P>
   The imprimatur of Helmut Lang, who seems these days to be the
font from which all fashion currents come, hasn't hurt the trend.
The supremely influential designer _ whose defection from the
Seventh on Sixth show calendar spurred Donna Karan, Calvin Klein
and several others to present their collections for spring 1999 two
months early _ featured hot-pink silk organza over white
printed-cotton underpinnings in his show on Sept. 17. The next day,
the fashion followers had popped for pink.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call it strong pink,'' a spokeswoman for Lang said.
</P>
<P>
   Lang does a strong _ and strongly influential _ color every
season. His color choices are often regarded as gospel by the
fashion faithful, even if they don't always buy from him. ``I left
Helmut Lang's show and went right to Club Monaco,'' a Dallas
fashion editor said at Eisen's show. ``A $19 hot-pink tank top
under a black pants suit. That's all you need.''
</P>
<P>
   To be in the vanguard of fashion, that's often true. But it has
to be the right pink piece worn in the right way. These days that
means a sporty accent to more minimalist attire. A hot-pink suit
with shoulder pads and an above-the-knee skirt is still a big
glamour don't.
</P>
<P>
   But why a push for pink? It's simple. Sort of.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed a pink moment,'' said Margaret Walch, the director
of the Color Association of the United States, a trend-forecasting
group in New York. Sounding a bit like the late Kay Thompson's
character in ``Funny Face,'' Ms. Walch said women want to think
pink because ``things are a little grim and uncertain at the
moment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Pink came on strong just when we needed it,'' she added. ``We
may need pink for several years, it would appear.''
</P>
<P>
   Dodging any political implications, Ms. Walch explained that
``color trends are truly about a time and a place and feeling
comfortable in a particular color.'' Gray seems ``terribly
relevant'' at the moment, she said. ``I'm even wearing it in
underwear.''
</P>
<P>
   The charm of charcoal may in fact have spurred the interest in
pink, she said. Women today like wearing pink as an accent because
they perceive it as a ``feminized'' color, but not a weak one.
``This is not '50s wimpy pink we're seeing,'' she said. ``These are
vital pinks. These are complicated pinks,'' unlike '80s pinks,
which were obvious. In those days, pink offset New Wave black and
white. Today, it makes the sea of gray in this fall's fashion
magazines seem more appealing, and slightly more upbeat.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Walch predicts that various shades of pink will be with us
for a while at least. The color is forecast through spring 2000 in
men's, women's and children's wear and for home interiors, she
said. Hot pink, she expects, will give way to fuchsia and then
violet in the next year and a half. The Bonnard show, currently at
the Museum of Modern Art, makes ``a great case for purples and
yellows,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   But yellow, which was the featured color at CK Calvin Klein for
spring 1999, ``won't do for women what fuchsia can do,'' Ms. Walch
cautioned. That's because pink is an easier color to wear. Like
those women outside Mark Eisen's show two weeks ago, Ms. Walch
herself recently bowed to the latest color trend. ``I just bought a
hot-pink J. Crew T-shirt to wear with my favorite black pinstripe
suit,'' she said, adding a bit sheepishly, ``Even those of us who
should know better are not outside its influence.''

A CRUCIAL WEEK FOR A FRAYED GLOBAL SAFETY NET

<TEXT>
<P>
   For the world's central bankers and finance ministers, this is
the week to put up or shut up.
</P>
<P>
   If they do what many analysts now expect, they could provide a
much-needed breather for investors in a global economic crisis that
began with the devaluation of the Thai currency 15 months ago, has
engulfed Russia, is battering Latin America and threatening the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   But if they disappoint, watch out.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Reserve policy makers meet on Tuesday, and Alan
Greenspan, the Fed chairman, has indicated _ but not guaranteed _
that a rate cut is in the offing. ``We have to bring the existing
instabilities to a level of stability reasonably shortly, to
prevent the contagion from really spilling over and creating some
very significant further difficulties for all of us,'' he told
Congress last week.
</P>
<P>
   While not a silver bullet, a quarter- or half-point cut in the
Fed's short-term interest rate target could ease fears in emerging
markets, lessening capital flight. It would also minimize the
chances that the American economy would aggravate the crisis by
slipping into its own recession.
</P>
<P>
   Taking no action would be a jolt, sending stocks here and around
the world lower.
</P>
<P>
   The election for German chancellor is set for Sunday; Brazilians
will select a president a week later. With the elections over, a
new German leader (Gerhard Schroder) or the current one (Helmut
Kohl) can pay more attention to global problems, a necessity if
there is any chance for a global rate cut.
</P>
<P>
   President Fernando Henrique Cardoso of Brazil, if he wins a new
term, as expected, will have to make good on promises of deficit
cuts and Social Security changes. Otherwise, it will be hard to
lure back investors.
</P>
<P>
   Then the world's financial leaders will be gathering in
Washington at the end of the week, for the semiannual meeting of
the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. The Group of
Seven leading industrialized countries and the IMF will be expected
to do more to calm the waters. On top of the list is some kind of
standby bailout package for key Latin American countries like
Brazil. If no such deal is done soon, investors should worry about
a steeper Latin American downside.
</P>
<P>
   Even though many stock markets have settled into a volatile but
contained trading range over the last two weeks, the Fed and the
world's leaders still have plenty to worry about, especially in
Latin America. Mexico, Brazil and Argentina are where global policy
makers will have to make their last stand against a virulent
financial crisis that, if left unchecked, could send the whole
world into a recession.
</P>
<P>
   Jose M. Barrionuevo, director of global market strategy at
Lehman Brothers, has a risk barometer based on a country's level of
dollar currency reserves. This level is compared with what would be
needed, hypothetically, as a full defense against capital flight,
without resorting to unsustainably high interest rates to defend
the currency.
</P>
<P>
   On this basis, Brazil and Mexico are still extremely vulnerable
to a currency collapse and the economic crisis that would follow.
In Brazil, the level of actual reserves is $47.5 billion and the
defense level is $200.8 billion. In Mexico, reserves are $30.3
billion and the defense level is $100.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the absence of additional external and domestic measures,
these countries are likely to experience serious foreign exchange
devaluation pressures,'' Barrionuevo said.
</P>
<P>
   Argentina, which pegged its currency, the peso, to the dollar,
is less vulnerable by this measure, with a reserve level of $25
billion and a defense level of $33.6 billion. But Barrionuevo is
still concerned because Argentina's economic health is so
dependent, through trade, on Brazil. The Czech Republic is also
under threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The support from the Group of Seven and the IMF has to be
materializing soon,'' Barrionuevo said. The Fed must ease, he
added, because Latin America needs to see that the United States is
not slowing too much, closing a key export market.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world,'' he warned, ``is walking a very fine line.''
</P>
<P>
   Look how quickly the Greenspan-inspired, rate-cut euphoria
evaporated on Wednesday. Just hours after the Dow finished the day
257 points higher, a more than $3.5 billion rescue was announced
for one of the biggest casualties yet of the financial crisis:
Long-Term Capital Management, the hedge fund founded by John W.
Meriwether.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow fell 152 points on Thursday, and for a day Meriwether's
mistakes outweighed Greenspan's promises. That could make the
chairman's search for stability tougher.

TIMES POLL: YOUNG WOMEN MORE TOLERANT TOWARD LEWINSKY THAN THEIR
MOTHERS 
</HEADLINE>

 By CAREY GOLDBERG    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Some young women say: Let she who is free of all
Monica-style sin cast the first stone. Others say: Blame the
powerful man who cheats, not the weak woman who helps him. Still
others say: She was wrong. But Lord, the punishment of having every
desperate, pathetic, lovelorn detail bared to the entire country!
</P>
<P>
   For a variety of reasons that seem to reflect a variety of Ally
McBeal-generation attitudes and realities, young American women
hold somewhat more tolerant opinions of Monica Lewinsky than their
mothers and grandmothers, according to a national New York Times
poll, follow-up calls to respondents and several separate
interviews.
</P>
<P>
   The Times survey, carried out from Sept. 12 to 14, found that
among women under 30, only slightly more than half said they viewed
Ms. Lewinsky unfavorably, compared with nearly three-quarters of
women over 65. Among the women in between those age groups, it
found the level of disapproval rising steadily with increasing age.
</P>
<P>
   Still, only 11 percent of the young women said they viewed Ms.
Lewinsky favorably, while 28 percent said they were undecided. And
many said they simply could not relate to or identify with her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ally McBeal,'' the much-talked-about Fox Television show, may
depict young American women in the workplace as confused huntresses
who wear mini-skirts to the courtroom, but ``real life is nothing
like Ally McBeal,'' said Christine Parker, a 25-year-old sales
support administrator in a Boston computer company. ``I don't know
anybody whose life is like Monica Lewinsky's,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, while they did not accept Ms. Lewinsky as any kind of
kindred spirit or generational symbol, some young women did evince
a sense of sympathy for her and an unwillingness to denounce her
unequivocally, even though they heartily disapproved of her
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like she got herself into a situation she must have
known she was getting herself into,'' said Jill Freydberg, 23, of
Chicago. ``I wouldn't say she deserved it, but she should have
known better.''
</P>
<P>
   And Karen, a 29-year-old publishing employee in Manhattan who
asked that her last name not be used, said that for young women who
grew up after the early years of the feminist movement, there seems
little ideological need to denounce Ms. Lewinsky's workplace affair
with President Clinton as bad for the image of working women.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's sort of like a throwback to how the working woman was
perceived in an earlier era,'' Karen said. ``She just doesn't exist
as part of how the modern working woman sees herself.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky, who was a 21-year-old intern in the White House
when her affair with the president began, may be a throwback in
that her relationship recalls the old maxim, ``Women have sex and
men have power and each wants the other.'' But her situation, the
uneasy coexistence of sex and work, is only too contemporary, young
women said.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Lehrman, author of ``The Lipstick Proviso: Women, Sex and
Power in the Real World'' (Doubleday, 1997), said that Ms. Lewinsky
was taught a lesson for trying to use sexual power in the
workplace, which ``is now met with much condemnation.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ms. Lehrman said, the youngest generation of women in the
workplace is also aware that despite the great movement against
sexual harassment, ``we don't lose our sexuality once we walk in
the door at 9 in the morning, and things happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Several young women interviewed agreed that though they blamed
Ms. Lewinsky for pursuing Clinton, sexuality and flirting in the
workplace remain delicate issues, with no clear lines drawn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that one of women's powers is sexuality,'' said Erika
Manuel, 26, who works for the Massachusetts Department of Mental
Retardation. ``I'm not saying that's what gets us ahead. It's part
of you as a person. You can't shut it off and become an automaton
at work.''
</P>
<P>
   Michelle Sagi, 24, who works at a Boston investment company,
said: ``There are very few roles women can take in the workplace.
They can take the role of the maternal figure, they can become a
man, or they can become this flirty thing in a way.''
</P>
<P>
   Her lunch companion, Livia Foo, 22, also an investment company
employee, disagreed. ``I think the workplace is more balanced
out,'' Ms. Foo said. ``I don't think about those things. There's
definitely a boys' club at work. There's also, like, the women's
club. I think things are starting to get better.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Ms. Lewinsky's putting pressure on the President to help
her get a job, that, too, could be understandable, said Persis, a
23-year-old receptionist in Schauburg, Ill., who also asked that
her last name not be used. Persis said Ms. Lewinsky seemed to be
saying: `` `You want me to disappear? Give me something. I'm not
going to disappear without something.' It seems like a legitimate
angle.''
</P>
<P>
   Persis also said, ``When somebody is married, it's not the fault
of the person they're cheating with, its the person who's
married.'' Referring to Ms. Lewinsky, Persis said: ``It is her
fault in that she knew he was married, but she's not the one who
vowed. You hold her accountable, but she's young and she's getting
a raw deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Young women's more tolerant attitudes fit in to a general
slowness among their generation to judge personal-life behavior,
said Ellen Fitzpatrick, a historian focusing on modern American and
women's history at the University of New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have been people who have experienced the highest divorce
rate _ or one of them _ in American history and a lot of
instability in family life,'' she said. ``A lot of them have come
to understand very well their parents' clay feet at a fairly young
age. So I think they probably find it less shocking than maybe some
older folks do.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ms. Fitzpatrick also noted that older women would have been
taught to condemn ``the kind of sexual aggression that seems to be
part of what we have heard about the story,'' referring to the
Clinton-Lewinsky relationship. But several young women interviewed
did not sound at all surprised that Ms. Lewinsky had flirted so
avidly with the president, and one even commended her
``get-up-and-go.''
</P>
<P>
   If young women's attitudes sound a bit confusing and
contradictory, that is because they are, even to themselves, Ms.
Lehrman said. ``I can think of highly embarrassing moments when I
put my sexuality on the line and was kicked in the face one way or
another,'' she said. ``So I would think this reflects a complicated
view that they don't want to pity her but they definitely feel
empathy toward her.''
</P>
<P>
   Among all the young women interviewed, Erin Riley, a 28-year-old
law student at the University of Michigan, offered the most
Realpolitik- based explanation of why her generation is less
willing to condemn Ms. Lewinsky than older women.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe they understand more,'' Ms. Riley said. ``Or maybe
they're attracted to older men, whereas for older women it would be
their husbands who are having the affairs.''

ASU COACH-SALARY (Flagstaff, Ariz.) - Forget the 1-2 record, the
great expectations for this year's Arizona State University
football team. Head coach Bruce Snyder, already the highest paid
state employee in Arizona, got another raise Friday, pushing his
salary to a minimum of $595,000 with incentives that could make him
as much as $80,000 more. It's tempting to say that football coaches
are paid like CEOs, but the CEO of Arizona State, President Lattie
Coor, makes only about half as much as Snyder. By MARTIN VAN DER
WERF. Story will move in the ``A`` and ``S`` categories. &QL;

FANTASY-FOOTBALL (Undated) - Though I somehow missed the press
release, the NFL apparently decided to honor the past Sunday with
their first unofficial oldtimer's day. Playing for the Jets, Vinny
Testaverde used his long years of experience to toss four touchdown
passes. Randall Cunningham helped the Vikings beat the Lions with
five (yawn) field goals, and in Denver, they dusted off Bubby

GERMANY (Bonn) - His lead has been dwindling over the past few
weeks, but Gerhard Schroeder is expected to be elected the new
chancellor of Germany, at the end of his heavily `Americanized''
campaign. Proclaiming that he wants to build ``a new center'' that
wipes out old ideological lines of left and right, Schroeder has
packaged himself ala Bill Clinton as a dynamic, youthful leader for
a flagging country that has been ruled by the same man since 1982.

<P>
   PINK-FASHION (New York) _ In a season when fashion is married to
charcoal, some women are quietly having a hot-pink love affair.
Julia Louis-Dreyfus was the darling of the paparazzi outside the
Emmy Awards in a cleavage-baring pink Bob Mackie dress. If gray is
the new black, as the magazines say, pink is the new orange. It is
the accent color du jour. By Frank DeCaro. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   ARM-CANDY (New York) _ Not long ago, a well-known publisher in
his 50s called a single woman he knew slightly and asked her to a
benefit dinner for several hundred at the Plaza. It was not a date;
the man had a serious girlfriend. He needed something else. ``Would
you be my arm candy tomorrow night?'' he asked. (italics)Arm
candy.(end italics) The phrase is bracing in its candor, implying a
beautiful object to attach to your arm, for others to feast their
eyes upon. In the image-obsessed 1990s, when a dominant mood is the
desire to inspire fits of envy in one's friends, a woman (and
sometimes a man) in the role of arm candy expresses the
quintessential modern relationship. By Alex Kuczynski.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   REMNICK-NEW-YORKER (New York) _ David Remnick, once a rumpled
writer for The New Yorker, appeared on ``The Charlie Rose Show'' on
Sept. 13 to discuss his appointment as editor of the magazine. Gone
were the oversize horn-rimmed glasses readers saw on the jacket of
his Pulitzer Prize-winning book, ``Lenin's Tomb,'' and Remnick
appeared to have treated himself to an $80 haircut, a stylish,
windowpane-check suit and a plump silk tie. ``He's gone downtown,''
said the Time magazine columnist Margaret Carlson, who watched the
broadcast. The key to the new Remnick sophistication? ``High-care
fibers,'' she noted. By Alex Kuczynski. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MOTH-TALES (New York) _ On many Monday nights, literary types
with book-party burnout seek refuge by listening to oral
tale-spinners at a gathering called Stories at the Moth. It's an
idea as old as the campfire: The lights dim, the crowd gathers and
people stand and tell stories. After its first successful year, the
Moth went on hiatus for the summer, but the series returns Monday
night at 9 p.m. to Lansky in Manhattan. By M.P. Dunleavey. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SWAIN-LOLITA-PROFILE (Undated) _ On her first visit to a New
York nightclub, Dominique Swain said she had more in common with
the title character in ``Pecker'' than the one for which she is
known. That is ``Lolita,'' of course. Ms. Swain seems younger than
she is, three years after making ``Lolita'' at age 15. The
much-debated film, which had trouble finding an American
distributor because of its subject matter, was first seen on
Showtime and finally opened in theaters on Friday. By David
Colman. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WILLIAMS-SLAM-PROFILE (New York) _ Saul Williams walked into the
Antique Boutique in Greenwich Village as though it were his old
neighborhood. He had the same comfortable, long-limbed stride his
poet-rapper character in ``Slam,'' this year's Sundance grand prize
winner, used while walking around the projects in Washington.
Williams doesn't look as though he spends much time figuring out
his wardrobe. But he does. He is, after all, an actor, well aware
that he has an image to project. And lately, that has been
especially important, sitting for one interview after another _
usually at his favorite hangout, the celebrity-studded Time Cafe on
Lafayette Street _ to promote ``Slam,'' which opens in New York on
Oct. 9. By Evelyn Nieves.

blue of an indigo bunting; no rose is as vividly red as a scarlet
tanager. Even drab-colored birds improve the landscape, like plants
grown as a quiet background. By Cass Peterson. &QL;

BILL WOULD EASE DRUG COSTS FOR SENIORS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS BLACK  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In two weeks, Vi Quirion, a senior citizen from
Waterville, Maine, will take a field trip to Canada with her
friends and neighbors to stock up on prescription drugs that cost
half the amount she pays in Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Quirion has arthritis and a stomach ailment. Supported by two
metal canes, she labored to the lectern of a Capitol Hill news
conference Friday to explain that many senior citizens pay more
than twice as much for prescriptions as preferred customers that
buy drugs in bulk, such as large health maintenance organizations,
hospital chains and the federal government. Under Canada's national
health insurance system, prescription prices are heavily
subsidized.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't afford to pay my prescriptions and gas and eat, too,''
Quirion said. ``We should not have to live like that.''
</P>
<P>
   A study conducted by the Democratic staff for the House
Government Reform and Oversight Committee in seven congressional
districts, including Representative Tom Allen's district in Maine,
found that older Americans and other uninsured consumers pay 106
percent more for the 10 best-selling prescription drugs than the
drug companies' preferred customers.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the study found that Tielid, a drug used by stroke
victims, costs $118.06 per prescription at retail but only $33.57
for favored customers, a 252 percent difference. Zocor, a drug used
to treat high cholesterol, costs preferred customers $42.95 and
regular retail customers $104.98, a 144 percent difference.
</P>
<P>
   The study said large corporate and institutional customers of
the drug companies were able to buy drugs at discounted prices, but
the most vulnerable consumers, the uninsured and others without
insurance coverage for prescriptions, were paying full price and
effectively subsidizing the more well-heeled consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Representative John F. Tierney, the Massachusetts Democrat, said
an analysis of prices in his district found retail prices for the
10 drugs were 110 percent higher than the price charged to
preferred customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is unfathomable and biased,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Allen led a group of Democrats in proposing legislation Friday
that would require drug companies to sell prescription drugs at the
same low price offered preferred customers to pharmacies that serve
Medicare recipients.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers charged that the major pharmaceutical companies
are making record profits at the expense of senior citizens.
Pharmaceutical companies maintain they need to charge full price
for prescription drugs to subsidize research and development of new
life-saving drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are determined to assure that no older American will ever
again have to choose between buying food and taking the drugs
needed to maintain their health,'' said Allen, a first-term
Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation faces an up-hill battle and is not likely to be
considered until next year because Congress is scheduled to adjourn
in two weeks. No Republicans support the bill, and the drug
companies are expected to be strongly opposed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The well-meaning efforts of the bill's sponsors unfortunately
are likely to backfire on America's seniors,'' said Alan F. Holmer,
president of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of
America, a trade association. ``In a very real sense, this bill is
a dagger pointed at the hearts of America's senior citizens. If
price controls are imposed, there will be less investment in
research and development, and far fewer new cures and treatments.''
</P>
<P>
   The industry spends $21 billion a year on research and
development of new drugs.
</P>
<P>
   According to the American Association of Retired persons, more
than 75 percent of all Americans over age 65 take prescription
drugs. The association found that older Americans spend nearly
three times more of their income on health care than younger
people. Senior citizens make up 12 percent of the population but
purchase one-third of all prescriptions, said Allen. Medicare does
not provide prescription drug coverage. An estimated 37 percent of
all senior citizens have no prescription drug coverage, he said.

POLICY MEANS NOTHING IF THE SHELVES ARE BARE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 27) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anyone who thinks all this global market turmoil is mostly about
devalued currencies, deflation and doomsday scenarios should try to
check in with Anwar Ibrahim. He's a bit hard to reach these days.
</P>
<P>
   Until a few weeks ago, Anwar was the insightful, canny finance
minister of Malaysia, the man anointed to take over as prime
minister some day, and the symbol of his country's astounding
transition from a backwater of rubber plantations and tin mines to
a leading maker of computer chips and cellular phones.
</P>
<P>
   Today he is sitting in jail, held under Malaysia's Internal
Security Act, a law first used 30 years ago to detain suspected
Communist insurgents without trial. The prime minister, Mahathir
Mohamad, is now wielding it to put down an economic insurgency led
by Anwar.
</P>
<P>
   The new subversives have the temerity to suggest that for
Malaysia to make the next leap, it must embrace the discipline of
global markets and stop rewarding Mahathir's cronies.
</P>
<P>
   Anwar's descent from the finance minister's suite to solitary
confinement is the story of a seemingly successful authoritarian
regime cracking under economic pressure _ the same pressure that
toppled President Suharto in Indonesia and brought chaos to Russia.
</P>
<P>
   But it is also a humbling warning to economists whipping up
strategies for putting the world back on track. Bad economics _
horrendous misjudgments made worse by misguidance from the
International Monetary Fund _ may have set off the Asian crisis.
But not even a perfect economic solution, if someone had one, could
stuff the genie back in the bottle.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly this is a crisis about power politics and national
cultures. No economic elixir will work if it is politically
unpalatable to Moscovites searching empty shelves or to Indonesians
again desperate, as they were a generation ago, at the prospect of
unaffordable rice. No wonder the IMF, stuffed with more than 1,000
PhD economists with little background in national politics, keeps
getting wiped out in Kiev and Surabaya.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's fair to say that we misjudged the kind of
political currents that the crisis would unleash,'' a senior
official of the IMF conceded a few weeks ago. ``It's not the way
people in this building have ever been trained to think. If they
did, they would work at the U.N.''
</P>
<P>
   So now, 14 months into the crisis, the countries of the world
can be divided into three broad categories: the Defiant, the
Drifters and the Dutiful.
</P>
<P>
   The Defiant are the most interesting: the countries that, after
a year of dueling with global markets, have chosen to wall
themselves off. Malaysia is the prime example.
</P>
<P>
   While Anwar was echoing the language of Treasury Secretary
Robert E. Rubin and the IMF, talking about austerity, transparency
and market reforms, his prime minister was spinning dark conspiracy
theories about how George Soros and a cabal of secretive financiers
were plotting ``new forms of colonialism.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually that cognitive dissonance grew too great, and Anwar
was sacked and accused, apparently spuriously, of sodomy by
Mahathir. Now acting as his own finance minister, Mahathir imposed
exchange controls and declared the country's currency worthless
outside its borders, leaving terrified international investors _
and Malaysia has plenty, from Intel to Motorola to Coca-Cola _ to
wonder if they will be able to repatriate their profits.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, where tax collection never took hold, never mind market
economics, is speeding into the Defiant camp as well. Its new
economic team, appointed last week, has been dealing with the
country's creditors by decree, with threats to default if the
country is not given more IMF aid on Moscow's terms. Meanwhile, it
is flouting the fund's prescriptions by printing money to pay off
unhappy miners and, more important, the restive rocket corps
officers who command the nuclear silos.
</P>
<P>
   Concern that the ranks of the Defiant will grow explains why
Washington is so worried about the Drifters, countries like
Indonesia and Japan that seem unable to get any traction because
their banks have collapsed and their leadership is paralyzed.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are nations that could go either way,'' one White House
economic adviser noted the other day. ``They could stumble through,
or try to wall off the world.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there are the Dutiful, following the Western
prescriptions and enduring the pain of slashed budgets and high
interest rates, who wonder hourly whether they are obedient
optimists. Brazil and Mexico lead the Dutiful pack and have staved
off disaster so far.
</P>
<P>
   There are signs of hope elsewhere: Interest rates have fallen in
Thailand and South Korea, the only two nations to implement IMF
programs fully. But the cranes in Bangkok still aren't moving, and
Korea's giant conglomerates have failed to downsize in the face of
street protests.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the future for all three groups depends most on the
outcome of the longer political struggle between the Anwars of the
global economy and the Mahathirs of cronyism and isolation. No
econometric model can forecast a winner in that fight.

   With Suharto's authorization, the Indonesian government can
seize the contents of those accounts and return the assets to
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia's attorney general, Major Gen. Mohammad Ghalib, said
Suharto came to his office ``of his own free will'' to deliver two
drafts of letters authorizing the government to open the accounts.
Suharto also notified the government that he had no plans to leave
the country, said General Ghalib, who added that no travel ban
would be placed on Suharto.
</P>
<P>
   Formal action to seize the accounts cannot begin until the
letters are in their final form.
</P>
<P>
   The government's investigations into allegations that Suharto
and his family accumulated up to $40 billion through cronyism and
corrupt business practices has become a national obsession in a
country grappling with its worst recession in decades.
</P>
<P>
   Millions have been thrown out of work since the government first
went to the International Monetary Fund in October to help rescue
the ailing economy, which is expected to shrink 20 percent this
year in the wake of the rupiah's nearly 80 percent depreciation
over the past year.
</P>
<P>
   But critics doubt the ability of a government stacked with
officials put in power by Suharto to conduct a serious
investigation that is likely to implicate high-ranking Cabinet
members and influential businessmen.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts also warned that Suharto's penchant for issuing
government decrees favoring the businesses of his children and
associates would make it difficult to track down the wealth and
find a legal basis for prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the government's decision to include outside lawyers and
independent experts in the investigation, protesters have continued
to take to the streets to demand that charges be brought against
the former president, who resigned under pressure in May.
</P>
<P>
   With public pressure building as Indonesia nears a special
parliamentary session in November, President B.J. Habibie this week
ordered the military to crack down on the protesters who, he said,
``are openly working to keep the situation in the country
uncontrollable, unsafe and unstable.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics labeled the order a ``Suharto-style'' tactic that could
easily backfire on Habibie as he tries to establish his authority
over a restless population of 200 million people, many of whom
continue to question his legitimacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Habibie should not be using his power for personal gain as
this will undermine the authority of the government,'' said
Marsilam Simanjuntak, a lawyer and former student activist.
</P>
<P>
   Simanjuntak predicted the demonstrations would continue and
could eventually ``paralyze the government'' if it failed to insure
an adequate supply of basic commodities and rein in an inflation
rate quickly approaching 100 percent.

 By M.P. DUNLEAVEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Candace Bushnell got up to contribute a tale to
an evening of storytelling on the theme of ``Scary Wedding
Stories,'' she found out it was harder than it seemed to enthrall
an audience without a written text. Ms. Bushnell, the author of
``Sex and the City,'' loped through a sprawling saga of sex, drugs
and matrimony, weaving in mentions of Hugh Grant, a pair of ruined
shoes, several continents and various men.
</P>
<P>
   By the end, both the audience and Ms. Bushnell were worn out.
``It would be great to get up there and discover that you're Eddie
Murphy, but you don't,'' she recalled ruefully of the evening last
spring, which was part of a storytelling series held at Lansky
Lounge downtown. ``I thought it would be like telling a story at a
cocktail party. If I had to do it again, I'd practice more.''
</P>
<P>
   On many Monday nights, literary types with book-party burnout
seek refuge by listening to oral tale-spinners at a gathering
called Stories at the Moth.
</P>
<P>
   It's an idea as old as the campfire: The lights dim, the crowd
gathers and people stand and tell stories. It's Lake Woebegone on
the Lower East Side. Well-known raconteurs like Malachy McCourt and
George Plimpton mingle with those less practiced in the art of the
spiel (Jonathan Ames, Shelagh Ratner, Dael Orlandersmith).
</P>
<P>
   After its first successful year, the Moth went on hiatus for the
summer, but the series returns Sept. 28 at 9 p.m. to Lansky, at 104
Norfolk Street. Hazelle Goodman, an actress, and Ames, author of
``The Extra Man,'' will riff on the theme, ``What Did You Expect?
An Evening of Stories About What You Wanted and What You Got.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Moth isn't about perfection,'' said George Dawes Green,
creator of the series and author of ``The Juror,'' a thriller that
became a Demi Moore movie. ``It's a casual enough event that we
don't care if someone falls on their face a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Green grew up in the single-minded story-swapping culture of
Saint Simon's Island, Ga., and drew much of his inspiration for the
Moth from that background. ``The art of storytelling has
atrophied,'' he said. ``When you watch someone like Malachy
McCourt, who is just masterful, you realize that this is a separate
and distinct art form that just hasn't been encouraged.''
</P>
<P>
   A renowned storyteller long before his older brother, Frank,
wrote ``Angela's Ashes,'' making the name McCourt famous, the
portly, white-haired Malachy McCourt _ who recently published his
own memoir, ``A Monk Swimming'' _ told the tale at one Moth evening
about the time he got naked in a restaurant. It seems a bartender
had refused to serve him until he checked his coat. McCourt
returned to his car, stripped off his clothes and put his overcoat
on. He returned to the bar to ask a second time for a drink. When
the bartender again told him to check the coat, McCourt obligingly
surrendered the garment, whereupon, he related, ``a hush fell over
the room like the moment after Christ left the Apostles at the Last
Supper.''
</P>
<P>
   The punch line, as McCourt told it: he left the restaurant
without his coat, but had forgotten his car keys in his pocket.
</P>
<P>
   Even when there isn't a marquee name at the Moth, what draws the
elbow-to-elbow crowds _ 300 have phoned in reservations for
tomorrow night _ seems to be that old-fashioned ideal of the dream
of a literary community.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no hidden agendas,'' said Katherine Rich, senior
editor at Allure magazine, who organized the ``Scary Wedding
Stories'' evening. ``People tell stories with a sense of vision, as
opposed to a sense of getting their picture on the Time Out
literary page. It's not a lot of writers with trust funds and cell
phones; consequently you get people with something to say.''
</P>
<P>
   But true raconteurs are in short supply. There are moments at
the Moth that make one long to be at a cocktail party, in order to
excuse oneself and hunt for canapes. At an evening called ``True
Crime Stories'' last fall, a man took so long narrating himself to
the border of Mexico (the scene of the alleged crime) that the
audience heckled him away from the microphone.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happens to a lot of people is that they fall into the
trap of monologue,'' said Joey Xanders, the Moth's director. ``You
have to transform the anecdote from `this happened one day' to get
to the point of revelation.'' The Moth is not meant to be a place
for anecdotal anarchy, spontaneous rants or happenings. The
organizers view storytelling as a kind of performance art, and
expect raconteurs to practice and shape their material.
</P>
<P>
   For each evening, Ms. Xanders chooses a curator to recruit
promising storytellers. Then each candidate auditions for Ms.
Xanders, who selects four or five per evening. Ms. Xanders
sometimes puts in hours helping a storyteller _ who could be a
writer, a monk, a monologuist or, in one case, a tourist _ hone the
tale until it's ready to be performed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joey is a masterful editor,'' said Ida Hakkila, a former
deejay and freelance comedy writer for ``Late Night with David
Letterman,'' who told an affecting story about finding and losing
her father. ``When you're working on a true story, it's really hard
to craft it, but Joey helps you find the pivot points in your story
that you couldn't even see.''
</P>
<P>
   In creating the series, Ms. Xanders, who formerly worked in the
theater, recalled asking Green, ``How do we distinguish a story
from readings, from performance art?''
</P>
<P>
   She and Green struggled with the question with a board of
directors. But it was only after they had their first event, in
Green's living room in the summer of 1997, that they got a sense of
what they wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the oral tradition of folk storytelling, the Moth wants
to encourage less rambling and stronger narratives. ``Even more
than the structure of beginning, middle and end, there must be a
character who wants something,'' Ms. Xanders said. ``Every
character is on a journey to find that thing, and on that journey
they have conflicts and struggles _ and how they resolve those
reveals something of who they are.''
</P>
<P>
   The Moth is just one of many storytelling outlets around the
country. There is, of course, the long-standing folk tradition of
storytelling, which has inspired a Website (www.storynet.org) and
an annual convention next weekend in Jonesburg, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   A storytelling salon called Nights With VCR takes place on
Mondays at Here, a bar in SoHo, which was started five years ago by
Victoria Rowan and named for her initials, VCR. It is geared to
young, untried performers.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles, Beth Lapides started what she calls the
Un-Cabaret to bring stand-up comedy back to its story-based roots.
``Our performers don't do routines,'' said Greg Miller, a
co-producer of the Un-Cabaret. ``They tell a different story every
time they get up _ and that's what keeps the audience coming
back.'' Julia Sweeney developed the material that evolved into her
one-woman show about dealing with cancer, ``And God Said Ha,'' at
the Un-Cabaret. Janeane Garofalo is another alum, who Miller said
was scheduled to return to work on stories about the evolution of
her movie career.
</P>
<P>
   But not all storytellers seek to turn the craft into a
profession. As Ms. Rowan put it, ``I think it's part of your
definition as a human being to be able to entertain a group for 10
minutes.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Saul Williams walked into the Antique Boutique in
Greenwich Village as though it were his old neighborhood. He had
the same comfortable, long-limbed stride his poet-rapper character
in ``Slam,'' this year's Sundance grand prize winner, used while
walking around the projects in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Brushing past rows of sweaters and pants in all the New York
colors _ black, charcoal, gray _ he stopped in the middle of the
floor, at a rack he seemed to know well.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is it,'' he said, pulling a house-brand sweatpants-gray,
wool-blend sweater with a zippered neck from out of the pack.
</P>
<P>
   Just then, a young saleswoman in a Morticia Addams-ish clingy
black dress approached.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hi,'' she said, giving him a hug and a peck on the cheek.
``How's that sweater you bought?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually,'' Williams said, still holding the twin of the
sweater he had in his shoulder bag, ``I'm thinking of exchanging
it.''
</P>
<P>
   He had spent a good long time at the store the week before,
mulling over the virtue of this sweater. Still, he did exchange it,
for a pair of gray wool baggy pants with a drawstring waist.
``These are so dope,'' he said, holding the pants against him.
``They look really comfortable, and I like that too.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams doesn't look as though he spends much time figuring out
his wardrobe. But he does. He is, after all, an actor, well aware
that he has an image to project. And lately, that has been
especially important, sitting for one interview after another _
usually at his favorite hangout, the celebrity-studded Time Cafe on
Lafayette Street _ to promote ``Slam,'' which opens in New York on
Oct. 9.
</P>
<P>
   Already a star in New York's spoken-word scene as the 1996
winner of the Nuyorican Poets Cafe grand slam championship,
Williams is on the verge, as the Hollywood types say. His
performance in ``Slam'' has made him a darling of the film festival
circuit, and winner (with his co-star Sonja Sohn) of the
Independent Feature Film Project's first Perry Ellis Breakthrough
award.
</P>
<P>
   When ``Slam'' opens nationally, on Oct. 16, and Williams
inevitably crosses the great divide between anonymity and
celebrity, he plans to do it looking like what he is, both
street-smart and artsy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do like clothes,'' he said the other day, after yet another
interview at the Time Cafe. Runner-skinny, with a lean, dark brown
face and longish hair that he was wearing pulled back, he looked
very downtown in his black overdyed cargo pants from Canal Jeans, a
vintage white cotton-blend button-down shirt that accented his
narrow waist and a pair of clunky sneakerlike shoes (``They're
called Campers''), which he bought in London.
</P>
<P>
   At 26, a year after getting his master's degree in acting from
New York University, Williams is poised for all kinds of success.
While his first feature role has received hosannas, his writing and
spoken-word performances are also getting their shot in the
limelight.
</P>
<P>
   He was credited as a screenwriter for helping to create his
character in ``Slam,'' a sensitive type facing prison time on a
petty drug charge, and for writing the poetry that he performs in
the film.
</P>
<P>
   His first volume of poetry, ``Seventh Octave,'' (Moore Black
Press) has hit the stores, and he has recordings of his spoken-word
performances on Mouth Almighty/Mercury Records and Ninja Tunes
Rawkus Records.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was never really into slams,'' he said, of the competitive
poetry readings that have hovered on the edge between faddishness
and obscurity for a decade. ``A lot of the poetry in these
performances is all about performing, and not about poetry. To me,
poetry has to work on the page. I did slams because of what I
thought they could do for me. Once I won the grand slam, I stopped.
I had nothing else to prove.''
</P>
<P>
   It was at a poetry performance at the Nuyorican Poets Cafe that
Williams met Marc Levin, the director of ``Gang War: Bangin' in
Little Rock,'' a 1993 HBO documentary. Levin, who would go on to
direct ``Slam,'' had run into a friend on the street, Bonz Malone
(who ended up playing a Washington jail gang leader in ``Slam''),
who told him he simply had to see the young Williams perform.
</P>
<P>
   ``Slam'' was born out of weekly workshops the director had over
a period of months with several collaborators, including Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt in my mind that `Slam' is going to be huge,''
Williams said, between bites of a veggie burger at the cafe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a film about the power of language,'' he said earnestly.
``People are going to see this and get blown away.''
</P>
<P>
   In this urban fable, Williams' character, Raymond Joshua, is
thrown into the District of Columbia jail after being caught by
police with enough marijuana to land him a mandatory prison
sentence, even though it's a first offense.
</P>
<P>
   He uses his talent for writing and performing poetry to stop a
budding rumble in the jail yard in its tracks, and he is so
transformed by the experience that he persuades an old friend who
was blinded by an enemy not to retaliate. He also falls for a poet,
a prison writing teacher played by Ms. Sohn, and the growing
spoken-word movement in little clubs, while out on bail. Williams'
eyes grew large and moist. ``There's a reason I named my character
Raymond Joshua,'' he said. ``Joshua in the Bible marched around
Jericho, and the walls came tumbling down after he marched around
seven times with his trumpet. If `Slam' plays in 700 theaters at
the same time, the walls of Babylon will come tumbling down.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   After hearing this, it comes as no surprise to learn that
Williams is the son of the Rev. Saul Williams, a Baptist minister
in Newburgh, and that he grew up doing raps for his father's youth
rallies. ``I used to go through the dictionary looking for big
words that I could use in my rapping,'' he said. After getting
acting lessons for his 13th birthday, Williams was hooked. He
majored in both acting and philosophy at Morehouse College. He also
helped start a literary magazine. ``Poets are the soothsayers of
the new age,'' he said solemnly.
</P>
<P>
   He still performs his poetry. Sometimes he collaborates with his
girlfriend, Marcia Jones, a painter, with whom he lives in Harlem
with their daughter, Saturn, 2. During their performances, as
Williams recites poetry, Ms. Jones paints. ``She's a performance
painter,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The two have made themselves part of the downtown arts scene. On
a second shopping trip through the Village to hunt for something
Williams would wear for the premiere of ``Slam,'' the couple
stopped at least half a dozen times to say hello to friends and
acquaintances.
</P>
<P>
   They also joked with the salesman at Omari, the SoHo shoe
boutique where Williams bought a pair of blue suede, crepe-sole
shoes to match a blue vintage shirt he had bought at the Antique
Boutique possibly to wear to the premiere. (``I just hope this
works with black leather pants,'' he said.)
</P>
<P>
   Between all the interviews and greetings, Williams and Ms. Jones
plan to perform at CBGB's next weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Williams is also making the usual rounds of auditions. ``Just
today, he said, ``I went on an audition for what turned out to be
another drug-dealer role.'' He shook his head. ``I knew, when I
walked in, that I wasn't going to take the part.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Cornell University officials are investigating
allegations of scientific misconduct against the head of one of the
university's largest immunology and AIDS-related research labs in
New York City and a recipient of more than $2 million in federal
money, Cornell officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The researcher, Dr. John L. Ho, has been accused by members of
his lab of ordering subordinates to falsify data in one research
grant application; of knowingly using false claims to obtain
another federal grant for $1.5 million; of publishing a paper based
on falsified experiments; and of threatening or punishing members
of the lab who discovered damaging evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the allegations were pieced together from interviews
with seven current and former lab employees, three of whom would
speak only on the condition of anonymity and provided most of the
information, including supporting documents.
</P>
<P>
   Ho, 48, an associate professor of medicine and microbiology at
the Joan and Sanford Weill Medical College and Graduate School of
Medical Sciences of Cornell University, declined to respond to any
charges, saying, ``My guilt or innocence has to be evaluated in the
context of the whole current investigation.'' Asked if he was
guilty of scientific misconduct, he replied: ``I don't believe I
have intentionally conducted scientific misconduct.''
</P>
<P>
   Ho is not related to the better-known AIDS researcher Dr. David
Ho, who directs the Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, also
located in New York. Though Ho has not achieved renown as an AIDS
researcher, he is viewed by peers as an up-and-coming immunologist.
He sits on research peer review committees of the American Heart
Association and the National Institutes of Health, and his
collaboration in a 10-year, $5-million federal grant to study AIDS
in Haiti gives him a role in the search for an HIV vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   The research projects tied to the misconduct inquiry involve
test-tube experiments to determine how the immune system is
affected by various microbes, including those of HIV, tuberculosis
and parasitic diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Hajjar, the dean of the graduate school, said the
university's inquiry began in mid-August, when allegations made by
one member of Ho's lab reached top officials. Dr. Dominic Falcone,
an associate professor of pathology appointed by the dean to
conduct a 60-day inquiry, said in an interview that so far, some,
but not all, of the allegations have been supported by other
people.
</P>
<P>
   Questions about the integrity of Ho's research surfaced during
the last 19 months, lab members said. Also at issue in the inquiry,
officials said, is the disappearance of about 60 vials of human DNA
fragments known as plasmids, most of them encoded with HIV proteins
for experimentation. The plasmids vanished from a freezer in late
December, heightening what several researchers described as an
atmosphere of fear and distrust in Ho's lab, which occupies five
rooms on the fourth floor of the New York Hospital medical complex
in Manhattan. University officials said the plasmids had not been
found, but stressed that they were not dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cornell is not interested in anything but getting to the
bottom of it,'' Hajjar said.
</P>
<P>
   After Falcone reports on his inquiry, Hajjar, following
university policy, will decide if the allegations are
``sufficiently substantive'' to open a formal investigation by a
three-member committee, which would require notifying the National
Institutes of Health.

   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic _ As the death toll on this
hurricane-ravaged island continued to climb Friday, the first
international relief efforts arrived here with promises of more
support on the way.
</P>
<P>
   The Dominican government, which was caught largely unprepared
Tuesday for the force of Hurricane Georges, listed 125 dead and at
least 90 missing, but news reports from hard-hit rural communities
put the number of possible missing in the thousands.
</P>
<P>
   The front page of one daily newspaper bore the stark headline:
``Mesopotamia No Longer Exists,'' referring to a city in the
western part of this country of 8 million people that was
overwhelmed by torrential floodwaters. About 9,000 people were
evacuated from the area, but U.S. Embassy spokesman Franklin
Polanco said ``nobody knows how many are in the mud.''
</P>
<P>
   In the town of Cambita, about 30 miles west of the capital,
about 40 people were reported missing when floods swept away the
shelter in which they were seeking refuge.
</P>
<P>
   For the third day, the country went without electricity or
running water except in buildings served by their own generators.
An 8 p.m. curfew remained in effect, enforced by the military.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile two plane loads of supplies from the United States and
one from France landed Friday providing rolls of plastic sheeting
used for shelters, as well as tents and generators. Another plane
was scheduled to arrive Saturday carrying chainsaws, water jugs and
eight 3,000-gallon water containers.
</P>
<P>
   Also Friday, 10 disaster relief officials from the U.S. Agency
for International Development, the Pan American Health Organization
and the Miami-Dade Fire and Rescue Service arrived on a BAC-111 jet
-- normally used to ferry rock bands and sports teams -- that left
from Baltimore-Washington International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were just in the right place to do this,'' said chief pilot
Tony Gee(CQ) of Boca Raton, Fla. ``They just routed us to Baltimore
to pick it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Hugh Q. Parmer, U.S. AID assistant administrator for
humanitarian response who headed the relief assessment team, said
he would recommend that 100,000 pre-cooked relief meals be
stockpiled just outside Baltimore, Md. to be flown here, if
necessary. Late Friday, officials also were discussing the
possibility of shipping in rice, beans and other foodstuffs if
shortages developed.
</P>
<P>
   After a helicopter flight over the capital to assess some of the
damage and a meeting with U.S. Embassy Charge d'affaires Linda E.
Watt, Parmer said he also would recommend that U.S. military
helicopters be deployed to the island to help in reconnaissance
efforts. The Dominican Republic has only four government
helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   Medical assessment teams continued evaluating the damage and
preparing plans to provide medical aid, such as vaccines, and
sanitation assistance such as portable latrines.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add begins here.)
</P>
<P>
   Reporters who accompanied Parmer on the helicopter flight saw
houses and buildings ripped apart by the storm. Many roofs had been
torn off buildings and their interiors destroyed by the soaking
rains. Elsewhere, flood waters engulfed dozens of homes along the
Rio Ozama, the river that runs through the capital.
</P>
<P>
   In some places, homeowners dived into the muddy waters filling
their homes in search of lost possessions.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane Georges also dealt a severe blow to the Dominican
Republic's economy which, despite a poverty rate around 60 percent,
seemed to be heading for a growth rate of about 6 to 7 percent,
Watt said.
</P>
<P>
   Initial reports indicated that the country's agricultural crops
-- including rice, plantains, yucca, coffee and sugar -- were
severely damaged.
</P>
<P>
   About 30 percent of the sugarcane crop was destroyed and the
country's five major sugar processing mills all suffered
substantial damage, Polanco said. Two major sugar warehouses
containing thousands of tons of processed sugar collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the rice in the country is under water,'' said Polanco,
the U.S. Embassy spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's tourism industry also was hard-hit. Although many
downtown hotels were open and operating on emergency power, resort
areas such as La Romana, along the southeastern coast, reported
that 60 to 75 percent of the roofs had been destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Watt said the psychological damage to the tourism industry could
linger long after repairs are made.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of European tourists come down to the Dominican
Republic,'' she said. ``They're going to go back to their country
and say 'This hurricane hit us.' ``
</P>
<P>
   The hurricane is likely to squelch the economy's robust
performance and drive more people into unemployment, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a double whammy. It's going to take a long time to
recover.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dominican Red Cross reportedly tried to enlist the aid of
home run-slugging native son Sammy Sosa to organize a pledge drive
among the 29 Dominicans in Major League Baseball. U.S. officials
said they were unaware late Friday whether the Red Cross had
succeeded in reaching Sosa.

CLINTON CHIDES GOP FOR EMPHASIS ON LEWINSKY RATHER THAN
LEGISLATION  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Calif., Texas, Colo., Ky.)   By JOHN M. BRODER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Cheered by polls that appear to show the beginnings of
a backlash against congressional Republicans for a seeming
preoccupation with the Lewinsky scandal, President Clinton Friday
criticized them for a lack of action on spending bills and other
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   In remarks before leaving the White House Friday morning for a
three-day fund-raising swing on behalf of Democratic candidates,
Clinton said, ``By failing to meet its most basic governing
responsibility, the Republican majority in Congress has its
priorities wrong: partisanship over progress, politics over
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton laced his comments with a sharp partisan edge, hoping to
gain an advantage with the public as Republicans appear to be
moving toward authorizing an impeachment inquiry against him. In
his speeches late this week, there has been no mention of his
affair with Monica Lewinsky or for his seven months of misleading
statements about the relationship.
</P>
<P>
   As he tries to turn attention away from the threat to his
presidency, Clinton has authorized his lawyers to privately
negotiate a financial settlement in the longstanding Paula Jones
sexual misconduct case that is now pending appeal. If successful in
putting that matter behind him, Clinton could then argue to
Congress that he has resolved the accusations that ultimately
exposed his affair with Ms. Lewinsky, although what effect a
settlement would have on the impeachment inquiry remains unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Trent Lott, the Senate majority leader, resisted any notion of
short-cutting the House deliberations on impeachment Friday, saying
the process should be allowed to go forward. And he returned fire
on the president's criticism of Republicans in Congress, deriding
Clinton as ``Fundraiser-in-Chief'' and accusing him of neglecting
his own responsibilities as he maneuvers to salvage his political
future.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president comes out at a time when he needs cooperation
with _ and we need cooperation from him _ with the Congress, and he
takes a gratuitous slap, jumps on a plane, and runs off for three
days of fund-raising,'' Lott said. ``Now is he the fund-raiser-in
chief? Or is he the commander-in-chief?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we're doing our work,'' he said. ``Maybe he just hasn't
noticed; he's been distracted. And what he's trying to do is
distract attention from his problems by trying to, you know, push
the blame off on somebody else.''
</P>
<P>
   And Rep. Ann Northup, R-Ky., said that Clinton had failed to
exert his influence to help win passage of fast-track trade
legislation, which the president supports but a majority of
Democrats oppose.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where is he?'' Ms. Northop asked sarcastically. ``He's out on
a political junket.''
</P>
<P>
   Barry Toiv, the White House deputy press secretary, said that it
was the Republican leadership, not Clinton, who is responsible for
the gridlock in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how he can say that,'' Toiv said, referring to
Lott's criticism. ``It's not the president who has eeked out a
total of one appropriations bill in nine months, with only five
days left to go in the fiscal year. It's not the president who is
five months behind in enacting a budget. It's not the president who
has failed to approve education spending.''
</P>
<P>
   Toiv added, ``Look, the Congress needs to get its work done. I
think that's the point the president was trying to make today.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said there were still a few days left for Congress to
act before breaking in early October for electioneering. But he
held out little hope that Republican leaders would heed his call
and appeared delighted to have a slow-moving target at which to aim
political barbs.
</P>
<P>
   He said he had signed a stop-gap spending bill Friday morning to
keep the government running while Congress debates specific
appropriations bills. He called the emergency measure ``a
regrettable sign'' that Republicans were ``moving in the wrong
direction.''
</P>
<P>
   He was particularly critical of a Republican plan to cut taxes
by $80 billion before the future solvency of the Social Security
trust fund is assured.
</P>
<P>
   The president appeared emboldened by recent polls that show
approval of Congress slipping while his popularity registered gains
after the airing Monday of his grand jury testimony in the Lewinsky
investigation. His public comments reflect a calculation that he
can gain politically by contrasting his focus on public business
with Congress' heavy diet of impeachment talk.
</P>
<P>
   On a separate tour with similar themes, Hillary Rodham Clinton
campaigned for Democrats in Colorado, Oregon, Washington and
California this week. At an elementary school in Sheridan, Colo.,
on Thursday, Mrs. Clinton complained that Congress does not seem to
have time to devote to issues like education and classroom size.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I wish that I could have every member of Congress who is
too busy _ too busy to have a hearing about school modernization,
too busy to consider adding teachers to lower classroom size, to
come with me to Ft. Logan,'' Mrs. Clinton said, referring to the
school where she spoke. ``They could not do that and the result is
you won't see them ... they'd rather spend time dividing our
country, diverting our resources, doing anything but focusing on
the real problems of America.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton sounded the same anti-Congress theme in an appearance at
an elementary school in Chicago Friday, accusing Republicans of
inaction on legislation on education, health care, the environment
and the global economy.
</P>
<P>
   And, at a fundraiser for Glen Poshard, the Democratic candidate
for Illinois governor, at which Poshard did not appear, Clinton
said that after eight months of inaction, the Republican leadership
of Congress now wants to pass a popular tax cut on the eve of the
mid-term election.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority party wants to make everybody happy close to the
election with a tax cut,'' Clinton said. ``But it's not the right
thing to do. Before the red ink turns to black and it dries a
little bit, people want to turn around and spend it again.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Poshard, who spoke to the $250,000 fundraising luncheon at
Chicago's Mercantile Club by telephone from Washington, said that
critics would accuse him of seeking to distance himself from a
president in serious political trouble. ``Nothing could be further
from the truth,'' said Poshard, a Democratic member of Congress
from southern Illinois. ``I'm very proud of your work,'' he said,
addressing Clinton. ``I'm very proud of your leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Poshard said he had remained in Washington to vote on Social
Security and tax legislation. But he also was preparing to vote
against the administration's position on fast-track trade
authority, a position he has held consistently, according to David
Gillies, Poshard's congressional press secretary. Poshard, like
many Democrats, believes the administration's trade position does
not ensure adequate protection for workers and the environment in
less-developed countries, Gillies said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that he gave Poshard an ``excused absence'' from
missing his own fundraiser to stay in Washington to vote.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will appear at five more fundraising events for
Democratic candidates this weekend, three in California and two in
Texas. He also plans to spend Saturday morning with Mrs. Clinton
visiting their daughter, Chelsea, who is a sophomore at Stanford
University.
</P>
<P>
   The president returns to Washington late Sunday night.

HOUSE KILLS FAST-TRACK TRADE AUTHORITY FOR PRESIDENT
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service Clients.)  
 By JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Democrats and moderate Republicans, wary of
angering organized labor in an election year, united Friday to kill
legislation that would have given President Clinton special power
to negotiate trade agreements.
</P>
<P>
   The House voted 243-180 against renewing the so-called
fast-track authority enjoyed by George Bush and other recent
presidents.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Republican leaders in Congress support the
authority, which would streamline trade negotiations, but the
measure was staunchly opposed by labor organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, a free-trade supporter who helped steer the North
American Free Trade Agreement through Congress in 1993, has focused
on avoiding a possible impeachment inquiry over his extramarital
affair and did not lobby for fast track as he did in an
unsuccessful effort last year.
</P>
<P>
   Three senior Democrats _ Reps. Robert Matsui and Vic Fazio of
California, and Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland _ are leading advocates
of fast-track authority but helped steer the measure to defeat by
announcing they were opposing it to protest the Republican
leadership's timing of the vote five weeks before the November
elections.
</P>
<P>
   Matsui, the ranking Democrat on the House Ways and Means trade
subcommittee, said he would not ``participate in an effort to
embarrass or defeat my colleagues by using trade policy as a
tool,'' adding the Republican tactic will send a dangerous message
that ``the U.S. isn't serious about international leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It soils the national debate on trade with the mud of partisan
politics,'' Matsui said. ``This debate is not about fast track,
this debate is about partisan politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Matsui said it was obvious that the fast-track measure would
fail because it is virtually identical to the bill that Republicans
pulled off the House floor last fall because they were short of
votes.
</P>
<P>
   Fazio said Republican leaders knew they lacked support to pass
fast track but chose to bring the measure up to force Democrats to
choose between alienating labor groups that oppose it, and business
and agricultural interests that support it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could well put a lot of (Democrats) in a very tough
position,'' Fazio said. ``Democrats can't win because this has
become so divisive. It's a fight Republican leaders wanted to pick
... It's a meaningless, politically driven vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoyer said the Republican leadership scheduled the vote for
``political advantage,'' and would make it tougher for fast-track
authority to pass next year.
</P>
<P>
   Fast-track authority requires that when the president submits a
trade agreement for ratification, Congress must either accept it or
reject it without making amendments. Proponents say this gives the
president power to negotiate deals he wouldn't otherwise have if a
deal is subject to revisions by the House and Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has granted fast-track authority to every president
since Gerald R. Ford, but the current authority lapsed in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the fast-track authority say past trade deals have
failed to include provisions to adequately protect the environment
and ensure that trading partners have labor standards similar to
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``It places Clinton on the wrong side of the future,'' Rep.
Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said in an interview. Pelosi said that
while ``San Francisco was built on trade, we also know about
environmental damage that can come with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Pelosi said Friday's vote was not a sign of isolationism or
opposition to free trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about a much more enlightened look at trade,'' Pelosi
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Jim Kolbe, R-Ariz., an ardent supporter of free trade
and fast-track authority, said in an interview the vote would send
a global message that the United States ``is lacking any leadership
from the top.''
</P>
<P>
   Kolbe said the Clinton administration ``is afraid of the demons
_ the labor unions _ in their own party.''
</P>
<P>
   Kolbe said if the administration had pushed for fast-track
authority as it did last year, it would have passed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the weakest performance (by the White House) I've seen
in the 14 years I've been here,'' Kolbe said.

AMERICAN WINS 505 CHAMPIONSHIPS

<P>
   HYANNIS, Mass. _ Nick Trotman, the 27-year-old Massachusetts
native who sailed for Tufts University, Friday became the first
American skipper to win the 505 World Championships in 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   Winding up a seven-day regatta hosted by Hyannis Yacht Club that
included every condition from light-shift breezes to fresh 25-knot
northerlies, Trotman and crew Mike Mills placed just 14th Friday.
But after a consistent week of high scoring, it was more than
enough for the team that has been racing 505s together for more
than five years.
</P>
<P>
   Trotman, a member of the Team Racing World Championship sqaud,
narrowly missed the North American title last year and won this
year's Canadian championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``This title has been the focus of my life for a long time,''
said Trotman, who sailed Lasers and then 505s at Tufts. ``I chose
this class when I was in college. It's the greatest one-design
dinghy in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Trotman plans to put his sailing activities on hold and hopes to
start business school at Columbia this winter.
</P>
<P>
   Another US team, Howard Hamlin and Mike Martin, finished second,
beating out Britons Ian Barker and David Cripps, who had been
second for most of the week.
</P>
<P>
   In fourth place was another US tandem, three-time North American
champion Mike Zani and Peter Alarie.
</P>
<P>
   The last US world champion had been Cam Lewis in 1982 and '83.
American Steve Taylor had won it in 1979.

NUMBER OF AMERICANS LACKING HEALTH COVERAGE SOARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX PHAM  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite a booming economy and rock-bottom unemployment rates,
the number of people in America without health insurance continued
to soar last year to 43.7 million, up 1.5 million from 1996,
researchers at Harvard Medical School and Columbia University
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers, based on data from the US Census Bureau, show a
nation that is ``treading water'' despite recent attempts by
federal and state governments to combat a seemingly intractable
problem of uninsurance, researchers say. Attempts include
legislation by several states to expand Medicaid eligibilty; a
federal infusion of $24 billion to fund state programs to insure
children; and a 1996 federal ``portability'' law that allows
workers who lose or switch their jobs to keep their health
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``These programs are not making a dent in the problem of the
uninsured,'' said Dr. Steffie Woolhandler, associate professor at
Harvard Medical School and co-author of the national report,
published by the Physicians for a National Health Program, an
organization of 8,000 doctors who support universal access to
health care. &UR;  &LR; ``We had the equivalent of 125,000 people lose health
insurance every month this past year.''
</P>
<P>
   Three factors have undermined efforts to boost coverage.
</P>
<P>
   One is a loophole in the portability law that allows insurers to
shun sick people by jacking up their premiums, according to a
recent investigation by the US General Accounting Office.
</P>
<P>
   The second factor is an erosion in the number of people with
private, employer-sponsored health insurance. Cost is the culprit,
according to researchers. High premiums prevent many small
employers from offering insurance benefits. And among firms that do
offer coverage, many of their workers decide not to buy the
insurance because of unaffordable premiums.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coverage has become expensive,'' said Marilyn Ellwood, a
senior fellow with Mathematica Policy Research &UR;  &LR; in Cambridge.
``People at the lower end of the economy are having a harder time
affording'' health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   The last factor involves a recent federal revamp of the nation's
welfare programs, which sought to limit the amount of time people
stay on welfare. As the number of people on welfare dropped, so did
the number of people on Medicaid, the government health insurance
program for low-income people. While Medicaid eligibility was not
affected by the reform and eligibility for welfare assistance is no
longer necessary for Medicaid coverage, many families either
weren't aware of the change or didn't have the time to sign up
their families, leading to a national drop of 1.8 million people on
Medicaid in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts saw a minor decline in the number of uninsured,
down 11,000 to 755,000 residents last year, according to a separate
report by researchers of Boston University's School of Public
Health. The drop gave the Bay State a chance to catch its breath
from a decade of relentless growth in the number of uninsured.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, however, Medicaid helped compensate for a big
drop in the number of people with private health insurance, said
Alan Sager, co-author of the Boston University study on
Massachusetts uninsurance rates. Medicaid enrollment increased by
81,000 people in 1997, while those with private coverage dropped
70,000. The result is a net 11,000 decline in the number of people
without health insurance. And while the number of uninsured fell,
the percentage of uninsured in the state actually rose to 12.6
percent in 1997 from 12.4 percent in 1996, presumably because of a
declining population.
</P>
<P>
   Sager was sanguine about the state figures. Massachusetts'
booming economy should have had a greater impact on the uninsured,
he said. ``The state created 324,000 jobs since 1992, and yet the
number of people lacking health insurance rose 133,000 during the
same period,'' Sager said. ``Clearly, many of these new jobs are
not providing health insurance benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   While these numbers have not hit crisis proportions, scholars
fear that a weakened economy could trigger a widespread loss of
health insurance. ``We're just treading water now, but if we see a
downturn in the economy, we're going to start sinking,''
Woolhandler said.

BILL WOULD EASE DRUG COSTS FOR SENIORS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In two weeks, Vi Quirion, a senior citizen from
Waterville, Maine, will take a field trip to Canada with her
friends and neighbors to stock up on prescription drugs that cost
half the amount she pays in Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Quirion has arthritis and a stomach ailment. Supported by two
metal canes, she labored to the lectern of a Capitol Hill news
conference Friday to explain that many senior citizens pay more
than twice as much for prescriptions as preferred customers that
buy drugs in bulk, such as large health maintenance organizations,
hospital chains and the federal government. Under Canada's national
health insurance system, prescription prices are heavily
subsidized.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't afford to pay my prescriptions and gas and eat, too,''
Quirion said. ``We should not have to live like that.''
</P>
<P>
   A study conducted by the Democratic staff for the House
Government Reform and Oversight Committee in seven congressional
districts, including Representative Tom Allen's district in Maine,
found that older Americans and other uninsured consumers pay 106
percent more for the 10 best-selling prescription drugs than the
drug companies' preferred customers.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the study found that Tielid, a drug used by stroke
victims, costs $118.06 per prescription at retail but only $33.57
for favored customers, a 252 percent difference. Zocor, a drug used
to treat high cholesterol, costs preferred customers $42.95 and
regular retail customers $104.98, a 144 percent difference.
</P>
<P>
   The study said large corporate and institutional customers of
the drug companies were able to buy drugs at discounted prices, but
the most vulnerable consumers, the uninsured and others without
insurance coverage for prescriptions, were paying full price and
effectively subsidizing the more well-heeled consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Representative John F. Tierney, the Massachusetts Democrat, said
an analysis of prices in his district found retail prices for the
10 drugs were 110 percent higher than the price charged to
preferred customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is unfathomable and biased,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Allen led a group of Democrats in proposing legislation Friday
that would require drug companies to sell prescription drugs at the
same low price offered preferred customers to pharmacies that serve
Medicare recipients.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers charged that the major pharmaceutical companies
are making record profits at the expense of senior citizens.
Pharmaceutical companies maintain they need to charge full price
for prescription drugs to subsidize research and development of new
life-saving drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are determined to assure that no older American will ever
again have to choose between buying food and taking the drugs
needed to maintain their health,'' said Allen, a first-term
Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation faces an up-hill battle and is not likely to be
considered until next year because Congress is scheduled to adjourn
in two weeks. No Republicans support the bill, and the drug
companies are expected to be strongly opposed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The well-meaning efforts of the bill's sponsors unfortunately
are likely to backfire on America's seniors,'' said Alan F. Holmer,
president of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of
America, a trade association. ``In a very real sense, this bill is
a dagger pointed at the hearts of America's senior citizens. If
price controls are imposed, there will be less investment in
research and development, and far fewer new cures and treatments.''
</P>
<P>
   The industry spends $21 billion a year on research and
development of new drugs.
</P>
<P>
   According to the American Association of Retired persons, more
than 75 percent of all Americans over age 65 take prescription
drugs. The association found that older Americans spend nearly
three times more of their income on health care than younger
people. Senior citizens make up 12 percent of the population but
purchase one-third of all prescriptions, said Allen. Medicare does
not provide prescription drug coverage. An estimated 37 percent of
all senior citizens have no prescription drug coverage, he said.

BRUSCHI CUTTING HIS OWN SWATH ON THE FIELD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Year by year, his role expands. He spends
more time on the field. Little by little, the old prejudices _ that
he is undersized, that he's a defensive end learning to be a
linebacker _ become less intense. And now Tedy Bruschi doesn't have
to look over his shoulder anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I'm driving along in my car with my wife,'' he said,
``and I'll turn to her and say, `I'm living in a fantasy.' To play
professional football _ whether I'm playing 10 plays or 30 or
whether I'm just on special teams _ what an incredible thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-1-inch, 245-pounder never takes a moment of his NFL
life for granted. When he's on the field, he still hits people as
if they've done him wrong. While some of his teammates are caught
up in trivial stuff, Bruschi focuses constantly on getting better.
</P>
<P>
   For someone who loves the game so much, it might be difficult
not to be a starter, but Bruschi emphatically dispels that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether I play 10 plays or 30, I thank God for the chance to
be in there at all. I think everyone wants to play all the time,
but I'm the plug linebacker and right now (starter) Todd Collins is
having a great year. He's playing as well as I've seen him play
since I've been here.''
</P>
<P>
   For the selfish or the diffident, this would be a hard role to
accept. But Bruschi takes a different perspective. He figures that
every year he's made progress toward a starter's role, a role he
might have with several other NFL teams, ones that don't have the
likes of Collins, Chris Slade, and Ted Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``My role has expanded between this year and last year,'' said
Bruschi. ``I don't know if I could start somewhere else. That's not
for me to say.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I know is that as each year goes along, I'm developing as
a linebacker. When I first came in, I had been a defensive lineman
all my life. It took me a while to be able to say I'm a linebacker
and to think like a linebacker. I'm starting to learn the defense
and doing some good things. I can still rush the passer and go
crazy on special teams like I do.''
</P>
<P>
   In his third season, Bruschi's role has begun to evolve. He's
getting more playing time, and in more significant situations. He's
no longer just a complementary player. Now he's essential. He knows
Collins is a very good linebacker, hard to replace. So he's
patient.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my rookie year under Bill Parcells, I was mostly a dime
rusher,'' he said, ``and once in a while, we'd drop back in
coverage. When Pete (Carroll) came in, I was a nickel linebacker.
Now I'm a nickel linebacker, dime linebacker, and I'm a rusher in a
package we call the dollar package. It's expanded each year. Each
year I'm learning the regular plug position that Todd plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always considered myself in competition for it, and (the
coaching staff) told me I'd push for playing time this year. I see
Todd and I've learned a lot from him. I'm on the verge of making a
bigger step, and maybe that will be next year.''
</P>
<P>
   He takes a realistic view of his situation vis a vis Collins.
``Todd can do a better job than me right now at plugger,'' said
Bruschi. ``I look forward to the defense stopping them on first
down for 2 or less yards, because I say to myself, `OK, I'm coming
in.' I don't harp on the things that are out of my control. Last
year I played 10 plays some games and 30 some others. I didn't
complain when I played 10 and I didn't complain when I played 30.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruschi laid a big hit on Eddie George in a big-time situation
last week. The Oilers led the Patriots, 16-13, with less than seven
minutes remaining when, on third and 13 from the Tennessee 17,
Steve McNair swung a pass to George in the left flat. No sooner had
George caught the ball than Bruschi dropped him for a 4-yard loss.
Bruschi had noticed the play being used throughout the game. When
it was called this time, it came as no surprise to him.
</P>
<P>
   It got the Patriots going. The Oilers had to punt, and
eventually, the New England offense cranked it up and marched to
the winning score.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes after a play like that,'' said Bruschi, ``I just
shake my head and say, `I can't believe I just did that in an NFL
game.'''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------ &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots practiced for the last time before their weekend
off. Tight end Ben Coates missed his second straight day of
practice to be with his family after the death of his 38-year-old
sister from a brain hemorrhage ... Owner Robert Kraft appeared at
practice. In the November issue of Football Digest, Kraft is rated
as the No. 1 power broker in the NFL. Second is Gene Upshaw, the
executive director of the Players Association. Rounding out the top
10 are Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, Broncos owner Pat Bowlen,
Steelers owner Dan Rooney, Panthers owner Jerry Richardson,
commissioner Paul Tagliabue, agent Leigh Steinberg, Packers general
manager Ron Wolf, and Dolphins coach Jimmy Johnson. Kraft's ranking
was based on his work putting together the $17.6 billion TV deal
and his position on the finance committee, which recently put
together the Cleveland Browns expansion deal. In the same issue,
Foxboro Stadium was rated the worst facility in the NFL.

VANISHED BOY'S BIRTHDAY PASSES LIKE A PUFF OF AIR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID LEIBOWITZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - His birthday passed yesterday. The brown-haired boy
from Chandler would have turned seven. Imagine with me gifts,
games, a cake, seven candles plus one for good luck _ the
celebration that should have been.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the day vanished like the birthday boy, unnoticed,
traceless. Like a puff of air expelled from pursed lips.
</P>
<P>
   The leads in his case, the case of Omar Vargas, evaporate in
that same way.
</P>
<P>
   It happened again this week, 41 months after 3-year-old Omar
went missing, snatched from outside a revival tent in Agua Prieta,
Sonora, Mexico. This time, hope took the shape of a jailed Mexican
cop, a disgrace named Librado Castro Bravo.
</P>
<P>
   And again, hope proved a tease.
</P>
<P>
   Castro Bravo once helped lead the Vargas investigation. Three
years ago, it's said, he got three men to confess to kidnapping and
murder. Trouble is, those suspects recanted, saying Castro Bravo
tortured them. For seven months, the cop has sat in jail awaiting
trial. He tried an appeal to get out, then a hunger strike.
</P>
<P>
   When those tries failed, Castro Bravo played the Omar card.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came forward and claimed he knew where the body was,'' says
Norma Martens, an Arizona assistant attorney general on the case
since its start.
</P>
<P>
   The A.G.'s office sent an investigator. The Douglas police sent
two. For nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Martens explains: ``Basically, what he said was, `If you let me
out and give me some of my people back, I can find Omar's body
within a few days.' That was all he told us.''
</P>
<P>
   In a word, nothing. Which is not to say the cop's ploy passed
without effect. There's a house in Chandler where the name Omar
still rhymes with loss, ache, yearn. Erwin and Christine Diaz's
house.
</P>
<P>
   Erwin is Omar's half-brother, one sibling of 10. Christine is
his wife, a schoolteacher who entered his life as Omar slipped out.
This week, the TV reporters called to tell them about Castro Bravo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew all along it was just another scam,'' says Christine.
``That's always what it is. We knew he was just some cop that
wanted out of jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost like salt in a wound whenever these false hopes
come up again.''
</P>
<P>
   Come up they do, like the silent birthdays and ever-shifting
rumors. Once, someone left a boy at an orphanage in Sonora _ but
not Omar. There have been stories that he was kidnapped to be sold
to childless Americans, stories that it was a case of mistaken
identity, stories that Omar was killed immediately and stories that
he died many months later, of a stomach infection.
</P>
<P>
   Christine and Erwin have their own favored scenario _ one that
involves Omar's father and his kin, a vendetta and an Agua Prieta
drug family driven to revenge. Martens, the assistant attorney
general, has heard that story, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been so many theories throughout this whole
thing,'' says the lawyer. ``I just don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   No one does, which, impossibly, is worse than it sounds. For two
years, not knowing drove Omar's mother, Miriam, down to Agua
Prieta, to the city hall there. She rattled the uncooperative
Mexican cops, followed the cadaver dogs as they loped through the
streets, even got in to see Mexico's president.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in May of '97, Miriam and her twin, Lucy, died in a crash
six miles outside the town where Omar vanished.
</P>
<P>
   Two more bodies for a family still searching for a third.
</P>
<P>
   One more little boy Miriam lost the chance to touch. This time,
a grandson.
</P>
<P>
   Jonah Diaz was born two months ago, in the house where the name
Omar is still sore to the tongue. Christine and Erwin see the older
boy in the infant, and for that they hold their son that much
closer.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we look at Jonah, we're like `No way this child is ever
leaving our side,' '' says Christine. ``We value every minute we
have with him, because with Omar we thought we had all the time in
the world, but we didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   No time. No gifts, cake or candles. Just a soft outward puff of
air, and then absolutely nothing. Gone like a birthday. &QL;

COSMO `MOST ELIGIBLE' DENIES DRUG-RAPE CHARGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ELLEN O'BRIEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A man who was selected this summer by Cosmopolitan
magazine from hundreds of Massachusetts entries as the state's most
eligible bachelor has been charged with secretly slipping a
homemade concoction to a woman and raping her while she was
unconscious.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan C. Martin, 22, was released Thursday on $20,000 bail after
pleading innocent to the charges, which allegedly took place at his
home.
</P>
<P>
   The woman told police that, when she awoke on the morning of
Aug. 8, she believed she had been unknowingly poisoned the night
before, and possibly sexually assaulted, according to
investigators.
</P>
<P>
   The results of tests conducted by Massachusetts State Police
show that the liquid drug GHB, a ``date-rape'' drug that has become
a national concern on campuses and in nightclubs, was present in
the victim's blood, according to police.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, who lives with his mother in his hometown of Greendale,
said Friday: ``I am innocent, and I want it to end up that way.''
He added that the woman making the allegations against him is
someone he knows ``very well.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said it was his mother who first entered him in the
magazine contest.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, a 22-year-old community college student and aspiring
model who last year managed a city barroom in Worcester, apparently
impressed the magazine staffers with his telephone interview, and
pictures.
</P>
<P>
   Friday the phones at the women's magazine were ringing with
questions about how and why Martin was chosen.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Luthringer, director of public relations for Hearst
Magazines, said candidates for the second annual ``bachelor'' issue
were ``interviewed extensively by a team of editors.''
</P>
<P>
   He declined to comment further on Martin.
</P>
<P>
   Martin's alleged crime occurred one day after tougher
Massachusetts penalties for using date-rape drugs, including the
one suspected in Martin's case, were signed into law.
</P>
<P>
   The drug Martin's victim says he gave her is sometimes called
``Grievous Bodily Harm,'' or Liquid X, on the street. It was sold
during the 80's in health stores as a muscle enhancer, but the US
Food and Drug Administration issued several warnings about the
drug, say health and law enforcement officials.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said that just before the alleged attack the woman
making the allegations and another woman were drinking with Martin
after closing time in Sir Morgan's Cove, the bar where he once
worked.
</P>
<P>
   The Worcester Telegram &AMP; Gazette reported that the women told
police they each drank a green liquid Martin gave them, and became
sleepy afterward. Unable to drive, the women told police they
agreed to go home with Martin until they felt better.
</P>
<P>
   GHB is no longer available in retail stores but a recipe for the
drug exists on the Internet, and it is hailed as a homemade high,
though chemists know it as gamma-hydroxybutyrate, a synthetic
central nervous system depressive.
</P>
<P>
   The effects, say law enforcement professionals, can be
dizziness, confusion, loss of consciounsess and memory.
</P>
<P>
   Those symptoms are much like the ones that are caused by the
better known drug ``Rohypnol,'' which is illegal in the United
States, but has in recent years become an underground phenomenon
and a ``date-rape'' drug.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to reach Martin's attorney Friday were unsuccessful.

WITH 1 BIG EXCEPTION, BOSNIANS VOTE FOR MODERATES 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina _ Election results released by
international officials Friday confirmed the victory of the extreme
nationalist candidate, Nikola Poplasen, as president of the Bosnian
Serb half of this country.
</P>
<P>
   While Poplasen and those who support him are seen by American
and European diplomats as hardline opponents of Western efforts
here, the results in most other races show a trend in favor of
moderate politicians, international officials said.
</P>
<P>
   All three of the major ethnically-based political parties that
once held monolithic power over Bosnia's three ethnic groups saw
their power eroded by voters, the international officials who
conducted the elections said.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time in seven years, since before the war, the
people of Bosnia are not represented almost exclusively by three
dominant political parties, each one of them coming from a single
ethnic group,'' said Zlatko Lagumdzia, president of a moderate
multiethnic party that gained considerably in the election.
</P>
<P>
   But, with the country still divided, and its main political
forces still largely nationalistic, and with ethnic Croatian and
Serbian politicians still heavily influenced by the strongmen of
Croatia and Serbia, much of the political environment here remains
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   Further, in the complicated and often corrupt world of Bosnian
politics where many leaders preach an ideology of fear that helps
keep people divided, how the political forces align themselves and
what deals they reach may have more influence over Bosnia's
immediate future than the choices of the electorate.
</P>
<P>
   The results released Friday have not yet been certified as
official, so the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe, which ran the election, did not announce how many
legislative seats individual parties won. Elections officials said,
however, that it was clear that nationalist parties had gotten far
fewer votes than in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Poplasen's defeat of Biljana Plavsic was seen as a serious
setback for the Western strategy of supporting cooperative and less
nationalistic politicians.
</P>
<P>
   The reelection of Ms. Plavsic had been described by diplomats as
essential. With her defeat, the same diplomats are downplaying her
importance and emphasizing the general trend away from nationalism.
</P>
<P>
   One winner who has been singled out is Zivko Radisic, the
Bosnian Serb member of the three-person national executive, called
the presidency. He is described by some diplomats as a man who
sincerely favors strengthening the Bosnian state, which currently
has the trappings of a government, like offices, a flag and a
currency, but little power. However, his political party is the
Bosnian branch of the one controlled by the Yugoslav president,
Slobodan Milosevic, and it is not clear how much control Milosevic
will exert.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign officials say that nearly all their attempts to give
life to the Bosnian national government were blocked by Radisic's
predecessor, Momcilo Krajisnik. His defeat seems a defeat for the
clique of Bosnian Serb leaders who began the war, since he was the
last of that group to hold an important office.
</P>
<P>
   As a member of the presidency, Radisic could break the deadlock
that has led foreign officials to impose by fiat important measures
that the presidency could not agree on.
</P>
<P>
   Ante Jelavic, leader of Bosnia's branch of Croatia's ruling
nationalist party, was elected as the Croatian member of the
presidency. Some Western diplomats say that though he comes from
the hardline wing of his party, he may have recently changed his
views, though they seem more hopeful than certain.
</P>
<P>
   Other diplomats are less upbeat. A European diplomat said ``the
people who run his party are not interested in a Bosnian government
that works or has power because that is a threat to their financial
interests. Their goal is to keep Croats in ethnically pure enclaves
that they control.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Jelavic won easily, his party, the Croat Democratic
Union, was split shortly before the election, and a moderate
opponent fared well.
</P>
<P>
   The Muslim member of the presidency remains Alija Izetbegovic, a
man thought to generally favor a strong national government. His
Party of Democratic Action suffered losses to more moderate
parties, election officials said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Though the exact distribution of seats in the legislature of the
Bosnian Serb Republic is still not known, officials said it
appeared that the legislature will be controlled by a coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Since the assembly must also approve the person nominated by the
new president for prime minister _ the person who then appoints all
the ministers _whatever coalition emerges will have decisive power
over legislative and executive branches of the government.
</P>
<P>
   The new president, Poplasen, is an avowed opponent of unifying
Bosnia and strengthening the central government, which was the
promise of the Dayton Peace Accords that ended the war in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   But, Poplasen can be blocked if, as some diplomats predict, the
coalition that opposed him and his allies during the election holds
together and joins with legislators elected by Muslims and Croats.
</P>
<P>
   There have already been warnings from the chief foreign official
in charge of implementing the peace accords, Carlos Westendorp,
that he could remove Poplasen, or others, if they follow policies
considered to be at odds with the peace accords.
</P>
<P>
   ``This man, in our view, is on probation and has to prove
himself as a democratic leader,'' said Ambassador Robert Gelbard,
the American special envoy to Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Predicting that foreign powers are willing to go so far as to
abridge Poplasen's freedom of speech, Gelbard said if Poplasen
repeated his calls for the secession of the Bosnian Serb half of
the country, ``The view of the United States would be that it is
grounds for his dismissal.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, however, Western governments have removed only a
few of the many officials blocking implementation of the peace
agreement.

OMINOUS SIGNS SEEN IN FED BAILOUT OF HEDGE FUND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON   
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A dark alley off Wall Street was illuminated by the bailout this
week of a hedge fund, Long-Term Capital Management. But though
hedge funds are mysterious _ even, sometimes, to their investors _
they have become the growth industry of the financial world.
</P>
<P>
   The funds have ballooned to an estimated $175 billion in assets
as sophisticated investors encouraged by success in traditional
markets began hunting down higher-risk ways to invest their ``mad
money.'' Whether buying Russian government bonds or short selling
on stocks, hedge funds often borrowed heavily to make big bets _
they often won.
</P>
<P>
   And the glamorous funds were run by the world's most famous
investors. International financier George Soros of Soros Fund
Management and Julian Robertson Jr. of Tiger Management Corp.
persuaded investors to tote up more than $10 billion for each of
their funds.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Vinik jumped ship at Fidelity Investments, where he managed
the world's biggest mutual fund, Magellan, to start a hedge fund,
amassing more than $1 billion in assets.
</P>
<P>
   But the rescue this week of Long-Term Capital, negotiated under
the eye of the Federal Reserve, raised questions about just how
entwined these mavericks are in the more visible financial world
inhabited by commercial and investment banks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing in the financial system is its own little island,''
said Richard Syron, former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of
Boston who is chairman of the American Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have something that's as sophisticated an operation as
this is that gets into this trouble _ it does show you can have
50-year hurricanes,'' he said. ``That does raise some concern.''
</P>
<P>
   Because these funds are not required to report to federal
regulatory agencies there are no definitive numbers on their size.
</P>
<P>
   What is known is that their growth has exploded.
</P>
<P>
   Assets of the 1,200 hedge funds that report their activities to
Managed Account Reports, a New York newsletter, exceeded $120
billion this year _ double their size two years ago. The total
industry has about $175 billion, according to Lois Peltz, managing
editor _ about the size of one of the money-center banks that lend
to the industry.
</P>
<P>
   And as they have grown, they made spun webs inside the
traditional financial industry.
</P>
<P>
   Witness the Who's Who of firms involved in Long-Term Capital
that agreed to provide additional credit in return for majority
ownership: In New York, there was Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co., Bankers
Trust, Chase, J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co. and Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. In Europe,
there was Barclays of London and Deutsche Bank of Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
   The world's second-biggest bank, UBS, parent company of Union
Bank of Switzerland, which also participated in the bailout
disclosed on the same day that it had taken a $683 million charge
due to losses from investing equity in Long-Term Capital.
</P>
<P>
   UBS' losses follows similar reports in recent months by
international banks that have invested or made loans, often to
hedge funds, in Russia and other emerging markets.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the involvement of these big players, hedge funds are
virtually unregulated.
</P>
<P>
   That was the intention when the funds were set up, in the 1960s.
Investors, seeking to avoid the Securities and Exchange Commission,
which oversees mutual funds, used them as a vehicle for more
free-wheeling investments.
</P>
<P>
   Hedge fund investors were not bound by restrictions on mutual
funds. One restriction they were eager to escape was a ban on
investing with borrowed money. They invested at first in futures or
options as a way to protect, or ``hedge,'' their holdings in
stocks. Over the years, the term hedge fund lost its meaning as
managers began investing in virtually any security.
</P>
<P>
   Hedge funds report their investment activities to the SEC if
they make sizable investments in the stock of corporations, which
are overseen by the SEC.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed watches hedge funds through its regulation of banks,
which must submit detailed reports on their lending activities.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Although the Fed did not fund the bailout of Long-Term
Capital, its involvement in negotiations was striking.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Volcker, the former chairman of the Fed under President
Carter, took issue with it, noting that Long-Term Capital ``is not
a bank.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fed was ``worried about the systemic failure of one hedge
fund,'' Volcker said. In other words, the Fed was being cautious.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, at a time declining markets in Thailand, Indonesia and
Russia have triggered unpredictable declines in Latin America,
anything seems possible.
</P>
<P>
   Fed officials insist that Long-Capital was unsual, due to its
large size.
</P>
<P>
   Although that is probably true, Thomas Theurkauf, bank analyst
for Keefe Bruyette &AMP; Woods, is unsatisified with the lack of
information on hedge funds.
</P>
<P>
   Banks were ``caught flat footed'' by Long-Term Capital's
near-collapse, he said. ``They can't tell you with real precision
what their exposure is to the hedge fund industry. And believe me,
we've asked them.''

LEIBOWITZ-COLUMN (Phoenix) - His birthday passed yesterday. The
brown-haired boy from Arizona would have turned seven. Imagine with
me gifts, games, a cake, seven candles plus one for good luck _ the
celebration that should have been. Instead, the day vanished like
the birthday boy himself, unnoticed, traceless. Like a sip of air
pushed from pursed lips. The leads in his case, the case of Omar
Vargas, evaporate in that same way. By DAVID LEIBOWITZ. Story moved

RED SOX READY TO DEAL WITH VAUGHN'S FREE AGENCY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Once he rejected their contract offer at the All-Star break, the
Red Sox figured that slugger Mo Vaughn was headed to free agency no
matter what. So they weren't surprised when Vaughn said recently
that this indeed is his intention.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what trying to sign him in July was all about,'' says
the Sox' top man, John Harrington. ``We hoped it wouldn't get to
where it is now. But we still want Mo on our club in the future. We
have a plan. When the season is over, we will meet with his people
as soon as we can and make an offer. We expect that no matter what
we offer at that time, they will still go to free agency to see
what other clubs are willing to pay him. Once that happens, we want
an answer soon. As I've said before, we waited for (Roger) Clemens
to make up his mind a couple of years ago, and because we did, we
got shut out on some free agents we were interested in. That won't
happen again. We're sure that when the time comes, agents of other
free agents in the league will be calling us looking for offers,
and we will respond.''

   Is it a true resurgence of baseball, excitment over
McGwire-Sosa, or too much football? Whatever the reason, should the
trend _ if you can call three weeks of viewing a trend _ for the
NFL on television holds, the networks are in big trouble.
</P>
<P>
   In the first week, the NFL was looking good. CBS, back in the
game after winning the AFC rights from NBC, had a 19.9 rating and
Fox an 11.6 for a total of 31.5. The year before, NBC and Fox
combined for a 30.3 in the opening week, so viewership was up 1.2
rating points.
</P>
<P>
   However, the last two weeks have been disastrous. The second
week saw CBS and Fox total 35.2. The year before, the total was
39.6, so the loss was 4.4. Last week the loss from 1997 was 4.8.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, ``Monday Night Football'' has had the worst ratings
start in its history, establishing lows for first-, second-, and
third-week audiences.
</P>
<P>
   Each rating point is worth 980,000 households, and 2.3 people
are figured into a household. That means the NFL viewing audience
was down at least 10 million from a year ago in the second and
third weeks.
</P>
<P>
   There are contractual guarantees between the networks and
sponsors. If the audience doesn't reach a certain level, the
networks will have to provide some free advertising spots before
the year is out.
</P>
<P>

 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Message to Mo: Beware of the rope-a-dope. In 1970, Carl
Yastrzemski of the Sox and Alex Johnson of the California Angels
went down the the final day of the season battling for the batting
title, as Vaughn and the Yankees' Bernie Williams are doing. In the
final game of the 1970 season, Yaz faced Yankees lefthander Fritz
Peterson at Fenway Park. Johnson would play his final game the next
day. Johnson said in advance that no matter what Yaz did, he would
play the entire game. Yaz singled his first time up, then went
hitless the next three trips to finish at .3296. The next night,
Johnson went 2 for 3. His second hit was an infield single in the
fifth, and when he reached first base, he walked off the field. He
had been told before the game that if he went 2 for 3, he would
have a .3298 average, good enough to beat Yaz. So he didn't play
the whole game as promised. Yaz later admitted that the reason he
played the whole game was that he believed Johnson.
</P>
<P>

 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There has been a lot written and said about the great finishing
burst by 26-year-old Yankee rookie Shane Spencer the last two
weeks, but this reporter will take what Ted Williams did in 1957
any day. The 40-year-old Williams had missed 17 days with the flu.
In his first game back, he hit a pinch home run to tie a game
against Kansas City. His next game, against Washington, he walked.
In his third game, still just pinch hitting because he was so weak,
he hit a home run into the upper deck at Yankee Stadium. By the
time he finished, he had reached base in 17 consecutive plate
appearances, still the major league record. During that streak, he
hit four home runs, including a grand slam. In his final 31 trips
to the plate that season, he reached base 25 times, going 12 for
16, a .750 average. He wound up the season hitting .388 even though
he did not have an infield hit the entire year because he couldn't
run anymore.

   When Rick Pitino left Long Island as a teenager to enroll at the
University of Massachusetts, he never dreamed that one day he would
be sitting at a dinner in Boston raising $1 million in a single
night for scholarships at the university in the name of his late
son, Daniel. ``One of the big reasons I chose the University of
Massachusetts was to play with Dr. J (Julius Erving),'' said
Pitino. ``I practiced against him (as a freshman) but never got the
chance to play with him because he left (for the ABA) after his
junior year.'' Still, judging by these remarks he made during an
interview at UMass recently, Pitino had indelible memories of
Erving: ``Everybody would wait in line for miles just to see him
dunk. In those days, you could not dunk during a game. But he would
do it in warmups. He would dunk two basketballs and take off from
the foul line. It was a treat because no one else could do it.''
This was how basketball was transformed into a game played above
the rim. Erving brought the style to the ABA, then to the NBA,
where it is still copied by players today.

   That injury he suffered here with the Patriots last year has
really slowed down Curtis Martin. He is only second in the NFL in
total yardage after three weeks. Barry Sanders is first with 324
rushing and 73 receiving yards, a total of 397. In his first year
with the Jets, Martin lags 6 yards behind (260-131_391), and
Marshall Faulk of the Colts (274-116_390) is next. Imagine what
Martin could do if he were really healthy and not damaged goods, as
Patriot apologists maintained after he left here as a free agent
... You know by the way Boston College dealt with Quinton Lee that
this is a new era under athletic director Gene DeFilippo and coach
Tom O'Brien. Lee, who was arrested in an off-campus incident last
weekend, has been suspended even though he is the second-best
running back on the team. Unless he makes a dramatic turnaround, he
won't be back.

<P>
   Watching the premiums soar on his $100,000 life insurance policy
as he advanced through his 70s, Leonard Oxenberg wondered why he
was still making the payments.
</P>
<P>
   He no longer needed the coverage _ his son was grown, and his
wife had a good job. And there were many other ways that Oxenberg,
a retired advertising executive in Brookline, Mass., would have
liked to be spending the $5,000, soon to be $6,000, that he was
paying in annual premiums.
</P>
<P>
   But he felt stuck: If he just walked away from his term life
policy, he would get nothing _ as happens to many of the 6 million
Americans who drop insurance each year. And after paying premiums
for 15 years, that would be hard to take.
</P>
<P>
   Then Oxenberg found a solution: He could sell his unwanted life
insurance to one of the investment companies that, for years, had
been buying policies from people with AIDS and other terminal
diseases. Searching for fresh markets as new treatments continued
to extend the lives of AIDS patients, the companies have started
offering to buy life insurance of all kinds _ not only term, but
also whole-life and other types with cash value _ from relatively
healthy older people like Oxenberg.
</P>
<P>
   And so in an era when nothing is so alien as delayed
gratification, life insurance _ the ultimate form of delayed
gratification _ is being given a new twist: Now, it pays before
death. And it is not just helping with expenses in a policyholder's
waning days. Life insurance coverage can be turned into a vacation
in Europe, a new round of investments, gifts for the children now
rather than later, or just some extra spending money. The tradeoff
is giving up the big payoff at the end for one's beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   And though some policyholders may be wary of creating an
investment for strangers that pays off only when they die _ and the
sooner the death, the greater the return _ the business has grown
and there have been no scandals involving untimely deaths.
</P>
<P>
   As they have gone mainstream, the half-dozen companies doing the
buying say business is booming. One company, Viaticus Inc., a unit
of CNA Financial Corp., one of the biggest commercial insurers,
says it expects to buy up to $300 million of policies this year, up
from $75 million last year. Eighty percent of the deals, officials
say, will be with relatively healthy people. Another company,
Viaticare Financial Services, founded five years ago in Minneapolis
by four entrepreneurs, says it expects to buy $100 million in
policies, up from $18 million last year. And, it says, 70 percent
of the deals will be with the relatively healthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was an industry in the hundreds of millions of dollars,''
said Stephen Keller, president of yet another of the investment
companies, Kelco Inc., of Lexington, Ky. ``Now it's heading into
the billions.''
</P>
<P>
   Executives of these companies see the new deals as a shot in the
arm for the struggling life insurance business. If people know they
can change their minds and still get a good chunk of money back
when they no longer want their coverage, the reasoning goes, they
may be less reluctant to buy a policy in the first place. And some
of those who have cashed in their policies have already begun to
buy other things from life insurance companies, like long-term
health care policies, annuities and mutual funds. But the life
insurance industry, famously cautious, is not so sure. The big
companies, and little ones, too, distrust anything that alters the
hoary process of delivering death benefits to heirs. For one thing,
they worry that something could go terribly wrong with the largely
unregulated Johnny-come-lately investment companies, giving
insurers yet another black eye even as some companies are still
paying hundreds of millions of dollars to settle claims that agents
repeatedly misled customers with promises of unattainable returns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether this idea is so great remains to be seen,'' said Mel
Feinberg, a vice president at New York Life Insurance Co.. ``This
whole new industry may not be around in 20 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, some actuaries say the new approach could wind up
costing the insurance companies money. The insurers set premiums on
the expectation that a certain number of policies will be abandoned
and that no death benefits will have to be paid. If the investment
companies begin intervening widely, buying up and maintaining the
premiums on many policies, the insurance companies will end up
paying out more, said Tom Foley, an actuary who heads the life and
health division of the North Dakota Department of Insurance. Their
likely response, he said, would be to raise premiums _ and that, in
turn, could accelerate the long, downward slide in sales.
</P>
<P>
   For the investment companies, profits depend on the ability to
handicap death. They buy policies for something less than the face
value of the insurance and take over paying the premiums. Their
profit is the difference between what they pay out and the death
benefit, which goes to them when the insured person dies. They
shoot for profits of 12 percent to 14 percent, basing the purchase
price on life expectancy and the premiums due. The sooner a person
is likely to die and the lower the premiums, the more the seller is
likely to be paid for the policy. Anyone who lives beyond his
estimated time of death begins to cut into the profits of the
buyer.
</P>
<P>
   The purchase prices can vary greatly. For a $100,000 policy, for
example, a terminally ill person with a life expectancy of six
months could receive $80,000. But people in their 60s and 70s with,
say, 10 to 12 years to live, by actuarial estimates, could receive
much less _ perhaps $5,000 to $20,000. For a $100,000 policy, that
might not seem like much; Oxenberg got $16,500. But the investors
are especially looking for policies worth millions, and 20 percent
of the bigger policies begins to look like serious money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Half of these policies that we've bought have had face values
of more than a million dollars _ some have been over $5 million _
and we've paid many people hundreds of thousands of dollars,'' said
Gary Chodes, the president of Viaticus, which is based in Chicago.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Striving to prevent middlemen from coming between them and their
customers, dozens of insurers have begun making their own deals
with the terminally ill in the last few years, offering a so-called
accelerated death benefit. The insurer pays 90 percent or more of a
policy's value _ 10 percent to 20 percent more than investors
usually offer _ if a physician certifies that the policyholder has
only a short time to live.
</P>

   Viaticus is the only player owned by a major insurer; CNA itself
is a subsidiary of Loews Corp. The other companies are mainly
entrepreneurial ventures that operate by borrowing capital, buying
policies and reselling some of them to individual investors. The
companies act as brokers, taking a fee and passing on all or most
of the risk _ the bet on when the person will die _ to the
investors, along with the responsibility for paying premiums.
</P>
<P>
   An investor may buy a whole policy or a share in a policy or in
a pool of policies. One company, Affirmative Lifestyles Inc. of San
Antonio, says it is negotiating with a dozen institutional
investors, including university endowment funds and corporate
pension plans, to take shares of at least $10 million in a $200
million pool. Until now, though, institutional investors have
remained on the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the 40 or so investment organizations that have been
buying policies from the terminally ill have yet to begin dealing
with healthy older people. One reason, said Paul J. Moe, the chief
executive of Viaticare Financial Services in Minneapolis, is that
they do not want to tie up their money for long periods, as they
would need to do in dealing with healthier policyholders. Another,
he said, is that they lack the capital to take on the larger
policies that are being offered by older people, often in the
hundreds of thousands of dollars, if not millions. The original
deals with the terminally ill, which were known as viatical
settlements (from the Latin word ``viaticum,'' for the money and
supplies furnished to Roman officials embarking on official
journeys) were criticized as ghoulishly preying on desperate people
who were willing to trade away the full value of their life
insurance to get money for their final days. Now some critics talk
of graver concerns. With the stakes rising as investors await the
death of relatively healthy people insured for millions, insurers
and other critics say, homicide becomes more than a remote
possibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be very easy to do,'' said David D'Alessandro, the
president and chief operations officer of John Hancock Insurance
Co.of America. ``If you bought 12 policies issued by different
insurance companies, there could be a series of car accidents that
would be very hard to trace back, one guy killed in Seattle,
another in Florida.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the investment companies say they use codes to keep the
identities of insured people secret from investors _ trying, as one
broker put it, to guard against a visit ``from some guy in North
Jersey with a violin case.'' But complete anonymity is impossible.
In calculating payouts, the investment companies analyze medical
and family histories, and part of the sales contract requires the
insured person, his doctor, his lawyer or a relative to check in
periodically with the investment company. Someone, usually the
seller's doctor or a relative, also must agree to notify the
investment company of the insured person's death.
</P>
<P>
   While none of the generally healthy people have yet complained,
a few terminally ill patients say they have been harassed by
investors asking, as one person with AIDS put it, ``Are you still
alive?''

SHUTTING DOWN THE WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, September 27, 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With a little luck, the near-collapse of an important hedge fund
will not matter very much _ another Black Monday, another nasty
surprise. The monetary and currency instruments available to
Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan and Treasury Secretary
Robert Rubin are such that the slow-motion panic of the last six
weeks may turn out to be like the 1987 crash _ a spectacular
financial event with no recession.
</P>
<P>
   The bailout of Long-Term Capital Management L.P. is simply the
latest variation on an old story: unexpected problems arise from a
new and imperfectly understood financial technology. In this case,
a pioneering hedge fund pursued arbitrage strategies whose
aggregate risk was not well-monitored, not even understood, as was
the case in 1987 (remember portfolio insurance?). That it was an
investment pool organized for the super-rich added charm.
</P>
<P>
   The witty Lex Column of the Financial Times described the
problem this way on Friday: ``In essence, LTCM was was functioning
as a huge reinsurance company for Wall Street, taking on the risk
the big banks wanted to lay off.
</P>
<P>
   ``That these same banks were simultaneously lending it the money
to do so defied logic. And now that the emerging markets hurricane
has blown LTCM over, they were left with little choice but to bail
it out.''
</P>
<P>
   And so the cracks in markets that appeared last week signaled
that the effects of the crisis that began last year in Asia at last
had reached New York. But they also clearly marked the edge of the
precipice to which the campaign to unseat the US president has
contributed.
</P>
<P>
   The same gang that three years ago shut down the US government _
the Republican majority in Congress _ is now threatening to shut
down the world economy.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the basic connection between the on-going financial
crisis and the continuing attempt to overthrow the government by
means of the independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   The history of the crisis was laid out in a fine four-part
series last week in The Wall Street Journal. Among the many salient
details, however, there was one startling omission.
</P>
<P>
   The series started started with an account of the events of the
last five weeks leading up to last week's bailout _ the flight to
quality that ensued in the wake of Russia's default on part of its
debt on Aug. 17. ``Russia was the match but the markets were ripe
for dislocation,'' noted one participant.
</P>
<P>
   The series then turned to the seven-year history of Russia's
attempts to decentralize its planned economy in a search for what
went wrong. Whatever its missteps, the Russian economy was poised
for recovery at recently as December 1997. Then a series of
political blunders, miscalculations, and accidents began,
culminating in the decision on the weekend of Aug. 15 to let the
ruble fall and default on some debt _ in effect, to give up on its
attempt to join the world economy.
</P>
<P>
   The third part of the series described attempts by the Clinton
administration to contain the Asian crisis, beginning with the
devaluation of the Thai baht in July last year. A parallel attempt
by the International Monetary Fund was traced: $17 billion for
Thailand, $42 billion for Indonesia, $58 billion for South Korea,
$23 billion for Russia _ until the cash ran out.
</P>
<P>
   A fourth article described various plans to deal with the
situation now, with Brazil last week having entered into talks with
the IMF about a possible rescue.
</P>
<P>
   The startling omission in all this, of course, is the lack of
any mention of the political situation as it has developed in
parallel in Washington. It was in January 1998 _ just after Boris
Yeltsin's government was faced down by a pair of the tycoons known
as ``oligarchs'' in an incident that began its tailspin _ that the
matter of Monica Lewinsky surfaced for the first time. And Aug. 17,
the day the match was lit, was also the date that Bill Clinton
testified to the grand jury convened by Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   News of the disastrous Russian default was completely
overshadowed. A six-column, two-line headline proclaimed Clinton's
confession across the top of The New York Times. ``Russia Acts to
Fix Sinking Finances'' noted a one-column headline barely above the
fold.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that House Republicans were refusing to vote the
emergency $18 billion assessment to the IMF that the Senate already
had appropriated didn't make the paper for the next two weeks. Such
is the power of obsession.
</P>
<P>
   The current confrontation with Congress has its roots in Mexican
peso crisis. When the freshly &UR;  &LR; elected Republican majority declined
to meet the administration's request for emergency aid, the
Treasury Department spent some of its own reserves, with the result
that the crisis was averted.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican loans have long since been paid back, but
conservative Republicans, led by House majority leader Dick Armey
(R-Texas), have been angry ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Even without additional US funding to prevent the spread of the
crisis to Latin America, the US and European economies probably
will escape recession _ for now. But the monetary easing that is
expected this week will, in all likelihood, be reversed next year _
just the pattern that followed the 1987 crash.
</P>
<P>
   Will the Clinton administration be free to pursue its policies
with relatively undivided attention then? Or will the congressional
leadership of the Republican Party still be doing its best to hound
Bill Clinton from office, and never mind the risk of throwing the
global economy into a stall?

 UNDATED: still alive?''

<P>
   Still, the business is growing rapidly. Scores of insurance
agents and financial planners have begun looking for people who
want to sell their policies, and many have also been recruiting
people with as little as $10,000 to invest, sometimes using
newspaper ads that promise returns of up to 60 percent. Last year,
the investment companies bought $600 million worth of insurance
policies from terminally ill patients, about half of them with
AIDS, according to the Viatical Association of America, a trade
group in Washington. Judging from the reports of the companies
leading the new trend, the volume this year is likely to exceed $1
billion, with the growth coming among deals to buy policies from
the healthy elderly.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent deal in the expanded market, Bill Senno, owner of
First Financial Resources, an estate planning company in
Moorestown, N.J., arranged for the sale of the $500,000 policy of a
72-year-old chemical company executive who had suffered a heart
attack 15 years earlier but had no apparent disabilities. The
investment company's actuaries gave him eight years to live and,
partly because his premiums were relatively low ($9,000 a year), he
was paid $210,000. The executive is buying a long-term health care
policy with some of the money and investing in mutual funds and a
fixed annuity.
</P>
<P>
   Senno got $1.2 million for the sale of a wealthy farmer's $3
million policy that had a cash value of $72,000 and annual premiums
of $100,000. The farmer, 67, had been diagnosed with leukemia and
was given six years to live.
</P>
<P>
   Carole Fiedler, who owns a financial company in Sausalito,
Calif., that specializes in helping people sell their policies,
arranged for the sale of Oxenberg's $100,000 policy. She also
brokered the sale of a $4 million policy for a lawyer who was in
his mid-70s and in excellent health. He received $235,000, or just
under 6 percent, for a term policy with no cash value; as part of
the deal, the investors took over his premium payments of $80,000.
Another of her clients, William G. Blackman, a retired insurance
administrator who is an 80-year-old widower in Palo Alto, Calif.,
got $20,000 for a $100,000 policy that cost him $6,000 in premiums
last year.
</P>
<P>
   While the trading in life insurance policies has attracted the
attention of federal and state regulators, only about 20 states
have laws specifically dealing with it, and those rules are limited
to transactions with the terminally ill. The laws provide minimum
payment standards intended to prevent terminally ill people from
being pressured to accept unfairly low prices for policies when
they are desperate for cash. But there are no licensing
requirements or regulations for the deals with generally healthy
people. Nor are there any formal protections for investors. Federal
and state regulators argue that many of the transactions,
particularly those in which shares in a policy are sold, are
covered by securities laws. But in a case that was argued over
several years, a federal appeals court ruled last year against the
regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Many investment company executives say the less regulation, the
better. But Moe, of Viaticare, says comprehensive regulation would
enhance the industry's credibility.
</P>
<P>
   With no regulations to worry about, investment companies can
disclose what they like and offer any price they like to the
relatively healthy. Ms. Fiedler tells of a 74-year-old Texas
businessman who was eager to get out from under the $77,000 annual
premiums on his $3.8 million term-life policy. One company offered
him $10,000. He went to Ms. Fiedler for a second bid and ended up
selling the policy for $257,000.
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, dozens of investors have complained of being
misled. The recurring theme, said Denise Voigt Crawford, the Texas
securities commissioner and president of the North American
Securities Administrators Association, is that investors were told
that the people covered by the policies they bought would die in a
year or two. But often, she said, because of new drug treatments
for AIDS, the insured people were still living three or four years
later. Even though the jurisdiction is not clear, Ms. Crawford and
securities commissioners in several states are investigating these
complaints. Since August, a task force of the securities
administrators association has been looking into the investments.
</P>
<P>
   For Oxenberg, who considers himself ``halfway healthy'' even
though he is a smoker who suffers from high blood pressure and has
to watch his cholesterol, shedding his annual premiums was almost
as important as the $16,500 he received from the investors. If he
had kept paying, he said, it would not have been long before he had
put in close to what his wife eventually would have received from
the policy at his death. She is 20 years younger than him.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I thought my wife would be destitute, we would find a way
to keep paying,'' he said. ``But she's not concerned. And let's
face it, I was doing this for her.''
</P>
<P>
   They agreed, Oxenberg said, that they would rather have more
spending money. ``Why have the outflow?'' he asked. ``We're at that
stage where we travel a lot. We like to enjoy ourselves.''

 (af)  
 By MICHELLE KREBS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Oldsmobile is the nation's longest-running auto maker and
General Motors' oldest division, but for a decade it has been
struggling to remake itself and remain relevant to consumers who
don't put much stock in history.
</P>
<P>
   For four consecutive years _ 1983 through 1986 _ it tallied
sales of more than a million cars a year. But sales slid in the
late 80s and 90s, totaling a mere 304,759 cars and trucks in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The drop has prompted many industry observers to speculate about
_ and even advocate _ the elimination of the division. Instead,
Olds is trying to reinvent itself as the GM division that competes
with imports.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1992, Oldsmobile has fully revamped its product line.
Gone, or on the way out, are some venerable names. The Cutlass
Supreme, the backbone of Olds in the 1970s and 80s, is no more; the
latest Cutlass goes out of production next summer. The Ninety
Eight, Oldsmobile's longtime flagship, was dropped, too. And the
last Eighty Eight will be built on Dec. 23.
</P>
<P>
   New nameplates have replaced the old, starting with the Aurora
in 1995. A luxury mini-van, the Silhouette, and a cushy sport
utility, the Bravada, have also joined the line.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Oldsmobile introduced the midsize Intrigue, which
critics have praised and customers have embraced, to battle the
Honda Accord and the Toyota Camry.
</P>
<P>
   Now Oldsmobile is adding the final _ and in volume, the most
important _ piece to its new lineup. The entry-level Alero, a
compact sedan and coupe just hitting the market, is expected to
generate up to 150,000 sales a year, about half of Oldsmobile's
current volume.
</P>
<P>
   To perform that well, it has to offer consumers compelling
reasons to turn their backs on the Accord, Camry and Nissan Altima,
as well as competitors from Ford and Chrysler, in a segment where
sales dropped nearly 14 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   It's a tall order for this small car. After test-driving two
versions of the Alero, I found many pluses, but I wondered if the
new, unknown nameplate had enough to take on the world's
heavyweights.
</P>
<P>
   The Alero went on sale last spring, but its production was
interrupted by the 54-day strike by the United Automobile Workers
at two parts plants that shut down almost all of GM's North
American assembly. Those plants now are up to full speed.
</P>
<P>
   Because of its significance, the Alero is being introduced with
fanfare. Its ad campaign, a first effort by Oldsmobile's new
creative team, is estimated at $80 million.
</P>
<P>
   Theoretically, the Alero replaces the Achieva, a sales
underachiever, in the compact segment. More directly, it will fill
in for the short-lived Cutlass.
</P>
<P>
   The Alero is sold as a coupe or a sedan, each with three trim
levels: the entry-level GX, the midrange GL and the top-of-the-line
GLS. A four-cylinder base engine and an optional V6 are available.
</P>
<P>
   Competitors for the coupe include the Chrysler Sebring, the
Dodge Avenger, the Mitsubishi Eclipse and the Accord. The sedan
aims at shoppers who might otherwise consider the Chrysler Cirrus,
the Ford Contour, the Altima or the Accord.
</P>
<P>
   The Alero's basic body structure is shared with the Pontiac
Grand Am and is substantially more rigid than the one it replaces.
The styling, however, is intended to be much more understated than
the Grand Am's in-your-face, boy-racer look.
</P>
<P>
   My first test Alero was a bright-red V6 coupe, more in the
Pontiac vein. The second car, a four-cylinder GL sedan of the ilk
expected to eventually account for most Alero sales, was jade
green, appropriately understated and elegant. The low-slung nose,
narrow cat's-eye headlamps and the hood emblem _ a circle slashed
with the diagonal, stylized Oldsmobile rocket _ mimic the larger,
more expensive Aurora. Only the oversize tail lights detract from
the sleekness.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, the five-passenger Alero's tasteful and attractive cabin
reminded me of the larger Intrigue. The beige-and-taupe materials,
including the plastic, appeared to be high quality. The round dials
with simple markings were easy on the eyes.
</P>
<P>
   The front-drive Alero is available with the base 2.4-liter
four-cylinder engine at 150 horsepower or the very quiet 3.4-liter
V6 at 170 horsepower. Unlike many of its competitors, the Alero
comes only with a four-speed automatic transmission; a five-speed
manual is planned for 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The GL was equipped with a smaller engine, but it was peppy
enough. I had no problem in passing maneuvers, nor was I left in
the dust at stoplights. The engine, typical of GM's small
dual-overhead-cam type, was extremely loud under hard acceleration.
It quieted down at cruising speeds.
</P>
<P>
   The extra money that Oldsmobile pumped into the Alero's
relatively sophisticated suspension system, which has a number of
aluminum components for light weight and agile handling, was well
spent. Indeed, the suspension and the significantly more rigid body
structure provided fun-to-drive handling as well as a smooth,
comfortable ride. The body had a noticeably solid and tight feel,
without eliminating the feel of the road.
</P>
<P>
   Braking was extremely firm. The Alero comes with standard
four-wheel disk brakes with an anti-lock system and all-speed
traction control. Other standard features include air-conditioning,
tinted glass that cuts solar heating, a door-mounted trunk-release
button and two power outlets for items like cellular phones.
</P>
<P>
   Safety features include daytime running lights and dual front
air bags. The car does not offer side air bags nor is there a
three-point seat belt for the center passenger in the rear seat.
</P>
<P>
   Quality control was difficult to gauge. Both cars were
preproduction models. The fit of some body panels and interior
components was slightly off, but that is likely to be fixed in
production. An on-again, off-again rattle came from the instrument
panel or steering column _ I couldn't detect which _ a problem
that's common in recent GM products.
</P>
<P>
   The Alero represents a fairly good deal in the compact segment.
Base prices, with destination fees, start below $17,000. The tested
GL sedan, with power, leather-covered seats, remote keyless entry
and a cassette/CD player, came in just shy of $21,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Alero's attractive price, elegant styling and fun-to-drive
nature should go a long way toward helping Oldsmobile achieve its
lofty sales objective, and, with the Intrigue, set Oldsmobile on a
more promising course for its second hundred years. &QL;

JUDGE SENTENCES EX-CIA SPY TO FIVE YEARS IN PRISON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EDWARD FITZPATRICK  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Douglas F. Groat, a zealous former police officer
who went on to join a supersecret unit within the CIA, was
sentenced to five years in prison Friday by a judge who described
him as a disgruntled ex-employee who tried to blackmail the
intelligence agency.
</P>
<P>
   But Groat was not trying to sell out his country. ``I don't
think you really had any intention of harming our national
security,'' Judge Thomas F. Hogan told Groat in U.S. District
Court. ``You were trying to resolve what you felt was unfair
personnel treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   But in doing so, Groat ``went off the deep end,'' Hogan said.
``You just couldn't get it out of your mind,'' he said. ``You made
threats and tried to carry them out, to some extent. You took steps
that went too far.''
</P>
<P>
   Groat, 51, pleaded guilty in July to attempted extortion,
admitting he demanded $1 million from the CIA in exchange for not
hindering U.S. spying efforts by selling his services to foreign
governments.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Groat was arrested on four charges of espionage, which
could have resulted in the death penalty. Groat was accused of
telling two unidentified nations they were under U.S. electronic
surveillance.
</P>
<P>
   Federal authorities dropped the espionage charges as part of a
plea bargain, saying they wanted to avoid a trial that might have
disclosed national security secrets and wanted to quickly find out
exactly what Groat had done.
</P>
<P>
   Hogan accepted the plea agreement Friday, recommending Groat be
sent to a minimum-security prison for the five-year sentence, to be
followed by three years' supervised release.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are pleased justice has been served in this case,'' CIA
spokesman Mark Mansfield said afterward.
</P>
<P>
   After the sentencing, the judge said he knew of no harm that
Groat had done to national security. ``I don't think this was a
case where he was a spy,'' Hogan said. ``He did not get into
espionage for money or to be a traitor to his country.''
</P>
<P>
   According to prosecutors, Groat demanded eight lump-sum
payments, totaling $1 million, in exchange for not becoming a
communications-security consultant for other nations. In March and
April 1997, Groat made initial contact with several unnamed foreign
governments, and on July 18, 1997, Groat wrote to the CIA, offering
to ``suspend any and all actions that may interfere with agency
intelligence activities'' if he received the $1 million,
prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   Groat, a native of Glenville, N.Y., joined his hometown police
force in 1973 after a stint in the Army Green Berets. His police
career, however, didn't last long and he was fired in 1977 on
allegations of misconduct and insubordination. Colleagues and
supervisors considered him an overzealous officer who didn't fit in
the small force.
</P>
<P>
   His firing was overturned by a court, but Groat went on to the
U.S. Marshals Service and then the CIA, where he would join a
special unit that broke into foreign embassies to steal code books.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At Friday's sentencing, Groat submitted a defiant three-page,
hand-written statement to the court. In it, Groat, who broke into
foreign embassies to steal codes as part of a CIA ``black-bag''
team, traced his troubles with the agency back to a botched mission
and described himself as a whistleblower.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stand before you today because 8 1/2 years ago I cared too
much about my CIA mission and teammates,'' he wrote in an opening
paragraph, which was partly blacked out by the government before
the letter became public. ``I reported serious flaws ... that could
have gotten my teammates and me captured. ... Rather than learn
from the errors, the responsible manager lashed out at me and
threatened to end my career.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter described his attempts to salvage retirement payments
after the CIA fired him in 1996 for not taking a polygraph test and
allegedly taking home classified material.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my efforts to save first my career, then later my CIA
retirement, I have made many mistakes, many errors in judgment,''
Groat wrote. ``My methods have at times been unconventional. I
admit I put pressure on the government to resolve our dispute and
have used some of their own tactics against them.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Groat wrote, he has ``paid dearly'' for fighting for what
he considered unfair treatment. ``I have been punished with eight
years of persecution, the loss of my career, my job, back pay and a
CIA retirement, plus six months of solitary confinement under
harsher conditions than someone serving a life sentence under
lock-down.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Groat will be eligible for a pension, totalling about
$30,000 a year, when he turns 62, under the plea agreement. The
government is still not saying where Groat is being held and it is
expected to take about a month for the U.S. Bureau of Prisons to
decide where he will go next.
</P>
<P>
   Groat's attorney, federal public defender Robert Tucker, urged a
minimum-security prison, citing Groat's service in the Army, CIA
and Marshals Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some ways, he lost a little judgment,'' but Groat poses no
security problem, he said. ``He wants to get on with his life. He
wants to put this behind him.''

SOME SEE POSITIVE SIGNS IN LATIN AMERICAN TURMOIL 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By CLIFFORD KRAUSS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina _ With increasing signs that world
lenders are preparing to rescue Brazil from a potential financial
meltdown, Wall Street analysts say that outflows of capital are
slowing from stock markets from Mexico City to Buenos Aires.
</P>
<P>
   They caution that the region's economies and markets may not
have reached bottom yet. Corporate profits throughout Latin America
are falling, a devaluation in Venezuela may be looming and a
financial collapse in Brazil is less likely but still possible.
</P>
<P>
   Latin American mutual funds have already lost $851 million, or
63 percent, of their asset value this year. Nevertheless, some say
they believe they are beginning to see the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   ``The panic selling has subsided,'' said James Upton, Latin
American equity strategist for Credit Suisse First Boston, who
cautioned that he expected continued volatility.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's still a lot of risk out there,'' said Eduardo Cabrera,
Merrill Lynch's chief Latin America equity strategist, noting the
region's continued vulnerability. ``The global situation is still
turbulent, but you have big brother finally stepping up.''
</P>
<P>
   The beginnings of cautious optimism are based partly on the view
that the governments of Mexico, Argentina and Peru have responded
smartly to protect their currencies with timely rises in interest
rates and that several of the region's largest countries are likely
to have positive growth rates next year.
</P>
<P>
   The optimists note that Chile, a traditional leader in regional
economic policy-making, last week lifted a key capital control
costly to foreign investors in another sign that Latin America
would not veer from free-market policies adopted over the last
decade.
</P>
<P>
   But more than anything else, the more positive view tentatively
emerging is based on expectations that the International Monetary
Fund and other lenders will come to Brazil's rescue with an aid
package that could exceed $50 billion and that the U.S. Federal
Reserve Board will soon lower interest rates to help the U.S. and
world economies.
</P>
<P>
   A loosening of U.S. monetary policy, the analysts hope, should
indirectly raise the prices of several of Latin America's lagging
exports such as oil, copper, paper and steel.
</P>
<P>
   However all bets are off, Wall Street analysts say, if Brazil's
president, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, does not win re-election as
expected on Oct. 4. They also say he must fulfill his recent
promises of an aggressive program to slash government spending and
to raise taxes to relieve the burden of a fiscal deficit that
represents 7 percent of gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
   With a population of 160 million and 30 percent of Latin
America's total economy, anything that happens in Brazil
reverberates through the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brazil was at the brink of a devaluation a few weeks ago, and
that meant that all emerging markets were on the brink,'' said
Jorge Mariscal, chief Latin American investment strategist at
Goldman, Sachs. ``But now all the things the markets were clamoring
for seem to be happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Capital is still leaving Latin American stock markets, but
analysts say the flow is slowing. In the week ended Wednesday,
Latin American mutual funds suffered an outflow of $15.6 million,
slightly better than the average of $18.3 million a week over the
last month. James Barrineau, Latin American equity strategist at
Salomon Smith Barney, said the slight improvement came because
``we've started getting hints of an aid package for Brazil.''
</P>
<P>
   Fears of financial collapse precipitated by Russia's devaluation
and debt moratorium, followed by expectations that Brazil would
avert that fate with an international bailout, have driven Brazil's
stock market on a wild ride in the last two months.
</P>
<P>
   Between late July and early this month, the market fell by more
than 50 percent, only to recover most of its losses in recent days.
Then it stumbled again Thursday and Friday for other reasons,
mainly the prospects of the collapse of a U.S. hedge fund.
</P>
<P>
   The Bovespa closed Friday at 6,711.52, down 132.83 for the day
and more than 34 percent for the year. Mariscal and several other
analysts said they expected a recession as a result of a recent
doubling of interest rates that will depress corporate profits next
year.
</P>
<P>
   But while Wall Street analysts do not expect a sustained rally
in Brazilian stocks, they say that as long as Brazil does not
devalue, they like the economic prospects for much of the rest of
the region, particularly Argentina, Mexico and Chile. Wall Street
analysts say continued drops in the stock markets in all three
countries should be buffered by the ready pools of cash available
from their private pension-fund systems.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A rise in Argentine interest rates in recent months to defend
the peso has depressed auto production and construction, and is
drying up consumer and mortgage credit. Jane Heap, Latin America
strategist for Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, has lowered her estimates
for Argentina's economic growth rate from 6 percent to 4 percent
this year, and from 4.5 percent to 3 percent in 1999. But she
expresses hopeful optimism.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly is not a recession,'' Ms. Heap said. ``What is
most important about Argentina is that there is no way the peso's
peg to the dollar will break even in the worst-case scenario.''
</P>
<P>
   With Argentine stocks beaten down by more than 40 percent this
year, and several Argentine companies beginning to aggressively buy
back their own shares, several analysts said they saw the potential
for higher stock prices. They cautioned, though, that any
investments in emerging markets were risky at this point. Analysts
also said the Mexican economy should grow modestly next year,
despite high interest rates, even if oil prices do not rise much.
</P>
<P>
   Barrineau forecast a 10 percent drop in Mexican corporate
profits this year compared with a 4 percent drop in corporate
profits in Latin America as a whole. ``However, next year, if
Brazil does not devalue, 10 percent corporate earnings growth in
Mexico is doable,'' he said.

DEMOCRATS SEE POLITICAL AND FINANCIAL REWARDS IN REPUBLICAN
ATTACKS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Colo.)  (js) 
 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After months of enduring withering attacks for
President Clinton's relationship with a White House intern,
Democrats are turning the Republican zeal to punish him into a
rallying cry.
</P>
<P>
   Party leaders contend that a growing backlash against
Republicans eager to embarrass Clinton and punish him with
impeachment is helping energize supporters, displace apathy and
raise money. And on Friday, a co-chairman of the Democratic
National Committee said the scandal has become so good for the
party that it could help hold to a minimum any Democratic losses in
House and Senate elections this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're much stronger than we would have been,'' said a
committee co-chairman, Steven Grossman. ``Good times create
complacency and apathy, which are the enemies of our party. When
things are good, people tend to stay home. Sometimes you need a
crisis, an existential crisis, to motivate you.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican Party officials, meanwhile, have said that the
scandal has also pumped up their efforts, especially in fund
raising. They say disgust with Clinton's behavior has helped
increase fund raising to levels well beyond what the party would
normally see at this point in a year with midterm elections.
</P>
<P>
   Grossman and other Democratic Party officials appeared at a
briefing for reporters Friday to discuss what they viewed as
positive developments arising out of Clinton's admission that he
had an adulterous relationship and the Republican efforts to
impeach him.
</P>
<P>
   Around the country, they noted, polling data suggest that
Democrats are fuming over efforts by Republicans. Day after day,
Democrats have worked to capitalize on this by criticizing
Republicans for ignoring issues Democrats claim are far more
important to most Americans, like the administration-led
initiatives on education, health care and social security.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Roy Romer of Colorado, the other Democratic co-chairman,
said party leaders have been especially heartened by recent polls
that show Clinton's popularity has been rising since Monday, when
the videotape of his Aug. 17 grand jury testimony was shown to the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   He said Clinton's improving stature has resulted from a backlash
against Republican tactics, which he described as ``the gross
overreaching on the part of a conservative Republican-led party,''
and the ability of the public to ``cut through the fog and smoke''
of their strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Democrats,'' he said, ``have the high ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Grossman said the polls reflect the country's ``revulsion
against the politics of polarization to the extent Democrats
recognize that the stakes could not be higher'' in the fall
elections.
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time, he conceded that the scandal, with all its
smarmy details and the Republicans' campaign for impeachment, is
playing a major role in the re-awakening of Democratic voters,
shaking many of them out of an apathy that usually beclouds them in
midterm elections. If that works to improve turnout, which for
midterm elections is generally one-third of registered voters, then
Democrats could fare better than expected, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Gersh of the National Committee for an Effective Congress,
a Democratic organization, said a close analysis of congressional
races has convinced him that neither party would lose more than
five seats.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts have predicted that because of the scandal,
Republicans could improve their majority in the House by as many as
two dozen seats and their majority in the Senate by as many as
seven seats.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``I'm not here to tell you Democrats will win the House or even
pick up seats,'' Gersh said. ``But there's no evidence of major
erosion of Democratic support in marginal districts.''
</P>
<P>
   Grossman said that one of the marketing tools producing evidence
of a renewed energy among Democratic voters is a three-page mailing
signed by Hillary Rodham Clinton that reached Democratic donors
four days ago.
</P>
<P>
   He said the letter, in which Mrs. Clinton seeks support on
behalf of children as ``our nation's most vulnerable citizens'' and
invites written responses, exceeded a fund-raising goal that
generally takes months to meet.
</P>
<P>
   Grossman declined to say how many letters were distributed, how
much money was raised or the target amount. But he acknowledged
that the mailing drew ``thousands of letters'' of response.
</P>
<P>
   ``What people are responding to,'' he said, ``is venality and
mean-spiritedness and a total absence of fairness. It has energized
our base.''

THE AMERICANIZATION OF A GERMAN POLITICIAN  
 (EMBARGOED FOR SUNDAY, SEPT. 27) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY KAMMER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLOGNE, Germany - It was a scene that could have been scripted
in Hollywood: A handsome candidate radiating self-confidence moves
regally through an adoring crowd. The packed arena swells with
triumphant music as he ascends the stage and waves his arms in a
victorious semaphore.
</P>
<P>
   The candidate is Gerhard Schroeder, whose campaign for
chancellor has introduced a distinctly American flavor to a country
where voters long have based their votes more on a party platform
than an individual candidate. And many Germans have found the new
style of campaigning disagreeable in the run-up to today's federal
election, as the telegenic but ambiguous Schroeder tries to unseat
the uncharismatic but steady Helmut Kohl, who has led Germany for
16 years.
</P>
<P>
   Political observers call the new style Schroeder's
``Americanization'' of the campaign. It is an uncomplimentary term
that denotes slickness and superficiality, an emphasis on
personality instead of political substance, on warm and fuzzy
feeling instead of sober-minded discussion. It has helped to
establish the English word ``show'' _ in a language that has
already adopted ``spin doctor'' and ``TV spot'' and ``PR'' _ in the
German vocabulary.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder, dynamic and telegenic at 54, is being marketed as a
movie star who is ready to breathe new life into an office now
occupied by a tired old man of 68. Schroeder dismisses Kohl as
``used up,'' and ``unfit for the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Kohl counters that Schroeder, with his Italian suits and Cuban
cigars, is a show horse for the Social Democratic Party. On
campaign posters in hundreds of towns across this Montana-size
country, he warns his 80 million countrymen that they should allow
``no experiments.'' He says the party's left-leaning leadership
will discard Schroeder's pragmatic rhetoric about a new center as
soon as he is safely in office and it has control of the Bundestag,
as the parliament is known.
</P>
<P>
   But while Kohl dismisses Schroeder as superficial and
opportunistic, Schroeder has emerged as the narrow favorite. His
Clintonesque efforts to forge ``a new center'' may succeed, despite
the Kohl camp's criticism that he stands for nothing and promises
something to everybody. One of Kohl's lieutenants offered an
ironically ``Americanized'' critique, calling Schroeder ``the
Richard Kimball of German politics, always a fugitive from his own
comments.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kohl has refused to be drawn into an American-style
televised debate with Schroeder, who is far more comfortable with
television. That prompted Schroeder, in their one televised joint
appearance in the Bundestag, to taunt, ``You say you can't pin me
down. Well, pin me down, then.''
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder's style isn't the only feature of this campaign that
Americans would find familiar. Once the debate moves beyond the
alleged superficiality of Americanization, it enters the deadly
earnest territory of globalization.
</P>
<P>
   Germany has lost tens of thousands of jobs to countries such as
Poland and the Czech Republic, where labor costs are less than
one-fifth of the $30 per hour that is common here. The collapse of
the Soviet Bloc that opened the East to German industry produced a
punishing side effect that had to do with the military
de-Americanization of Germany.
</P>
<P>
   As U.S. forces here have been reduced from the 340,000 troop
level of the 1980s, thousands of jobs on bases have disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   ``The closing of the bases was a big shock for us,'' said Erhard
Goltze, a reporter in the central German town of Giessen. Goltze
said the closing of American bases and supply depots cost the area
a quarter of the 4,000 jobs that Germans had there.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Wirtschaftswunder,'' the economic miracle that was
virtually destroyed in World War II, is history. Unemployment has
reached levels not seen since the turbulent 1930s that saw Hitler
take over. Meanwhile, Germans have no interest in low-paying
service and construction jobs that have been filled by foreigners
whose presence here has made immigration one of the touchiest of
campaign issues. It is one of the few areas of clear difference
between Kohl, who has pledged to clamp down on foreign lawbreakers,
and Schroeder, who wants Germany to be more ``foreigner-friendly.''
</P>
<P>
   Immigration is bound to be a difficult issue for a country that
40 years ago belonged to a homogeneous ``Volk,'' that had few
foreigners in its midst. Now, Germany's population of 80 million
includes 7 million foreigners, including not only workers but
political and economic refugees from around the world. A country
that met the post-war challenges of de-Nazification,
demilitarization and democratization is now gripped by even more
intractable problems that won't be solved by its characteristic
discipline and straight-ahead diligence.
</P>
<P>
   This society built its post-war order with a market economy
whose German name carries a prefix that sets it apart from its
American counterpart. Germans are proud of their ``social
market-economy,'' which implicitly rejects vasts disparities of
wealth as it provides womb-to-tomb security, from free medical care
to free university education to one of the most generous systems of
unemployment insurance, pensions and vacations in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Germans, for whom six-week vacations are a legal right, look at
vacation-poor America with sympathetic disbelief. Their acceptance
of a system for which they pay far higher taxes than do Americans
is the underlying expression of a sense of social organization that
also manifests itself with a remarkable system of public
transportation and inner-city pedestrian zones that stretch for
blocks and bring everyone together in a communal exercise of
shopping and sharing common space. Individualism is not the driving
force of life in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl, the leader of a coalition of Germany's conservatives, is
far to the left of Republicans in the United States. While the
social-security network was in place before he took office in 1982,
he helped extend it, raising taxes 14 times.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona State University history professor Gerald Kleinfeld said
Germans have a fundamentally different view of the role of
government.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't have the view that the federal government is a
foreign entity,'' he said. ``They have the continental European
view that the government is an important part of their world.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Schroeder, the role of the state likely would continue to
grow. He has promised job-training for 100,000 workers and to
cancel Kohl's modest cuts in unemployment insurance. Schroeder says
he admires the dynamism of the American economy but hastens to add,
``We could never tolerate its social and economic inequalities.''
</P>
<P>
   Something else Schroeder couldn't tolerate, were he an American
politician, is American interest in its politicians' personal
lives. He has been divorced twice, most recently from a woman who
wrote bitterly about his defection to a woman 20 years his junior,
whom he married last year.
</P>
<P>
   But the issue has been no issue in the campaign. Kohl addresses
it indirectly in his stump speech, saying, ``Loyalty is important
in private as well as public life.'' Schroeder has gotten away with
simply declaring that his willingness to try marriage three times
shows his ``earnestness'' about the institution.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl's public appearances provide a stark, distinctly
un-American contrast to Schroeder's shows. A rally at Munich's
Marienplatz on Thursday evening began with the precise German
punctuality that still allows train passengers to set their watches
by a train's departure: ``This is not about show, but about
substance,'' the chancellor said.
</P>
<P>
   Today, German voters will decide whether Kohl was correct. &QL; 
Arizona Republic reporter Jerry Kammer traveled to Germany last
week to observe the final phase of the German election campaign.
The trip was organized by the Hans Seidel Foundation. &QL;

AFGHANISTAN'S OPIUM BUSINESS HURT BY BAD WEATHER, BORDER TENSIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bad weather and tensions with neighboring Iran have slashed the
opium production of Afghanistan and hampered its opium exports for
European heroin markets, according to a new United Nations survey.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. Drug Control Program estimated last year that
Afghanistan had become the world's largest producer of opium,
surpassing Myanmar. The opium is refined into heroin and morphine
en route to Europe and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   But heavy rains, hailstorms and earthquakes this year have wiped
out one-quarter of the expected opium crop in Afghanistan, said
Pino Arlacchi, the program's executive director. Arlacchi said in
an interview that the Afghan poppy harvest this year was expected
to produce 2,300 tons of raw opium, compared with 3,100 tons last
year. He said the crop failure in central and southern Afghanistan,
including the poppy-rich provinces of Kandahar and Helmand, had
been reported by Afghan surveyors for the U.N. program, who travel
from village to village to interview officials and poppy farmers.
</P>
<P>
   The rugged and remote terrain of Afghanistan, its history of
lawlessness and chaotic warfare and the absence of a central
government helped opium flourish in recent years while the militant
Islamic movement called the Taliban seized most of the country.
</P>
<P>
   When Arlacchi visited Afghanistan last November, Taliban leaders
promised to wipe out opium poppy production, even making a show of
burning two tons of opium in June. They also promised to eliminate
new planting in return for development aid from the United Nations,
which operates a $14 million-a-year drug-control program in
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   But the latest survey, Arlacchi said, showed that poppy
cultivation had increased more than 9 percent since last year and
had spread to two eastern provinces, Lowgar and Laghman, where it
had not been reported earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``The religious leader of the Taliban would cooperate with us,''
Arlacchi said. ``But the movement is too fragmented to act.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States estimates that Afghanistan produced 1,400 tons
of opium last year, a smaller figure based on satellite photos but
not ground-level research. Its estimate this year has not yet been
made public.
</P>
<P>
   World production of opium may total 5,000 to 5,500 tons in 1998,
according to U.N. estimates. Based on a 10-to-1 ratio for refining,
the Afghan shortfall of 770 tons of opium means a potential loss of
77 tons of heroin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a result that cannot be attributed to a strong anti-drug
action by the Taliban,'' Arlacchi said. If the Taliban are not more
helpful, he added, he will ask the United States and other
countries that are financing a development program to use that
money to block drug exports.
</P>
<P>
   The deployment of tens of thousands of Iranian troops along the
western border of Afghanistan this month in response to the killing
of a group of Iranian diplomats by Taliban fighters has also cut
established smuggling routes to heroin refineries in eastern
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the price of raw opium on the Iranian-Afghan border
has soared to $50 to $77 a pound, up from $18 to $32 a pound last
year, Arlacchi said.
</P>
<P>
   The disruption of smuggling routes to the west has led
traffickers to find circuitous routes north through Tajikistan and
south through Pakistan to the Arabian Sea.
</P>
<P>
   Arlacchi said he did not expect the European price of
Afghan-derived heroin to rise significantly because a year's supply
is stockpiled along the smuggling corridor through Turkey and the
Balkans.

<P>
   TAUBATE, Brazil _ The Volkswagen factory here was built for
better days. Thanks to aggressive streamlining over the last four
years, the plant's 2,304 shift workers, 137 robots and miles of
machinery send another boxy Gol subcompact or Parati station wagon
into the world every 90 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   But finding homes for all of those cars is something else again.
</P>
<P>
   With the international financial crisis that wrecked economies
in Asia and Russia now buffeting Latin America, the Brazilian car
industry is slamming on the brakes. Shortly, 20,000 of Volkswagen's
workers here and at a plant in Sao Bernardo do Campo, about 100
miles away, will take 10 days of forced vacation.
</P>
<P>
   There will be unexpected time off soon, too, at the factories of
other automakers here in the Sao Paulo region: 12 days at Ford
Motor; two at Mercedes-Benz, a unit of Daimler-Benz, 11 at General
Motors.
</P>
<P>
   Just two years ago, Brazil was seen as the most promising new
market for car makers, the natural gateway to South America and its
more than 300 million consumers. Automakers including General
Motors, Volkswagen, Fiat and Honda Motor poured billions of dollars
into opening plants here, encouraged by forecasts of 4 percent
annual growth and by new laws that lowered import tariffs for
companies with factories in Brazil and made it easier for them to
take money out of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Though manufacturers remain excited about the country's
long-term prospects _ indeed, Toyota Motor just cut the ribbon on a
$150 million Corolla factory near Taubate _ today's reality is less
promising.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, as the world financial crisis reduced
confidence in the Brazilian currency and sparked a $1-billion-a-day
run on dollar reserves, the central bank responded by doubling
interest rates to nearly 50 percent _ an increase that is striking
the automobile and appliance industries especially hard.
Devaluations in Asian currencies are lowering prices for competing
Asian-made products by as much as 20 percent, according to the auto
industry, which expects its export sales to fall 15 percent this
year from their 1997 levels.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, fears of an imminent currency collapse have lessened,
but a recession, brought on by the high interest rates used to
maintain currency stability, now looks all but inevitable in the
year ahead.
</P>
<P>
   In Brazil, Latin America's largest market, with 160 million
people, the end of hyperinflation created a growing class of
consumers, many of them blue-collar workers. The biggest booms were
in cars and appliances, with demand running so high that steel had
to be imported from Argentina to keep production rolling here.
</P>
<P>
   Now those consumers are not only shrinking from the high cost of
financing large purchases but also fearing their jobs may vanish as
the downturn in the economy deepens. Economists forecast little or
no growth this year and next, and unemployment in this region, the
industrial and financial center of Brazil, is running at 19 percent
and expected to grow. The Brazilian stock market has bounced wildly
throughout the year, with huge losses on some days followed by big
jumps as investors are torn between optimism and pessimism.
</P>
<P>
   The National Association of Electronic Products Manufacturers
reports that sales of electronic goods in July, before this month's
latest round of interest rate increases, had already plunged 30
percent from their levels in July 1997. In appliance stores from
Manaus to Rio de Janeiro to Rio Branco these days, customers look
at the rows of television sets, refrigerators and stereos but
seldom buy.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the government increased interest rates last year, it
made consumers lose confidence,'' said Paulo Periquito, vice
president for Latin America at Whirlpool. ``People who lost their
jobs and people who were afraid of losing their jobs stopped
buying.'' Because sales were so hard hit over the last two years,
Periquito said that Whirlpool did not expect this month's interest
rate increase to make much difference.
</P>
<P>
   The National Association of Car Manufacturers here expects car
sales to shrink by at least 15 to 20 percent for 1998, compared
with sales in 1997. Auto exports in August dropped 16 percent from
levels in August 1997. Volkswagen's pause in operations will reduce
its production by 15,000 cars, said Antonio Fre, the manufacturing
operations chief at the Taubate plant. But he said no layoffs were
expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before we reach the point where we have to let people go, we
have a lot of other measures we can take,'' said Thomas Bielefeld,
the plant's director of human resources.
</P>
<P>
   But labor representatives are worried. ``We're in the middle of
a crisis, and the government is worried only about re-election,''
said Paulo Justi, who represents employees at the Volkswagen plant
here. ``As workers we have to think not only about today or
tomorrow, but about the future, and the future to us looks very
bleak.''
</P>
<P>
   Miguel Jorge, a company spokesman, said that the highly popular
four-door Gol (the name means ``goal'' in Portuguese) was not
expected to slip in sales, though other models could. Some 15
percent of Volkswagen's production goes to exports, principally to
Argentina and Mexico. The Gol, which is not sold in the United
States, is the most popular car in Brazil, accounting for one of
every four cars sold, Jorge said.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last four months, the company has reversed a policy of
aiming for export business only in large markets, he said. ``We
used to say: `St. Martin wants to buy 10 Volkswagens? Oh no, 10
cars is too few; it's not worth the trouble.' Now, we'll send 10
cars. Five cars we'll send. There is no longer any market too small
for us.''

</P>
<P>
   The first tremors from the tumult elsewhere in the world reached
Brazil last fall, as investors who had lost money in Asia and
Russia became skittish about investing in nearly all emerging
markets. Since then, Justi said, trends in the auto industry have
grown steadily more threatening for the Volkswagen workers. Faced
with company plans to lay off 10,000 workers last year, the union
agreed to a buyout plan and voluntary retirement for more than
4,000.
</P>
<P>
   Workers also agreed to give the company more flexibility to
tackle the crisis with three ``tools.'' The first was a bank of
hours. Workers would stay home to slow production and make up the
time when the company wanted to step up production. The second was
a bank of days that functioned the same way. The last was
collective vacations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fourth tool is going to be layoffs,'' Justi said, and
shook his head.
</P>
<P>
   Though Volkswagen and a number of other automakers signed
agreements with the ABC Metalworkers Union, which represents auto
workers, guaranteeing jobs through December, workers are worried
about their prospects after the New Year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This crisis hasn't even really begun to take its toll,'' said
Joao Antunis, the union representative for auto workers at the two
Volkswagen plants and two others. The layoffs, he predicted, would
begin with the automakers, then hit parts suppliers and then whip
through the suppliers of the suppliers. The union leadership is
floating a plan to occupy the Via Dutra, an important north-south
highway that runs through Sao Paulo. Paralyzing this commercial
artery, they think, will force the government to take their plight
into account.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, the union is going to work, to pressure for a
dialogue with the companies and with government so that there won't
be layoffs,'' said ABC Metalworkers Union president Luis Marinho in
an interview at union headquarters in Sao Bernardo do Campo. ``But
sincerely, I don't believe that we're going to be able to avoid
layoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   The union represents 80,000 of the 117,000 workers in
metal-related industries in metropolitan Sao Paulo. According to
its analyses, car sales are not likely to reach their level of last
November for at least another year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The recession is only going to get worse,'' said Moises
Selerges Jr., a 33-year-old union member who works at
Mercedes-Benz. ``We're in the boat, water's coming in, and we're
sinking.''
</P>
<P>
   At car dealerships, the central bank's increase in interest
rates this month might as well have been an evil magician's wand,
instantly making sales disappear. Last month, after the government
reduced a tax affecting cars, domestic auto sales surged,
registering 13 percent over August sales in 1997. But they fell
dramatically with the interest-rate increase this month.
</P>
<P>
   Outside Rio de Janeiro, at Recreio Vehicles , the biggest
Volkswagen dealership in Brazil, sales fell 30 percent after
interest rates on typical two- or three-year car loans rose to 4 to
6 percent a month from 2.5 to 3.5 percent a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is very unstable, so the interest rate can vary
more than once in the same day,'' said Mario Rubino, the manager of
the dealership.
</P>
<P>
   Dulcemar Portilho Baliera, a 28-year-old bank employee, was
looking over the cars for sale but did not expect to buy. ``So far,
I haven't had to change my standard of living, but I think we're
headed for recession,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Baliera said that now, when poverty could lie a paycheck
away, was not the time to splurge on a car at such high rates. ``In
a recession, the ones who suffer most are the ones who have the
least,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Luciana Silva Vieira, 28, a systems analyst, was more
optimistic. She was trading in her Chevrolet Corsa, a small
hatchback, for a new Gol at an interest rate of 5 percent a month,
or 60 percent a year. ``Maybe I'm rushing things, but I was able to
get a really good price for my car,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Vieira said she did not expect a currency devaluation, which
would probably lead to a return of inflation, after the election.
``If there's one good thing about Fernando Henrique Cardoso, it's
that,'' Ms. Vieira said, referring to the Brazilian President.
</P>
<P>
   The gloomy economic news, she said, had not affected her
standard of living in the least. ``But I'm such a little fish,''
she said.

CAMPUSES EXPERIENCING A SPIRITUAL REVIVAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIEGO RIBADENEIRA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After decades of being confined to the margins of college life,
spirituality is making a dramatic comeback on America's campuses.
</P>
<P>
   The spiritual revival is not only apparent in rising enrollments
in religion classes and larger membership in student religious
groups, but in a growing awareness by many universities that they
have too long neglected their students' souls.
</P>
<P>
   One tangible measure of this is the enormous response generated
by an upcoming national conference exploring the spiritual
dimension of higher education sponsored by Wellesley College.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers had at first expected a largely regional audience
with representatives from perhaps a couple of dozen universities.
But at last count more than 800 people, including some 30 college
presidents, were expected to attend from more than 350 higher
education institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly is much bigger than we ever expected and seems to
suggest that we've tapped into a movement that's happening on many
campuses across this country,'' said Victor Kazanjian, dean of
religious life at Wellesley College and a main organizer of the
conference Sunday and Monday. ``There is a great desire to have the
kinds of conversations about spirituality that haven't occurred for
a very long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Many working in higher education believe training minds is no
longer enough in an era of widespread concern about society's moral
erosion and when institutions usually charged with instilling
ethics _ family and church _ no longer have the same influence on a
younger generation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one thing to produce smart people but what do they do
with their knowledge?'' said Robert Randolph, senior associate dean
at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where worshipers at
Friday night Islamic services cause traffic jams outside the
school's religious center on Massachusetts Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been shown that success in life is determined by
intellect and emotional health, which includes the spiritual,''
said Felipe Jain, 20, a junior at Brown University who practices
Siddha yoga, a type of Indian meditation, every day. ``If the
university isn't good in the last area then how successful is it
going to be training students for life?''
</P>
<P>
   The conference will explore two main themes: the impact of
religious diversity on college campuses and how spirituality can be
introduced into education in a nonthreatening way that promotes
values, morals and ethics and produces responsible, as well as,
learned students.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the mission statement of so many colleges,
including this one, you realize that they were founded to inculcate
moral as well as intellectual values and I think we need to find
ways to use that to produce a better citizenry,'' said Rabbi Susan
Laemmle, dean of religious life at the University of Southern
California. ``I know it's a minefield and makes some people nervous
but it's a risk worth taking.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the country's most prestigious colleges, beginning with
Harvard in 1636, were founded by religious men and women who
expected that spiritual and intellectual formation would go
hand-in-hand.
</P>
<P>
   But over the decades as universities broke their historic ties
to religious denominations and became more secular, most
institutions jettisoned any talk of spirituality or relegated it to
the four walls of the campus chapel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pendulum swung so far toward a secular orientation that
universities seemed to emphasize the fact that we have no ethics,
no values, no beliefs and I think we're realizing that that kind of
attitude does a serious disservice to our students and to
society,'' said Margaret McKenna, president of Lesley College in
Cambridge, Mass., where courses looking at the connection between
spirituality and health are among the school's most popular.
</P>
<P>
   Many secular colleges, particularly those whose roots are within
Protestant denominations, have long been squeamish about
confronting issues touching on spirituality for fear of promoting
or forcing religion on students. An aversion to anything spiritual
is even more pronounced at public colleges and universities leery
of doing anything to weaken the wall between church and state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our educational process has really led to the separation of
the life of the mind and the life of the whole person, including
the spirit,'' said David Scott, chancellor of the University of
Massachusetts at Amherst, where students have petitioned the
administration to turn the campus chapel into a center for
spirituality. ``But I don't think the framers of the Constitution
intended that in the interest of not promulgating one particular
religion we should eliminate all religious or spiritual views.''
</P>
<P>
   The newfound receptivity to sprituality on many campuses is
driven by a number of factors, including booming religious
diversity among college students and worries that young people are
growing up in a moral vacuum. And many college students, reflecting
American society at large, are on spiritual quests, yearning to
find deeper meaning to their lives beyond making the honor roll,
paying tuition or landing a summer internship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spirituality in the classroom is one of those taboo subjects
no one wants to talk about because education is supposed to be so
secular and rational,'' stated Yasmeen Golzar, 20, a junior at
Wellesley and a Muslim representative on the school's multi-faith
council. ``We've made American higher education feed the mind and
not the soul. But for me spirituality is very important. I want to
find meaning in whatever I do. I want to know how I can use what
I'm studying to make the world maybe a better place.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, anecdotal evidence from many colleges around
the country shows a proliferation in religious student
organizations from evangelical Christians to Hindus, more campus
talks devoted to religious and spiritual issues, and greater demand
for religion classes. At Tufts University, a student outcry helped
save the religion department, said the Rev. Scotty McLennan, the
university chaplain.
</P>
<P>
   Now, broad spiritual issues are seeping into non-religion
classes on secular campuses.
</P>
<P>
   At Tufts University, for example, originally founded in 1852 by
what is now the Unitarian Universalist Association, McLennan
teaches a course called ``Ethics through Literature.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We look at characters in novels, plays and short stories and
ask about their morals, vices and virtues,'' said McLennan, ``and
use that to help students reflect on their own decisionmaking and
the development of moral courage.''
</P>
<P>
   Even a subject like mathematics, which seems as far removed from
the spiritual as possible, can still be an opportunity to discuss
spiritual issues, said Patrick Morton, a Wellesley math professor
who is leading a workshop at this weekend's conference called
``spiritual dimensions of creativity in mathematics.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As I do mathematics there is a feeling of being led and guided
through the process by something larger than myself,'' Morton says.
``I think there is a way of introducing spirituality into the
classroom if it is done with care and respects the individual, the
classroom and the subject.''
</P>
<P>
   At UMass-Amherst last September, more than 200 students turned
out for a series of five workshops on interreligious dialogue at
the university.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of students want to move beyond a strictly secular world
view,'' said William Johnston, director of religious studies and
history professor at UMass. ``They are interested in discussions
that don't assume that economics and politics explain all human
behavior. They are not embarrassed to talk about their souls and
how to tap into their spiritual side.''

 &HT;    Coca-Cola profit projections cut
 &HT;    By Mickey H. Gramig
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Analysts are cutting their projections for Coca-Cola
Co.'s profits through 1999 after Chief Executive M. Douglas Ivester
warned economic turmoil in key global markets will drag down the
company's performance for the rest of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Ivester, who met with analysts Friday morning in New York, said
third quarter earnings should be 35 cents per share, on sales
volume growth of just 3 percent to 4 percent. That compares with
growth of 11 percent in the year-earlier period, when Coca-Cola
earned 34 cents per share excluding a gain from the sale of stakes
in bottlers.
</P>
<P>
   The third-quarter consensus estimate of analysts reporting to
First Call had been 42 cents per share at the beginning of the
quarter, though it was revised to 39 cents just hours before the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   By mid-afternoon Friday, First Call's consensus estimate had
dropped to 35 cents for the third quarter, 30 cents for the fourth
quarter and $1.46 for the year.
</P>
<P>
   For 1999, the early consensus is $1.60 a share _ down more than
10 percent from the previous 1999 estimate of $1.79.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going through a short-term period of uncertainty, which
Coke should come out of (in the) second or third quarter of 1999,''
said Morgan Stanley Dean Witter analyst Andrew Conway, who attended
the meeting. ``Fundamentally, nothing has changed in terms of the
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Ivester put forth a positive front to reassure
investors that Coca-Cola will weather the harsh economic climate,
and come out stronger, as it has in previous downturns. Despite
economic uncertainty in Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe, the
company should reach its stated goal of annual volume increases in
the 7 percent to 8 percent range both this year and in 1999,
Ivester said.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one can deny that the simultaneous economic slump in most
markets is having a short-term impact on all global businesses,
including ours,'' Ivester said. ``Yet we remain intensely focused
on building this business system for the long-term by making the
right decisions and continuing to invest for the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no intent to sacrifice the long-term health of this
business merely to reap short-term rewards, which would only be
temporary in nature,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola, which does business in 197 countries, gets 70 percent
of its sales and 75 percent of its profit from international
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Through careful hedging, the company usually limits the impact
from currency fluctuations on earnings to no more than 3 percent.
But the global economic flux, coupled with the strong dollar, has
thrown that trend off track this year. This quarter, currency's
impact is expected to shave 10 percent off earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Friday was the second time in 13 months that Coca-Cola has
warned earnings would fall short of expectations because of
economic conditions in some parts of the world. This time, the
warning came with news that sales are slowing in Brazil, Japan and
Russia, where weak economies are curtailing consumer spending.
</P>
<P>
   Investor concern has sent Coca-Cola's stock down sharply in
recent months. By Friday, when it closed down 50 cents at $56.18
3/4, the stock had fallen 36 percent from its 52-week high in July.
More than 11.2 million shares changed hands, nearly three times the
six-month daily average.
</P>
<P>
   Buying back shares
</P>
<P>
   Ivester said the company will likely step up its share
repurchase program, which, since 1984, has bought back more than 1
billion shares at the average price of $11.93.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola has spent from $1.2 billion to $1.8 billion buying
back shares each of the last several years, and Ivester said the
company should spend near the high end of that range on stock
repurchases in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Companies typically buy back shares to help support their stock
price. Coca-Cola had 2.47 billion shares outstanding as of July 31.
</P>
<P>
   Through the end of second quarter, the company had bought 198
million of 200 million shares the board of directors had approved
repurchasing between 1992 and 2000. That buyback plan is likely to
be completed by now, so the company can move on to another program,
approved in 1996, to repurchase 206 million additional shares
through 2006.
</P>
<P>
   The company has enough cash to aggressively repurchase shares
and pour money into infrastructure improvements in emerging
markets, where weak economies give Coca-Cola more bang for its
buck, said Jennifer Solomon, a beverage analyst with Salomon/Smith
Barney.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're kind of hunkering down,'' she said. ``They're gearing
up for battle.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Ivester told analysts he'd rather be managing a business
that has a system in place in 200 countries than trying to build a
similar system in the midst of an economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   What's the true value?
</P>
<P>
   While Coca-Cola's market value has fallen about $80 billion in
the last two months, some analysts and money managers say the drop
has put the company's price-to-earnings multiple in a more
realistic range.
</P>
<P>
   ``The multiple has come down from about 55 to about 35,''
explained Bill Hackney, managing partner with Atlanta Capital
Management, an investment firm that manages $3.9 billion in assets.
</P>
<P>
   That price-to-earnings multiple generally is compared with the
S&AMP;P 500, which historically carries a multiple of about 15 but has
been pushed into the 20 percent to 25 percent range by this year's
market roller coaster. For years, Coca-Cola's multiple has
outdistanced the S&AMP;P 500, which some critics say creates a risk for
investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coca-Cola is a bit like Microsoft and GE. It's is so well
managed and it dominates its markets so well, it always looks too
high priced for its growth rate,'' Hackney said. ``It's much more
reasonably priced today. We're getting a historical opportunity to
buy the stock cheaply.''
</P>
<P>
   Solomon, who has had a more conservative outlook on Coca-Cola
than many of Wall Street, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd be buyers in the low $50s,'' said Solomon, who has a
``neutral'' rating on the stock. ``It's getting to the point...
where we would upgrade our rating.''

 &HT;    Immigrants create opportunities for mortgage lenders
 &HT;    By Susan Harte
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In 1994, when Benjamin Rincon began working for
Norwest Mortgage as community development branch manager, the
company made 35 mortgage loans to Hispanic families. This year, it
will make between 550 and 600.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, says Rincon, on Nov. 1, Norwest Mortgage will open
a Buford Highway office, one mile from the Latin American
Association in the heart of one of Atlanta's Hispanic communities.
It will be part of an ongoing effort to encourage Hispanic people
and other immigrants to buy houses.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Rincon, other mortgage lenders and real estate agents
say the burgeoning number of immigrants to the United States _
projected by the Immigration and Naturalization Service at 10
million this decade _ is creating challenges as well as
opportunities to create another population of home buyers.
</P>
<P>
   To meet the new demands, real estate professionals and mortgage
lenders are hiring bilingual employees, developing ethnically
sensitive advertising campaigns and adjusting selling techniques to
ethnic attitudes and cultural practices.
</P>
<P>
   Fannie Mae reported a 47 percent growth in immigrant homeowners
between 1980 and 1995 but anticipates another 45 percent jump by
2010. That means during the next decade, 6.8 million people not
born in the United States could own homes here, especially in the
suburbs, where they seek the same quality schools, churches and
transportation as their native-born counterparts do.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the groups, Hispanics have had and continue to have the
greatest impact on the real estate industry, according to Century
21 Real Estate Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Lynnette Rodriguez, director of family services at the Latin
American Association, said the organization's third annual housing
fair, scheduled for April 24, is being orchestrated by a committee
of lenders and Realtors. Although seminars will be given in
Spanish, other housing-related services are manned by bilingual
people.
</P>
<P>
   Even at Summit Bank, a Chinese-owned commercial bank in
Chamblee, directors are considering a move into the mortgage
lending business.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are testing the waters,'' said manager David Yu of Summit's
Asian Banking Center, ``but there are issues such as timing and the
economic cycle that we have to consider.''
</P>
<P>
   Real estate agent Michele Fiechter said her sales to immigrant
families have grown 500 percent during the past 12 months in west
Cobb, Smyrna, Tucker, Alpharetta and Paulding County. She works
with Century 21 in east Cobb County and assists the Latin American
Association in running seminars.

   Looking for Love In the Fed Funds Rate &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Like a love-struck intern parsing the boss's neckwear for a
secret sign that the feeling is mutual, world markets hunted
obsessively last week for reasons to believe that the Federal Open
Market Committee would cut interest rates at its meeting on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Hearts skipped beats at midweek when Alan Greenspan suggested to
Congress that action was needed ``shortly'' to keep the contagion
of economic instability now afflicting emerging markets from
``really spilling over and creating some very significant further
difficulties.''
</P>
<P>
   The remark apparently sounded enough like ``Will you marry me?''
to send stocks soaring for a day. By week's end, the main question
seemed to be how big a diamond, er, rate cut would be forthcoming,
with some Fed watchers liking the way a half-point sounded. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even a Hedge Fund Can Be `Too Big to Fail' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Long-Term Capital Management was every inch a hedge fund. For a
big-money client list, the fund's big-name managers took big
chances with even bigger leverage in pursuit of really big returns.
</P>
<P>
   Lately the fund had bought risky emerging-markets bonds and
hedged by selling Treasuries short, a strategy that got it in big
trouble when Russia devalued, setting off a market stampede to
safety that made both those moves big losers and nearly wiped out
the fund's capital.
</P>
<P>
   When the fund's founder, John W. Meriwether, failed last week to
raise enough new money to stave off insolvency, the Federal Reserve
stepped in.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing an asset fire sale that would clobber credit markets
worldwide, the Fed organized an unprecedented $3.5 billion bailout
by big institutions like Morgan Stanley and Chase Manhattan. News
of the fund's near failure shocked stock markets and made lenders
leery of other hedge funds.
</P>
<P>
   The Swiss bank UBS said it would report a big third-quarter
loss, in part because of Long-Term Capital's troubles. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Goldman's Faltering Profits May Delay an Offering &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After debating fitfully about it for years, the 189 partners of
Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. finally voted in June to go public, and look
what's happened since: Currencies have collapsed, emerging markets
melted, stock markets swooned, bond yields sunk, merger deals
unraveled, and new equity offerings all but vanished.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow Goldman still made a profit of $754 million in its
fiscal third quarter, the company said on Tuesday, but the falloff
from earlier in the year was sharp enough to cast doubt on
Goldman's plan for a November debut for its stock.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts called the Goldman offering a canary in the mine:
Postponement would be read as a warning that top investment bankers
see the stock market getting worse before it gets better. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Senate passed a bankruptcy bill that will make it
substantially harder for consumers to walk away from debts. ...
Philippine Airlines shut down after last-ditch efforts to resolve a
bitter labor dispute collapsed. The carrier handled 80 percent of
domestic air passenger and cargo traffic in the island nation; the
government and smaller carriers scrambled to fill the void. ...
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter reported a drop in profits of only 5
percent for the third quarter, much less than expected, but the
cheery report got lost in the hedge-fund bailout flap and Morgan's
stock slipped on the day.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the week, Lehman Brothers Holdings said profits fell
23 percent in the quarter; it, too, was reckoned to have escaped
much damage, and its shares bounced on the news. ... Orders for
durable goods jumped 1.6 percent in August, pointing to continued
economic strength; GDP growth in the second quarter was revised
upward, to an annual rate of 1.8 percent. ... The huge
Citicorp-Travelers merger cleared its last regulatory hurdle,
winning Federal Reserve approval contingent on selling some
businesses. &QL; 
 &QL;

accurate'' testimony: &QL;

trying to be particularly helpful to them, and I didn't think I had
an obligation to be particularly helpful to them.''(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   _ President Clinton, in his Aug. 17, 1998, grand jury testimony,
referring to statements that he and his lawyer made about his
relationship with Monica Lewinsky when he was deposed in the Paula
Jones sexual harassment suit in January. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (italics)``I never undertake to instruct the man who asks me
questions. ... It was no part of my duty as a witness to volunteer
testimony. While they thought they were leading me into a trap, I
let them go into a trap themselves.''(end italics) &QL;

   _ John D. Rockefeller Sr. to his authorized biographer, William
O. Inglis, referring to testimony in 1888 before a New York State
Senate committee. When the committee's counsel mistakenly referred

Improvement Co. instead of the South Improvement Company,
Rockefeller was able to deny taking part in it without committing
perjury. &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ What is the lesson from the rescue of Long-Term
Capital Management, the hedge fund based in Greenwich, Conn.,
that's run by John W. Meriwether and a band of Wall Street's
savviest traders? That it helps to be big, to be bold and to know
the right people.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Streeters not involved in the fund's $3.5 billion bailout
by a consortium of large banks and brokerage firms are agog not
only at the size of the losses but also at the idea that so
speculative a firm would be saved from a demise of its own making.
Cries of crony capitalism, Wall Street style, are growing louder.
And with some justification.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, the deal _ in which companies like J.P. Morgan,
Chase Manhattan, Travelers Group and Goldman, Sachs agreed to put
up roughly $300 million apiece to stabilize Long-Term Capital _
goes against the advice that American policy makers have been
dispensing to tattered economies around the world.
</P>
<P>
   If a financial institution is bankrupt, Washington has scolded,
it should be allowed to fail. The United States has been especially
vocal on this score to officials in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the small matter of exactly why these
institutions, under the Federal Reserve's sponsorship, came to
Long-Term Capital's rescue. According to Sanford I. Weill, chairman
of Travelers, the financial industry concluded that a bailout was
``the best way to maintain orderly markets.''
</P>
<P>
   Weill is surely right. Forcing Long-Term Capital to liquidate
its holdings under pressure would have unleashed a firestorm on
already damaged worldwide bond markets. Because Meriwether had big
holdings in junk bonds, for instance, a liquidation of those
securities would have clipped their prices badly, hurting
individual investors who own high-yield-bond mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   But the retail investor is only part of the story and hardly the
heart of it. The bailout was in the bankers' self-interest, too.
Most of the firms that executed Meriwether's trades piggybacked on
them, putting on the same positions.
</P>
<P>
   So a mass liquidation of Meriwether's portfolio would have
slashed the value of their holdings. Furthermore, some of the
rescuers _ Merrill Lynch and UBS AG, for example _ had stakes in
the fund.
</P>
<P>
   Is the bailout throwing good money after bad? An investment in
Long-Term Capital may turn out to be a home run for Merrill Lynch
and the other firms, which now have 90 percent ownership of the
hedge fund. But the idea that many of these institutions extended
so much credit to Long-Term Capital with little understanding of
the risks doesn't say much about their management controls.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers find it interesting to compare Meriwether's
treatment with that of another failed investment manager _ Robert
Citron, the disgraced former treasurer of Orange County, Calif. As
with Meriwether, Citron's undoing was a series of wrongheaded
interest-rate bets; his caused the county's 1994 bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   There are big differences, of course. Citron was investing with
public money, not the funds of high-rolling private investors. And
he diverted money from one public account to another. He also was
no denizen of Wall Street's corridors, given to wearing turquoise
jewelry, not chalk-striped suits.
</P>
<P>
   How many more hedge funds are about to need bailing out? Alan
Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, knows that the biggest
hazard of one bailout is that it makes people expect another and
another. He testified to Congress on the subject 10 days ago. And
yet the New York Fed brokered the Long-Term Capital deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``That the Fed decided to send a helicopter to sprinkle money
over Greenwich means Mr. Greenspan knows that the problem must be
so big on the other side,'' said Stan Jonas, managing director at
FIMAT/USA, a broker dealer in New York, referring to the banks.
``It must be big, if he's willing to sacrifice principle just to
get rid of it.'' &QL;

WHEN MANAGEMENT SHOOTS FOR THE MOON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Sept. 27)  
 (bl)  
 By ADAM BRYANT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Management theorists, who have created clunky terms like
``co-opetition,'' are generally not known for their elegance with
language. That's not likely to change anytime soon, considering the
buzzword now sweeping through corner offices around the country:
BHAGs, for ``big, hairy, audacious goals.''
</P>
<P>
   A BHAG (pronounced BEE-hag) is supposed to inspire an
organization to reach for a goal it might otherwise think
impossible, as when NASA set out to land a man on the moon in the
1960s. In management circles, the notion was refined by Gary Hamel
and C.K. Prahalad, who observed in a 1989 article in The Harvard
Business Review that companies that emerged as global leaders had
invariably begun with outsized ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   But the bigness and hair were added by James C. Collins and
Jerry I. Porras, who apparently coined the term BHAG in their 1994
book, ``Built to Last: Successful Habits of Visionary Companies''
(HarperBusiness). And the idea seems to be gaining momentum. Warren
Bennis, a professor at the University of Southern California and
the author of several books on leadership, said he kept hearing the
term at a recent management conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed to really hit everybody,'' he said. ``People keep
raising the bar, and in order to be competitive, you have to set
these goals. It's all part of the hyper, turbulent, spastic
business environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, there are a lot of attention-getting goals being
trumpeted by corporate executives. Samir Gibara, chief executive of
Goodyear Tire and Rubber, a $13 billion company, has told Wall
Street that he will add $10 billion in sales within five years, a
tall order for a slow-growth industry. Procter &AMP; Gamble is still
working on its goal of doubling the company's size in 10 years. And
Times Mirror wants to increase the circulation of The Los Angeles
Times by 500,000, a 50 percent jump.
</P>
<P>
   But are these goals big, hairy and audacious enough to be
bona-fide BHAGs?
</P>
<P>
   Collins says incremental financial targets don't qualify.
``People are setting short-term targets and confusing them with
BHAGs,'' he said in an interview. ``They just pick a big goal
because they feel they need to have a big goal.''
</P>
<P>
   So how can you spot a genuine BHAG? By Collins' thinking, it has
to be something with at least a 30-year horizon, a mountain of a
goal, with 10-year financial targets serving as base camps along
the way. BHAGs should help stimulate progress while preserving a
company's central mission.
</P>
<P>
   Sony, for example, set out to change the world's perception that
Japanese products were cheap. General Electric pledged to become
No. 1 or No. 2 in every market it served, while moving with the
speed and agility of a much smaller company.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s, Boeing invested two-thirds of the company's net
profit from the postwar years to develop the 707, the early
commercial jetliner; it has since emerged as the world's largest
aerospace company, absorbing the remnants of most of its 1950s
rivals. (Boeing's recent stumbles in speeding up its production
lines suggest that it might be better at BHAGs, than what, with
apologies to Collins, might be called small, nettlesome ancillary
goals, or SNAGs.)
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the companies that seem better at meeting
short-term objectives than sculpting a BHAG. Bristol-Myers Squibb
Co. set out in 1994 to double sales, earnings and earnings per
share by the end of 2000 _ a difficult hurdle that it has a good
shot at clearing. But that sharp focus gets lost in setting out its
loftier mission. ``The pillars of our success,'' the company states
in its annual report, ``will remain Growth, Productivity and the
continued development of a Dynamic Operating Culture that fosters
innovation and rewards success.'' On the cover of its annual
report, Bristol uses the anything but audacious tag line ``Building
Tomorrows.'' Bristol says the slogan is meant to capture the
company's core mission of ``enhancing and extending lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, mere audacity does not a BHAG make. ``The critical
variable is that a BHAG has to be connected to the purpose of the
company _ not just any random big goal, but one that really
connects back to the enduring values and purpose of the
institution,'' Collins said. ``Companies that change best over time
know first and foremost what should not change.''
</P>
<P>
   But when companies go after a BHAG, they can easily create a big
hairy foot to trip over.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Campbell Soup chairman David Johnson released a
gaggle of goals for the company in 1996. He wanted to take Campbell
to ``a new level,'' he said, ``vaulting our company into the ranks
of the world's renowned consumer-goods companies.'' He wanted to
make Campbell ``best of show,'' instead of just tops in its class.
Last but not least, he said he wanted Campbell Soup to be
considered a global leader, like Coca-Cola or Gillette. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To get there, Campbell Soup has steadily predicted annual jumps
in sales of soup, even though the category has remained flat for
years. Such predictions, when not met, can undermine investor
confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many packaged food companies can be accused of selling their
stock as hard as their products,'' said John M. McMillin, an
analyst for Prudential Securities.
</P>
<P>
   But what's wrong with a little BHAG-ian bravado? Bennis, the USC
professor, said there might be a long-term price to pay for feeling
compelled to pursue a BHAG.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cost may be in impulsive decisions,'' he said, like
chasing dubious mergers for the sake of doing something big _ and
doing it quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``And somehow the phrase,'' he added, ``lacks a certain
aesthetic.''

CNN EXPLORES LIFE ON THE BRINK IN `COLD WAR'  
 (EMBARGOED FOR SUNDAY, SEPT. 27) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVE WALKER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Watch just a little of the massive new CNN documentary
``The Cold War,'' and one conclusion is inescapable: What peewees
we've all become.
</P>
<P>
   The state of affairs that currently possesses the affairs of
state are laughably light when weighed against the overwhelming
issues that occupied world leaders until just a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   More than public decency or faith in elected leadership stood on
the brink of annihilation during most of the nearly five decades of
the Cold War. Humanity's future waited there, watching for the big
flash on the horizon. Our elders sweated Stalin and Castro so we
can spend our time combing through the Starr report?
</P>
<P>
   You'll wonder that, too, as you work your way though the 24-hour
documentary, which will unfold on the Cable News Network one hour
at a time each Sunday night until spring, starting tonight. It's
simply amazing, looking back, that we survived. And where have all
those larger-than-life leaders gone?
</P>
<P>
   More than 500 witnesses, both ordinary citizens and world
honchos, were interviewed for ``The Cold War.'' Actor Kenneth
Branagh narrates.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the cold facts of our history in this world
over the last 50 years, you end up with a very great deal of
respect for the leaders on both sides,'' said Sir Jeremy Isaacs,
executive producer of the series, in a recent meeting with TV
critics.
</P>
<P>
   Respect for leaders. How quaint.
</P>
<P>
   CNN founder Ted Turner, in the same meeting with critics, said
the idea of a comprehensive Cold War series came to him during the
1994 Goodwill Games in St. Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   The Berlin Wall had fallen, the long war was over. Files on all
sides of the conflict, for the first time, were opening. Video and
newsreel footage from dozens of countries was becoming available.
And many of the key policymakers and eyewitnesses, though aging,
were still alive and available for interviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had always been a student of history,'' said Turner. ``I was
particularly touched by ``The Civil War,'' Ken Burns' series on
public television, and perhaps even more _ because it was more
poignant, more relevant to me _ by the series ``The World at War,''
which took a multinational viewpoint of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those of us who are old enough to remember the Cold War . . .
only saw our side of it. We never saw what appeared on Russian
television or Vietnam television or Chinese television.
</P>

N.Y. HAITIANS FOCUS ON HURRICANE RELIEF

   NEW YORK _ Haitian immigrants in New York City are scrambling to
put together a relief effort to send emergency supplies to Haiti in
the aftermath of Hurricane Georges, and some have expressed dismay
at what they see as the slow response of the administration of
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani to the situation there.
</P>
<P>
   About a dozen Haitian organizations have created the Haiti
Disaster Relief Committee, and have set up drop-off sites where
people can donate goods and clothing.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the Haitians acknowledged Friday that they did not act
quickly enough in assessing the damages in Haiti and failed to
reach out to city officials until late this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``This challenges us once again to look at the way we operate in
the Haitian community and to do better next time,'' said Jocelyn
McCalla, executive director of the National Coalition of Haitian
Rights and chairman of the ad hoc relief committee. ``We generally
do not engage elected or appointed officials in a consistent
basis.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's office said that the city was ready to send
emergency supplies as soon as it finds an organization in Haiti
capable of distributing the aid once it arrives, said Colleen
Roche, the mayor's spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to guard against the relief aid ending up in the
black market,'' Ms. Roche said, adding that the city was prepared
to send whatever was needed in Haiti, including blankets, water and
food.
</P>
<P>
   On its destructive path through the northeastern Caribbean,
Hurricane Georges hit the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico the
hardest.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Hispanic community in New York City said they did
not wait for the city to begin planning a relief effort. When it
appeared that the full force of the storm would hit Puerto Rico and
the Dominican Republic, they reached out to the mayor's office and
created an emergency plan. New York City dispatched a team of
police officers and firefighters to the Dominican Republic. Similar
efforts have been coordinated for Puerto Rico and other Caribbean
nations.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Mayor Ninfa Segarra said that these relief efforts would
be extended to wherever they were needed. ``Certainly, this is not
just for Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic,'' Ms. Segarra
said. ``We've been working with groups from across the Caribbean.''
</P>
<P>
   Haitians said that the hurricane's impact on Haiti was also
devastating, given that mountainous country's problems with erosion
and its poor infrastructure. In Haiti, the poorest country in the
hemisphere, even the most routine rainfall can bring flooding in
the capital of Port-au-Prince.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, because of poor roads and communication, scant
information is known about the storm damage and death toll in the
northeast and central plateau regions, which bore the brunt of the
hurricane in Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   According to reports, Port-au-Prince, where roughly 2 million
people live, is completely flooded. Thousands of people living in
Cite Soleil, a teeming seaside slum, were left homeless when the
storm washed away their cardboard homes. Health officials fear an
outbreak of cholera and malaria in a country with poor sewage
systems and a lack of potable water.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The relationship between the Giuliani administration and Haitian
immigrants was severely strained following an assault case in
August 1997 involving a Haitian immigrant, Abner Louima. Four
police officers from the 70th Precinct in Brooklyn were indicted on
federal civil rights charges in the case, in which prosecutors say
Louima was beaten and brutalized in the station house. Haitians
organized a march across the Brooklyn Bridge to protest what they
saw as a climate in the Police Department that allowed brutality,
an event that Giuliani denounced as anti-police.
</P>
<P>
   ``In almost every instance, we're not considered,'' said Henri
Frank, executive director of the Haitian Centers Council, a
Brooklyn-based group. ``It seems that there is favoritism. The
other groups make noise and they get things done.''
</P>
<P>
   Tatiana Wah, chairwoman of the Haitian American Alliance, a
community group, agreed, saying of Giuliani: ``I do think Haitians
have been slighted by his administration overall. He could have
rallied the Haitian community. He just felt that this time he
didn't have to.''
</P>
<P>
   Georges Bousiquot, a Haitian immigrant and Giuliani supporter
who is director of operations at the city's Department of Housing
Preservation and Development, said Haitians have taken a victim's
posture that undermines their potential political strength and
exposes their lack of cohesion in a community that is perceived by
outsiders as being tight-knit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're always bashing Giuliani and now we want him to come to
our aid,'' Bousiquot said. ``It doesn't make any sense. Why should
he reach out to us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, the Haitians were late in planning for this
disaster,'' McCalla said. ``Now we have to develop very quick and
fruitful relationships.''

BUSH PREPARES TV PITCH TO HISPANIC VOTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA TOLLEY  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ In an expensive bid to attract Hispanic voters
who have traditionally supported Democrats, Republican Gov. George
W. Bush's campaign Friday unveiled a series of television
commercial in Spanish and English.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's opponent, Democratic Land Commissioner Garry Mauro, has
won the Hispanic vote in his previous elections. But the Bush camp
believes the governor could grab a larger-than-usual proportion of
the Hispanic vote in the November election.
</P>
<P>
   Although no specific dollar figures were given, the Bush
campaign said it is making an ``unprecedented'' push in the
Hispanic community. At least a quarter of the campaign's TV budget
will be spent on the Hispanic TV ads that begin airing Monday in
most Texas markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you this campaign is going to devote more time,
more money and more resources and more personnel to reaching out to
(Hispanic voters) than any campaign in Texas history, Democrat or
Republican,'' said Mark McKinnon, Bush's media specialist and a
one-time Democratic consultant.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro dismissed the importance of the ad campaign, saying Bush
doesn't understand what it takes to win votes in the Hispanic
community.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro is far behind Bush in fund-raising efforts, and he has yet
to introduce TV ads in the final stretch of the campaign because he
needs about $2 million to do so.
</P>
<P>
   He hopes to get about $1 million of that when President Clinton
goes to San Antonio to Houston on Sunday to attend private
fund-raisers for Mauro.
</P>
<P>
   ``You carry the Hispanic vote because you understand the
community and you support the ideals and values the community
supports,'' Mauro said, inferring he is that candidate _ not Bush.
</P>
<P>
   There are three separate commercials done in Spanish and
English, and Bush speaks some Spanish in two. The Spanish ads will
run on Spanish-language stations and English-language stations,
while the English ads will only go on English-language stations.

IN KEY TEST FOR CLINTON, ANOTHER SPENDING BATTLE LOOMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With nine working days until the deadline for
approving money to keep the government running, President Clinton
is facing his first real test of power with the
Republican-controlled Congress since the effort to impeach him
engulfed the Capitol weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton still has the veto pen, and he has threatened to use it
on seven of the 13 must-pass spending bills. The question is
whether he has the strength to use it and whether his fellow
Democrats in Congress will back him if he does.
</P>
<P>
   Looming are battles over major issues that could bring a partial
shutdown of the government. These include differences over tax
cuts, spending for education, environmental controls, fixing the
Year 2000 computer bug in government computers, aid to farmers to
compensate for the drought, whether to grant school vouchers in the
District of Columbia and to what extent to finance the
International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   They include perennially contentious issues like family planning
and, new this year, whether the Food and Drug Administration should
be allowed to use taxpayer money to approve abortion-inducing drugs
like RU-486. Another novel dispute is over how to conduct the
census in 2000, which, because it helps determine the number of
seats each party can win in Congress, is deeply important to both
sides.
</P>
<P>
   But the chief hang-ups at the moment, and the reason the process
may seem stalled, stem from disagreements among Republicans in the
House and between Republicans in the House and Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Reischauer, who was the director of the Congressional
Budget Office earlier in the Clinton presidency and is now a
scholar at the Brookings Institution, said of the impasse that he
sees building: ``A lot of this reflects the internal divisions
within the Republican Party and the fact that the Republican
majority in the House is a very small one. The leadership can't
offend the moderate wing or the conservative wing and still have a
majority.''
</P>
<P>
   The House has passed 12 of the 13 spending bills. The Senate has
passed 10. The House and Senate have agreed upon and sent to
Clinton only two _ one to pay for scores of military projects in
local congressional districts and one to cover congressional
operating costs. Typically by this stage, Congress has passed five
or six of the bills.
</P>
<P>
   Both parties have been slowly laying the groundwork to blame the
other for a possible government shutdown that could result if they
fail to resolve their differences. But Clinton, who is rebounding
in public opinion polls, lashed out at Congress on Friday as part
of his strategy to focus attention away from his troubles.
</P>
<P>
   Emerging like a bear from a cave with sudden ferocity, Clinton
accused Congress of ``failing to meet its most basic governing
responsibility,'' a reference to Congress missing its deadline five
months ago for passing a budget resolution outlining its broad
goals for federal spending.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that Congress' need to buy more time to finish its
spending bills _ postponing its deadline for the spending bills
from Oct. 1 to Oct. 9 _ was a ``regrettable sign'' that Republicans
were not addressing urgent problems. But such postponements have
become accepted practice. In eight of the last 10 years, Congress
has provided temporary financing to keep the government running
past the start of the fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   The president's comments riled Republicans on Capitol Hill.
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott accused the president of taking a
gratuitous slap at Congress as he ``jumps on a plane and runs off
for three days of fund raising.''
</P>
<P>
   And Republicans insisted that they did not want a shutdown.
``With everything else going on, it would be wrong to have a battle
over the minutiae of the financing of the government,'' said Sen.
Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, chairman of the Senate Appropriations
Committee. ``We won't close down the government; we'll just past a
CR to bring us back after the election,'' a reference to a
``continuing resolution'' that would keep the government running.
</P>
<P>
   But he suggested the president was spoiling for a fight as a way
to deflect talk of impeachment. ``This is the first year that I can
remember that they haven't sent people around to talk to me about
how they feel about the bills,'' Senator Stevens said. ``I'm afraid
it means they want to veto bills and close down the government.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Livingston, R-La., chairman of the House Appropriations
Committee, had the same reaction. ``The big question is, how much
disruption does the president want to refocus the attention of the
American people away from his own problems?''
</P>
<P>
   Both the House and Senate have scheduled conferences next week
to reconcile their differing versions of four or five other
noncontroversial spending bills and send them to the president. And
they still have time to complete final action on all the bills
sooner than they have done in previous years. Last year, for
example, they took until Nov. 13 to resolve the spending bills. In
1987, they went until Dec. 22.
</P>
<P>
   An added incentive this year is that many Republicans are eager
to get home and campaign for re-election, and their advisers hope
they will be able to do that and avoid a shutdown or a major
confrontation with the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got the bully pulpit, and he can determine over which
issues the government is shut down,'' said Ralph Reed, the former
executive director of the Christian Coalition and an adviser to
numerous Republican congressional candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even during the darkest days of Watergate, Nixon sustained a
series of vetoes on Capitol Hill,'' he said. ``To underestimate the
institutional power of the presidency because of the unique
personal weakness of the person occupying it is a serious
mistake.''

VAGUE, YES, BUT SCHROEDER COULD UNSEAT CHANCELLOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ With a promise to restore ``social justice to
Germany,'' and a flash of his winning smile, Gerhard Schroeder on
Friday wound up his campaign to replace Helmut Kohl as German
chancellor in national elections on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Despite seeing his lead erode in recent weeks, and despite a
refusal to clarify his plans, Schroeder appears to have a better
chance of succeeding than any of his four predecessors as Social
Democratic candidates, who tried and failed to dislodge Kohl over
the last 16 years.
</P>
<P>
   During those Kohl years, the Berlin wall came down, Germany was
unified, the European Union was consolidated, a new European
currency called the euro was agreed to, and 16 million former East
Germans were granted pensions, social security and German marks at
a staggering cost to the nation but without social upheaval.
</P>
<P>
   The achievement speaks for itself, but Schroeder has cleverly
avoided speaking about it, concentrating instead on the high
unemployment, the fragmenting of Germany's social model, the
widening gap between rich and poor and the uncertainty that has
accompanied the country's push for global competitiveness and
acceptance of unification.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Kohl came to power, 25 percent of university students
were from working-class families,'' Schroeder told a crowd in the
former eastern part of Berlin on Friday. ``Today, that figure is
less than 14 percent. I intend to change this. Only a society with
social justice can be a true democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   The setting for Schroeder's last speech was clearly carefully
chosen, for it is in the former east that his best chance of
success appears to lie. With 20 percent of the work force
unemployed in the area that constituted the former East German
state, support for Kohl's Christian Democrats has crumbled.
</P>
<P>
   This decline, and a weariness with Kohl that is palpable
throughout much of Germany, and especially among young people, may
be enough to push the Social Democratic share of the vote to as
much as 42 percent, compared with estimates of about 37 percent for
the Christian Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Other opinion polls, however, suggest a much closer finish, with
the parties separated by just 2 percent. With more than 20 percent
of the electorate saying it is undecided, and many of these
believed to be former Christian Democratic voters, the outcome is
too close to call.
</P>
<P>
   What is clear is that Schroeder has taken a calculated risk in
avoiding clear commitments right to the last, a tactic that has
exasperated many Germans who take the practical view that they
should know what their vote is for.
</P>
<P>
   But this approach may have enabled the Social Democratic
candidate to win votes in the center while not alienating the
bedrock support of workers, for it has enabled the Social Democrats
to lambaste the unacceptable costs of the welfare state and at the
same time pledge its preservation or even its extension.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Schroeder promised to reduce taxes for working
families, combine ``economy and ecology,'' provide jobs for the
young, preserve or increase pensions, and refashion a society
``where the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.'' But he went
into no detail about how he would do all this.
</P>
<P>
   Battling to compete, and to increase productivity, German
companies cut about 2.7 million jobs between 1991 and 1997. This
drive created a wide sense of alienation in a society long known
for its cohesiveness. But recently the economy has revived _ 2.7
percent growth is expected this year _ and the unemployment rate
has begun to decline.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder believes this improvement has come too late for Kohl.
His campaign organizers are convinced that Schroeder's modern air,
his Clintonian push for a ``new center'' and his new face itself
will be enough to overcome the visceral conservatism of many German
voters, for whom change is tantamount to possible instability.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Oskar Lafontaine, the chairman of the Social Democratic Party,
who tried and failed to defeat Kohl in 1990, spoke before
Schroeder, describing with great eloquence his dream that the young
would find new hope in a Social Democratic government.
</P>
<P>
   It was, by any estimate, a much better speech than Schroeder's.
But that was not the point. Having failed so often, the Social
Democrats have decided to be pragmatic _ and Schroeder, polls
repeatedly show, is the man with greatest capacity to broaden the
center-left party's appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``World-Class for Germany,'' says Kohl's campaign poster. But
Schroeder, like Clinton in his campaign against George Bush in
1992, is betting that the world matters less to Germans than their
domestic problems, and that Kohl's historic achievements now belong
in the history books. It is a big wager, and one whose outcome, it
now seems, will be uncertain to the last.

THOUGHTS OF REPENTANCE AND COMMUNITY FOR YOM KIPPUR 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With the nation's political leaders and the news
media preoccupied by the scandal involving President Clinton, words
like sin, repentance and forgiveness have flowed freely in
newscasts and political debate for weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But one might ask if such words are being used superficially, or
is any thought given to them as profound religious concepts?
</P>
<P>
   The question seems appropriate given the imminence of a major
religious holiday, Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement, which Jews
worldwide will begin observing on Tuesday at sundown.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief overview of the holy day, included in an edition of
the Yom Kippur prayer book published by Mesorah Publications Ltd.
of Brooklyn, Rabbi Nosson Scherman writes that sin, without
repentance, progressively diminishes a human being.
</P>
<P>
   ``It engenders within him an indifference to evil, a tolerance
for evil, an appetite for evil _ and, eventually, a distaste for
good,'' writes the rabbi, who is general editor of the company's
Artscroll series of religious books.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview Friday, Scherman said the idea of the
personal decline that comes from repeated sinful acts was a major
theme in Jewish ethical thought. ``The Talmud,'' he said, referring
to Jewish oral law and tradition, ``says if somebody sins once, and
then repeats it, to him it becomes a permitted act. If you do it a
third time, it becomes a commandment.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, human beings have a way of rationalizing the
wrong they do. Rabbinic sages, he added, called that process ``the
insulation of the heart.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So repentance is a process of stripping away that built-in
insulation,'' Scherman said. ``It doesn't come easy. It's a long,
hard process.''
</P>
<P>
   In a separate interview, Rabbi Marc Schneier, president of the
New York Board of Rabbis, offered some other thoughts for the holy
day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember that during this penitential season, the Jewish
community comes before God,'' he said. This is not just an
individual process, he added. ``We are coming before God in a
communal judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   Schneier's emphasis on the word `communal' is not surprising,
given that he and five other rabbis, representing the Reform,
Conservative and Orthodox movements within Judaism, had just
emerged Friday afternoon from a brief meeting with Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, who was visiting New York.
</P>
<P>
   Since he became the organization's president in January, Rabbi
Schneier, who is Orthodox, has tried to point to the board of
rabbis (whose membership list, he said, includes more than 800
Orthodox, Conservative, Reform and Reconstructionist rabbis) as an
example of how Orthodox and non-Orthodox can cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   That idea has undergone enormous strain in the last two years, a
period when Orthodox and non-Orthodox leaders have fought verbally
over whether rabbis in Judaism's Reform and Conservative movements
should be allowed official recognition in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The two movements comprise the majority of religious Jews in the
United States, but are a small minority in Israel, where the
Orthodox have held official control of religious life (conducting
conversion ceremonies, performing weddings, granting divorces)
since the founding of the state 50 years ago. The non-Orthodox have
challenged this in the Israeli courts; the Orthodox, who have three
political parties, have responded with attempts to codify their
status in Israeli law.
</P>
<P>
   At times, the rhetoric of the debate, in both the United States
and Israel, has been deeply divisive.
</P>
<P>
   Schneier recalled that officers of the New York rabbinical board
met with Netanyahu in January, when the prime minister had said
that the board could try to be a model of cooperative relations
among rabbis across the spectrum of Judaism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not trying to minimize the conflict,'' Schneier said.
``I'm not trying to minimize the differences that do exist.'' He
said that examples of cooperation among Orthodox and non-Orthodox
rabbis in New York and other North American cities might be no more
than a drop in the bucket, but he wanted people at least to know
``that the drop exists.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've taken the position that before you can address sensitive
issues like conversions and divorce'' in Israel, he said, ``you
have to focus on Step One, and that's having lines of communication
and trust.''

   Maybe Pepsi Has a Job For a Dogged Coke Critic &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Albert J. Meyer, a mild-mannered accountant, gained fame in 1995
for leading investigators to what proved to be fraud of tens of
millions of dollars at New Era Philanthropy in Philadelphia. His
doggedness in uncovering that scam helped win Meyer a job at Martin
Capital Management, a small investment firm in Elkhart, Ind.
</P>
<P>
   But now, after Meyer, 47, used that same tenacity to go after
the accounting methods of Coca-Cola, he and the investment firm
have agreed to part ways.
</P>
<P>
   The firm's founder, Frank K. Martin, said that a factor in his
decision to distance the firm from Meyer's research was that
Coca-Cola was ``a pretty intimidating company.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody was able to tell me that Coke wouldn't seek retribution
against our firm,'' Martin said. ``Nowhere in our mission statement
does it say that we should go after elephants with peashooters.''
</P>
<P>
   Meyer and other critics say Coke and its giant bottling company
are in reality a single business and should consolidate their
financial statements. Coca-Cola, which disputes Meyer's research
and says it properly follows all accounting rules, says no one from
the company has called the investment firm to complain.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman said he found it odd that Martin was even worried.
And Martin confirmed that he had not heard a peep from Coke.
</P>
<P>
   Meyer, who sold his house in Elkhart this month and is
interviewing for various jobs, said he was not sorry that he wrote
papers criticizing the soft-drink giant's accounting. He said
investors needed a more complete picture of the company's
relationship with its largest bottler, Coca-Cola Enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did it for the public,'' he said. ``Some people appreciate
someone who is independent in his thinking and others don't.'' &QL;

   During Robert Crandall's 18 years as maximum leader of American
Airlines, he was the most brilliant and feared executive in the
airline industry, known for his predawn staff meetings and
profanity-laden rebukes.
</P>
<P>
   But even the chain-smoking Crandall, who once likened airline
competition to war, had to put his pants on one leg at a time. And
when he opened his closet in the morning, he faced a rack of more
than a dozen nearly identical gray suits.
</P>
<P>
   How could he be sure that his trousers matched his jacket?
</P>
<P>
   Now that he has safely retired, Crandall's secret can be told.
His wife, Jan, carefully sewed a number into each of her husband's
jackets and trousers. With a quick peek, he could always be sure
that he was not heading to the battlefield wearing the pants from
Suit 2 with the jacket from Suit 5.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview, Crandall proudly pulled back his coat to
reveal the number 10 _ then stood up and turned down the top of his
trousers to show that, indeed, he had it right that day. &QL;

   At the July 1 celebration of PricewaterhouseCooper's first day
as a merged firm, Rocco Maggiotto, the global leader of the firm's
financial services practice, received thunderous applause from the
roughly 4,500 people assembled.
</P>
<P>
   But they were not cheering Maggiotto for his role as host of the
event, a breakfast at Tavern on the Green in Manhattan, but because
he had chosen to skip it. As he explained in a telephone call
broadcast to the crowd that morning, he had to drive his
12-year-old son to summer camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``The firm wants employees to make these kinds of judgment
calls,'' said Maggiotto, who shares the responsibility for his two
children with his wife, Kathleen Fisher, who works at a major
investment bank.
</P>
<P>
   And that wasn't some short-lived revolt against the corporate
grind. Just this month, Maggiotto bowed out of a dinner with the
firm's global management team to take his 8-year-old daughter on a
cruise around Manhattan.

   Top executives of Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide, based
in White Plains, appear to have rather fickle taste in housing.
When the chairman, Barry S. Sternlicht, moved to Greenwich, Conn.,
several years ago, he and his wife built a new house, abandoned the
project and then bought an existing house that ``unfortunately had
to be practically rebuilt,'' he wrote in the Harvard Business
School's 10-year reunion book from the class of 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Now, his newly appointed chief executive and close friend from
business school, Richard D. Nanula, has bought a house in Greenwich
for $6 million, but is renting elsewhere until it is renovated.
Juergen Bartels, another Starwood executive, also bought a big
house in the same neighborhood recently, and he, too, is renting
until the contractors are finished with a makeover. &QL;

AMERICANS WITHOUT HEALTH INSURANCE UP SHARPLY, TO 43 MILLION  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT PEAR    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Despite the booming economy, the number of people
without health insurance rose sharply last year, to 43.4 million,
and the proportion of Americans lacking coverage reached the
highest level in a decade, 16.1 percent, the Census Bureau reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   After rising slightly more than 1 million a year, on the
average, in the last decade, the number of uninsured people was up
1.7 million last year, Despite the booming economy, the number of
uninsured people was up 1.7 million last year, the largest increase
since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Medicaid rolls are down, and some employers have said they are
cutting back health benefits, especially for dependents of
employees.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Bennefield, a statistician at the Census Bureau, said the
data were somewhat surprising. ``In a healthy economy,'' he said,
``you'd think you would have more people with jobs, and that would
tend to increase coverage, so you'd see fewer people uninsured.''
</P>
<P>
   Even people with higher incomes are going without insurance.
Households with annual incomes of $75,000 or more accounted for
half the increase in the number of uninsured, the bureau said. The
number of people in these upper-income households without insurance
rose last year by 852,000, to 4.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau said that 8.1 percent of these higher-income
households were uninsured last year, up from 7.6 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The number of poor people without insurance stayed about the
same, 11.2 million. Nearly one-third of all poor people _ 31.6
percent _ were uninsured last year, about the same as in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Expanding health coverage has been a top priority for President
Clinton since he took office in 1993. Since his proposal for
universal health insurance died in September 1994, he has announced
dozens of initiatives to achieve that goal. But he has been unable
to stop the erosion in coverage, and Congress, which has passed
several laws to provide health benefits in recent years, appears
unlikely to do anything more in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials maintain that the situation would be
even worse without their efforts to guarantee coverage for children
and for workers who change or lose their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau said that 10.7 million children were uninsured
last year, about the same number as in 1996. Because of Medicare,
virtually all people 65 and older have insurance coverage. So it
was people 18 to 64 who account for the increase in the uninsured.
</P>
<P>
   People 18 to 24 are least likely to have coverage, the bureau
said. Thirty percent of these young adults were uninsured last
year, up from 28.9 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Hispanic Americans had the highest chance of being uninsured.
Thirty-four percent of Hispanic people lacked insurance last year,
compared with 21.5 percent of blacks and 12 percent of non-Hispanic
whites.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau had been planning to issue a report on the
data on Monday. But the raw data were posted on the Internet on
Thursday. A small organization of doctors tabulated and analyzed
the data and issued its findings Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's startling is the magnitude of the increase when the
economy was booming,'' said Dr. Steffie Woolhandler, a co-founder
of the organization, Physicians for a National Health Program. The
group advocates universal access to health care.
</P>
<P>
   Census officials and health policy experts suggested several
reasons for the growth in the number of uninsured:
</P>
<P>
   _ Welfare rolls have been shrinking for several years. People on
welfare automatically got Medicaid. But when they leave welfare,
they often take low-paying jobs with no health benefits. These
workers or their children may still be eligible for Medicaid, but
they do not realize it.
</P>
<P>
   _ Small businesses are creating most of the nation's new jobs.
But these businesses are far less likely than big companies to
provide health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   _ Health care costs and insurance costs are on the rise again.
Cost is the reason most often cited, by individuals and employers,
for not buying insurance.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Diane Rowland, executive director of Kaiser Commission on
Medicaid and the Uninsured, said: ``We are in a time of transition
and turmoil in welfare. While many states are trying to simplify
Medicaid enrollment procedures, there are still many barriers. Case
workers seem to be under greater pressure to find people jobs than
to assure they have health insurance coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   New York City has begun inspecting the homes of some people who
apply for Medicaid, to see if they misrepresented their income,
assets or living arrangements. City officials defend the technique
as a way to prevent fraud, but some advocates for the poor say it
is one more obstacle to getting health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rowland said that changes in welfare and immigration law had
deterred some people from applying for Medicaid. ``Noncitizens
often shy away from enrolling in Medicaid,'' she said. ``And
noncitizen parents may be reluctant to seek Medicaid even for
children who were born in this country and are eligible for
Medicaid as citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau's report is based on interviews with 50,000
households chosen to be representative of the nation as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   The bureau said that 10.8 percent of Americans reported having
Medicaid coverage last year, down from 11.8 percent in 1996. The
number of people on Medicaid declined by 2.5 million, to 29
million, the bureau said.
</P>
<P>
   Some people who have insurance are unaware of it and do not
report coverage, the bureau said. But such underreporting has
affected federal surveys for years and would not explain the
increase in the uninsured last year, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The government said that 43.3 percent of the poor were covered
by Medicaid at some time last year, down from 45.5 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Many poor people do not qualify for Medicaid. Many states set
income limits far below the poverty level. Childless adults are
often ineligible even if they are very poor.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau found that the number of people with
employer-sponsored health insurance rose last year, to 165.1
million, from 163.2 million in 1996. More people are working, and
employers may be providing health benefits for some of those
workers, even as they eliminate benefits for some dependents.

PROBLEMS PERSIST DESPITE REVAMP AT BOSTON NAACP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALISA VALDES-RODRIGUEZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In 1995, a state senate clerk named Leonard Alkins,
then 51, took charge of a sinking ship called the Boston branch of
the NAACP.
</P>
<P>
   As the first regional outpost for the nation's oldest civil
rights organization, Boston's branch once served as the model for
hundreds to follow. But by 1995, it had been crippled with
mismanagement, infighting, and scandal. Leaders didn't pay national
dues. They broke national bylaws, and were removed from office. The
branch fell into receivership, and the Massachusetts Avenue
building was abandoned, the paint left to peel in the sun.
</P>
<P>
   Now, three years after taking the helm, many say Alkins has done
the impossible: patched most of the leaks, and set the tarnished
tanker to sailing once again. National NAACP president and CEO
Kweisi Mfume will attend Boston's annual fundraising dinner at the
Marriott Hotel Saturday night _ a much-needed nod of approval.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, there are others who say that continued low
membership numbers, poor resources, and lack of appeal to people
under 35 mark the growing irrelevance of Boston's NAACP, whose
founding missions _ desegregation and civil rights _ may hold less
significance for a new generation.
</P>
<P>
   Although Alkins has apparently resuscitated the branch,
attracting to it dozens of new members who had avoided it in the
past, the branch still has a long way to go to regain its former
glory.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston chapter has no office, no central phone answered by a
person, no web site, only 600 members _ a number that has remained
constant since the time of scandal _ and a youth chapter that seems
to shrink every year.
</P>
<P>
   Some of this comes as a suprise to those who have noticed the
NAACP local branch, and Alkins, appearing more in local news media
as sources.
</P>
<P>
   But in spite of Alkins's efforts to organize the group, and to
make public statements on everything from racial discrimination at
the MBTA to affirmative action, the branch still lacks basic
resources. Chapter files are kept in boxes at Alkins's Brockton
home, and phone calls are picked up by a voice mail system he
monitors from his day job at the state house.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really unfair,'' said Thomas F. Welch, a real estate
developer and new member. ``One of the things we ought to do as
members is sit down with Lenny and staff the organization. Right
now he is the staff.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got the organization in his heart,'' said Darryl Settles,
restaurant owner and new member. ``But it hasn't been easy.''
</P>
<P>
   The difficulties stem in part from a lack of members and a lack
of funding, Alkins explained.
</P>
<P>
   Money remains short because donations to the local branch, a
501c4 nonprofit, are not tax-deductible. Donations to the national
branch, a 501c3 nonprofit, are tax-deductible. Because of this,
about 70 percent of money made from fundraising in Boston goes to
the national headquarters in Baltimore, Alkins said.
</P>
<P>
   But membership is an even more important issue. Even with new
recruits, the numbers are not growing. And among young people,
vital for survival of the branch, membership is shrinking, a fact
that Alkins says ``pains me more than any other.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Warren, a professor of economics and politics at
Northeastern University, and one of the dozens of members to join
since Alkins took over the Boston branch, says he thinks the
organization simply may not be relevant to young people anymore,
and must change its focus to include them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NAACP has a history of civil rights, we've defined it
narrowly in the past,'' Warren said. ``We wanted equal rights. We
wanted not to be segregated. It seems to me that's been
accomplished. We're no longer segregated in an absolute sense.
We've accomplished our mission as far as young people are
concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   But interviews with several teens in the Boston area showed that
issues of segregation and racism are alive and well for them.
However, many of them simply did not know what the NAACP stands
for.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is that the thing about the movie?'' asked Kelly Excellus, 14,
an 8th grader. Excellus also said she believed she had been denied
an after-school job this year because she was black, but felt
powerless to do anything about it.
</P>
<P>
   Tareesha Burton, 16 and a sophmore, said she knew about the
NAACP but said she had no interest in joining. ``Most people are
racist, and you can't change 85 percent of them,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Burton had learned about the NAACP from television when she saw
the NAACP Image Awards, which air on Black Entertainment Television
Saturday night. The national branch is trying to attract youth. The
show is co-hosted by actress Vanessa Williams and features the
trendy, turbaned singer Erykah Badu.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to figure out how to appeal to younger people,''
said Warren. ``We need to define civil rights in a broader sense,
because young people aren't going to join anything as amorphous as
we are right now. What Lenny has been doing with us these last
couple of years is try to redefine the mission statement. It's
happening, but slowly.''

 &HT;    ENVIRONMENTAL 'RIDERS' CLING TO APPROPRIATIONS BILLS
 &HT;    700&AMP;optional trim. With RIDERS-DATA.
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON - As Congress moves closer to its planned fall recess
without having passed funding bills for most of the government, a
showdown struggle is shaping up over environmental issues.
</P>
<P>
   That's because many of the must-pass appropriations bills still
pending in the House and Senate contain amendments - known as
``riders'' - that environmental groups contend would harm
wilderness areas, delay pollution cleanup and turn over valuable
resources to industries at bargain prices.
</P>
<P>
   Congress is scheduled to recess for the fall elections on Oct.
9. That day also marks the expiration of temporary legislation
funding nearly the entire government.
</P>
<P>
   Although environmental groups have obtained White House
commitments that President Clinton will veto bills that contain
particularly controversial riders, some fear that Clinton's
political problems in the Monica Lewinsky scandal could lead to an
unpredictable game of ``rider roulette'' between him and
congressional Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Potentially, we see the environment emerge as the focal point
of a major dispute over whether they're going to keep the
government open or not,'' said Greg Whetstone, a lobbyist for the
Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group.
</P>
<P>
   The standoff Whetstone and others fear could develop if
congressional Republicans decide to lump appropriations for several
different agencies into a single omnibus bill that included the
environmental riders, then recess and leave town.
</P>
<P>
   That would leave Clinton the choice of signing the bill or
vetoing it and shutting down a large part of the government until
members of Congress returned and either overrode the veto or passed
a different bill.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 13 separate appropriations bills that must be enacted to
keep the government running, only one - providing funds for
military construction - had been signed into law by President
Clinton by Friday. The rest were still awaiting approval by
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Legislative affairs specialists with environmental organizations
have counted 57 separate environmental riders, affecting everything
from logging practices to global warming.
</P>
<P>
   Provisions attached to appropriations bills by Alaska's two
senators and lone House member would protect illegal commercial
fishing in Glacier Bay National Park, require construction of
controversial roads through wilderness areas, impede parkland
acquisition in Alaska, speed up logging in the Tongass National
Forest and give up to 500,000 acres of federal land to the
University of Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   Another rider would delay efforts by the Interior Department to
require companies that mine for gold and other metals and minerals
on federal lands to meet new environmental standards, including
paying to restore damage to natural areas.
</P>
<P>
   Still another would delay an increase in royalties paid by oil
companies for oil taken from federal land.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, author of the royalty rider,
said the Interior Department was trying to a rewrite federal law
that spells out how oil company royalties are to be calculated at a
time when crude oil prices are at a 20-year low.
</P>
<P>
   (Begin optional trim for papers using the accompanying data
box.)
</P>
<P>
   A House amendment to the bill that provides funds for the
Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development
would prohibit the use of federal funds to reduce the ``greenhouse
gases'' believed responsible for global warming until the Senate
has ratified the Kyoto Protocol on climate change.
</P>
<P>
   Another rider would prohibit use of federal funds to encourage
developing countries to meet the provisions of the Kyoto Protocol,
even though provisions of the protocol giving those countries more
time to comply have been a chief reason for opposition to it in the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   A House rider would delay Environmental Protection Agency
regulations aimed at curbing mercury in air pollution from power
plants, opposed by the electric power industry. Another would block
plans to reintroduce grizzly bears to wilderness areas in Idaho and
Montana. Another would make it easier for developers to build on
fragile barrier islands in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   A rider would prevent the U.S. Forest Service from raising the
rent it charges celebrities such as actor Bruce Willis for vacation
cottages in Sawtooth National Forest, Idaho. After the General
Accounting Office revealed that some wealthy leaseholders were
paying the government as little as $156 a year, the Forest Service
set out to increase the rent to as much as $28,125 a year.
</P>
<P>
   (End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   The National Environmental Trust charged Friday that the
Interior Department appropriations bill alone was loaded with
``lobbyist-written taxpayer rip-offs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The smart thing for Congress to do would be to pass a
continuing resolution to keep the government in operation and head
for the hills,'' said Whetstone of the National Resources Defense
Council. ``But there are powerful voices over there, especially in
the Senate leadership, that want to take advantage of the
president's problems because they think he won't shut down the
government .''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Francis of the Wilderness Society said he was afraid
White House lobbyists will negotiate away many of the riders and
Clinton will then sign an omnibus bill containing others.
</P>
<P>
   ``There may be some issues the White House will compromise on
and some the Republicans will drop for now,'' Francis said. ``If
that happens, the chances of us getting a veto are somewhere
between slim and none.''

HILLARY CLINTON WELCOMED BY OREGON DEMOCRATS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADAM PERTMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. _ The Oregon Democrats running for governor and
Congress haven't disguised their views of President Clinton: They
support his policies, condemn his adultery, and prefer that he stay
in Washington rather than campaign for them.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, however, they made it equally clear that their opinion
of Hillary Rodham Clinton is quite different.
</P>
<P>
   At the first lady's appearances for three Democratic candidates
here, the scandal afflicting the president not only had not
undermined his wife's political effectiveness, it had turned her
into an even bigger draw as the November elections approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because his public presence has been tainted greatly, she's
going to have to step up to the plate and do more,'' Janna Loper,
an official with a state agency called Children First for Oregon,
said after hearing Mrs. Clinton speak Friday morning. ``I have to
admit I didn't expect much before she began ... but now I know she
can rise above it all and be very effective.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has always been a skilled public speaker and campaigner,
able to rouse an audience _ especially the women in it _ about as
well as her husband can.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the president all but housebound by Democrats
nationwide afraid he'll do them more harm than good (except perhaps
as a fund-raiser), the campaign spotlight is effectively turning
onto Vice President Al Gore and Hillary Clinton. And to many
Democratic candidates, the first lady is the first choice, because
she can point to the administration's accomplishments without being
blamed for the affair that has tarnished her husband.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the rank-and-file Democrats interviewed before and after
Clinton's appearances here Friday said that, if anything, she has
become a more sympathetic and appealing figure as a result of the
Monica S. Lewinsky controversy. ``She the one who was cheated on,
but she's still so dignified, so articulate, and so strong. It's
very impressive,'' said Libby Upham, a writer for a local
television station's web page.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons for Clinton's apparent ascent to campaigner-in-chief
have been on display this week on a bicoastal tour for candidates
from New York to Oregon. She has drawn big crowds and standing
ovations at each stop, and has raised hudreds of thousands of
dollars for Democratic candidates.
</P>
<P>
   In Oregon Friday, she started with a rousing speech on behalf of
congressional hopeful David Wu at a child-care forum at Portland
State University. Then she rode down the street for a $250-a-plate
luncheon for Wu and, at the same hotel, private meet-and-greet
sessions at which supporters of Governor John Kitzhaber and US
Representative Darlene Hooley contributed to their re-election
efforts by paying $500 to $1,000 each to get their pictures taken
with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, Clinton flew to San Francisco to meet up with the
president and make the final campaign appearance of her current
tour. Aides said she would maintain a full schedule of speeches and
fund-raisers until November.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton tailors her message at every stop to address the central
issues of the campaign she's trying to promote, and takes aim at
her favored candidates' Republican opponents. She invariably
stresses, however, widespread Democratic concerns that the Lewinsky
scandal will help the GOP by keeping Democrats away from the polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do everything you can to make sure that everyone you know
turns out on election day,'' she said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   All three of the Democratic candidates here have expressed their
preference that the president not campaign for them, asserting that
the public and the press would be so focused on the Lewinsky
scandal that their own concerns wouldn't get through. Hillary
Clinton, on the other hand, wasn't asked once about her husband's
travails Friday.
</P>
<P>
   She did make one fleeting reference to Republicans' continuing
discussions about whether to start impeachment hearings against the
president. And she did so to take a partisan shot, her voice laced
with sarcasm.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't get them to focus on education,'' Clinton told
about 200 listeners at the Wu luncheon, who had greeted her with a
sustained standing ovation and whoops of support. ``They were busy
doing other things of grave concern to our country.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hillary Clinton's obvious popularity among the Democratic
faithful hasn't kept detractors away in each city she has visited.
But there weren't many on the streets of this Democratic stronghold
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps a dozen protesters, carrying signs calling for the
president's impeachment and telling voters ``Don't let Hillary Wu
you,'' marched outside the hotel where Clinton was speaking.
</P>
<P>
   One demonstrator, Pat Sharp, said she drove 90 miles from the
town of Albany to make sure people understand ``that there are
mothers and grandmothers, like me, who disapprove of Hillary's
behavior, too.'' Sharp, a hairstylist, said Clinton should have
publicly chastised the president when she learned he had engaged in
an affair with an intern.
</P>
<P>
   ``She could have come out and said, `He's my husband and I love
him, but his behavior's deplorable,'' said Sharp. ``Now, not having
done that, how can she look her daughter in the face ... when she
knows what her dad has done?''

CLINTON AND JONES NEGOTIATIONS CONTINUE; AGREEMENT COULD BE NEAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Lawyers for Paula Jones and for President Clinton
on Friday appeared close to an agreement to settle the sexual
misconduct lawsuit, which has led to the impeachment crisis
confronting Clinton, advisers to both parties said.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Mrs. Jones' lawyers rejected a $500,000 offer Clinton
made this week to have her withdraw her lawsuit, and they gave the
White House until Tuesday morning to sweeten the pot, the advisers
said. Earlier this month, the White House rejected a request from
the Jones camp to pay $1 million to settle the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   A senior White House adviser said that the suddenly vigorous
effort to put an end to the lawsuit was being propelled by a
political calculation that to do so would help Clinton present the
best possible case to Congress to battle any impeachment
proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, one of the staunchest opponents to any kind of
concession to Mrs. Jones _ Hillary Rodham Clinton _ has now acceded
to the idea of a settlement, Clinton associates say.
</P>
<P>
   A settlement, which appeared elusive for years, is a strong
possibility now, because of the profoundly changed political _ and
some would moral _ standing of Clinton since he publicly
acknowledged a sexual liaison with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   That is a major reason Mrs. Jones lawyers say she has dropped
her demand that any settlement include some sort of apology from
the president or some explicit acknowledgment that her claim about
Clinton's behavior was true. Her previous insistence on an apology
had always proved an insurmountable obstacle.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Jones' advisers say she no longer feels a need to prove
that Clinton behaves in a sexually irresponsible manner, given the
avalanche of detailed material about his relationship with Ms.
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``The events of the last several weeks and months have
vindicated Paula Jones' case,'' said John W. Whitehead, the
president of the Rutherford Institute, which is funding Mrs. Jones'
legal efforts. He said that any settlement from the president would
constitute an admission of Mrs. Jones' allegations, if not an
apology. Mrs. Jones contended that in 1991, when Clinton was
governor of Arkansas, he invited her to his hotel suite in Little
Rock, and when alone with her, made a crude sexual advance. Clinton
has always denied the allegation.
</P>
<P>
   Whitehead said that he was hopeful a settlement would be
reached, but he cautioned that the talks could still fall apart.
</P>
<P>
   Senior White House officials expressed a similar mix of hope and
caution. The advisers said that Mrs. Clinton had only recently been
persuaded to allow negotiations aimed at settling the lawsuit after
firmly resisting such a course since the beginning because that
could be taken as evidence of wrongdoing. One aide said that Mrs.
Clinton, who has been deeply anxious over mounting legal bills, had
to be assured that the money for a settlement could come out of the
legal defense fund that has been created for the Clintons.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, one adviser to the Clintons said, there is a
feeling that a settlement would not affect the president's standing
with the public, which has already taken that part of his character
into account in digesting the Starr report about his liaison with
Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we go before Congress on the impeachment matter, the Paula
Jones suit is now still on the table,'' said a Clinton adviser, who
spoke on condition of anonymity. ``Anything we take off the table
may be enormously helpful.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends of Mrs. Jones said she is eager to reach a settlement
and be done with the matter. Another incentive for her is that if
the appeals court does not reinstate the case, she would get
nothing after four years of high-profile litigation.

FIRM PROVIDES EMERGENCY AID DURING SOLO YACHT RACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ARNOLD  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Before the last around-the-world solo sailboat race, Mark
Schrader packed a finger-amputating device in his first-aid kit so
he could discard a crushed digit then get on with the racing.
</P>
<P>
   Not until he was far at sea did it occur to Schrader that the
stainless steel device, given to him by a doctor, required two
hands in good working order to manipulate the amputation levers.
Bad medical planning, concluded Schrader.
</P>
<P>
   He has since become director of the 27,000-mile Around Alone
race departing Saturday from Charleston, S.C., and this is partly
why Schrader has hired physicians from WorldClinic Inc., based in
Boston, to coordinate medical care for the 16 competitors about to
embark on one of the most gruelling, fatiguing, solo sailing
competitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Advances in technology have made it easier not only to send
distress calls around the world, but also deliver medical help by
remote control,'' said Schrader, director of a race that, because
of the storms it encounters, has been likened to riding the spin
cycle of a clothes washer. Consider, for example, that the boats
will sail in the shadow of Hurricane Georges and are on a collision
course with three other hurricanes and two tropical depressions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's face it. Health happens when you're 60 days from land,''
he added.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1982, this race _ formerly known as the BOC Challenge _
has been run every four years, claiming more than a dozen boats and
the lives of two sailors. The tally does not include contestants
such as the late Mike Plant of Jamestown, R.I., who died alone
trying to get to the start of the 1992 race when his boat
apparently flipped.
</P>
<P>
   Around Alone is a race where small lacerations, bruises, and
infections can quickly become big problems. For example, during the
1986-1987 contest, Pentti Salmi, a Finnish sailor, mildly scraped
his arm on a barnacle. Within days, an allergic reaction swelled
his arm to the thickness of his thigh. Fever-ridden and far at sea
with a useless, pain-throbbing arm, Salmi could not trim sails or
take down his spinnaker.
</P>
<P>
   It so happened that another sailor, Jean Luc Van den Heede of
France, was several hours ahead, the needed medicine and syringe in
his first aid kit. But the men, struggling to communicate by radio,
had difficulty developing a transfer and useage plan because
neither spoke the other's language.
</P>
<P>
   They eventually worked out a strategy: The Frenchman stalled
long enough for the ailing Finn to catch up. When the Finn careened
past, spinnaker flying, the Frenchman threw the medicine and
syringe across to his boat.
</P>
<P>
   The package was wrapped in a Playboy Magazine centerfold. A red
``X'' on her anatomy marked the proper spot for the shot.
</P>
<P>
   Race organizers have concluded there is a better way to deal
with medical emergencies for solo sailors at sea. Enter
WorldClinic.
</P>
<P>
   Incorporated last spring, WorldClinic has cornered a niche
market on the Seven Seas, combining pre-race medical evaluations
with state of the art FAX, E-mail and satellite telephone
communication technology. Now, for instance, a racer will be able
to wash and suture his or her wounds using digitized photographs
and instructions dispensed from Dr. Daniel Carlin's office at New
England Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   Carlin concedes there may be better ways to deliver health care;
then again, there are probably better ways than riding 50-foot
waves through a southern gale to see the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are not your normal hospital walk-ins,'' Carlin pointed
out. These clients clean and stitch first, then tend to sails,
then, if time permits, deal with the pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``With computers, we can move very specific, high quality
medical information and graphics back and forth to patients very
far away,'' Carlin said. ``They no longer need to set sail with a
copy of Grey's Anatomy.''
</P>
<P>
   Carlin's partner is Dr. Ronald Ruffing, who, similar to Carlin,
is affiliated with the New England Medical Center's Division of
Geographic Medicine and Infectious Disease; Dr. Davidson Hamer,
director of the division's Traveler's Health Service, consults for
WorldClinic.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; They work in an office where pins and tiny flags in a
wall-sized world map indicate the location of about 25 clients
(mostly sailors, with a few landlocked contractors sprinkled in)
and the nearest hospitals should an emergency arise.
</P>
<P>
   WorldClinic charges anywhere from $500 to $1,500 annually for
its 24-hour-a-day consulting service. Generally, the higher the
health risk, the steeper the fee. Indeed, knowing a client's
medical history, gleaned from medical screenings the likes of which
Around Alone sailors experienced earlier this week in Charleston,
is key to early diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   For example, not long ago a client and her husband were sailing
across the Caribbean Sea when she began to suffer an earache. She
had been swimming, and Carlin surmised from an earlier examination
that because she had a small ear canal, salt water had created an
infection that probably would lead to deafness or worse if the
problem was not addressed immediately. There was already temporary
hearing loss. The client was hundreds of miles from the nearest
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Via the internet, Carlin located, then transmitted, an image of
the inner ear that, coupled with his instructions on a satellite
telephone, allowed the sailor's husband to perform the minor
surgery required to relieve the pressure, save her hearing _ and
perhaps her sanity from the pain.
</P>
<P>
   The Around Alone competitors are scheduled to sail with medical
kits prepared by WorldClinic. Equipment includes skin staplers
(taking the place of sutures), staple removers, allergy and
antibiotics medications, and nitroglycerine tablets for symtoms of
angina, to name a few. Some racers are taking a variety of straps
and harnesses to suspend themselves from parts of their boats
should they need to reset a dislocated joint. It's not a race for
the queasy.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least there are no more finger saws,'' said Schrader. ``Now
the sailor just dials direct, rigs up the speakerphone, and follows
the doctor's orders.'' Hopefully with all fingers functional.

   RUNDA, Kenya _ As FBI agents continue their investigation into
the bombing last month of the U.S. Embassy in Kenya, they have
returned to a fashionable, two-story white house with a red tile
roof in this Nairobi suburb, which they combed over after the first
suspects were captured.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday agents walked around the back yard and examined the
two-car garage, talking among themselves about whether it was large
enough for a pickup truck, people who were present said Friday.
Small trucks were used in the embassy bombing in Nairobi and the
one in Tanzania on the same day, according to the indictments
handed down in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI is intensely interested in the house because in the
weeks before the bombing, the tenant was one Haroun Fazil,
according to neighbors and the landlady. Fazil, a citizen of the
Comoros, has been charged with having orchestrated the Aug. 7
bombing here, which killed 258 people, including 12 Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment of Fazil says that he operated out of a ``villa
in the vicinity of Nairobi,'' and that it was in the villa that the
bomb was built. The indictment does not further identify the villa,
but it is in New Runda Estates, a 5-year-old development on the
edge of Karura Forest about eight miles north of the U.S. Embassy
in downtown Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those who live in the 243 houses are expatriates,
working for various agencies of the United Nations, which has its
compound on the other side of the forest.
</P>
<P>
   Judging by his accounts of his activities at the house in the
week of the bombing, Fazil is a man with proverbial nerves of
steel. Two days after driving away with his wife and family, he
apparently used the same vehicle to lead the bomb-laden vehicle to
the embassy. Then after the attack he returned to supervise the
cleaning of the house, which had little in it, except for a
television set.
</P>
<P>
   But the house, with hardwood floors and a family room that opens
through sliding glass doors to a well-kept garden, may not have
been cleaned well enough. The FBI found ``large amounts of gray
powder,'' which is similar to aluminum powder used in bombs, the
indictment says.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors said that young Arab-looking men came and went from
No. 43, and that two stayed in the servants' quarters _ two small,
concrete-floored rooms with tiny windows, behind the garage.
</P>
<P>
   One of the men was Mohamed Rashed Daoud Al-'Owhali, according to
neighbors who identified him from photographs that have appeared in
the newspapers and on television here. 'Owhali has been indicted in
connection with the bombing, and has admitted that he drove in the
vehicle carrying the bomb to the embassy, and then threw a grenade
at the guard before fleeing on foot.
</P>
<P>
   Fazil moved into the house in May, with his wife and their
4-year-old daughter and 2-year-old son, neighbors recalled. They
kept to themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``They tended to hide,'' said Omega Wycliffe, the night watchman
at a property across the street, who said he had been interviewed
by the FBI. ``He refused to even let people stand there,'' he said,
pointing to the black gate, suspended between white pillars, which
opens on to the property. He said the mosque did not want people to
see his wife. She was fully covered in black, except for her eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Fazil said his work was ``of the mosque,'' said John Simide, who
earned $4 a day as a gardener for Fazil. ``He didn't seem to want
anyone in the house.''
</P>
<P>
   Fazil drove a white Datsun pickup, neighbors said.
</P>
<P>
   One day Fazil said to his gardener: ``I'm going. My work is
finished.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he loaded his wife, two children and ailing father-in-law
into the Datsun, drove down the short hill, turned right, right
again, up a hill and out of the suburb. That was Wednesday, Aug. 5,
Simide said.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later Fazil drove a white pickup truck toward the U.S.
Embassy, showing the way for the bomb-laden vehicle that followed,
according to the indictment.
</P>
<P>
   The blast at 10:30 that Friday morning was heard in New Runda,
though the residents had no idea what it was.
</P>
<P>
   By noon Fazil was back at the house and asked Simide to find a
woman to help clean the house.
</P>
<P>
   While the woman, Pauline Wambui, was sweeping and dusting, Fazil
turned on the television. The news had pictures of the carnage and
destruction downtown.
</P>
<P>
   ```It seems there was a bomb in town which destroyed buildings
and killed people,''' Simide recalled Fazil saying.
</P>
<P>
   Fazil said he did not have money to pay Simide. He gave him the
television.
</P>
<P>
   Then he got back in the white pickup and drove off.

TRIBE LOOKS GOOD TO RED SOX FANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ON THE ROAD TO CLEVELAND OR TEXAS _ Go, Tribe.
</P>
<P>
   This should be the mantra of Red Sox fans this weekend. Take a
good look at those standings, you citizens of Sox Nation. The
Rangers have been gaining like mad on the Indians and could wind up
being Boston's first-round playoff opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Trust me when I tell you that the Sons of Jimy Williams do not
want any part of the Texas Rangers right now.
On-the-road-to-Cleveland-or-Texas, I spent three days in California
watching the Rangers beat up the Angels and take their lunch money.
It was nasty stuff, an aggregate score of 25-3 _ on Anaheim's home
field. It was mildly reminiscent of when the Yankees savaged the
Red Sox four straight times (by a count of 42-9) at Fenway in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers went into Friday night's game at Seattle with a
four-game winning streak and eight victories in their last 10.
Texas leads the American League in hitting (.289) and ranks second
(to the Yankees) in runs. The pitching staff is coming around with
the addition of Todd Stottlemyre and a 20-game winner you've
probably never heard of (Rick Helling). They've got a proven World
Series closer in John Wetteland and their lineup features certain
American League MVP Juan Gonzalez, who has knocked in 157 runs,
plus Ivan Rodriguez, Will Clark, and Rusty Greer.
</P>
<P>
   A week ago, the AL wild-card winner was a lock to play
Cleveland, but the Tribe got swept in New York and shut out by the
Twins Thursday night and carried a mere one-game lead over the
Indians into Friday night's action. If Cleveland and Texas finish
with the same record, Boston plays Texas because the Rangers won
their season series with the Tribe.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a good development. If you are a Red Sox fan, you
want Cleveland. Boston was 8-3 against the Indians this year but
only 6-5 against Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox don't need any additional pressure in this postseason.
It's bad enough that they'll be lugging a major league-record
13-game postseason losing streak into Cleveland or Texas. The Sox
have not won a playoff or World Series game since Bruce Hurst beat
the Mets in Game 5 at Fenway in '86. Boston has not won since Bill
Buckner's error (speaking of Buckner, Chicago Cubs outfielder Brant
Brown _ the man who dropped the infamous fly ball Wednesday _ said,
``You can tag me all you want, but someone dropped a `Buckner' tag
on me, and I wasn't appreciative of that'').
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland is the way to go. The Indians will pitch Jaret Wright
and Dwight Gooden in the first two games of the playoffs. After
that, it's a jump ball for Tribe manager Mike Hargrove.
</P>
<P>
   While the Rangers are playing their best ball of the season and
the Indians sputter, the Red Sox have wobbled in the final month
(10-14 before Friday night). The ever-reliable Nomar Garciaparra
knocked in only three runs over a 20-game stretch and started
throwing the ball away (25 errors). Pedro Martinez yielded the Cy
Young trophy to Roger Clemens, losing three straight in September,
then giving up three homers in his final start. Mo Vaughn is still
a candidate to win the batting title, but he goes into the playoffs
with that 1995 Cleveland Doughnut (0 for 14, seven strikeouts)
hanging around his neck. The Sox are without a dependable No. 4
starter and there's concern that the Darren Lewis and Mike Benjamin
types have played over their heads too long already.
</P>
<P>
   Until Friday, it was premature to speculate on the playoff
opponent. Sox fans were concerned with clinching a playoff spot and
not paying much attention to whom Boston would play.
</P>
<P>
   But now it matters. A lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been paying attention,'' said Montreal coach Tommy
Harper, a Red Sox loyalist still. ``And it looks to me like Texas
is the team that nobody wants to play right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Go, Tribe.

 &HT;    Flu vaccine: Get one soon to beat the bug
 &HT;    By Lillian Lee Kim
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- It's barely cool enough to think about wearing a
jacket, but once flu season arrives, it'll be too late to cover
yourself.
</P>
<P>
   Influenza, a contagious and potentially deadly lung disease, can
be prevented by a yearly vaccination _ but you must be vaccinated
before mid-November, when the flu season starts.
</P>
<P>
   This fall, as part of a statewide immunization effort with the
American Lung Association, more than 1,000 health care providers
will offer flu vaccines. Some Kroger and CVS stores also will offer
shots.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. vaccine contains inactivated, noninfectious flu viruses
from three strains: the Harbin type B and two type A strains,
Beijing and Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Those allergic to eggs cannot receive the vaccine, since it is
made with eggs. Acutely ill people with fever should wait until
they recover to be vaccinated.
</P>
<P>
   To help counter historically low immunization rates among
African-American people 65 years and older, the Clark Atlanta
University Horizons Project is offering flu and pneumonia vaccines
from 10:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. today at Quality Living Services, 4001
Danforth Road in Atlanta. Those eligible should bring their
Medicare cards or numbers.
</P>
<P>
   For information about the Horizons immunization drive, call
404-880-6203.
</P>
<P>
   To find out about flu shot locations throughout the state, call
the American Lung Association at 1-800-586-4872 (LUNG-USA), or

ZENGA LOOKS TO NEXT SEASON WITH FINAL GAME AGAINST METROSTARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Walter Zenga's five-game coaching career
began last month. Velibor ``Bora'' Milutinovic's 21-year coaching
career started in Mexico City and has taken him to teams in Africa,
Central and South America, Europe, and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Both Zenga and Milutinovic have made their reputations on the
world stage, in high-stakes competition, far from Foxboro Stadium,
where they will be matched on the final weekend of Major League
Soccer's third regular season.
</P>
<P>
   For Zenga's Revolution, Saturday night's meeting with the
MetroStars in their 1998 finale is a platform to launch them into
next season. For Milutinovic's MetroStars, this is a chance to
become acquainted with their new coach and to prepare them for
their playoff opener at Columbus Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, there is a sense of anticlimax about the match,
though a crowd of more than 20,000 is expected. The Revolution were
eliminated from playoff contention last week and are in last place,
2 points behind Tampa Bay, in the Eastern Conference. The
MetroStars clinched a playoff berth last month but lost six
successive games before firing coach Alfonso Mondelo.
</P>
<P>
   Milutinovic's hiring was announced Monday, and his first
practice with the MetroStars was Tuesday. Though he has made his
reputation on the national team level _ he is the only coach to
have led four teams (Mexico, Costa Rica, the US, and Nigeria) past
the first round of the World Cup finals _ he has been less
successful with club teams in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   After a playing career in Yugoslavia, France, Switzerland, and
Mexico, Milutinovic used his coaching experience at UNAM Pumas in
Mexico City to vault him into the Mexican national team job for the
1986 World Cup. Mexico, playing at home, had its best tournament
under Milutinovic, advancing to the quarterfinals before losing on
penalty kicks to West Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Milutinovic then had brief stops at Udinese in Italy and Velez
Sarsfeld in Argentina before returning to the international game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bora is one of the greats,'' Zenga said Friday. ``He really
deserves all the recognition he gets. In Italy, he is regarded as a
sort of mythical figure.''
</P>
<P>
   But Milutinovic's notoriety borders on novelty status at times.
He has had great accomplishments with small teams, exemplified by
his leading Costa Rica to two victories before second-round
elimination against Czechoslovakia in the 1990 World Cup in Italy.
Milutinovic was rightly admired for that, while Italy and Zenga
were vilified after a semifinal elimination by Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   Milutinovic and Zenga last met in April 1997, when Milutinovic
coached Mexico in a 2-2 tie against the US in a World Cup qualifier
and Zenga was playing for the Revolution at Foxboro Stadium. Then
Milutinovic seemed split in his allegiances, since he had coached
many of the US players from 1991-95, and he was being treated as a
lame duck by many in the Mexican federation. Several of his former
players will be involved in Saturday night's match, including the
Revolution's Mike Burns, Damian, and Joe-Max Moore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bora is a great motivator,'' Damian said. ``When I was playing
for Mexico, I had not seen my family for about a year. He showed us
a film before the game of my mother saying she missed me and good
luck in the game. That's the kind of thing that makes you want to
jump right out onto the field and give everything you've got and
more.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution have 29 points, 4 fewer than in their first
season ... Midfielder Ivan McKinley is doubtful with a right knee
strain ... Eduardo Hurtado, the MetroStars' Ecuadoran
international, is out with a broken nose.

 &HT;    Holiday Inn owners told of need to improve
 &HT;    By Shelia Poole
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ Thousands of hotel owners and operators got a pat
on the back and a stern lecture Friday on the need to continue to
improve.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas R. Oliver, chairman and chief executive officer of Bass
Hotels &AMP; Resorts, the parent company of Dunwoody-based Holiday Inn,
said its aggressive eight-year push to improve quality and customer
service was on target but franchisees can not afford to rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Competition is intensifying,'' Oliver said at the Bass Hotels
&AMP; Resorts worldwide conference. ``We're all running harder for
fewer dollars, pounds and yen.''
</P>
<P>
   About 3,000 hotel owners and operators attended the conference.
Bass acquired Holiday Inn in 1990. Its brands include Holiday Inn,
Holiday Inn Express, Crowne Plaza and Inter-Continental.
</P>
<P>
   In order to become more competitive, Holiday Inn, which ranked
as one of the lowest rated mid-priced hotels in a Consumer Reports
survey recently, is in the midst of an aggressive improvement
program. Franchisees have been told they must meet higher standards
_ or else.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, about 100 hotels closed because they failed to
meet the new standards, and 600 Holiday Inns have been renovated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Oliver is right on track,'' Emerson Hoffman of the Natala
Corp. in Tifton, Ga., which owns two Holiday Inns in Georgia. ``I
think we have given this business to our competitors with our own
deficiencies. I think Bass is committed to regaining the market
share that we've lost over the last 15 to 20 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Bert Patel, who owns a Holiday Inn Express in Lexington, S.C.,
agreed. ``They're giving the older, tired-looking properties a
fresh look. Every dollar they invest, they get back.''
</P>
<P>
   Bass is launching its new extended stay brand, Staybridge
Suites. The first will open in Alpharetta in November.

EX-UNION LEADER FACES CHARGE IN UNUSUAL CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RIC KAHN   AND STEVEN WILMSEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Captured by a surveillance camera this month, the image
was bizarre and unsettling: A middle-aged balding man in a business
suit casting furtive glances, darting between pay phones, his hand
tapping the receiver but his lips never moving _ at least when the
camera catches his face.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the person who believes he received almost 700 crank calls
from that man claims he has unmasked the caller seen driving away
from those phone banks in a blue Massachusetts Turnpike Authority
Taurus with the number 98 license plate. It is, he contends, none
other than Domenic Bozzotto, the legendary former bearded boss of
the Boston hotel workers union who is now a clean-shaven Mass Pike
manager with a company car.
</P>
<P>
   Bozzotto, 58, denies making the harassing phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   For almost two decades Bozzotto had nurtured a mystique of a
working-class streetfighter battling corporate kings; a militant
merry prankster ready to brandish baseball bats against scabs or,
according to one memorable allegation, unleash rodents in hotels to
bring home higher wages to the maids who toiled in the ``back of
the house'' of Boston's hotels.
</P>
<P>
   But now the would-be leaders of Local 26, once hailed for aiming
daggers at hotel management's jugular, are at each other's throats.
</P>
<P>
   The man pointing fingers at Bozzotto, it turns out, is not a
hotel owner but a fellow hotel worker _ a fresh-faced 35-year-old
waiter named Andrew McLeod, who is running his second insurgent
race for president of Local 26 against Bozzotto's protege. McLeod's
charges recast Bozzotto from a lion of the labor movement to a
snake turning on one of his own; an immigrant workers' demigod
reduced to making prank calls to a longshot candidate who
questioned Bozzotto's legacy.
</P>
<P>
   In filing a harassment complaint that will be heard next month
in Boston Municipal Court, which may decide whether McLeod's tape
is part of an elaborate hoax or a ``gotcha'' video, McLeod has
positioned himself as a Bozzotto of the '90s, a young reformer with
multicultural connections railing against an entrenched union
leadership he accuses of mismanagement and using dirty tricks to
stifle dissent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pathetic,'' says McLeod.
</P>
<P>
   During the '80s, Bozzotto created an image as the radical bad
boy of Boston's labor movement. Using high-profile, high-pressure
tactics, he took up the cause of immigrant hotel workers in the
back of the house with the same fervor of civil-rights activists
fighting for those forced to ride the back of the bus.
</P>
<P>
   Taking to the manicured front lawns of hotel owners with raucus
picketers, Bozzotto won for underclass workers a host of benefits,
from higher wages to an education fund, and a landmark
affordable-housing trust.
</P>
<P>
   By the early '90s, however, Bozzotto found himself further
isolated on the fringes of labor's frontier, shunned by labor
progressives who accused him of selling out by supporting the hotly
contested 1990 tax rollback petition and embracing Republican
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Bozzotto made good on his long-stated intention to
leave Local 26, but not before guiding his hand-picked successor,
Janice Loux, to a resounding victory over McLeod 749-146.
</P>
<P>
   Now, McLeod is again challenging Loux in a spring election, and
seems intent on taking down the presumed power behind the throne,
accusing the man who walked the streets of solidarity with Cesar
Chavezcq of launching phoney phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   Ludicrous, say Bozzotto backers, who portray McLeod as a tool of
old-guard ``front of the house'' waitresses and doormen, a
candidate trying to build a name by tearing down Bozzotto's.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's irrelevant,'' said Bruce Marks, a former Bozzotto aide,
of McLeod. ``He's not a threat to anybody but himself.''
</P>
<P>
   From his downtown office as the turnpike authority's
$75,000-a-year director of employee relations, Bozzotto denies
McLeod's allegations, saying he doesn't even know his home phone
number.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of it is true,'' he said. ``There will be a hearing and
we'll show that.''
</P>
<P>
   And he derides McLeod as unworthy of his wrath, saying: ``I have
not harassed this kid, there's no need to harass this kid. He lost
8-to-1.''
</P>
<P>
   But, others say, perhaps McLeod's allegations of union
mismanagement _ from questions about pensions and retirement plans
to whether membership numbers have been inflated _ just got under
Bozzotto's skin.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's true, it's the same old Bozzotto,'' said Joseph
Faherty, former president of the Massachusetts AFL-CIO. ``It's the
same tactics. This time he's just turning it around against his own
cause _ what used to be his cause.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucy Festa, a onetime Bozzotto ally in Local 26 turned foe, said
once a union gets accustomed to using strong-arm tactics, it's hard
to let go.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you disagree with Domenic, &UR;  &LR; that's the end of you,'' said
Festa, 62, who claimed that after her falling out with Bozzotto her
phone would ring all night, and her car was vandalized with
Superglue.
</P>
<P>
   Bozzotto acknowledges he could well be the man on McLeod's
video, the one seen making calls outside the Walk Hill Market near
his home in Boston's Hyde Park section and then hopping into a car
with his Pike license plate. After all, Bozzotto said, he routinely
buys lottery tickets and uses public phones there to conduct family
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a car phone and don't have a cellular phone,'' he
said. ``I make pay phone calls.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bozzotto flatly rejects McLeod's charges of mismanagement,
saying the union's many enemies would have produced an indictment
already if there was any hint of financial wrongdoing. Loux did not
return phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's just trying to neutralize my ability to campaign
for her,'' Bozzotto said.
</P>
<P>
   And he denounces the dirty-trickster label. ``We reveled in
being tough, taking no quarter,'' he said. ``We never reveled in
being underhanded or shadowy....In your face between the eyes is
not dirty tricks. Organizing the workers to use their strengths for
winning benefits is not dirty tricks.''
</P>
<P>
   But, McLeod says, this may be: Inundating his home with
unsolicited CDs and magazine subscriptions, and making 683 phone
calls to his home since June. The caller never spoke, said McLeod,
but made unintelligible noises that sounded like scraping and
sawing. ``Trying to wear me down,'' said McLeod.
</P>
<P>
   But the faster the calls came, McLeod said, the harder he
campaigned. ``It's a Tao philosophy,'' he said. ``You take the
energy being given to you, and instead of fighting it, you go with
it.''
</P>
<P>
   McLeod said he traced the calls, taped and timed the messages,
and dispatched a private investigator with a video camera to a
cluster of phones in the city's Jamaica Plain section.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 8, McLeod said, he got a suspicious call at home and
alerted the private eye. Hidden behind tinted glass, the video
camera captured the image of a man making a call from one phone,
walking 20 feet and making two more calls from a second phone, and
then driving two blocks to a third phone.
</P>
<P>
   McLeod said his caller ID traced the incoming calls to those
same phones.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as he watches the video roll from his tiny TV, McLeod's
anger grows, his polite speech turning profane.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is the man,'' he shouts, mouthing allegations of
skullduggery that linger over Local 26.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going forward, we're going to change the union,'' he
adds, his voice rising. ``I'm going to be a fighter. This should be
a lesson to anybody not to fool with us.''

 &HT;    More jet orders may give lift to Lockheed
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The chief executive of Lockheed Martin Corp. picked a
good day to visit the company's Marietta plant and ride on the new
and improved C-130J cargo plane.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a wonderful experience,'' Vance D. Coffman, chairman
and CEO of Bethesda, Md.-based Lockheed Martin, said Friday after a
40-minute flight in which he got a pilot's-eye view.
</P>
<P>
   Better yet for the Marietta plant was news that Congress may add
six C-130Js worth $482 million to the defense spending bill for the
upcoming fiscal year. The Clinton administration had asked for one
C-130J.
</P>
<P>
   House and Senate negotiators agreed on the boost to speed
replacement of aging models, Bloomberg News reported. The bill
isn't yet final, but totals rarely change after joint negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The seven additional planes would lift C-130J orders from 83 to
90, with 34 by the U.S. military. Lockheed Martin developed the
updated plane, which features new engines and cockpit technology,
at its own expense.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Aviation Administration certified the model just
this month after several delays. The Marietta plant is producing
about two C-130Js a month but could boost that rate as orders
warrant.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional negotiators also voted to spend $771 million to
continue Lockheed Martin's F-22 fighter program, only $14 million
less than requested. Final assembly of the F-22 is done in
Marietta.
</P>
<P>
   Coffman, promoted to CEO in April, said he's confident those two
programs will remain on track and sustain the plant.
</P>
<P>
   ``The C-130J is in demand around the world,'' he said. The
company took the plane on a world marketing tour earlier this year.
It has been asked by 28 countries to submit sales proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Coffman briefly flew the plane, with some enthusiastic coaching
from pilot Bob Price, director of flight operations at the Marietta
plant. Price demonstrated the rugged plane's short-takeoff
capability, lifting it off the Dobbins Air Force Base runway in
less than 1,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Price also showed how a new ``stick pusher'' system prevents
stalls, or loss of lift at low speeds. Computers sense imminent
stalls and automatically push the yoke forward to drop the nose and
regain speed and lift.
</P>
<P>
   After the flight, Coffman said Lockheed Martin may explore new
international aircraft alliances in the wake of its failed merger
attempt with Northrop Grumman.
</P>
<P>
   Under one rumored scenario, it might team with European jet
maker Airbus and make airliner parts in Marietta.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's some excess capacity here that could be productive,''
Coffman said. ``But it's speculation at this point, and we better
leave it at that.''
</P>
<P>
   Coffman also said he's confident Lockheed Martin will gain
regulatory approval for its $2.6 billion buyout of Comsat Corp., a
move to be a bigger player in satellite services. He said initial
negative investor reaction was due to ``misunderstanding'' of the
deal.
</P>
<P>
   The stock rebounded this week, closing Friday at $102.06 1/4, up
$3.56 1/4.

`MARTIAL LAW': MORE KUNG FU NONSENSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review. Time, channel are for
New York area. Check local listings.)  
 (bl)  
 By WILLIAM McDONALD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   If, as soldiers say, war consists of endless boredom punctuated
by moments of stark terror, ``Martial Law'' boils down to an hour
of tedium punctuated by frenzied bouts of kung fu fighting.
</P>
<P>
   The people at CBS who slapped this martial-arts show together
over the summer aren't asking that it be taken seriously, of
course; its silliness is by design. Indeed, the show hardly
pretends to know precisely what it is. ``A new comedy action
drama'' is how its producers bill it. ``Or whatever,'' they might
have added.
</P>
<P>
   But even taking ``Martial Law'' on its own mix-and-match terms,
one would hope for a good laugh under the ``comedy'' part of the
equation, or a bit of drama that seemed, well, dramatic. Alas, the
only inventiveness in this show is in its cartoon kung fu
choreography, exploding onto the screen every 12 minutes or so.
</P>
<P>
   Trading on the popularity of Hong Kong action films, ``Martial
Law'' has imported one of the genre's stars, the squat, 220-pound
Sammo Hung, for the lead role of Sammo Law. Sammo is a renowned
Shanghai detective who joins forces with the LAPD to troll the
Chinese-American underworld for his abducted and beautiful protege
(Kelly Hu). He's also a renowned, and rather cuddly, master of
martial arts given to dispensing aphorisms (``You don't break rocks
with eggs'') between body slams.
</P>
<P>
   The built-in joke, of course, is that Sammo's black belt is
about a size 44, affording cheap opportunities for giggling. And
predictably he gets the last laugh, proving time and again that
he's lighter on his feet than the stone-faced foes he likes to
thrash in sometimes hilarious and always acrobatic ways.
</P>
<P>
   Bodies do turn up, presumably to make good on the promise of
drama. But so does game show host Bob Barker, in a painfully lame
scene in the premiere episode in which Sammo winds up as a
contestant on ``The Price Is Right'' (on CBS, naturally; check your
local listings).
</P>
<P>
   Yet if ``Martial Law'' is clumsy when it isn't kick boxing, it's
clearly surefooted in going after the audience it wants. The tipoff
comes about six minutes into the premiere. After a spectacular kung
fu exhibition in a Shanghai den of thieves, the action shifts to
Los Angeles. Enter a gorgeous blonde (Tammy Lauren playing a police
detective). Kung fu and a major babe: what more could a teen-age
boy want?

SECOND SETBACK FOR ADVOCATES OF CENSUS SAMPLING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va., Ga., Pa., N.J.)  (lb) 
 By DAVID STOUT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Federal judges in Virginia have dealt another
setback to the Clinton administration's plans to use statistical
sampling in the 2000 census, agreeing with judges in Washington
that use of the technique would be illegal.
</P>
<P>
   A special three-judge panel for the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals, which heard arguments in Roanoke, Va., last month, ruled
unanimously on Thursday that sampling would violate a 1976 census
law. Judge Claude Hilton headed the panel, which included the
district judges Emory Widener Jr. and Raymond Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling was similar to one issued on Aug. 24 by a special
panel for the District of Columbia U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
The Supreme Court has agreed to take up the issue in its next term,
so the latest ruling means it will have two decisions to review.
</P>
<P>
   The wording in the 1976 law differed from that in earlier census
legislation, in a way that the plaintiffs argued was meant to
prohibit sampling. Agreeing, the Virginia court referred to Supreme
Court precedent that a statute must be construed ``in such fashion
that every word has some operative effect.''
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs in the cases are similar and the issues almost
identical. The Virginia suit was brought by Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga.,
by a conservative Atlanta law firm, and by suburban counties in
Pennsylvania and New Jersey. The District of Columbia suit was
brought by Speaker Newt Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   The administration wants to use sampling _ simply put, gauging
the characteristics of households that do not respond to census
queries based on the traits of those that do _ to avoid a
repetition of what happened in the 1990 census, which undercounted
the population by several million people.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those missed in the last census were city dwellers and
members of minorities. People who favor sampling contend that
because of the undercount, big cities were short-changed on federal
aid based on population. Some people have said sampling would work
in the Democrats' favor in the reapportioning of legislative
districts.
</P>
<P>
   Some opponents of sampling have contended that it is not only
illegal but unconstitutional _ an issue the High Court has not
ruled upon.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   No. 9 Washington (2-0)
</P>
<P>
   at No. 2 Nebraska (3-0)
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska has been doing fine, and now quarterback Bobby Newcombe
and tailback DeAngelo Evans return from injuries. The Huskers have
won 17 straight games overall, 44 straight at home. Their last home
loss was in 1991 _ to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   No. 18 Southern California (3-0)
</P>
<P>
   at No. 10 Florida State (2-1)
</P>
<P>
   Chris Weinke, Florida State's 26-year-old quarterback, righted
himself and passed for 241 yards in trouncing Duke. Southern
California has fattened up against mediocre teams and struggled
against Oregon State.
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky (3-0)
</P>
<P>
   at No. 8 Florida (2-1)
</P>
<P>
   Florida can't settle on a quarterback and its turnover ratio
(minus 10) is 112th and last in Division I-A, but it should still
win. Kentucky, on Tim Couch's passing, leads the nation in total
offense (572.7 yards a game).
</P>
<P>
   EAST
</P>
<P>
   Tulsa (2-0)
</P>
<P>
   at No. 19 West Virginia (1-1)
</P>
<P>
   West Virginia has found potent passing to complement Amos
Zereoue's running.
</P>
<P>
   Army (1-1)
</P>
<P>
   at Rutgers (1-2)
</P>
<P>
   Rutgers has lost 16 straight to I-A opponents. Army may run all
day.
</P>
<P>
   Columbia (1-0)
</P>
<P>
   at Bucknell (2-1)
</P>
<P>
   Bucknell can run. So can Columbia, which beat Harvard on the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut (2-0)
</P>
<P>
   at Yale (1-0)
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut's big-play defense should handle Yale's promising
offense.
</P>
<P>
   Grambling (1-1)
</P>
<P>
   vs. Hampton (3-0)
</P>
<P>
   at East Rutherford, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton, with 13 straight regular-season victories, should win
this New York Urban League Classic game. Grambling, now coached by
Doug Williams, an old quarterback, needs a quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   SOUTH
</P>
<P>
   Houston (0-3)
</P>
<P>
   at No. 4 Tennessee (2-0)
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee stopped Florida's offense with five sacks and minus 13
yards rushing.
</P>
<P>
   No. 11 Virginia (3-0)
</P>
<P>
   at Duke (2-1)
</P>
<P>
   Virginia is struggling but winning. Duke has lost 18 straight
Atlantic Coast Conference games.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh (1-1)
</P>
<P>
   at No. 21 Virginia Tech (3-0)
</P>
<P>
   Tech, the better team, is banged up. Pitt played Penn State
tough in a seven-point loss.
</P>
<P>
   Boston College (3-0)
</P>
<P>
   at Louisville (1-2)
</P>
<P>
   Mike Cloud of Boston College is averaging 184 yards rushing a
game, second best in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   MIDWEST
</P>
<P>
   Northwestern (2-1)
</P>
<P>
   at No. 14 Wisconsin (3-0)
</P>
<P>
   Northwestern beat Rice with a fake punt, an onside kick, a quick
kick, unusual formations and a hurry-up offense. This could be a
tight game.
</P>
<P>
   Purdue (2-1)
</P>
<P>
   at No. 23 Notre Dame (1-1)
</P>
<P>
   Notre Dame has given up 923 yards to Michigan and Michigan
State. This should be easier.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan State (1-2)
</P>
<P>
   at Michigan (1-2)
</P>
<P>
   Two disappointing teams that won the last time out, State over
Notre Dame and Michigan over Eastern Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   SOUTHWEST
</P>
<P>
   No. 22 Alabama (2-0)
</P>
<P>
   at Arkansas (2-0)
</P>
<P>
   Alabama has an imaginative offense and the nation's No. 2
rushing defense (allowing 36 yards a game).
</P>
<P>
   No. 23 Air Force (3-0)
</P>
<P>
   at Texas Christian (1-1)
</P>
<P>
   Blane Morgan is 13-2 as the starting quarterback in Air Force's
multiple-option offense.
</P>
<P>
   FAR WEST
</P>
<P>
   Baylor (1-1)
</P>
<P>
   at No. 15 Colorado (3-0)
</P>
<P>
   Colorado's defense is sound, its rushing and pass protection
suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford (1-2)
</P>
<P>
   at No. 20 Oregon (3-0)
</P>
<P>
   Oregon's two best running backs are hurt, but its passing should
win.
</P>
<P>
   MISMATCHES
</P>
<P>
   Northeast Louisiana (2-1)
</P>
<P>
   at No. 5 Kansas State (3-0)
</P>
<P>
   Kansas State is first in the nation in scoring (62.3 points a

</P>
<P>
   Idaho (2-1)
</P>
<P>
   at No. 6 Louisiana State (2-0)
</P>
<P>
   Louisiana State, although sometimes unsteady, can stop the run.
Idaho can't stop much.

PROFITS STILL LOOK GOOD FOR HEDGE FUND'S PARTNERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: See also HEDGEFUND-BAILOUT, HEDGEFUND-IMPACT) 
(mk) 
 By EDWARD WYATT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Despite the huge losses and shattered reputations
that have resulted from the near-collapse of Long-Term Capital
Management, the firm's 16 partners still appear to be sitting on
gains in their original investments in the hedge fund they managed.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, for their work as portfolio managers of Long-Term
Capital Portfolio, as the hedge fund is formally known, the
partners of Long-Term Capital Management are likely to have
collectively earned hundreds of millions of dollars over the four
and a half years the fund has been operating.
</P>
<P>
   As representatives from a newly formed oversight committee of
outside investors begin picking through the wreckage, it remains
unclear which partners have taken money out of the firm and which,
having left their investments in both the hedge fund and the
management company intact, face further personal financial
difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   The scope of the huge paper profits, and breathtaking losses,
that flowed to John Meriwether and the firm's general partners is
almost too large to comprehend. In early 1994, a group of 10
general partners of Long-Term Capital Management collectively
contributed $100 million to the fund. The fund then raised another
$1.1 billion from outside investors, otherwise known as limited
partners. Later in 1994, the fund raised another $2 billion in
capital.
</P>
<P>
   That money was invested according to Long-Term Capital's arcane
computer-driven mathematical models, which produced a net profit of
nearly 20 percent in the partial first year, followed by full-year
profits of 43 percent, 41 percent and 17 percent in 1995 through
1997.
</P>
<P>
   By the beginning of this year, the value of the shares of the
fund owned by the general partners, who now number 16, had grown
from the original $100 million to $1.5 billion. Nearly all the
partners kept their entire stake invested in the fund, financial
executives say, forgoing the payout of profits that outside
investors were forced to take last year.
</P>
<P>
   But as the fund's investments went sour, the value of the
partners' stake has fallen to roughly $200 million _ a devastating
loss, but still representing an average individual gain of about 25
percent, to $12.5 million for each of the 16 partners from an
assumed original investment of $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, each partner is not likely to have kept exactly the
same amount in the fund. If some partners borrowed against the
value of their fund holdings at a time when their profits were
high, their debts might now far outstrip their remaining investment
profits.
</P>
<P>
   But investments in the fund were not the only source of
potential profits for partners at Long-Term Capital. Over the last
four and a half years, the company that managed the fund reaped an
estimated $2 billion in revenue from its annual management fee,
which equaled 2 percent of the fund's assets, and its 25 percent
share of the fund's gross investment profits.
</P>
<P>
   Some of that $2 billion went to pay salaries of the
approximately 170 nonpartner employees of Long-Term Capital, as
well as to buy computer systems, rent office space and pay
utilities and other expenses.
</P>
<P>
   But it is also likely that a considerable chunk of that revenue
became net profits for the partners. Some of the most profitable
mutual fund companies, for example, earn net income equal to 25
percent of revenue _ a benchmark, which if matched by Long-Term
Capital would mean net profits to the 16 partners of $500 million,
or an average of more than $30 million apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the partners apparently took at least some of that money
out of the firm, but others left substantially all of it in or
borrowed against that which remained. The extent of that activity
is not known, but word spread on Wall Street Friday that more than
one upper-level executive at Long-Term Capital was facing possible
personal bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Rosenthal, a spokesman for the firm, declined to comment
on the rumors. ``But the one thing they all have,'' he said, ``is a
little bit of hope.''

CONGRESSMAN ONCE IMPEACHED AS JUDGE IS CRITICAL OF STARR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)   (bl)  
 By CARL HULSE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As a lawyer and former federal judge, Rep. Alcee
Hastings has more than a passing familiarity with the Constitution.
And his reading tells him that Congress is badly mishandling the
impeachment process.
</P>
<P>
   His real expertise in the subject comes not from arcane legal
theory and dusty law books but from unique personal experience _
the Florida Democrat is the only member of the House to have been
impeached himself. He was removed from the federal bench by the
Senate in 1989 on grounds of bribery and perjury and three years
later was elected to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as he joins his House colleagues in weighing the
impeachment of President Clinton, Hastings, 62, is trying to use
his familiarity with the process to protect Clinton from what he
sees as the same unfair system that led to his own judicial exile.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a great deal of experience in the process of
impeachment,'' said Hastings, who became Florida's first black
federal judge when he was appointed by President Jimmy Carter in
1979. ``I also have a great deal of experience in judging whether
or not prosecutors have committed prosecutorial misconduct. In this
instance, firmly I come down on the side affirmatively that he
has,'' he said, in reference to Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   The congressman said he has made no judgment on whether Clinton
should be impeached, only that Congress should be more measured in
its approach.
</P>
<P>
   Hastings' chief complaint is that Congress abdicated its
responsibility in the matter to Starr, relying too heavily on the
special counsel's findings, which he put forth in a 445-page report
delivered to Congress last week. Hastings likens the situation to
his own case, saying the House was swayed by an impeachment report
from a panel of 26 federal judges, an imprimatur of authority that
he said lawmakers were unable to resist.
</P>
<P>
   Hastings' first attack on Starr came in the form of a House
resolution to impeach the prosecutor for egregious misconduct,
including leaking grand jury material and ``wasting'' $40 million
on the investigation. It was quickly and overwhelmingly dismissed
by the House on Wednesday on a 340-71 vote.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans were offended by the resolution and branded it
an outrage. But the failed attempt will not be Hastings' last.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am sure he is going to proceed to deal with the
circumstances we are confronted with based on his experience,''
said Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., who chairs the Congressional
Black Caucus.
</P>
<P>
   Hastings was a rising judicial star when he was charged in 1981
with conspiracy to accept a $150,000 bribe in a criminal case he
was overseeing in Miami. He was acquitted by a jury two years later
although another lawyer, charged in the case as a co-conspirator,
was sent to jail. The alleged accomplice, accused of being the
go-between in the conspiracy, refused to testify against Hastings.
</P>
<P>
   But that was not the end for Hastings. In 1987, a panel of
federal judges delivered a 381-page report to Congress accusing him
of having committed the original crime as well as having lied about
his conduct during his defense.
</P>
<P>
   The House, including many members he now serves with, voted
413-3 to impeach him in 1988. The Senate, in a decision some
lawmakers said was agonizing due to Hastings' double jeopardy
argument, voted 69-26 for conviction, as Hastings, there to make an
appeal, watched.
</P>
<P>
   The ousted judge, who passionately maintained his innocence
throughout, found the experience surreal. ``There were times when I
was sitting there and it was as if I was talking about someone
else,'' Hastings said.
</P>
<P>
   A hero in the black community for his persistence in fighting
the charges against him, Hastings was elected to the House in 1992
from a newly drawn, heavily minority district centered in Fort
Lauderdale. Last year, questions were raised about laboratory work
done by the FBI on evidence given to the judicial panel in
Hastings' case. House leaders, however, refused to reopen the
impeachment issue.
</P>
<P>
   Hastings says he made peace with many of those in the House who
supported his impeachment, taking official overseas trips with Rep.
Henry Hyde, R-Ill., who is chairman of the Judiciary Committee, and
working on legislation with Rep. John Conyers of Michigan, senior
Democrat on that panel.
</P>
<P>
   ``One would argue one ought to dislike them,'' Hastings said of
those who backed his removal. ``But what happened is they became
part of a process that was driven by constitutional abdication of
responsibility that allowed the judges to drive the process.''
</P>
<P>
   Hastings, who generally keeps a low profile in Congress, can
elicit strong emotions. A Florida Republican who asked not to be
named said one of his most disturbing moments upon arriving in
Congress was seeing Hastings, an impeached federal judge, presiding
over the House when the Democrats still held the majority. And
after Hastings introduced his Starr impeachment resolution, he said
a House staffer sent him an e-mail saying, ``Impeach yourself, you
idiot.''
</P>
<P>
   And to those who see his criticism of Starr and the ongoing
congressional process as an effort to lash out at the system that
stripped him of his judicial authority, he says it isn't so.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no striking back at all,'' he said. ``I have the
responsibility as a citizen but even more so now as a
congressperson.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone does not stop the madness, the madness continues,''
he said.

SUIT FILED OVER HOME RUN-THAT-WASN'T BALL 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By TERRY PRISTIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A Queens high school student was sued Friday over the
ball that Mark McGwire hit for what some fans thought was his 66th
home run of the season in County Stadium in Milwaukee last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The student, Johnny Luna, 18, was accused in the suit of taking
the ball from the fan who caught it, Michael Chapes, 31, a high
school gym teacher in Waterford, Wis.
</P>
<P>
   The hit by McGwire, the St. Louis first baseman, was ruled a
double after Chapes extended his glove over the fence to grab the
ball. The ball, which could fetch big money on the baseball
memorabilia market, somehow ended up in the hands of Luna, a senior
at Long Island City High School in Queens.
</P>
<P>
   Chapes' lawyer, Thomas C. Boyd, said in the lawsuit, filed in
Milwaukee County Circuit Court, that as his client caught the ball,
he was pushed against the inside fence by the crush of fans behind
him. While Chapes was doubled over and in danger of falling, Luna
jumped down into the 4-foot-wide trough between the two fences and
spirited the ball away, the lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Luna had traveled to Milwaukee with Gerald DiGilio, 40, a bridge
painter from Astoria, Queens; his two teen-age sons, and another
young man. Luna and DiGilio are named as defendants in the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, DiGilio told reporters that they planned to sell the
ball to the highest bidder.
</P>
<P>
   Boyd said DiGilio ``organized this group for the purpose of
securing the ball.'' The lawyer said he did not know how to reach
either defendant. DiGilio was not listed in the Queens telephone
directory.
</P>
<P>
   A similar lawsuit involving Sammy Sosa's 62nd home run ball was
settled in Chicago Friday.

RUSSIA MOVES TO ASSERT MORE CONTROL OVER VODKA INDUSTRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Reining in Russia's boundless thirst for illicit,
untaxed and therefore cheap vodka is easy. President Boris
Yeltsin's government already has done it dozens of times.
</P>
<P>
   There was last year's decree banning walk-up liquor sales at
sidewalk kiosks, which promptly mutated into sidewalk stores with
phone-booth size sales rooms. There was the previous year's decree
of an 18.4-ruble-per-liter minimum price at stores, which aimed to
wipe out the price advantage of untaxed vodka, but instead expanded
the black market.
</P>
<P>
   There were another 40 or so similar decrees, plus a near-war
with Georgia last fall to block invading fleets of ethyl alcohol
tank trucks _ all to some, but not very much avail.
</P>
<P>
   Now Russia's new prime minister, Yevgeny Primakov, is preparing
a new vodka decree _ a get-tough plan with the statist stamp of
Yeltsin's new Communist-led ministries, as well as the endorsement
of moderates. Which is not to say it will work, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``The alcohol industry is now under mafia control,'' said
Nikolai Petrakov, an economist and director of the Institute of
Market Problems in Moscow. ``It was simple to privatize production
and trade of vodka. It will be very difficult to return to the old
position.''
</P>
<P>
   Primakov intends to try anyway. Details are scarce, but his
aides said the government would effectively retake control of key
parts of the vodka industry that were set free when Yeltsin
liquidated the state vodka monopoly in May 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Private vodka manufacturers _ they are not distillers, just
mixers of alcohol, water and flavors _ would keep their licenses,
as long as they let the government sign off on major production
decisions. The government also would decide who gets to sell the
billions of one-liter bottles of vodka that fly from Russian
shelves each year.
</P>
<P>
   The government already controls the 162 distilleries that make
virtually all the pure alcohol used in legal Russian vodka. Control
of production and distribution supposedly will re-establish
something approaching the vodka industry of Soviet days, but with
some room for private profit.
</P>
<P>
   ''All those who will get a quota to produce alcohol will
function. Those who will not get this quota for various reasons
will either have to change their product line or work according to
the government,'' the deputy prime minister for agriculture,
Gennady Kulik, said at a news conference Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Among Russians, at least, the motive for such sweeping changes
goes without saying. In czarist days, half of all state revenues
came from state-controlled vodka sales. The Soviets received as
much as 35 per cent of their income from vodka, before oil and gas
became big moneymakers in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin opened the pasture gate, and the cash cow walked out. By
the latest estimate, no more than four per cent of Russia's
revenues come from vodka taxes or sales, though that is a half to a
third of what it should be.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov's goal is to pay off at least half of the immense total
of back wages owed state workers with the proceeds from stricter
enforcement of alcohol laws.
</P>
<P>
   For bootleggers, evading taxes is the game. Vodka is such a
heavily taxed commodity that the riches gained from cheating
outweigh the risks.
</P>
<P>
   Bootleggers cut costs by making vodka from cheap ethyl alcohol
smuggled into the country or illegally produced after-hours at
government distilleries, a rampant practice. By some estimates,
government distillers produce twice as much alcohol as they list on
official sales reports.
</P>
<P>
   The bootleggers skirt excise taxes by marketing their vodka at
discount prices, often under reputable names _ counterfeits, in
essence.
</P>
<P>
   Boris Smirnov, a Russian vodka maker whose family name is also
on a competing line of foreign-made ``Smirnoff'' vodkas, said in an
interview that at least one new counterfeiter is reported to his
factory each week. Licensed vodka makers also produce extra bottles
in the dark of night, then juggle their books to hide the income
from sales.
</P>
<P>
   All told, the hidden vodka production is staggering, so to
speak: in 1997, licensed makers reported producing 868 million
liters of vodka. Meanwhile, Russians reported drinking 2.15 billion
liters. No one knows, or at least is saying, where the difference
came from. Still, it is easy to surmise.
</P>
<P>
   When Russia's border service blocked tank trucks from running
foreign alcohol into the country from Georgia last fall, provoking
a diplomatic incident, legal alcohol production by state distillers
more than doubled in three months.
</P>
<P>
   Last winter, Yeltsin's government fired the head of the border
guards who ran the anti-smuggling operation. Smuggling has since
resumed; so has the unsteady course of state production.

YELTSIN SELECTS FINANCE MINISTER  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL WINES    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Ending an agonizing deliberation that held world
financial markets and national politics in its thrall, President
Boris Yeltsin finally chose a finance minister for Russia's new
government Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But his choice provoked a second key minister to walk out,
triggering a search for a replacement. And later, the head of the
nation's securities commission resigned, also apparently in protest
of the appointment.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin apparently stirred their anger by naming Mikhail
Zadornov, a 35-year-old free-market advocate, as finance minister.
He held the same job under the last prime minister, Sergei
Kiriyenko.
</P>
<P>
   The appointment was welcomed by western analysts and investors
who have been searching for some sign that Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov's new government would remain open to western-style
financial practices and reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Zadornov is the most prominent reformer left in a cabinet more
or less dominated by left-centrists and members of the Communist
party. In response to the appointment, the leading centrist in the
new cabinet, Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Shokhin, resigned
after a mere nine days on the job. Shokhin, who is in charge of
economic policy in the new government, was, in effect, Zadornov's
boss. The second resignation was that of Dmitri Yasilyev, head of
the Russian securities regulation commission. Yasilyev, like
Zadornov, is considered a reformer. The nature of his difficulties
with Zadornov were not clear.
</P>
<P>
   Shokhin said he was quitting because the selection of Zadornov
was ``a political mistake'' that would make it impossible for him
to form a united front on fiscal policy and debt negotiations with
foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not want to be a fig leaf talking to the West without
being sure that the ministries I was overseeing would be guiding
the policies I could be responsible for,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a television interview Friday evening, Shokhin noted that he
had urged Zadornov to quit the government earlier because no ruling
coalition could function effectively if it included key officials
who were responsible for the fiscal collapse that occurred last
month.
</P>
<P>
   Shokhin said he had told Primakov and Yeltsin of his decision
early Friday, but had withheld the formal announcement until they
were convinced that he was serious.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov reacted coolly to the decision. ``I think this is
irresponsible, especially at such a difficult time,'' he said,
adding that Yeltsin had done Shokhin ``a great favor'' by elevating
him to the post.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Primakov added that his government was unaffected by the
departure. But it was not clear who might now accept the job.
Shokhin's departure swings the Russian government even further
toward the Communist left, something he acknowledged in a
television interview Friday night. Shokhin was a national
legislator and the leader of Our Home Is Russia, a political
faction closely allied with the centrist policies of the former
prime minister, Viktor Chernomyrdin.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, Shokhin made headlines by suggesting that Russia
could default on its debt to other nations and the International
Monetary Fund unless lenders gave the country more leeway to
restructure its finances.
</P>
<P>
   The Communist Party leader in the legislature, Gennady Zyuganov,
seemed to welcome Shokhin's departure. In a television interview
Friday night, he said Shokhin left because negotiation over debts
to western creditors were stalled and his old post as legislative
leader of Our Home Is Russia was soon to be filled by someone else.
</P>
<P>
   Shokhin has quit the government before. In 1994, he left the
post of finance minister to protest Yeltsin's appointment of
conservatives to his cabinet. Then as now, he has been playing an
important role in negotiations with the International Monetary Fund
and western creditors for money to fuel what was then Russia's
economic expansion.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech made Friday before his resignation became public,
Shokhin said he believes there remains a small chance that the IMF
will deliver the second segment of a multibillion-dollar loan
commitment to the Russian government.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, an IMF mission evaluating Russia's financial
situation left Moscow Friday, saying the country's difficulties
remain serious, but offering to work with the government to resolve
them.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF experts gave no hint of whether the organization would
continue to extend credit to Russia.

HOUSE REJECTS FAST-TRACK TRADE BILL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich., Minn., N.J., R.I.)  (lb) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House on Friday rejected legislation that would
have given expanded trade-negotiating authority to President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome, 243-180, seemed assured in advance, since few
lawmakers had switched sides since November, when the same bill was
pulled from the House floor before it could be voted down. If
anything, the measure had lost support since then.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton badly wants the authority, called fast track, which
would allow him to negotiate trade agreements that Congress could
accept or reject but not amend. But he did not want Congress to
deal with it now.
</P>
<P>
   That is because the vast majority of House Democrats oppose the
legislation. Indeed, Democrats voted against the measure Friday,
171-29, and many of them accused Speaker Newt Gingrich of holding a
vote on legislation that he knew was doomed, simply to expose
Democratic divisions just weeks before the election.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why did the speaker insist on bringing up this bill when he
knew it was going to fail?'' said Rep. David Bonior of Michigan,
the Democratic whip.
</P>
<P>
   Taking to the House floor at the end of Friday's four-hour
debate, Gingrich angrily rejected the criticisms and accused
Democrats of taking orders from labor unions, which are the
Democrats' biggest donors and most loyal supporters, and which
strongly oppose the measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real issue is that your unions won't let you vote for free
trade,'' Gingrich said.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement after the vote, Gingrich criticized Clinton for
not rallying Democrats to his cause: ``Instead of lobbying for fast
track, the president neglected our nation's long-term economic
health in favor of political fund raising.''
</P>
<P>
   The House legislation would have extended the authority that all
presidents since Gerald Ford have had in negotiating trade accords
that Congress can accept or reject but not amend. Clinton let those
powers lapse four years ago rather than risk a vote that would have
splintered the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich and his lieutenants twisted arms and lobbied hard for
the trade authority this week, but Democrats said it was all show
to deflect complaints from business groups and farmers upset that
Republicans have balked at providing $18 billion in new financing
for the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker flipped the accusations around, warning that a vote
against the enhanced trade authority would weaken the United States
in the eyes of the world economic community, and further unsettle
jittery currencies from Asia to Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this goes down and this ends up in a step toward world
recession, some of us will have the comfort to know we cast the
right vote,'' Gingrich said.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's debate was a pale shadow of last November's dramatic
confrontation that dealt Clinton one of his most stinging
legislative setbacks. But lawmakers went through the motions
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters cast the debate as a choice between protectionism and
free trade in an increasingly global marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an argument between those who believe Americans can
compete in the world market and those who believe they can't,''
said Rep. Gil Gutknecht, R-Minn.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dave Camp, R-Mich., said, ``A vote for fast track is a vote
for farm families. Trade is one of the most important tools to
improve the farm economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats retorted that the trade authority failed to ensure
that developing nations would uphold labor and environmental
standards in their quest to profit in the global market.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Are we going to let multinational companies bargain down
environmental standards around the world in the name of economic
competitiveness?'' said Rep. Frank Pallone, D-N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Patrick Kennedy, D-R.I., said that a recent visit to the
homes of Mexican factory workers convinced him that ``if we don't
insist on standards for our brothers and sisters in Mexico, we're
next on the chopping block.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said granting Clinton enhanced trade-negotiating
authority would continue to undermine a U.S. job market already
suffering from the North American Free Trade Agreement of 1993, a
conclusion disputed by Republicans. ``NAFTA is hurting hundreds of
thousands of people on both sides of the border,'' Bonior said.

SPORTS COLUMN: A GREAT SEASON ENDS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Ill., Mo.)  (mk) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sammy Sosa is the symbol of a great baseball season
coming to a close.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees closed in on baseball immortality Friday night,
becoming the first team since 1954 to win more than 111 games in a
season. The Mets, Cubs and Giants are virtually even in a furious
wild card race. Sosa and Mark McGwire are neck and neck in a home
run chase.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa has pursued McGwire through spring and summer. Now in the
fall, the Dominican Republic's 29-year-old hero finally has pulled
even. With three games left the question of who is king of the hill
comes down to a final test of skills: strength, timing,
coordination, concentration.
</P>
<P>
   There is national pride, too. Up and down Broadway, beyond 155th
Street all the way up to the 200s, groups of men and women from the
Dominican Republic will crowd around television sets for the next
three days, watching and waiting for news of the chase.
</P>
<P>
   The scene is reminiscent of the Harlem of 50 or 60 years ago
when men and women crowded around their radios and listened to Joe
Louis fight. Every blow seemed like some symbolic punch for The
Race. Each new round was a symbol of stamina, of a capacity to
endure. So it is with Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   Late Thursday night, Jose Correa, manager of the popular Margot
restaurant in Washington Heights, sat in his restaurant and tried
to put Sosa in perspective. ``The Dominican people are coming up,
especially here in New York,'' Correa said. ``Before, we were
labeled as bad, corrupt, now they see it's not like that. Sosa has
given light to a whole lot of other things. Not only in sports,
we're coming up in politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Historians predict that this baseball season will have
resonance. David Voigt, a professor emeritus at Albright College
and the author of seven books on baseball, including an extensive
three-volume history of American baseball, said: ``This will be one
of the more memorable seasons. It will be remembered for the
overall accord in the game. The strike that set the game back is
being forgotten.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The season will also be remembered because this was the Monica
Lewinsky year,'' Voigt added. ``People could turn to the
McGwire-Sosa thing if they were fed up with that stuff. That gives
the season a benchmark. Sometimes external stuff gives baseball a
benchmark.''
</P>
<P>
   Voigt was 13 years old during the 1941 season, attending the
Hershey Industrial School in Hershey, Pa. It was the season of Joe
DiMaggio's 56-game hitting streak; Ted Williams hit .406; the
Yankees won Game 7 of the World Series when Tommy Henrich reached
first base when the Dodgers catcher, Mickey Owen, dropped the third
strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then World War II breaks out and that gave that year a
timelessness,'' Voigt said. ``You had nothing but wartime baseball
for the next four seasons. That's what you remember. That's how
externals have a way of sharpening one's perception of standout
baseball years.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Sosa slammed his 64th and 65th home runs of the
season, just as Hurricane Georges slammed into the Dominican
Republic. The front page headline on Thursday in Listin Diario, a
newspaper from Santa Domingo, Dominican Republic, was ``65.'' Sosa
dedicated his homers to the Dominican people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am at the side of all Dominicans, of my people, of my nation
in these difficult moments,'' Sosa said as the Cubs left Milwaukee
Wednesday night. ``Hopefully these home runs will bring a little
happiness.''
</P>
<P>
   Correa said he already has. ``When he's playing, if he hits a
couple of home runs, it'll be a couple hours that no one will be
thinking about the hurricane,'' Correa said. ``Our minds will be
relaxed. He'll bring a little joy.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been complaints that throughout his race with
McGwire, Sosa was given the short shrift. He has been left for dead
two or three times this season, treated as though his performances
were merely a warmup act for McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   Was race a factor? Probably: People of color always have to
scream a little louder. Was U.S. jingoism at play? Probably: We
tend to wrap our flag rather tightly around this game of baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone wanted McGwire to break the record,'' Correa said as
the last customers left. ``Everybody was pulling for McGwire,
`cause he was white. Now, this guy, Slammin' Sammy Sosa, comes from
nowhere to break up everything. He really did it to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they're making up for it,'' Correa said, referring to the
media. ``They're making up for it because they know they did
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa has left the debates to those of us on the ground. He's
taken the high road. He has been gracious and deferential; his
mantra has been ``Mark's the Man.''
</P>
<P>
   Now we will see: The last day of the season is Sunday and many
things are still up in the air: Mets-Cubs-Giants; McGwire-Sosa.
Things even out _ life evens out _ and adulation, like home runs,
comes in bunches.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire broke the record; Sosa will probably take the record and
the Giants will grab the last playoff spot. How's that for justice?

ALBRIGHT HOPES TO PUSH ISRAELIS AND PALESTINIANS TOWARD PEACE
AGREEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is preparing
to open a round of shuttle diplomacy on U.S. soil, traveling
between Washington and the United Nations in New York in the hope
of making progress in talks between Israel and the Palestinians,
administration officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The goal, the officials said, is for Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu of Israel and Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, to
hammer out at least some of the final details of an agreement
before they meet separately with President Clinton next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``One can break off parts of this very complex piece and try to
get agreement on it,'' said James Rubin, the State Department
spokesman. ``The question is whether the political will is there to
make the hard decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials said there is little hope of an overall
settlement next week, especially because Netanyahu must be back in
Israel before Tuesday evening for the start of the Yom Kippur holy
day. He is to meet Clinton in the White House on Monday morning and
then leave immediately for Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Still, administration officials said the White House hopes for
some concrete agreements next week, if only to prove that the
president remains actively involved in foreign policy and has not
been distracted by the political turmoil resulting from his sexual
misadventures.
</P>
<P>
   After nearly two years with little visible progress in peace
talks, Israel and the Palestinians are reported to be near an
agreement under which Israel would cede another 13 percent of the
West Bank to the Palestinians. About one-quarter of the newly ceded
area would be designated as nature reserves to prevent Palestinian
settlements.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli army radio quoted Netanyahu as officially confirming
that Israel was ready to withdraw from another 13 percent of the
West Bank. The report also quoted a senior Israeli official as
saying an agreement with the Palestinians could be signed within
two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. officials say there are various issues to be resolved,
including Israel's demand for concrete guarantees from the
Palestinians that they will not allow their territory to be used as
a haven for terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   Albright, who met with Netanyahu earlier this week when both
were in New York for the opening of the U.N. General Assembly, is
expected to return to New York on Saturday for late-night meetings
with both the Israeli leader and with Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said she is expected to remain in New York on Sunday ``in
order to continue to work on this effort in advance of meetings the
president will hold.'' State Department officials did not rule out
the possibility that she might try to arrange a joint meeting this
weekend with Netanyahu and Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   She is scheduled to be back in Washington on Monday for the
White House meeting with Netanyahu, and then to return to the
United Nations, possibly to talk to Arafat again in preparation for
his White House meeting with the president later in the week.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat is to address the General Assembly on Monday.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ British Airways said Friday that it would not permit
the writer Salman Rushdie to fly on its planes, despite Iran's
assurances that it would not carry out its death sentence against
Rushdie.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we have every sympathy with Rushdie's difficulties with
overseas travel,'' said Bruce Tobin, a spokesman for the airline,
``our ultimate responsibility is the safety of our passengers and
staff.''
</P>
<P>
   Rushdie has made many overseas trips since 1989, when the death
sentence, in the form of a religious edict, was issued against him.
But not once has he flown on British Airways.
</P>
<P>
   ``We maintain close contact with the relevant authorities in all
matters that might affect the safety and security of our
passengers,'' Tobin said. ``Mr. Rushdie is not a British Airways
customer.''

JAMES H. LAVENSON, ADVERTISING AND MARKETING EXPERT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Maine)  (js) 
 By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   James H. Lavenson, an advertising and marketing expert known for
public speeches that were both hilarious and instructive, died
Sept. 19 at Penobscot Bay Medical Center in Rockport, Me.,
following a stroke, his wife, Susan, said. He was 79.
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, Lavenson gained attention when, as president of the
Plaza Hotel in New York, he restored the Edwardian Room, the
high-ceiling dining room with carved wall panels that three years
earlier had been renamed the Green Tulip as part of the early 1970s
trend in Manhattan to make all things old suddenly modern.
</P>
<P>
   The restoration drew praise from architecture buffs who
considered the Plaza, designed by Henry Hardenbergh, to be one of
New York's treasures. But it was a desire to increase revenue at
the then-struggling hotel that motivated Lavenson to restore the
Edwardian Room, hoping to attract customers tired of similarly
sleek dining rooms.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech to the American Marketing Association, ``Thinking
Strawberries,'' Lavenson articulated the idea that every employee
from the waiter to the chambermaid should think of himself as
actively selling to customers, an idea well ahead of its time. The
speech, which is still in several hotel management textbooks,
showed how adding strawberries to the Edwardian Room dessert menu
had increased the average meal charge at a time when dieting was a
growing trend in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did a brilliant job with the Plaza because he was able to
deal with all the elements to make a success from customers to
unions,'' said Roger Sonnabend, chief executive of Sonesta
International Hotels. ``And he was active in finding and bringing
into hotel management people from Harlem, which was unheard of at
the time in major New York hotels.''
</P>
<P>
   Lavenson became such a lively speaker that he collected fees for
entertaining audiences with his ideas, Sonnabend said. One was his
talk on earning an MBWA degree in management by walking around.
</P>
<P>
   The Edwardian Room closed last summer and will not be reopened,
a spokeswoman for the hotel, Amy Marmer, said. ``It's empty and the
owners are trying to decide what to do with the space,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Lavenson, a horseman, who told people his middle initial stood
for Horse, was born in Philadelphia. He graduated from Williams
College in Williamstown, Mass. As a captain in World War II, he was
responsible for writing the dog training manual for the Army's
Canine Corps. He then joined his father's Philadelphia advertising
agency, the Lavenson Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1960s, as an executive with Hotel Corp. of America,
he recommended that it change its name to Sonesta International
Hotels, incorporating the names of the founder Ben Sonnabend and
his wife, Esther.
</P>
<P>
   Later he was a senior executive and then president of Premier
Corp.of America, which operated the Sonnabend family's non-hotel
properties, which at the time included Hartmann Luggage, Mad
magazine and Doxsee Foods, a major clam and shrimp processor.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, Susan, of Camden, Me., he is survived
by a daughter, Ellen R. Stanclift of Camden, Me.; four sons, Joel
S., Lavenson of Oakland, Me.; Michael Lavenson, of Suffern, N.Y.;
Peter C. Lavenson, of Wayland, Mass.; and Gary Lavenson of
Amesbury, Mass.; a brother, Jay, who lives in Austria; and seven
grandchildren. His first marriage, to Marian Schatte Lavenson of
Greenwich, Conn., ended in divorce.

HOUSE APPROVES RELEASE OF MORE DOCUMENTS FROM STARR INVESTIGATION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ark., Mich.)  (See also CLINTON-JONES, CLINTON-DAY) 
(js) 
 By LIZETTE ALVAREZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House Judiciary Committee on Friday approved
the release of thousands more pages of documents that had been
delivered by the independent counsel, finding near unanimity this
time on particularly sensitive information that would be kept from
public view.
</P>
<P>
   After days of wrangling, Republicans and Democrats on the panel
agreed to release the audiotapes of surreptitiously recorded
conversations between Linda Tripp and Monica Lewinsky, the White
House intern who had an affair with President Clinton. The
committee voted unanimously to make the same sort of deletions of
sensitive or immaterial information on the audiotapes as it did the
accompanying transcripts of the conversation.
</P>
<P>
   The documents are set to be released on Thursday at the
earliest, with the tapes probably made available a few days later
for technical reasons, promising the public a third round of
details about Clinton and his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the Tripp tapes, the documents also include the
transcripts of grand jury testimony of several important witnesses
in the case, including Clinton's secretary, Betty Currie, and his
confidant, Vernon Jordan, as well as a number of depositions and
FBI interviews with a long list of people.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing a sharp distinction from the committee's last go-around,
which was sharply partisan, Republicans cast Friday's proceedings
as a model of cooperation and comity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, we're trying to be sensitive to the American people,
of whether they need more or less,'' Rep. W. Asa Hutchinson,
R-Ark., said regarding the release of information.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats immediately tried to dispel that notion of
togetherness. There was ``a modest change'' signaling ``a
Republican retreat in the face of public opinion polls showing
increasing disappointment of what they are doing,'' said Rep. John
Conyers of Michigan, the ranking Democrat on the panel. ``At
another level, the partisanship continues.''
</P>
<P>
   In a stark departure from last week's partisan roll call,
Republicans and Democrats took 15 unanimous votes on what
information to redact or withhold, some of it for national security
reasons. On one occasion Whitewater independent counsel Kenneth
Starr requested that three transcripts _ two of people interviewed
by the independent counsel and one grand jury witness _ be kept
secret, and the committee acquiesced.

   For Initial Offerings, 1998 Is a Year to Forget &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Investors who bought into one or more initial public offerings
this year might prefer not to be reminded of them. The average
initial offering was down 13.9 percent through last Thursday,
according to Commscan, a New York company that tracked 333 such
deals.
</P>
<P>
   And the Bloomberg IPO index, which tracks stocks for 12 months
after their debuts, was down 30.2 percent from its April 22 high.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen a market this poor,'' said Tom Zita, a
Commscan analyst.
</P>
<P>
   Also unusual are the huge differences in the report cards of the
brokerage firms that brought these offerings to market. For
example, the 23 offerings for which Goldman, Sachs was lead
underwriter returned an average of 21.7 percent, the best of any
firm. By contrast, the four companies taken public by SG Cowen were
down 56.1 percent, on average.
</P>
<P>
   Among Goldman's hits: Inktomi, a network software company, up
322.2 percent through Thursday; Visual Networks, a provider of
network management systems, up 111 percent; Exodus Communications,
an Internet services firm, up 82.5 percent, and last week's star,
Ebay, the Internet retailer, up 163.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Cowen's four losers were Command Systems, a technology services
company, down 72.9 percent; Schein Pharmaceutical, down 25.4
percent; Symphonix Devices, a hearing aid maker, down 68.2 percent,
and V.I. Technologies, a blood products maker, off 57.8 percent. &QL;

<P>
   Harvard's Endowment Has A Flow of Crimson Ink &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Harvard University's endowment, the world's largest university
nest egg, has been decimated over the past 10 weeks, as $1.3
billion was shaved off its $13 billion portfolio, the school's
investment arm said in its fiscal year-end letter. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jack R. Meyer, president of the Harvard Management Co., which
runs the portfolio, tied the 10 percent decline to two factors.
About three percentage points resulted from arbitrage trades, which
though currently unprofitable, should rebound, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The remainder was due to the endowment's 13 percent exposure to
emerging-markets stocks at the start of the quarter. The decline
was first reported in The Boston Globe. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Meyer acknowledged disappointment over the quarter's results.
``We typically do better in down markets than up markets,'' he
explained. But he did note the bright side. ``Unlike hedge funds,''
he said, ``we do not have shareholders who redeem.''

   FUNDS WATCH &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the Long Run, Sector Funds Outperform Their Rivals &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Psst! Ready for yet another tip on how to beat your average,
run-of-the-mill general stock fund? Try this: Dump your diversified
offerings and buy a collection of industry-specific funds.
</P>
<P>
   The average annual return of sector funds was 16.2 percent over
the 10 years ended Thursday, as calculated by Lipper Analytical
Services, the research firm in Summit, N.J., compared with 14.5
percent for general equity funds. Lipper tracks 573 sector funds
and 3,670 general equity portfolios.
</P>
<P>
   The difference is interesting in that the sector funds included
such laggards as real estate funds, which returned just 6.6
percent, annualized, over the 10 years; utilities, 10.9 percent,
and natural resources, a miserly 7.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Investors in other sectors, of course, fared far better. The
best-performing sector fund categories were health and
biotechnology, with an annualized 10-year return of 21.3 percent;
science and technology, 20.4 percent, and financial services, 20.3
percent.
</P>
<P>
   (The sector category did not include gold funds, which lost an
average of 2.7 percent, annualized. Those funds are relegated to
Lipper's world equity category.)
</P>
<P>
   The only type of general equity fund that the sector portfolios
did not beat was the group that tracks the Standard &AMP; Poor's
500-stock index. Those funds returned 17 percent a year, on
average.
</P>
<P>
   General equity funds outperformed the sector funds over shorter
time periods, but sector funds were again the winners during the
recent market downturn, losing an average of 9.7 percent from June
30 through Sept. 24, compared with a loss of 13 percent for general
equity funds. &QL;

<P>
   Q. I am part of a small team that creates product marketing
materials for our manufacturing company. One member of our team
chews up much more than her share of our group budget, overpaying
for necessities and wasting money on frills. Should the rest of us
keep pinching pennies, even though the quality of the work suffers,
or should we spend what we think we need, knowing that it will call
down the wrath of the bean counters on the whole team? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Without a doubt, your best option is C: Neither of the above.
(Isn't that always the case?) Both courses you mention aren't
really plans at all; rather, they are ways to avoid dealing with
your team's problem. And you do have a problem.
</P>
<P>
   It is essential for everyone in a group to recognize that each
member is responsible for the performance of the whole, says Jon R.
Katzenbach, a director with McKinsey &AMP; Co., the consultants, and an
author of ``The Wisdom of Teams'' (HarperBusiness). ``All members
should be mutually accountable to one another for their
expenditures or the budget or whatever,'' he said. ``Otherwise, you
don't have a real team.''
</P>
<P>
   For a work group to function effectively _ and profitably _ the
members must address internal crises like a spendthrift's breaking
of the budget. They shouldn't wait for an outsider to instill
order.
</P>
<P>
   ``The team should confront the person,'' Katzenbach advised.
``Say: `Look, we're all accountable for this. We have to
collectively be comfortable that this spending is going to help us
achieve our purpose.' ''
</P>
<P>
   David Schafer, a vice president at Enron Corp. who has worked
closely with self-directed teams, said, ``One characteristic of
teams that really should have appeal is the self-policing nature of
the group.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it can take time for a team to learn how to handle
conflicts itself, rather than relying on a supervisor. ``It's
certainly not automatic,'' Schafer said. ``One of the things I
would tell my teams is that there's safety in numbers. You've got
to be careful not to look like you're ganging up on someone, but
whoever confronts the person can say: `This isn't just my take on
the issue. This is the way the group sees it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Ron Burnaska, a consultant at the General Electric Co. on
personnel and team issues, offered a four-step approach:
</P>
<P>
   _ Designate a team member to confront the offender about the
group's concerns.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ask the offender the reasons for his behavior. (There may be a
good explanation.)
</P>
<P>
   _ If the explanation isn't convincing, work with the person on a
corrective plan.
</P>
<P>
   _ Arrange a follow-up meeting with the person to review the
situation and determine if progress is being made.
</P>
<P>
   No one likes confrontations with co-workers. But if the problem
festers, Schafer warned, ``frustration levels on the team rise and
suck the energy out of the group.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, your team's only alternative is to wait for a higher-up
to step in and handle your management responsibilities for you. And
that wouldn't look good on your year-end performance evaluations.

   Fund's Bailout Points a Finger Back to the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   During a year of worldwide financial crises, the United States
has often assumed the role of schoolmarm, lecturing other nations
on the need for banking regulation, market discipline and better
information. But the near-collapse of a large Wall Street hedge
fund has showed that even the top student in advanced capitalism
has something to learn.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in some ways, the U.S. system worked as it should, as
regulators swiftly acted on signals that the fund, Long-Term
Capital Management, was in trouble. And the fact that the fund came
near the brink may simply reflect the secrecy and complexity of the
fund's trading.
</P>
<P>
   The 16 partners of Long-Term Capital still appear to be sitting
on gains in their original investments in the hedge fund they
managed despite the fund's near-collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Hopes of a Rate Cut Lifts Stocks
</P>
<P>
   Stocks reversed early losses to rally on optimism about the
Federal Reserve Board's likelihood of cutting interest rates next
week, which offset concern that banks would report more losses on
hedge-fund investments. The Dow Jones industrial average rose
26.78, or 0.3 percent, to 8,028.77, to end a roller-coaster week
that left the average 1.7 percent higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500

   Outflows of capital appear to be slowing from stock markets in

2 MORE EUROPEAN BANKS CITE LOSSES LINKED TO LONG-TERM CAPITAL
FUND 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOSEPH KAHN and PETER TRUELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two more big European banks on Friday reported losses from their
dealings with Long-Term Capital Management LP, the large
speculative investment fund salvaged from insolvency with a $3.5
billion infusion from an elite roster of Wall Street saviors
earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   One day after UBS AG of Switzerland, Europe's largest bank,
reported a loss of as much as $721.6 million partly because of its
risky investments with Long-Term Capital, Germany's Dresdner Bank
AG said it lost $144 million and Switzerland's Credit Suisse Group
said it lost $55 million because of bad investment bets by the
Greenwich, Conn.-based hedge fund.
</P>
<P>
   Some European financial markets fell sharply Friday in reaction
to fear that further huge losses would come to light. U.S. stock
markets, which tumbled Thursday in reaction to the Long-Term
Capital rescue, fell in early trading Friday but recovered by the
end of the day to post a gain.
</P>
<P>
   Investors were nervously watching developments to determine
whether other big players in the universe of 3,000 hedge funds,
many of which had bond market positions not unlike those of
Long-Term Capital, would face pressure from banks to sell
securities to pay off margin loans, potentially weakening the
already fragile world bond market.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Bakstansky, a spokesman for the New York Federal Reserve,
which arranged the private-sector rescue of Long-Term Capital, was
cautious when asked if there might be other hedge funds that are at
risk or if the bailout of Long-Term Capital had succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   But he said that initial signs are good. ``The firm has not
collapsed, and the market reaction at this point seems to be
reasonable,'' Bakstansky said. ``If there are losses taken, they
are among the creditor firms. They are well capitalized and they
have strong market positions.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York Fed pulled together a consortium of private banks
and brokerage houses early this week to rescue Long-Term Capital,
which the Fed feared could send shock waves through a world
financial system already destabilized by Asia, Russia and other
emerging market woes.
</P>
<P>
   But the Fed's quick action to save the hedge fund from collapse
has raised other questions. Some Wall Street bankers say privately
that they felt strong-armed by the government regulator into
putting up the $3.5 billion needed to shore up the hedge fund.
There were also concerns raised in Washington about whether the
largely unregulated hedge fund sector should continue to operate
without direct oversight, given the fears that the failure of just
one big hedge fund raises about the stability of financial markets
generally.
</P>
<P>
   Another question raised by regulators in the United States and
Switzerland was whether there should be closer scrutiny of the
links between banks and hedge funds. Banks provide much of the
capital the hedge funds need to take highly risky positions in
stock, bond and currency markets. Long-Term Capital, for example,
had just over $2 billion in investment capital, but was able to
borrow enough money to make bets valued at $80 billion or more.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, chairman of the House Banking Committee,
announced that he will hold hearings soon on the Long-Term Capital
bailout. At the top of the agenda are questions about how and
whether to regulate hedge funds.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Regulators elsewhere are also concerned. Britain's Financial
Services Authority has ordered 55 banks and other financial
institutions to provide information on their exposure to Long-Term
Capital and to other hedge funds. Swiss bank regulators asked UBS
for details about its involvement in Long-Term Capital.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Zuberbuehler, director of the Swiss Federal Banking
Commission, said the matter required closer investigation. ``What
leads serious banks to involve themselves to such a degree in such
a vehicle?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   The consortium of financial institutions participating in the
rescue of Long-Term Capital announced Friday that the duration of
their equity recapitalization is three years, suggesting that
participants expect the slow resolution of the firm's trading
positions.
</P>
<P>
   The group said it would provide ``adequate liquidity to sustain
Long-Term Capital Management while it work to realize the inherent
value of its portfolio.''
</P>
<P>
   An oversight committee is being formed at the direction of the
consortium, and will include representatives of Goldman Sachs,
Merrill Lynch, JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, Travelers
Group, and UBS.
</P>
<P>
   The oversight committee, which now controls 90 percent of the
equity in Long-Term Capital, has assumed authority over all aspects
of the fund's operations, including investment strategy, capital
structure, risk management, compensation, hires and terminations,
and ``other significant decisions,'' the statement said.

DR. DONALD A. PIOUS, IMMUNOLOGIST, 68 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wash.)  (js) 
 By FORD BURKHART   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Donald A. Pious, a University of Washington immunologist who
advanced understanding of the immune system's responses to
transplants and infection, died on Sept. 6 at his home in Seattle.
He was 68.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was pancreatic cancer, family members said.
</P>
<P>
   Pious made important contributions to immunology by producing
cell mutations that revealed how the body's killer T-cells
distinguish between foreign substances, or antigens, and the the
body's own cells, said Dr. Hugh McDevitt, an immunologist at
Stanford University.
</P>
<P>
   Pious' work led to the discovery of how particular molecules
appear on protein markers, like flagpoles, that protrude through
the cell's membrane and can identify a cell containing a virus as
foreign tissue to be rejected.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Arno Motulsky, a medical geneticist at the University of
Washington, said Pious was a leader in the use of genetics to
create mutant cells for immunology studies.
</P>
<P>
   Pious' advances were central to later research on autoimmune
diseases, like rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis, as well
as on the entire system of histocompatibility, which involves the
body's response to transplants.
</P>
<P>
   Pious, who was born in Bridgeport, Conn., graduated from the
University of Pennsylvania in 1952 and earned his M.D. there in
1956.
</P>
<P>
   After a residency in pediatrics at Yale University Medical
School, he was a postdoctoral fellow in biology at the University
of California at San Diego from 1961 to 1964. Pious then joined the
University of Washington, working in its departments of pediatrics
and genetics and helping to create the department of immunology
there in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Constance; a son, Tony, of Oakland,
Calif.; a daughter, Lisa, of Berkeley, Calif., and a sister,
Barbara Bresler, of Fairfield, Conn.

COMPLICATIONS MULTIPLY IN CASE OF SLAIN GIRL 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By PAM BELLUCK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Chicago remains rattled over the case of an
11-year-old girl who was sexually molested and killed this summer
in a patch of weeds in a poor South Side neighborhood. Two months
after her death, the case has taken extraordinary twists and turns.
</P>
<P>
   At first, police said two boys, ages 7 and 8, had confessed to
killing Ryan Harris, a girl from the south suburbs who was staying
with her godmother in the boys' Englewood neighborhood so she could
attend a summer camp. Authorities charged the boys in the July 27
killing, saying they had hit Ryan with a rock, knocked her
unconscious, and then suffocated her by stuffing her panties in her
mouth and putting leaves and grass in her nostrils _ all to take
her bicycle. The boys were believed to be the youngest children
ever charged with murder.
</P>
<P>
   Then, earlier this month, prosecutors dropped the charges after
semen was found on the girl's panties. Authorities said it was
virtually impossible for boys that young to produce semen. Police
still believe that the boys may have been involved because they
knew specific details about the incident.
</P>
<P>
   Now, investigators have matched the DNA in the semen to a
29-year-old neighborhood man who was already in jail after being
charged in August with sexually assaulting a 10-year-old girl.
Friday, he was charged with sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl
in January and an 11-year-old girl in May in the same area.
</P>
<P>
   But police have not charged him in the Harris case and will not
even officially confirm that he is a suspect. Unofficially, they
said they had not yet determined exactly what the man had done. A
police official, who would speak only if he was not named, said the
man told investigators that he had not killed Ryan but that he had
performed a sexual act on her after she had been killed. The man
has also said he saw two boys near her body.
</P>
<P>
   Several factors complicate the case. Investigators have been
unable to interview the boys about the 29-year-old man because the
boys' lawyers will not let them talk to police as long as they are
considered possible suspects.
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Ferguson, a public defender who represents the
7-year-old, is worried that police would try again to get her
client to admit involvement and that they might bring the boys in
under the pretext of identifying the 29-year-old, when their real
intention would be to have the man identify the boys. She said that
even if her client saw something happen to Ryan he was so
traumatized and confused by police that he may never be able to
articulate it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're giving this new suspect an easy way out,'' said Andre
Grant, a private lawyer for the 8-year-old, who said his client
knew nothing about Ryan's death. ``The cops know they have the
right person. They just don't have the moral fortitude to admit
they made a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   People in the Englewood neighborhood, historically distrustful
of police, have become even more angry and embittered by the
apparent mishandling of the case and are, in some cases, reluctant
to cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure to solve the case has become so intense that police
two weeks ago took the unusual step of calling a news conference to
exonerate another man, whom they had interviewed after lawyers for
the 7-year-old said they considered him suspicious because he had
begun giving toys to the boy after Ryan's death.
</P>
<P>
   The Police Department has been beset by accusations that a
detective who obtained the confessions from the boys coerced a
confession from an 11-year-old boy in a murder case four years ago.
The accusations, made in a civil lawsuit filed this month by
lawyers for the 11-year-old, mirrored some complaints made by
lawyers for the boys in the Harris case. Pat Camden, a spokesman
for police, said the detective, James Cassidy, had done nothing
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the fallout from the Harris case has prompted
prosecutors, police and members of the City Council to consider
making substantial changes in juvenile investigations, including
videotaping interviews with children, insuring that a parent is
present and requiring prosecutors to approve the filing of criminal
charges against juveniles, as they do with adults.
</P>
<P>
   The Fraternal Order of Police, sensitive to the criticism,
teamed up this week with a group off Englewood business and
community leaders to offer a $10,000 reward for information leading
to Ryan's killer.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are still very angry,'' said Shirley Blanton, who runs
a laundromat in the neighborhood where the boys live. ``They're
getting sick of this. They just want it to be over.''

COMMENTARY: MORE JOY OF SEX  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK RICH    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Don't listen to the Clinton lackeys' bitter gripes about Henry
Hyde's impending impeachment show. It's hard to imagine what
Judiciary Committee investigating this president could be more
qualified _ and bipartisan _ than this one. Both Hyde, its
chairman, and Barney Frank, its ranking Democrat, have had their
own embarrassing sexual adventures exposed for all the world to
see. Who better than these guys to render justice on Clinton's
seemingly perjurious efforts to parse the sex out of oral sex?
</P>
<P>
   Hyde _ whose name by Washington journalistic decree cannot
appear in a sentence unadorned by the adjectives ``revered'' or
``beloved'' (and who has an impressive silver mane to match) _ has
expertise in the fine points of lying about sex, too. When the
chairman was revealed by the on-line magazine Salon this month to
have carried on an illicit affair with the married mother of three
more than 30 years ago, he declared, ``The statute of limitations
has long since passed on my youthful indiscretions.'' Youthful?
Hyde began the affair when 41. Indiscretion? The affair went on for
five years. Apparently any word with the prefix ``in-'' _ witness
Bill Clinton's ``inappropriate'' relationship _ is the
one-size-fits-all fig leaf to cover carnal sins in the capital.
</P>
<P>
   There are many more members of the Judiciary Committee, and by
the time they get through all the Linda Tripp tapes, we may know
all there is to know about their sex lives as well. Hyde is just
one of three outed congressmen so far this month. Republicans _
such as Tom DeLay, who wants to sic the FBI on Salon _ will keep
blaming such revelations on a White House ``scorched-earth''
strategy allegedly masterminded by Sidney (Sid Vicious) Blumenthal.
Democrats will counter by arguing that Kenneth Starr unleashed the
dogs of sexual McCarthyism with a report that Larry Flynt has now
praised for outdoing Hustler magazine in prurience.
</P>
<P>
   In the spirit of bipartisanship, I'd say both these theories are
simplistic. Starr, by spending $40 million to make the world safe
for Peeping Toms, and Clinton, by so loutishly giving him so much
to peep at, have merely poured gasoline on bonfires smoldering over
the decade since the travails of Gary Hart, Anita Hill and Clarence
Thomas ushered us into this brave new world. Throw in the
concurrent expansion of our tabloid press, especially in the
ballooning electronic media _ and the competitive rush to the
bottom it has kindled _ and we've reached the nadir where a
commentator on MSNBC this week took pains to share with us the
checkered marital histories of the Clinton allies Vaclav Havel and
Nelson Mandela.
</P>
<P>
   Were Clinton to leave office today, these forces would not
abate. As William Bennett, our self-appointed morals czar, warned
in February: ``Notice to Republican candidates: If you committed
adultery, I don't think you are going to get the nomination.'' (And
he did not bestow absolution on those with distant messy divorce
histories: ``If Gingrich did what Gingrich is alleged to have done,
that's relevant too.'') Already the likes of Dan Quayle and John
Ashcroft are running in part on the purity of their marriages; a
congressional candidate in Illinois has challenged his opponent to
join him in releasing a signed affidavit denying any hetero- or
homosexual extramarital high jinks. Even as the All Monica show
starts to wane, All Scandal All the Time is in the wings. We're all
sex addicts now.
</P>
<P>
   In a country where the video porn business is bigger than Major
League Baseball and Broadway combined, according to a study by the
trade publication Adult Video News, this shouldn't be a shock. The
question is whether anyone's sex life is relevant to public office.
In the journalistic profession, there has been some sensible
reflection of late on self-policing guidelines that might stop the
non-tabloid press from chasing the latest Drudge sludge. But in the
cutthroat race of the nonstop news cycle, these rules are no sooner
enumerated than they are broken the instant the next salacious
scoop comes along.
</P>
<P>
   The only practical antidote to the madness now may be to let the
sexual fever run its course until the media and their audience
overdose on erotic expose, and the right to privacy, for
politicians no less than the rest of us, comes back into fashion
again. Should Hyde's impeachment proceedings hasten that day, the
circus may yet be a blessing in disguise.

 &HT;    Tough task for Jackets
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Georgia Tech try to end a 53-year-old drought and
gain a measure of respect tonight when the Yellow Jackets travel to
North Carolina for a nationally televised game (7:30 p.m., ESPN).
</P>
<P>
   It will be the ACC opener for the Yellow Jackets (1-1), who had
a week off after beating New Mexico State on Sept. 12. Winning at
Chapel Hill for the first time since 1945 would be a meaningful
accomplishment for this program.
</P>
<P>
   But Georgia Tech stands to gain a lot more if it can beat the
Tar Heels (0-2). A victory, coach George O'Leary said, would be a
significant confidence-builder for a team that thinks it can
compete for the ACC title.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad our players are thinking that way, because three
years ago they weren't,'' O'Leary said. ``They know this is the
kind of game that can set the tone for an entire season.''
</P>
<P>
   Tech may find it tough to win at Kenan Stadium. North Carolina,
11-1 last year, has lost both of its games _ to Miami of Ohio
(13-10) and Stanford (37-34) _ on last-second field goals. The Tar
Heels and first-year coach Carl Torbush have their backs to the
wall.

   ``They are obviously better than their record,'' O'Leary said.
``They have recruited well and have a lot of great athletes. Still,
I think the game is very winnable, if we play well.''
</P>
<P>
   Also today, the Atlanta Football Classic matches Florida A&AMP;M and
Tennessee State in the Georgia Dome at 4 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, a couple of key games in Florida are expected to be
affected by Hurricane Georges, which already has postponed UCLA's
scheduled trip to Miami.
</P>
<P>
   No. 8 Florida will try to bounce back from last week's 20-17
overtime loss to Tennessee as it hosts undefeated Kentucky (3:30
p.m., CBS). At the same time, No. 10 Florida State (2-1) will be
out to prove it still belongs in the national championship race,
against No. 18 Southern California (3:30 p.m., ABC) in Tallahassee.
Rain is supposed to be a factor in both games. In Saturday's
biggest national game, No. 9 Washington (2-0) travels to No. 2
Nebraska (3-0). Nebraska, the defending national champion in the
coaches poll, has won 46 games in a row at home.
</P>
<P>
   In other SEC games, No. 22 Alabama (2-0) should find out if it
will be a legitimate contender in the West when it travels to
Arkansas (2-0) (6 p.m., ESPN2). South Carolina will be out to avoid
a 1-3 start when it hosts Mississippi State (12:30 p.m., WATL).
</P>
<P>
   In the ACC, Clemson (1-2) is at home against Wake Forest (1-1)
(noon, ABC), while No. 11 Virginia (3-0) visits Duke (2-1) (noon,
Fox SS).

 &HT;    Hurricane won't slow Seminoles or Gators
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- The state of Florida, once the focal point of the
college football world, can't get a break.
</P>
<P>
   First Florida State loses to N.C. State and drops out of the top
five for the first time in forever. Ditto for Florida after it
falls to Tennessee last week in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Now, improved Miami, which was licking its chops to get No. 3
UCLA in the Orange Bowl, has been cut off at the pass by a
hurricane named Georges.
</P>
<P>
   But do not weep for the Sunshine State. Florida and Florida
State will play through the rain today against legitimate opponents
and both should win. And given the wackiness of college football,
at least one of them will be in the national championship race.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to weep anyway, please do it for your humble
prognosticator, who got beat up last week by some goofy games,
Marshall over South Carolina, to name just one.
</P>
<P>
   While we're preparing to dodge Georges' rain drops, let's take
another stab at it:
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Tech (1-1) at North Carolina (0-2), 7:30 p.m., ESPN: The
Tar Heels are in trouble after losses to Miami of Ohio and
Stanford. Georgia Tech has a chance in this one if it can exploit a
defense that gave up 37 points to a bad Stanford team. Problem is,
Georgia Tech's defense hasn't exactly been a steel curtain. The
home team wins because, frankly, they've got to. North Carolina 31,
Georgia Tech 24.
</P>
<P>
   Houston (0-3) at No. 4 Tennessee (2-0), 7 p.m.: It's a cliche,
but in this case, it's true: Houston might be the best 0-3 team in
America. Tennessee is still enjoying the high of last week's huge
win over Florida, and so the Vols need to be careful. Talent,
however, should prevail, and the Vols have plenty of that.
Tennessee 31, Houston 17.
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky (3-0) at No. 8 Florida (2-1), 3:30 p.m., CBS: Kentucky
is undefeated, but the Wildcats and Tim Couch will learn there is
nothing more dangerous than a wounded Gator. Florida is still
hurting from the loss to Tennessee but will prevail at home, where
it has won 23 in a row. Florida 35, Kentucky 21.
</P>
<P>
   No. 18 Southern California (3-0) at No. 10 Florida State (2-1),
3:30 p.m. (ABC): If the Seminoles are going to be contenders,
instead of pretenders, for the national championship, they need to
take care of business against the Trojans. FSU quarterback Chris
Weinke is starting to get more comfortable with the offense and
should play well. The Seminoles have won 35 straight games at home.
This will be 36. Florida State 31, Southern California 20.
</P>
<P>
   No. 22 Alabama at Arkansas (2-0), 6 p.m. (ESPN2): Two teams
hoping to find out if they have the right stuff to contend in the
SEC West. Alabama has lost three out of its last four games to
Arkansas, but the Crimson Tide feels good about its new offense and
Shaun Alexander, who has 321 yards and eight touchdowns in his
first two games. This game is the first real test for Houston Nutt,
the first-year coach at Arkansas. Because of Alexander the Great,
we like the Tide. Alabama 24, Arkansas 17.
</P>
<P>
   No. 9 Washington (2-0) at No. 2 Nebraska (3-0), 3:30 p.m.: The
Cornhuskers have been without running back DeAngelo Evans and
quarterback Bobby Newcombe for two weeks, and now both are back.
The Huskies do not have a running game, which means quarterback
Brock Huard is going to take a beating. There is a reason Nebraska
has won 46 in a row at home. Nebraska 35, Washington 14.
</P>
<P>
   Mississippi State (2-1) at South Carolina (1-2), 12:30 p.m.
(Jefferson-Pilot): South Carolina is in a must-win situation after
last weak's inexplicable loss to Marshall. Mississippi State is
coming off a tough road loss to Oklahoma State. The Bulldogs think
they are good enough to win the SEC West. They'll prove it in
Columbia. Miss. State 24, South Carolina 14.
</P>
<P>
   Wake Forest (1-1) at Clemson (1-2), Noon: The Tigers were on the
verge of a major upset at Virginia last week and let it slip away.
Now their backs are to the wall against the Deacons, who have lost
four in a row to Clemson. Clemson gets the edge at home, but it
won't be easy. Clemson 24, Wake Forest 17.
</P>
<P>
   Purdue (2-1) at Notre Dame (1-1), 2:30 p.m., NBC: Notre Dame has
had a week off since getting trounced by Michigan State on Sept.
12, while Purdue is coming off an impressive 35-7 win over Central
Florida. Purdue upset the Irish a year ago, but this year Bob
Davie's club has a better idea of what they are doing. Notre Dame
28, Purdue 24.
</P>
<P>
   The others:
</P>
<P>
   ACC _ Virginia 31, Duke 20; Maryland 21, Temple 14.
</P>
<P>
   SEC _ LSU 42, Idaho 14; Mississippi 21, SMU 17.
</P>
<P>
   Top 25 _ No. 5 Kansas State 70, NE Louisiana 14; No. 14
Wisconsin 24, Northwestern 20; No. 15 Colorado 31, Baylor 14; No.
17 Texas A&AMP;M 42, North Texas 21; No. 19 West Virginia 30, Tulsa 17;
No. 20 Oregon 42, Stanford 17; No. 21 Virginia Tech 21, Pittsburgh
20.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's record: 13-7.
</P>
<P>
   Season's record: 36-21.

 &HT;    Tech, UNC both at critical juncture
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- For the past couple of years, playing North Carolina
has been about trying to move into the upper echelon of the ACC for
Georgia Tech. But tonight's ACC opener at Kenan Stadium at 7:30 on
ESPN is more about survival for the Tar Heels.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina (0-2) is reeling after a pair of losses to Miami
of Ohio and Stanford, two teams the 1996 and 1997 Tar Heels
wouldn't have imagined losing to. They are trying to regain some
face among their fans who have gotten used to winning and were
shocked by legal problems surrounding the program, most recently
with the suspension of offensive guard Jon Hall after he was
arrested for allegedly assaulting and threatening a woman.
</P>
<P>
   First-year coach Carl Torbush is scrambling for his first win
since adding the title of head coach to defensive coordinator with
the departure of Mack Brown for Texas. He's likely to be going with
a true freshman quarterback, Ronald Curry, gifted but untested in
his first ACC game. Torbush already is talking about must-wins and
trying to prevent Carolina from going 0-3 for the first time since
1988, Brown's first season in Chapel Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're going to be in the bowl picture, this is a game we
need to win,'' Torbush said. ``There comes a point when you need to
have success if you're planning to have a very solid football
season.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yellow Jackets (1-1), meanwhile, are not much more proven
than North Carolina, with their only win against a low-caliber
opponent in New Mexico State. A loss in Chapel Hill would make the
season-opening Boston College loss a lot more vivid. A win would go
some way in building confidence for the rest of the ACC schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big game for us because it's the first ACC game,'' Tech
quarterback Joe Hamilton said. ``And they've been a tough opponent.
It's equally important to them because they're 0-2. They'll be a
little hungry. They're playing in front of a home crowd. It will be
a good game.''
</P>
<P>
   Tech has not won at Kenan Stadium since 1945, the year before
coach George O'Leary was born. To win this one, the defense will
have to continue the progress it showed against New Mexico State.
North Carolina does not have a dominating running back, but Curry
is dangerous running the ball himself.
</P>
<P>
   The Tar Heels have some key injuries, including receiver L.C.
Stevens, who is questionable with a sprained knee, and running back
Ronnie Robinson, who has been slow to recover from a concussion he
suffered against Stanford. Their two best athletes _ Curry and
All-American cornerback Dre Bly _ both have missed practice time
this week because of the deaths of their grandfathers.
</P>
<P>
   Offensively, Hamilton needs to have his best game yet against
North Carolina. He will feel the heat from a defense trying to
rebound from giving up 451 yards to Stanford, the most since a 1994
game against Duke.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a pivotal game for the program, not just the
season,'' Tech slot back Charlie Rogers said. ``We're trying to
move forward. This would give us momentum in the coming weeks.''

 &HT;    Jesse Jackson attempts to brings public awareness to the plight
of the Appalachia's poor
 &HT;    By Wendy Hundley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Just as the Selma, Ala. march focused the
nation's attention on voting rights for blacks, Rev. Jesse Jackson
is trying to turn the public spotlight on the plight of the poor in
Appalachia.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Jackson will be joined by Rev. Jerry Falwell, singer
Willie Nelson and actor Martin Sheen for a rally at Hocking College
in Nelsonville, according to Jackson's Rainbow/PUSH Coalition. The
march will be followed on Monday with an economic summit at Hocking
in that southeastern Ohio community.
</P>
<P>
   In a teleconference Friday, Jackson told about 25 reporters that
``the real needs of the American people are going unaddressed''
while the media chase the President Clinton-Monica Lewinsky sex
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to keep pressing this case until the press becomes
obsessed with impeaching poverty, illiteracy and disease,'' Jackson
said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the the six-state region in the heart of Appalachia
represents the ``richest soil but the poorest people in our
nation.'' The area, he said, is plagued by a lack of economic
development, inadequate housing and health care.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the Titanic, 1,500 people were killed and people are still
traumatized,'' Jackson said. ``But 1,500 people die each year from
black lung disease every year and it's hardly noticed.'' United
Mine Workers President Cecil Roberts also participated in the
teleconference.
</P>
<P>
   .Jackson is calling for a kind of domestic Marshall Plan that
would encourage economic development in the region with tax-free
zones, long-term, low-interest loans and other incentives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should do for Americans what we do for our allies abroad,''
said Jackson, who went on a 13-stop bus tour last week through
Ohio, West Virginia and Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   The civil rights leader said he wants people in the impoverished
area to recognize their power to improve their situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just as Selma sent a message about the right to vote,''
Jackson said, ``our focus is on the underserved Americans who have
played by the rules and yet growth and prosperity has passed them
by.''

 &HT;    Ohio honors Rosa Park
 &HT;    By John Keilman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ On Dec. 2, 1955, the night after Rosa Parks refused
to give her seat on a public bus to a white man, the Ku Klux Klan
burned a cross on the tallest hill in Villa Rica, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   John Hindsman was there, watching the smoke curl over the
graveyard where his mother was buried. The Klan set the fire to
show the town's black people that Parks' immediately famous act of
defiance had changed nothing, recalled Hindsman, now an 81-year-old
Daytonian.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The Klan) didn't think nobody would have the courage to stand
up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   History's verdict on that notion was evident Friday afternoon,
when Hindsman and about 250 others, black and white, crowded the
atrium of the Cincinnati Westin Hotel to greet the woman whose act
of courage changed history.
</P>
<P>
   Parks, now 85, was in town to receive the first International
Freedom Conductor Award from the National Underground Railroad
Freedom Center.
</P>
<P>
   The former seamstress emerged from a black stretch limousine in
front of the hotel at 12:46 p.m. and made her way through a
cheering gauntlet of admirers. Once inside, dozens of
schoolchildren serenaded her with America the Beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   Parks didn't speak long, only about 5 minutes. She recalled the
fateful afternoon when, tired from a day of work and fed up with
decades of mistreatment, she told a Montgomery, Ala., bus driver
that she had no intention of surrendering her seat.
</P>
<P>
   Two police officers took her to jail. But Parks' bravery sparked
a year-long boycott that put the company out of business and put
the modern civil rights movement on the map.
</P>
<P>
   Parks told the audience her experience still had relevance
today.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you find that you're being mistreated, you don't need no
fussing or fighting _ in a quiet way, let them know,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   One man who doesn't mind fussing or fighting was also on hand
Friday. Retired federal Judge A. Leon Higginbotham, a
blunt-speaking civil rights champion, gave the Freedom Center's
first Theodore M. Barry lecture.
</P>
<P>
   In a stentorian voice, Higginbotham recalled his days as one of
Antioch College's first black students, and he remembered Jessie
Treichler, the white college secretary who raised money to bring
him there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Treichler was one of the first persons I ever met who seemed
totally devoid of racial bias and prejudice, and who saw inherent
humanity in all individuals,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The judge also said the spirit of the Underground Railroad is
still needed today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Its goal of enabling all Americans to be truly free has not
been realized,'' he said. ``In the history of this nation, there
have been, and still are, many persons who . . . are in a real
sense still shackled.
</P>
<P>
   `` . . . They carry what at first glance are the almost
invisible shackles of illiteracy, a grossly inadequate education,
and a lack of any essential skills to get a job.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosa Parks will receive her honor tonight at a black tie dinner.
The International Freedom Conductor award is meant to recognize
those whose words and deeds reflect the spirit of the Underground
Railroad.
</P>
<P>
   As Parks left the atrium escorted by white-shirted policemen,
Hindsman walked over to a display of a bus seat refurbished to look
much like the one Parks refused to relinquish. He snapped a few
photos of it, but those probably won't be the pictures he'll
remember.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took me 50 years to get a photo of Rosa Parks,'' he said.
``But I got it.

 &HT;    FAMU has 7-game win streak in matchup of mutual respect
 &HT;    By Earnest Reese
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Coaches Billy Joe of Florida A&AMP;M and L.C. Cole of
Tennessee State are singing the praises of each other's team before
today's 10th annual Atlanta Football Classic at the Georgia Dome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tennessee State has a very explosive offense. They've got some
great skill position players,'' Joe said. ``They can score from
anywhere on the field. If we don't play our best football, we could
have some serious problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Cole said, ``The edge in this game has to go Florida A&AMP;M because
of all the points they've scored. They've got a lot of skillful
players. And what's really great about their situation is that
coaching staff has been together so long. That's hard to beat.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rattlers (2-1), with a coaching staff that includes four
assistants who have been with Joe all five of the years he's been
in Tallahassee, decimated their last two opponents. They routed
Norfolk State 84-14 and then blasted Jackson State 45-7 last week.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee State (1-1), off a week after a 33-21 win over Jackson
State before a crowd of 55,000 in Memphis, is averaging 487 yards a
game in total offense.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams will start quarterbacks who began their college
careers in Division I programs. Tennessee State sophomore Leon
Murray, who transferred from Pittsburgh, has averaged 347 yards
passing per game this season.
</P>
<P>
   Murray's primary targets have been senior All-America candidate
Tyrone Butterfield (17 catches, 258 yards) and Corey Sullivan, a
sophomore who has caught 13 passes for 178 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Murray has done an excellent job,'' Cole said. ``He's gotten
better each game.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe, making good on his promise to start each of his team's top
three quarterbacks, puts the offense in the hand of senior Pat
Bonner against Tennessee State. Bonner, a Fort Lauderdale, Fla.,
native who transferred from Temple, passed for 343 yards and three
touchdowns against Jackson State, while sophomore receiver Jacquay
Nunnally leads Division I-AA averaging 131 yards receiving per
game.
</P>
<P>
   Florida A&AMP;M has beaten TSU seven times in row. Three of those
victories came in this classic sponsored by 100 Black of Men of
Atlanta. And if Joe's assessment of his team is true, the Rattlers
just might be able to register their eighth victory in row over a
Tiger team that was beaten by South Carolina State in this classic
a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we've played as well as we need to play,'' Joe
said. ``Our best football is still ahead of us.''
</P>
<P>
   TENNESSEE STATE VS. FLORIDA A&AMP;M
</P>
<P>
   -- When, where: Today, 4 p.m.; Georgia Dome, Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   -- Series: Tennessee State leads 23-14.
</P>
<P>
   -- Records: Tennessee State 1-1; Florida A&AMP;M 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   -- Game notes: This is the fifth meeting of these two teams in
Atlanta, and their first in the Georgia Dome. In the previous four
games _ two played at Georgia Tech (1989 and '90) and two at
Atlanta- Fulton County Stadium, they averaged 46,767 in
attendance.... FAMU, which has won its last seven games against
TSU, will be seeking its third straight victory on the road.

 &HT;    Leagues differ from NBA on eligibility issue
 &HT;    By Mike Fish
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Kenny Anderson skipped out of Georgia Tech for the
NBA after only two years. Stephon Marbury stayed just one season.
</P>
<P>
   The latest incoming Yellow Jackets point guard out of New York
must wait four years before having the option to play for pay.
</P>
<P>
   Her name is Niesha Butler, and the professional leagues she has
her eye on prohibit women from suiting up until they've completed
their college eligibility. Defeated in the courts 24 years ago in
its efforts to keep out college underclassmen, the NBA has
reluctantly opened its doors to them _ plus graduating high-school
seniors. Not so with the ABL and WNBA.
</P>
<P>
   The women's leagues might not be on firm legal ground, but the
money to be made _ $150,000 for top stars, not counting
endorsements _ has not offered enough incentive for a player to
bring a test case. Some day, it will happen. Either salaries will
escalate, or the leagues will relax their rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, it's antitrust,'' California-Berkeley coach Marianne
Stanley said. ``It's going to take the first woman to say, `Hey, if
guys can leave early, I should be able to leave early, too.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee star Chamique Holdsclaw is believed to have considered
a challenge but decided to remain in college.
</P>
<P>
   Opinion is split among lawyers and sports agents whether the
leagues' refusal to draft underclassmen might be a violation of
antitrust law. Some suggest that the courts would agree, because
the WNBA and ABL have no collective-bargaining agreement with their
players and yet unilaterally impose provisions for a draft. At the
same time, however, Supreme Court decisions since 1985 have
weakened antitrust laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``You now need to show it hurts a whole market of players,''
said attorney Mark Levinstein, a specialist in antitrust law. ``One
person being kept out isn't going to be enough. But, really, no one
can say for sure how a challenge would shake out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The leagues aren't doing it to raise prices or hurt
competition. They're doing it because they want to look good
public-relations-wise and they want to have good relations with the
universities.''
</P>
<P>
   Butler, the all-time leading scorer in New York high schools,
maintains that the rule is unfair to women. She wrote a
first-person story on the topic for a sports Internet site.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see why men should have the opportunity to turn pro
early but not women,'' she said. ``That's why you go to college _
to create options for yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Tech coach Agnes Berenato agrees to an extent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a stupid rule,'' Berenato said. ``It's an unfair
rule. I don't think anybody is ready (to turn pro) at 17 or 18. But
the point is, men can do it and women can't. Somebody will
challenge that.''
</P>
<P>
   The inconsistency between the women's leagues and the NBA is
irksome to leaders of the women's sports movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure the cat's meow for a very talented performer is
to go through college from 18 to 22 if your performing lifetime is
limited,'' said Donna Lopiano, executive director of the Women's
Sports Foundation. ``You can go to college anytime you want. I'm
sorry, (but) this is not sacred ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Defenders of the policies point to the increasing antisocial
behavior of NBA players and trace some of the blame to the early
entry of teenage athletes. WNBA commissioner Val Ackerman, a former
NBA employee, says her league has been assured its stand is solid
and that the men's league wishes it didn't have to accept the
players.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're set up as a single enterprise, which is different than
the NBA,'' Ackerman said. ``Because of that legal and corporate
structure, our lawyers have indicated this sort of a rule would be
unassailable. So we have great comfort in that.''
</P>
<P>
   WNBA star Sheryl Swoopes hopes the rule stands up, to help her
league maintain some of its innocence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NBA made that mistake when it let guys come out (early),''
Swoopes said. ``I hope it never gets to that point with the women.

 &HT;    Kersee: It's acceptable to be a tomboy now
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jackie Joyner-Kersee, a six-time Olympic track-and-field
medalist and a former star basketball player at UCLA, is widely
recognized as the greatest female athlete of her generation.
Kersee, 36, retired after this past track season to devote full
attention to her St. Louis-based sports marketing firm. This
summer, she was the lone woman on ESPN's town-hall meeting on race
in sports, which featured President Clinton. Joyner-Kersee wrote
the following essay for the Journal-Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   When I was growing up in East St. Louis, Ill., my introduction
to competitive sports came early in my sophomore year at Lincoln
High School. I was bigger than most girls my age. On the
playground, I had discovered I could out-run a lot of the boys. So
here I was, trying out for the girls basketball team.
</P>
<P>
   I can still remember the coach coming into the gym that first
afternoon, telling us, ``Well, we're going to have to move practice
to 6:30 (p.m.)'' I'm thinking, ``Mom is not going to let me come up
here at no 6:30!'' It's dark by this time. A lot of our parents
didn't have transportation, and we lived all over.
</P>
<P>
   The reason we were being pushed back is the boys were supposed
to get the gym first. It wasn't about sharing half of the court. It
was simply that we were females, and we would have to practice
after the boys.
</P>
<P>
   By the next year, after a lot of debate, we got the gym at 3:30.
One reason was safety. But we'd also opened some eyes with a great
showing on the court. My sophomore year, we went to the state
championships. A lot of the same girls were on the undefeated team
my senior year.
</P>
<P>
   I can tell you, people were jealous because we were so dominant
not only in basketball, but softball, volleyball and track. It
might sound silly, but we thought there was a conspiracy where some
guys on the boys teams were encouraged to get some of the girls
pregnant so we couldn't win as much. Our coaches talked about it,
warning us to be careful about who we were dating and what some
boys' agendas might be.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back, it's still hard to understand why people were so
upset that we were getting more publicity and attention than the
boys.
</P>
<P>
   What I find really positive today is the far greater
appreciation for women's sports. When I was growing up, it wasn't
really looked upon as the right thing to do. You weren't considered
feminine. You had my idol, Wilma Rudolph, in track. You had Billie
Jean King in tennis, and what she brought to the sport was great.
But she was almost ostracized because of the very private choice of
her sexual preference.
</P>
<P>
   I don't want to say that hurt, but it gave people a reason not
to want to support women's athletics. That shouldn't have been the
case, because people should have the freedom to be who they want.
Probably all of us heard the negative, unflattering comments.
``Tomboy'' was a big one.
</P>
<P>
   When I started making a living on the international track
circuit, I caught on immediately that men and women weren't treated
the same. In 1984, only a few top female athletes were earning
between $5,000 and $10,000 per meet. Promoters had this mentality
that people didn't want to see women compete. Now, it's not unheard
of for a woman to command a $25,000 to $40,000 appearance fee,
although you might have only four or five female athletes earning
top dollar. Still, it's better than it was 15 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   It was unheard of for a female to have a shoe named after her. I
never had that opportunity. Now, there are several women with shoes
named after them.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the Los Angeles Olympics 14 years ago, you didn't
see women on the business side of sports. I only saw myself as an
athlete. But now I'm able to parlay my athletics into a
sports-marketing company. I can do things to help other female
athletes. I can go out and register as an agent with the NBA and
NFL. My firm can represent an NFL No. 1 draft pick like Terry Fair,
and no one calls me a tomboy.
</P>
<P>
   When people ask me to project the hot names over the next 10
years, I often say Mia Hamm in soccer, Marion Jones in track and
Chamique Holdsclaw, the Tennessee basketball star, just to name a
few.
</P>
<P>
   I really think women's basketball will grow. The WNBA has done a
great job selling the game and bringing in fans that wouldn't
ordinarily watch women's basketball. The ABL has established a
foundation, too, but I find it hard to see two leagues surviving.
It's difficult when the WNBA is on TV consistently and the ABL is
not. Rather than a merger of leagues, you might see a day when the
WNBA simply absorbs a few teams or players from the ABL.
</P>
<P>
   Whether other women's pro leagues reach the same level, I'm not
so sure. Women's soccer is here to stay, and you can say the same
about softball and maybe even hockey _ at least at the Olympic or
international level. Basketball was truly a natural. The other
sports have to grow that talent base and interest at the college
level.
</P>
<P>
   Hopefully, we'll also see more women in decision-making
positions. It makes sense that females with roots in sports should
head up the NCAA, run college athletic departments or be
influential in the advertising and marketing business.
</P>
<P>
   My husband Bobby and I eventually would like to start a family.
And if we were to have a daughter, we'd like for her to benefit
from the big changes in women's sports. I'm glad she'll have
opportunities that didn't used to exist for other young girls and
myself when I was coming up.
</P>
<P>
   I know it sounds corny to say women have come a long way, but
it's true. Now, it's okay for us to sweat, be tough, get dirty. And
people don't mind coming to see that.

 &HT;    Are women bound to same competitive standards as men?
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- The familiar fodder of sports-radio call-in programs
temporarily vanished from America's jock-talk menu in late
February. It was replaced by a subject that rarely shows up on that
combative format's radar screen.
</P>
<P>
   The injured Nykesha Sales had scored a ``gift'' basket that
enabled her to become the University of Connecticut's career
scoring leader. Her coach defended the move by asserting that women
are different emotionally and bring a unique perspective to sports
that should be understood and appreciated. The league commissioner
said he would have had a different opinion for a male athlete,
because women are more sensitive and should be treated accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   The simple layup and complex aftermath generated the kind of
discussion that is virtually non-existent on the sports airwaves.
And it forced an examination of how far women's sports have come.
</P>
<P>
   Should female athletes be given a pass from the difficult
lessons of sports? Or should they be bound to the same competitive
standards and values under which males have operated for years?
</P>
<P>
   How those questions are answered will help determine the status
of top-level women's sports as it enters the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   Sales, who ruptured an Achilles' tendon the week before, walked
onto the floor in uniform at Villanova, took the opening tip as the
other players stood idly by and scored to rousing applause.
</P>
<P>
   She had been two points short of the record when her college
career came to a crashing end. UConn coach Geno Auriemma and
Villanova's Harry Perretta agreed to stage the uncontested hoop.
Big East commissioner Mike Tranghese learned of the plan in advance
and approved it.
</P>
<P>
   For the better part of a week, the media devoted considerable
time and space to the Sales controversy. UConn's status as a
high-ranked, high-profile team in the back yard of the New York
market made it a national story.
</P>
<P>
   Many talk-show hosts complained that Auriemma was promoting a
double standard at the same time that women are demanding equality
in athletics.
</P>
<P>
   Beau Bock, a veteran Atlanta sports radio host at ``SportsTalk
790 The Zone,'' had a different spin. As the father of two
basketball-playing daughters, he had no trouble seeing what
Auriemma was trying to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of the greatest things I've ever seen in sports,
men's or women's,'' he said. ``What's wrong with showing a great
athlete some compassion?''
</P>
<P>
   How that compassion should be defined when it comes to women
athletes has been part of the fallout. A number of Auriemma's
coaching colleagues defended his gesture, although others thought
it bordered on fixing a game. UConn beat Villanova that night in
overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Auriemma unleashed a furious assault on his critics. He called
ESPN ``SportsCenter'' host Kenny Mayne an idiot for questioning his
sincerity and went on popular New York City sports-radio station
WFAN to defend himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, I thought, 'What is he (Auriemma) doing?' `` said
Marilyn Childress, former president of the advocacy group Georgia
Women's Intersport Network. ``But later on, I realized that we
don't have to necessarily fit the men's mold.
</P>
<P>
   ``It came across like a daddy taking care of his daughter.
Nobody talks about it when a football coach does the same thing
with his players. It's a father-son thing then, and it's widely
admired.''
</P>
<P>
   Some men who coach women's sports have immersed themselves in
female psychology to understand the differences. Anson Dorrance,
whose University of North Carolina soccer teams have won 15 NCAA
titles, notes that female athletes generally have less
self-confidence than males. His approach is to build up each
player, one by one, then fold them into an emotionally cohesive
unit in which teamwork and mutual support are paramount. In men's
sports, coaches often have to break down individual egos to get the
same result.
</P>
<P>
   (In August, Dorrance was sued on sexual harassment grounds by
two former players seeking $12 million in damages. Included in
their complaints is that Dorrance was too intrusive, often asking
about their private lives, and that he made unwanted advances,
including what they considered inappropriate touching. Dorrance
denied the charges, and other former players have signed a
statement in support of him.)
</P>
<P>
   Hartford Courant columnist Jeff Jacobs condemned Auriemma's
action, suggesting that it was Soupy Sales, rather than Nykesha
Sales, who set the scoring record and to ``forget all that
namby-pamby innocent stuff so many try to peddle about women's
sports. The women must understand rigging events is inherently
dishonest.''
</P>
<P>
   For his opinions, Jacobs received threatening phone calls. On
the eve of the NCAA Tournament, his newspaper published a special
four-page section containing only letters to the editor about the
Sales controversy. Most of them blasted Jacobs for being harsh.
</P>
<P>
   Auriemma stood by his actions: ``Are we supposed to be just like
men's sports?''
</P>
<P>
   Women's Sports Foundation executive director Donna Lopiano
ripped Tranghese for allowing the ``fix'' to go on and said the
gender of the athlete should have nothing to do with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the most sexist and irresponsible comment by an athletics
commissioner I have ever heard,'' she said. ``People's motivations
were good, but all that stuff is ethically unjustifiable.''
</P>
<P>
   Other women's sports advocates say that while they were glad
their issues were getting some attention, they're uneasy with the
reasons why.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was blown out of proportion,'' said Nancy Levin, publisher
of W Sports, a national magazine for women's sports that will start
up next year. ``(Sales' basket) was probably a bad decision, but
there are still a lot of people out there who are looking for a way
to bash women's sports. People who didn't know who Nykesha Sales
was were chiming in. It even made Dan Rather (and the CBS Evening
News).''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Sales controversy soon died out, it might have
signaled the beginning of what figures to be occasional forays into
women's sports topics.
</P>
<P>
   ``You put opinions out there and it drives people crazy,'' Bock
said. ``I mean, some of these knuckleheads who called up about this
didn't know what we were talking about. But there are a lot of guys
out there who do watch women's sports, and I think they're going to
continue to take off.

 &HT;    TV exposure on upswing, but ratings slow to follow
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- The pursuit of women's sports programming on
television has picked up to the extent that even Lifetime, a cable
channel associated more with the touchy-feeliness of such shows as
``Sisters,'' has spun itself into a poor woman's ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   What started as a diversion four years ago _ sponsorship of the
first women's sailing crew to compete in the America's Cup _ has
swelled to a five-year agreement with the WNBA, coverage of an LPGA
event, the creation of a Lifetime Sports division and an Internet
site that includes a tutorial, ``Sports 101.''
</P>
<P>
   The results? Doug McCormack, the Lifetime CEO, conceded, ``When
our viewers turn on their sets and get a basketball game, we don't
do as well in the ratings as we do with movies. But anytime you
expand a franchise, you take one step back before you take two
forward.''
</P>
<P>
   There is disagreement as to whether those steps throughout the
industry are forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
   Women's sports have had unprecedented growth on television. In
addition to Lifetime's commitment, ESPN has expanded its coverage
of college basketball and added such new properties as the WNBA,
the women's World Cup in 1999 and professional fast-pitch softball.
NBC carries some WNBA games. ABC plans World Cup coverage. CBS,
while dropping the women's NCAA basketball tournament, still
carries regular-season games.
</P>
<P>
   A universal decrease in coverage is unlikely, given the
proliferation of cable channels. But TV has yet to find a gusher to
join the likes of Olympic women's figure skating and gymnastics,
which appear only once every four years.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, while the amount of programming has gone up, many of the
ratings have dropped. ESPN drew a 4.0 rating for the NCAA women's
basketball title game in 1997 but fell back to 3.7 this year. One
rating point is equivalent to approximately 980,000 households, so
the drop constituted about 327,000 homes.
</P>
<P>
   The WNBA, despite an extensive marketing campaign created and
funded by the NBA, also has gone backwards in the ratings. In its
first year, the women's league drew average ratings of 2.0 on NBC,
0.9 on ESPN and 0.5 on Lifetime. But in the just-completed season,
including playoffs, it averaged only a 1.6 on NBC, 0.7 on ESPN and
0.5 on Lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   NBC Sports publicist Jennifer Arnold, asked whether the network
is concerned about the decline, said, ``We're in this for the long
haul. In looking at all the factors, this is a sport that is
building a solid foundation.''
</P>
<P>
   Lifetime spokesman Brett Henne echoed those remarks, saying,
``Our demographics show that we drew in a younger audience, and
that's what we wanted.'' Nonetheless, Lifetime's 0.5 rating (less
than 500,000 homes) pales in comparison with the cable network's
average rating for a movie of 1.8 (1.764 million).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about individual numbers,'' McCormack said.
``Lifetime has an obligation to be a leader in this area.''
</P>
<P>
   Former CBS Sports president Neal Pilson, now a consultant,
speculated that ratings growth isn't imminent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very difficult to grow a sport in the current
environment, when ratings in most sports are on the decline,'' he
said. ``Women's sports has a solid platform _ an advertising base
and a viewer base. I have confidence they'll do OK. But I'd hate to
predict growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will women's sports ever get the ratings of men's sports? I
don't think so. But it could chip away.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Gutkowski, former head of programming at ESPN, said women's
events are ``becoming more attractive for advertisers.'' But he
said it's difficult to project a ratings climb, which ultimately
decides air time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it'll have some pocket hits,'' said Gutkowski,
president of a sports-marketing firm, ``but whether women's sports
will, across the board, see tremendous growth, I'm not sure. NBC
has done a good job (marketing) the WNBA. But (the league) hasn't
represented that it can rate well.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether women's sports programming fits into the category
of hot, uncertain or fad, Gutkowski said, ``It's a hot, uncertain
fad.''
</P>
<P>
   Figure skating and gymnastics long have been the dominant
women's sports, in terms of viewership, and skating has been
particularly strong since the Tonya Harding-Nancy Kerrigan saga in
1994. It's been suggested that the ratings are connected to both
because they are so-called ``leotard sports,'' where women athletes
appear more feminine than in basketball or golf.
</P>
<P>
   But Pilson said, ``I don't see ice skating as a leotard sport.
Ice skating is more story-telling and theater.''
</P>
<P>
   ESPN vice president John Wildhack believes viewership of all
women's sports will rise.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very bullish on the women's sports,'' he said. ``I think
it's here to stay. I don't see any leveling off (in interest).''
</P>
<P>
   ESPN has grown into three networks and needs to fill air time.
Wildhack denied that the growth is the sole reason the company
carries more events. ``As much as we (need) programming, seldom do
we have a situation where we say we have holes to fill,'' he said.
``We try to target marquee properties.''
</P>
<P>
   CBS had carried the NCAA women's finals but let the entire
tournament package go to ESPN. ``I think advertisers are
interested,'' CBS vice president/programming Mike Aresco said.
``Ratings just don't justify a bigger commitment yet.''

   WASHINGTON WATCH VOTE CHART Questions regarding this
transmission should be directed to 202-628-3100, ext. 224.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 25 -- The following chart shows how senators and
representatives voted on key bills and amendments within the last
week. A ``Y'' means the member voted for the measure; an ``N''
means the member voted against the measure; a ``?'' means the
member did not vote; and a ``P'' means the member voted
``present.''
</P>
<P>
   SENATE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: WAGE
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Tuesday voted to block a minimum wage increase. By a
55-44 vote, senators decided to table -- or set aside for the year
-- a proposal to raise the federal minimum wage by $1 over the next
two years. Supporters of the procedural vote cited an increase in
the minimum wage within the past several years. Opponents of the
motion to kill the increase said it would have helped working
families stay above the poverty line. A ``yes'' vote favors tabling
the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: BANKRUPT
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Wednesday voted, 97-1, to overhaul the nation's
bankruptcy laws, making it more difficult for consumers to file for
bankruptcy. Supporters said the law needs to be changed because
currently many people exploit the bankruptcy system to get out of
paying debts. The opponent said the overhaul would make it harder
for those who legitimately need to file for bankruptcy to do so. A
``yes'' vote favors the bill.
</P>
<P>
   3) BILL NUMBER: FAA
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Friday voted, 92-1, to renew Federal Aviation
Administration programs and earmark $10.1 billion in fiscal 1999
for the agency. The measure would increase flights at busy airports
while restricting flights over national parks. Supporters said the
legislation would provide increased service to underserved areas.
The opponent said the legislation goes against previous agreements
to turn airports over to regional authorities. A ``yes'' vote
favors the bill.

   HOUSE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: SCHOOLS
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Sept. 18, the House approved a measure, 212-198, that
would reallocate money from 31 federal education programs to block
grants given directly to the states. The grants would total $2.7
billion in 1999 and $14.3 billion over five years. Supporters said
it would allow teachers and students to focus on learning.
Opponents said the measure would not address serious education
problems, such as classroom overcrowding and a lack of qualified
teachers. A ``yes'' vote favors the bill.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: IMMIGRANTS
</P>
<P>
   The House Thursday approved, 288-133, a bill that would allow
more skilled immigrants to work in the United States. The measure
would increase the number of visas given to immigrants who would
work in such high-tech fields as computer programming and
engineering. Supporters said the bill would not necessarily result
in immigrants taking jobs away from U.S. workers. Opponents said
companies will lay off U.S. workers to hire immigrants who will
work for lower wages. A ``yes'' vote favors the bill.
</P>
<P>
   3) BILL NUMBER: SS
</P>
<P>
   The House Friday voted, 240-188, to set aside a portion of the
budget surplus for Social Security. The measure would place 90
percent of the estimated $1.6 trillion budget surplus over the next
10 years in a reserve account until the future of Social Security
is set. Supporters, mostly Republicans, said the measure could save
Social Security, and the remaining 10 percent could be used to cut
taxes. Opponents said the entire surplus should be put into the
reserve account and that using the money for tax cuts would be an
assault on Social Security. A ``yes'' vote favors the bill.

   (NOTE: Because of the complicated figuring involved, you are
requested to use these Best Sellers lists in full or not at all.
This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-To,
and Miscellaneous'' listings were separated from the non-fiction
list for important reasons, and not to print ``Advice, How-To, and
Miscellaneous'' gives an impression that is incorrect, resulting in
criticism from publishing houses.)

<P>
   Rankings reflect sales figures for the week ending Sept. 12,
1998, at almost 4,000 bookstores plus wholesalers serving 60,000
other retailers, statistically weighted to represent sales in all
such outlets nationwide. The number of titles within the two
subdivisions of non-fiction can change from week to week,
reflecting changes in book buying.

COMMENTARY: RUBE GOES TO TOWN  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By RUSSELL BAKER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   I spent four days in New York. It was swell.
</P>
<P>
   Except for the restaurant prices. I'd planned to stay five days
in New York, but after the fourth day, restaurant eating had
already cost me $3,792.87.
</P>
<P>
   That was without wine. By leaving wine alone, you can save $800
to $900 per meal in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Ask for water, but don't let them bring you that bottled
imported water all the restaurants push.
</P>
<P>
   That costs $200 to $300 per bottle, depending on where the water
is imported from, whether it was bottled in a vintage year and
whether the bottler has an advanced degree in hydrology.
</P>
<P>
   Stay with tap water. New York tap water is tops, and most
restaurants charge only $10 a glass with one free refill.
</P>
<P>
   My first day in town the president showed up. You know what it's
like when a president leaves Washington. Or maybe you don't.
</P>
<P>
   I once went to a college commencement where a U.S. president
showed up.
</P>
<P>
   Spoiled it for everybody. Cops everywhere, traffic detoured all
the way out to Chaos Township. Armed men standing by metal
detectors to seize absent-minded professors who'd forgotten to
leave their Kalashnikovs at home.
</P>
<P>
   In short: mass-teria!
</P>
<P>
   And that was a small New England town. Imagine what a president
can do to New York. Catastrophe is too mild a word. With Clinton
this week it was King Kong without Fay Wray, the San Francisco
earthquake without Jeanette MacDonald, Iwo Jima without John Wayne.
</P>
<P>
   All right, that's hyperbole, and I don't want to sound cross
with the president. He's got enough people cross at him already.
</P>
<P>
   Not many in New York, though. New Yorkers must have a deep
working knowledge of sin, because those I talked to spoke kindly of
the president and agreed with the New Testament about the moral
qualification required for throwers of the first stone.
</P>
<P>
   This probably shows I was meeting only the most despicable class
of New Yorkers; to wit, liberals. Worse, New York liberals.
</P>
<P>
   It wouldn't be surprising. I was a New York liberal myself until
all the big lecture fees started going to Washington conservatives.
Where was I _ ?
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations, that's where. Some big fuss was on over
there, which brought several dozen alien statesmen to town, and
they had to have V.I.P. treatment, just like Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Gigantic cars, sirens, flashing lights, sinister-looking
escorts.
</P>
<P>
   What a mess! Streets that carry a million cars per hour were
closed to traffic. Those millions were detoured into streets that
already had millions of cars parked in congealed masses.
</P>
<P>
   It being the Age of Terrorism, cops in battalion strength were
bivouacked in midtown. Have you noticed that the more security we
Americans have, the less secure we are?
</P>
<P>
   It was exhilarating to walk rapidly through midtown admiring the
security. The reason I walked was that nothing motorized was able
to move for days.
</P>
<P>
   The reason I walked rapidly was that New Yorkers who don't walk
rapidly can be run down and badly dented by other walkers, all of
whom walk at a speed of 22 miles per hour.
</P>
<P>
   This pace shows they are very busy, or on vital missions
carrying secret papers, or in training for the Olympic
urban-walking competition, or something.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe they walk so fast because it makes them feel they're going
someplace important to do something important, whereas slowing down
might give them time to wonder about the pointlessness of things,
especially being treated like sheep so big shots can party under
heavy security.
</P>
<P>
   It's generally supposed that periods of intolerable commotion
like this week's leave New Yorkers exhilarated. You sometimes hear
them say they wouldn't live anyplace else, be it Xanadu or the
Seven Cities of Cibola.
</P>
<P>
   I used to feel that way myself sometimes during my dozen years
of residence. It's seductive. I used to walk 22 miles per hour and
never think about the pointlessness of things and, if confronted by
hicks, boasted about the exhilaration of it all.
</P>
<P>
   Then I found I could no longer walk faster than 21 miles an
hour, and real estate prices went cosmic, and I couldn't cut the
New York mustard anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Still, give me four days now and then, and it's swell.

BIN LADEN GROUP TRIED TO DEVELOP NUCLEAR WEAPONS, U.S. SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (See related: KENYA-BOMBING)  
 (bl)  
 By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Federal authorities charged Friday that a person
described as a senior deputy to Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile
suspected in last month's bombings of two U.S. embassies in Africa,
made significant efforts on behalf of the bin Laden group in 1993
to develop nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities said that in at least one case there was
evidence of documents relating to a proposed purchase of enriched
uranium but they did not say whether the group ever obtained
uranium.
</P>
<P>
   The allegations, concerning Mamdouh Mahmud Salim, also assert
that bin Laden had an official agreement with the Iranian
government and with Sudan's ruling party to oppose the United
States, and suggested that the United States had penetrated the bin
Laden organization and learned detailed information in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The allegations were contained in newly unsealed court papers
that charged that Salim with conspiracy to murder and to use
weapons of mass destruction against Americans stationed outside the
United States, including in Saudi Arabia, Yemen and Somalia.
</P>
<P>
   Salim was arrested in Germany last week after flying there from
Sudan and the U.S. government said Friday that it would be seeking
his extradition to face charges in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The government also asserted for the first time in court papers
that the Iranian government had entered into a formal three-way
``working agreement'' with bin Laden and the National Islamic Front
of the Sudan to ``work together against the United States, Israel
and the West.'' The front is the ruling party in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   Members of bin Laden's organization, al Qaeda, sent emissaries
to Iran and some of its members received explosives training in
Lebanon from Hezbollah, the terrorist group backed by the Iranian
government, prosecutors said in court papers filed in U.S. District
Court in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The government also said that during the time when the working
agreement was being negotiated, Salim met with an Iranian religious
official stationed in Khartoum and also traveled with al Qaeda
members to Tehran to arrange for training by Iran in the use of
explosives.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The allegations against Iran come at a sensitive time, since
Tehran is currently trying to improve its relations with the West
and is also at odds with the Taliban, the dominant group in
Afghanistan, which is protecting bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   The eight-page complaint was signed by FBI Agent Daniel Coleman
and was approved by two federal prosecutors, Patrick Fitzgerald and
Kenneth Karas, and an arrest warrant for Salim by a federal
magistrate in Manhattan, James Francis. It was issued by the judge
Sept.14 under seal and made public Friday. The complaint may be
followed by an indictment which must be approved be a grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   In unsealing the charges against Salim, who was arrested near
Munich on Sept. 15 and is being held in Germany pending his
extradition, U.S. authorities showed that their investigation of
bin Laden and al Qaeda continues to follow dual tracks.
</P>
<P>
   One is focused more narrowly on trying to solve the nearly
simultaneous bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania
on Aug. 7, in which more than 250 people were killed and hundreds
of others were injured. Bin Laden's operatives in those countries
are suspected in the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The other track is directed at bin Laden's larger organization
itself, and its role in other acts of terrorism, such as the
attacks on United States and United Nations forces in Somalia in
1993 and early 1994, prosecutors have said.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities also acknowledged for the first time Friday that
the FBI had won the secret cooperation of an admitted terrorist in
al Qaeda as early as 1996, and obtained extensive information about
the group from the asset, who was not identified.
</P>
<P>
   The source was described in court papers as someone who ``was a
member of al Qaeda for a number of years'' and was ``personally
familiar'' with bin Laden and Salim. The document said that the
source ``has admitted to participating in terrorist activity
against American interests.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that description, there was no further information last
night about whether the government had actually penetrated the
group and won the cooperation of an active member, or whether the
source had left al Qaeda and decided to cooperate, and under what
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   The document does say that the information from the source was
provided to the FBI in the late summer and fall of 1996, raising
questions about how much the government knew about the bin Laden
group in the months leading up to the bombings.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the FBI in New York, Joseph Valiquette, said
that he could not comment beyond what was in the public complaint.
</P>
<P>
   The government complaint does reveal more extensively than ever
before how much the authorities have learned about al Qaeda's
history and command structure. The document says that bin Laden's
group is highly organized, and includes a ``majlis al shura'' or
consultation council, which discusses and approves all major
undertakings, including terrorist operations.)
</P>
<P>
   The charges also said that al Qaeda had members who ``made
bayat'' or swore their allegiance to the emir, or prince, of the
organization, who is identified as bin Laden.

BASEBALL COLUMN: THE FINAL WEEKEND TAKES FLIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Bobby Cox has it all figured out. He knows how to
handle the last weekend of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``You play the game, you get in the plane, you land somewhere,''
Cox said Friday night before his Braves played the New York Mets on
the final Friday of the regular season, with the Mets tied with the
Cubs for the National League wild card.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy for Cox to talk about going wherever the team charter
goes. He has, after all, managed 79 postseason games during his
career with Toronto and Atlanta. Some managers are dispatched
before they get to 79 games in one year.
</P>
<P>
   The logistics and the mind-set of the last weekend can be
complicated. The Braves have got this drill down pat, because they
have the best record in baseball since the start of 1991, winning
one World Series and losing three.
</P>
<P>
   They needed to win one more game this weekend to ensure
themselves the best record in the National League and consequently
the extra home game in the league championship series, if they get
there.
</P>
<P>
   Also, they would not mind eliminating the Mets because that
would mean they would very likely open against the Cubs rather than
face Kevin Brown and the Padres. Cox also had the consolation of
knowing that the Braves are opening at home in the first round _ no
charters till midweek.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets have no such assurances. They came here with their
families, not knowing if they would fly happily to Houston on
Sunday night or fly home to New York for a one-game playoff with
the Cubs or perhaps the Giants, or to clean out their lockers for
the winter.
</P>
<P>
   There is a fourth possibility: The rain from Hurricane Georges
could spread northward, threatening the games scheduled for
Saturday and Sunday. Fortunately, the Mets were told to pack for a
trip continuing to Houston, so theoretically they have enough
clothes in their suitcases. But there is that eerie sense of not
knowing what they will be feeling or doing 48 hours from Friday
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a feeling of anticipation, not anxiety,'' said Bobby
Valentine, the Mets' manager.
</P>
<P>
   In that occasional sport of football, players are goaded to
``get up for the big game,'' because it comes around only once a
week. Baseball players cannot afford to seek an emotional high in
every game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, your stomach churns,'' Cox said. ``But it's no different
from early in the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Cox did happen to remember the churning in 1985, when he was
managing the Blue Jays, and Butch Wynegar of the Yankees hit a
homer to delay the clinching until Saturday. But Cox, now 57, was
younger then. Is there a temptation to overmanage in the final
weekend of the season, to make that one brilliant move that will
catapult a team into the playoffs?
</P>
<P>
   ``If you had all the answers now, why didn't you do it all
season?'' Cox said. ``It's the other way around, almost. You might
tend to be more conservative, not try to do anything unusual.''
</P>
<P>
   Cox certainly has more experience than Valentine in postseason
games _ 79-0, if you're counting _ but John Schuerholz, the general
manager with the best record in baseball since coming to Atlanta
from Kansas City for the 1991 season, has consistently retooled the
Braves.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets were not total neophytes in big games. John Olerud and
Carlos Baerga, both starting for the Mets on Friday night, have
played in the World Series. So has Al Leiter, Saturday's scheduled
starter, who last year started the seventh game for the world
championship Florida Marlins. (Sounds kind of weird, doesn't it?
Almost as if that never happened.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, there's bound to be some question,'' Leiter said about
the confidence level of a team that collectively has not played in
a momentous series. ``But from what I see, the guys are relaxed.
There's always a first time. This three-game series will mean the
season.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the Mets have said they did not particularly mind being
on the road for the final weekend of the season. They have heard
the impatient New York fans when the team did not perform well.
``It's kind of sad,'' Valentine said. ``That's not how I would
script it.''
</P>
<P>
   He would script a tie with three games left in the season. He
would even take his chances in a one-game playoff on Monday at
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see the finality of the season,'' Valentine said.
``You can touch it. This is why we hold winter meetings. This is
why we took spring training, to get to know each other. We played
159 games. These are your players. We had a pretty loose plane ride
down. Now I can't wait to play the games.''
</P>
<P>
   There would be another plane ride soon. As of Friday night, the
destination, and the mood, were still to be determined.

 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Earlier this year, it seemed that stock prices would never stop
going up. Now, it seems that mortgage rates will never stop going
down.
</P>
<P>
   Many homeowners are scrambling to refinance their mortgages,
some for a second, third or even fourth time in a decade, as
interest rates have skidded to a 31-year low of 6.64 percent for a
conventional 30-year loan. That is barely one-third the 1981 peak
of 18.63 percent. Indeed, more than half of all mortgage
applications these days are for refinancing.
</P>
<P>
   But should you join the crowd? If so, should you go for the loan
du jour, a 15-year mortgage, instead of the traditional 30?
</P>
<P>
   The experts' answers to these questions may surprise some
people. These are turbulent times, and some long-held assumptions
may no longer apply. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TRUISM NO. 1 The higher costs of a 15-year loan ultimately lead
to savings. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you want to lower your mortgage rate, you are probably
enticed by 15-year mortgages, with an average rate (6.32 percent)
about one-third of a percentage point below those of 30-year loans.
But many advisers say you should resist the temptation.
</P>
<P>
   The advantages are undeniable: You wind up paying fewer dollars
for your house, and you arrive far earlier at the the peace of mind
that full ownership brings.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the monthly payments are lower on 30-year
mortgages, freeing up money that can be invested elsewhere _
perhaps the stock market. Despite the market's summer swoon, there
is a strong case to be made _ as shown in the accompanying chart _
that money invested in stocks is going to grow faster than equity
sunk into a home on an accelerated payment schedule.
</P>
<P>
   According to Thomas P. Ochsenschlager of Grant Thornton, it
might be wiser to sign a 30-year mortgage and pump the money you
would otherwise spend on higher monthly payments into a mutual
fund.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming average annual returns of 10 percent on the fund, you
would end up with almost $528,000 after 30 years, compared with
$406,000 if you had taken a 15-year-mortgage, waited until you paid
it off and then poured the equivalent of your larger monthly
payments into a similar mutual fund.
</P>
<P>
   But Ochsenschlager said the gap would shrink to $38,000 if the
average return fell to 8 percent and would vanish if it dropped
much below that.
</P>
<P>
   And a 30-year loan may be best even if you're getting gray in
the temples. So what if the loan outlasts you? Lenders don't care
how old you are as long as you can make the payments; the house is
collateral. Besides, in the real world, most people move before
they are anywhere near mortgage freedom. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TRUISM 2 Don't refinance unless you can slice two percentage
points off your rate. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For many years, that was the general advice; in addition, you
needed to plan on staying put for at least three years in order to
justify the costs. But now, with intensified competition and the
emergence of so-called no-point, no-cost loans, specialists say
refinancing makes sense even if the new rate is only a half-point
lower than the old.
</P>
<P>
   ``That old rule has just totally been thrown out,'' said David
Seiders, economist for the National Association of Home Builders.
Basically, you calculate the reduction in your monthly payment
under the new loan and decide whether you'll keep the house long
enough for the savings to offset the transaction costs.
</P>
<P>
   Those costs can mount, in less-than-obvious ways. If you don't
maintain at least 20 percent ownership when you refinance, for
example, you may end up having to pay for mortgage insurance for
the lender.
</P>
<P>
   And some fees _ for services like an appraisal, credit check,
settlement, deed recording, title insurance, copying and even for
considering the application _ might have to be paid out of pocket,
at costs typically between $1,500 and $3,000. Most can be added to
the loan, but you don't want to wind up with more debt than you can
afford.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest single expense is often ``points'' _ a percentage of
the loan that is due upon signing. (If a bank charges three points
on a $100,000 loan, for example, you have to write a check for
$3,000.)
</P>
<P>
   Points are deductible immediately when you buy a house, but must
be prorated over the life of the loan when you are refinancing. If
you refinance a second time, the unamortized points from the first
refinancing then become deductible right away. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TRUISM 3 Always take money at the cheapest rate. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   These days, mortgage specialists frown on adjustable-rate
mortgages, or ARMs, which bob up and down every year, or every few
years, in tandem with an underlying interest rate like one-year
Treasury bills.
</P>
<P>
   ARMs today are priced at 5.43 percent, roughly a point below
fixed-rate loans. But with fixed-rate mortgages themselves so low
and inflation creeping up, logic suggests that future adjustments
will be up rather than down. Indeed, few homeowners are choosing
ARMs these days.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if you don't expect to stay in your home for more than a
few years, you might want to consider a version called the 7-23,
which is especially popular in California. In this ARM you get a
special low rate for the first seven years. By the time it adjusts
upward, the odds are that you will be gone. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TRUISM 4 Don't try to time the mortgage market. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Actually, this principle stands the test of time. If you want to
refinance, the experts say, you probably shouldn't dally in hopes
that rates might fall a tad more.
</P>
<P>
   Already, they contend, the flight of capital to the United
States as a result of financial turmoil overseas has driven
interest rates on Treasury securities, the chief benchmark in this
country, artificially low.
</P>
<P>
   And keep in mind that a lot of other people are holding out for
the bottom, just as you are, which means that the slightest uptick
will set off a stampede that could not only drive interest rates
even higher but might also overwhelm lenders' processing
capabilities.

CLINTON-JONES NEGOTIATIONS CONTINUE; SETTLEMENT COULD BE NEAR 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Seeking to give President Clinton a stronger
position as Congress considers impeaching him, his lawyers are
involved in intense negotiations with representatives of Paula
Jones and may reach an agreement in the next few days to settle her
sexual misconduct lawsuit against him, advisers to both parties
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of the negotiations is the question of how much
Clinton must pay Mrs. Jones to achieve a settlement in the suit
that has led to the impeachment crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Jones' lawyers Friday rejected a $500,000 offer Clinton
made this week, and they gave the White House until Tuesday morning
to sweeten the pot, the advisers said. Earlier this month, the
White House rejected a request from the Jones camp to pay $1
million to have her withdraw the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   A senior White House adviser said that the suddenly vigorous
effort to end the lawsuit was being propelled by a political
calculation that doing so would help Clinton present the best case
to Congress to battle any impeachment proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we go before Congress on the impeachment matter, the Paula
Jones suit is now still on the table,'' said one Clinton adviser,
who like the others would speak only on condition of not being
named. ``Anything we take off the table may be enormously
helpful.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, associates of the president say that one of
the staunchest opponents of any kind of concession to Mrs. Jones,
Hillary Rodham Clinton, has now acceded to the idea of a
settlement.
</P>
<P>
   A settlement, which had appeared elusive for years, is now
possible because of the profoundly changed political _ and some
would say moral _ standing of Clinton since he publicly
acknowledged a sexual liaison with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Jones' lawyers say that is a major reason why she has
dropped her demand that any settlement include some sort of apology
from the president or some explicit acknowledgment that her claim
about Clinton's behavior was true. Her previous insistence on an
apology had always proved an insurmountable obstacle.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Jones' advisers say she no longer feels a need to prove
that Clinton behaved in a sexually irresponsible manner, given the
avalanche of detailed material about his relationship with Ms.
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``The events of the last several weeks and months have
vindicated Paula Jones' case,'' said John W. Whitehead, the
president of the Rutherford Institute, which is financing Mrs.
Jones' legal efforts. He said that any settlement with the
president would constitute an admission of Mrs. Jones' allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Jones contends that in 1991, when Clinton was governor of
Arkansas, he invited her to his hotel suite in Little Rock and,
when alone with her, made a crude sexual advance. Clinton has
always denied the allegation.
</P>
<P>
   Whitehead said that he was hopeful a settlement would be
reached, but he cautioned that the talks could still fall apart.
</P>
<P>
   Senior White House officials expressed a similar mix of hope and
caution. The advisers said that Mrs. Clinton had only recently been
persuaded to allow negotiations aimed at settling the lawsuit after
firmly resisting such a course since the beginning, because that
could be taken as evidence of his sexual misbehavior. One aide said
that Mrs. Clinton has been anxious over mounting legal bills and
had to be assured that the money for a settlement could come out of
the legal defense fund that has been created for the Clintons.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, one adviser to the Clintons said, there is a
feeling that a settlement would not affect the president's standing
with the public, which has already taken that part of his character
into account in digesting the report by the Whitewater independent
counsel, Kenneth Starr, about Clinton's liaison with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty obvious why we would like to settle now,'' one
senior adviser to the White House said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the case against the president now being considered in
Congress stems from the lawsuit Mrs. Jones filed in 1994. During a
deposition taken under oath last January, Clinton told Mrs. Jones'
lawyers that he had not engaged in ``sexual relations'' with Ms.
Lewinsky or had an affair with her.
</P>
<P>
   Starr, in his referral to Congress about possible impeachable
offenses, said Clinton had knowingly lied when he gave those
answers, and therefore that he committed perjury.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and his lawyers have argued that while his answers may
have been misleading, they were ``legally accurate'' because of the
definition of sexual relations that was approved by the judge that
day.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement activity comes at a time when the White House is
seeking to fashion some sort of negotiated settlement with Congress
that would allow Clinton to keep his job.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a three-judge panel of a federal appeals court is
scheduled to hear arguments on Oct. 20 in St. Paul, Minn., on
whether to reinstate the lawsuit, which was dismissed last April by
a trial judge in Little Rock. If Mrs. Jones' lawyers succeed in
persuading the appeals court to reinstate the lawsuit, it could
mean a new round of discovery in which the president would be
subject to more embarrassing questions about his personal behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Jones' lawyers have already said they intend to use the
contents of the Starr report as part of their case before the
appeals court. White House lawyers and advisers have said they
believe there is a strong likelihood the appeals court panel,
composed of Republican-appointed judges, would rule in favor of
Mrs. Jones.
</P>
<P>
   The president's lawyers have said that one reason he has
resisted acknowledging that he misled Mrs. Jones' lawyers is that
such an acknowledgment could be used against him in a revived Jones
lawsuit. Removing the suit might also make it easier for Clinton to
acknowledge unreservedly that his answers in the Jones deposition
were untrue, as many members of Congress have been demanding as
part of some kind of plea bargain.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Such an admission would not eliminate in a legal sense his
culpability for his misleading and possibly perjurious answers in
the Jones deposition. But his advisers say it could allow the
president to argue that Congress would be proceeding on impeachment
on the basis of a civil lawsuit that was not settled.
</P>
<P>
   While that argument may not have any legal merit, White House
officials hope that it would help with members of Congress who are
wavering on whether to seek Clinton's removal from office.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear how that would actually affect deliberations.
Several members of Congress canvassed Friday said they were unsure
that a settlement of the Jones lawsuit would make any difference,
but they also said it was too early to tell.
</P>
<P>
   The judge in the case, Susan Webber Wright, has also raised the
possibility that she would hold Clinton in contempt for offering
misleading testimony in January. A settlement of the suit would not
eliminate that possibility, but White House advisers said they
hoped it would make it harder for Ms. Wright to take such a step.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Jones' lawyers have suggested that if they do not achieve a
settlement by Tuesday, they will file a petition with the judge to
bolster her resolve to hold a contempt hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Friends of Mrs. Jones said she is eager to reach a settlement
and be done with the matter. If the appeals court does not
reinstate the case, she would get nothing after four years of
high-profile litigation.
</P>
<P>
   But there are various claims on any money Mrs. Jones receives in
a settlement, and her friends said she is anxious that not all of
it go to lawyers and expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Her first team of lawyers, who resigned from the case after she
rebuffed a tentative offer that did not include what she deemed a
sufficient apology, have a court order entitling them to at least
$700,000 to cover their legal expenses. The Rutherford Institute
has paid about $400,000 in legal expenses, and Mrs. Jones' new team
of lawyers has also incurred significant costs. Mrs. Jones'
husband, Stephen, was reported to have lost his job with Northwest
Airlines a few months ago, and the family may be in difficult
financial circumstances.

TAKING OVER AND ALREADY IN THE KNOW  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 27) 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Questions should be boldfaced)

   Plucked from relative obscurity, James E. Goodwin became
president and chief operating officer last week of the UAL Corp.,
parent of United Airlines, the country's largest airline and
largest employee-owned company. He succeeded John A. Edwardson, who
resigned after United's two biggest unions made it clear they would
block his becoming chief executive when Gerald Greenwald retires
next year. United's board has hired a search firm to find a
successor for Greenwald.
</P>
<P>
   Goodwin, 54, is the ultimate insider. He has spent 32 years at
United, managing virtually every phase of operations, from airplane
maintenance to in-flight food. In his first interview since
becoming president, he spoke from Buenos Aires, where the board met
last week. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. You've attended your first board meeting as president. What
are your marching orders? Did the board make clear that you are a
candidate to succeed Gerald Greenwald? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. We didn't have any conversations about the succession. But we
did spend some time talking about where we want to take the
company. I have a very tough job ahead of me to step into this job,
and that is where my focus is going to be. The board and Jerry have
the responsibility of looking at the CEO succession; I am going to
focus on running the day-to-day business. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Given Edwardson's experience, do you need to mend fences with
the unions? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. John was relatively new to United Airlines. I, on the other
hand, have spent really my entire professional life here. I've
witnessed periods where we had internal conflict that came close to
tearing this company apart. I know our people, and I believe they
know me as someone they can talk to about issues that are pertinent
to their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   I am also not naive enough to believe that we have seen an end
to internal disagreement. But I believe that our employees would
like to see us move forward. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Many investors are chary of employee ownership, especially in
the airline industry, because they think it means management can't
be tough with labor. Are they right? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Our investors to some degree don't totally understand the
ESOP structure. That has complicated their view of all the
successes that this company has had over the last four years. We've
improved our balance sheet. We've reduced our debt. We are getting
close to investment-grade rating, and we reallocated resources
during this period of economic crisis in Asia and moved those
capital resources to other parts of our system to generate profits.
All of that has created disruptions to our employee base, and I
think we have demonstrated that we can make the tough decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Our employees also recognize that there are times when we have
to make these tough decisions, just like they did in 1994 when they
agreed to insure the economic health of our company by doing the
ESOP. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. The employee stock ownership plan expires in 2000. Should it
be renewed? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't know that I can say for certain that it should be
renewed. It clearly has brought value, in terms of tying all our
employees economically to the health of our company. In order for
us to go through the first ESOP, our employees made some
significant financial sacrifices. As a result, they have gained
significant rewards, because our stock price has certainly
reflected the improvement in our earnings.
</P>
<P>
   When you look at the future, I'm not sure whether our employees
would want to step up to another economic investment. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Much of the public resents airlines because of high ticket
prices and poor service. What can be done to change that image? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't know that I agree that all of the consumers believe
this industry is bad. If you look back over the last 20 years since
deregulation, I think it is very safe to say that consumers have
more choices and are paying less over all. At the same time I
recognize that our airports and our planes are more crowded than
they have ever been, but that is true of our highways and a lot of
our other transportation systems.
</P>
<P>
   One of the things that we as an industry have not done a good
job of is communicating to the consumer what benefits they have
derived from this new era of air transportation. It is probably
something as an industry that we have to do more.

GIULIANI VETOES BILL TO REVAMP CITY'S CAMPAIGN FINANCE SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By CLIFFORD J. LEVY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani vetoed a bill Friday that
seeks to curb the influence of money in municipal elections, but
the move was largely symbolic because the leadership of the City
Council has pledged a speedy override.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would revamp New York City's campaign finance system
for the first time since it was set up in the late 1980s, reducing
limits on contributions and increasing the size of subsidies that
the city would give candidates for their campaigns. With these
provisions in place, candidates could spend less time raising
money, and wealthy interests would have less influence over the
process, the bill's backers say.
</P>
<P>
   In his veto message to the City Council, Giuliani declared that
the bill was flawed when compared with the campaign finance measure
proposed by his Charter Revision Commission. ``The City Council has
missed a real opportunity for significant reform,'' the mayor
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Council Speaker Peter Vallone and Public Advocate Mark Green,
who have both championed the bill, lashed out at Giuliani, saying
that his Charter Commission was a sham. The speaker's aides said
the council, which passed the bill last month, 42-5, would easily
override the veto within the next few weeks. The
Democrat-controlled council needs 34 votes to override.
</P>
<P>
   Advocacy groups that support overhauling the campaign finance
regulations quickly lined up against the mayor. They lauded the
Council bill and said the commission's proposed referendum would
have little impact.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor set up the Charter Commission to forestall an effort
by Vallone to put a referendum on the ballot in November that would
bar the city from spending money for a stadium for the Yankees in
Manhattan. After considering a range of sweeping proposals for a
referendum, the commission settled on a less ambitious one that
would prohibit candidates from accepting campaign contributions
from corporations.
</P>
<P>
   The council's bill _ which would change city law, not the
Charter _ would encourage candidates in the city's voluntary
campaign finance system to refuse corporate contributions by giving
them more city aid if they did, but would not ban the contributions
outright. In his veto message, Giuliani said that while the bill
had some worthy ideas, over all it was defective because the
corporate contribution provision did not go far enough.
</P>
<P>
   If the Charter proposal is approved by voters in November, it is
unclear what would happen to the new rules approved by the council.
The discrepancies would probably have to be decided in court.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   While the mayor has said banning corporate contributions would
be an important change, many campaign finance experts disagree.
They point out that executives of corporations could still donate
as individuals, and note that many large donations in city
elections come from political action committees, as well as from
law and real estate firms and other partnerships, which would not
be barred from giving.
</P>
<P>
   Vallone, the Democratic gubernatorial candidate, has sought to
use the legislation to contrast the city's campaign finance laws
with the more lax state laws.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, he linked the veto to his opponent, Gov. George
Pataki, and to Sen. Alfonse D'Amato. ``Mayor Giuliani's veto of a
needed improvement to the nation's model campaign finance law is a
disgrace,'' Vallone said. ``But it is consistent with his new-found
allegiance to the D'Amato-Pataki money machine.''
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Mayor Joseph Lhota called Vallone's comments
``disgusting,'' saying that he was being reckless because his
campaign was struggling.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's aides said he did sign two other bills that were
approved by the council. One would require that the committees that
candidates set up for inaugurations and transitions abide by the
same limits and disclosure rules as campaigns. The other would
prohibit city officials from appearing in advertisements sponsored
by the city in election years.
</P>
<P>
   Those two bills themselves are considered far-reaching, but they
were overshadowed by the debate over the veto of the campaign
finance bill. Lhota said the mayor was ``trying to move campaign
finance law to a higher level.''
</P>
<P>
   Two advocacy groups, Common Cause New York and the New York
Public Interest Research Group, called the mayor a hypocrite. ``A
decade ago, Mayor Giuliani was one of the city's leading political
reformers,'' the public interest group said in a statement.
``Today, he forfeits that title.''

CHARGES OF RESEARCH FRAUD ARE RAISED AGAINST THE HEAD OF A CORNELL
AIDS LAB 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Adds 2nd take of 1200 words chronicling the events leading to the
charges against Dr. Ho.)   (EXCLUSIVE; 10:45 p.m. ET EMBARGO for print media; 12:01 a.m. ET

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Cornell University officials are investigating
allegations of scientific misconduct against the head of one of the
university's largest immunology and AIDS-related research labs in
New York City and a recipient of more than $2 million in federal
money, Cornell officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The researcher, Dr. John L. Ho, has been accused by members of
his lab of ordering subordinates to falsify data in one research
grant application; of knowingly using false claims to obtain
another federal grant for $1.5 million; of publishing a paper based
on falsified experiments; and of threatening or punishing members
of the lab who discovered damaging evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the allegations were pieced together from interviews
with seven current and former lab employees, three of whom would
speak only on the condition of anonymity and provided most of the
information, including supporting documents.
</P>
<P>
   Ho, 48, an associate professor of medicine and microbiology at
the Joan and Sanford Weill Medical College and Graduate School of
Medical Sciences of Cornell University, declined to respond to any
charges, saying, ``My guilt or innocence has to be evaluated in the
context of the whole current investigation.'' Asked if he was
guilty of scientific misconduct, he replied: ``I don't believe I
have intentionally conducted scientific misconduct.''
</P>
<P>
   Ho is not related to the better-known AIDS researcher Dr. David
Ho, who directs the Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, also
located in New York. Though Ho has not achieved renown as an AIDS
researcher, he is viewed by peers as an up-and-coming immunologist.
He sits on research peer review committees of the American Heart
Association and the National Institutes of Health, and his
collaboration in a 10-year, $5-million federal grant to study AIDS
in Haiti gives him a role in the search for an HIV vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   The research projects tied to the misconduct inquiry involve
test-tube experiments to determine how the immune system is
affected by various microbes, including those of HIV, tuberculosis
and parasitic diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Hajjar, the dean of the graduate school, said the
university's inquiry began in mid-August, when allegations made by
one member of Ho's lab reached top officials. Dr. Dominic Falcone,
an associate professor of pathology appointed by the dean to
conduct a 60-day inquiry, said in an interview that so far, some,
but not all, of the allegations have been supported by other
people.
</P>
<P>
   Questions about the integrity of Ho's research surfaced during
the last 19 months, lab members said. Also at issue in the inquiry,
officials said, is the disappearance of about 60 vials of human DNA
fragments known as plasmids, most of them encoded with HIV proteins
for experimentation. The plasmids vanished from a freezer in late
December, heightening what several researchers described as an
atmosphere of fear and distrust in Ho's lab, which occupies five
rooms on the fourth floor of the New York Hospital medical complex
in Manhattan. University officials said the plasmids had not been
found, but stressed that they were not dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cornell is not interested in anything but getting to the
bottom of it,'' Hajjar said.
</P>
<P>
   After Falcone reports on his inquiry, Hajjar, following
university policy, will decide if the allegations are
``sufficiently substantive'' to open a formal investigation by a
three-member committee, which would require notifying the National
Institutes of Health.

</P>
<P>
   There is growing concern in the scientific community that the
incentives to commit fraud have intensified as competition has
increased among researchers to win grant money and publish
findings. But since research inevitably involves mistakes, proving
intent to mislead has become the key to a formal finding of
scientific misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   Allegations as serious as those in the Cornell case are rare,
said Chris Pascal, the acting director of the Federal Office of
Research Integrity, which has the power to prevent researchers from
receiving federal money if they are found to have committed fraud.
He said the office, which is part of the Department of Health and
Human Services, is notified each year of 35 to 40 investigations by
the 3,000 institutions that receive federal research grants, some
involving single instances of plagiarism. It makes about 15
findings of misconduct annually, Pascal said.
</P>
<P>
   Ho's success in winning money from the National Institutes of
Health began in the mid-1990s, about half a dozen years after he
joined the Cornell faculty from Tufts University-New England
Medical Center in Boston. Born in Canton, he is a graduate of the
State University of New York at Stony Brook and was trained as a
doctor at New York University Medical Center and
Columbia-Presbyterian Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble in Ho's lab surfaced in February 1997, after David
Kaufman, a young medical and PhD student, conducted a promising
experiment with blood samples from four people. According to a
detailed account provided by one lab researcher and confirmed by
another, Ho told Kaufman to create a graph in support of a grant
application that would present the results of the four samples as
averages from the blood of 40 people. In what more experienced
members of the lab described as an act of courage unusual in their
hierarchical world, Kaufman refused, telling Ho that such a graph
would be fraudulent.
</P>
<P>
   Later, the researchers said, Ho ordered Miguel Camargo, a lab
technician, to create the same graph. When Kaufman saw the graph on
Camargo's computer he tried but failed to persuade the technician
to defy Ho, the researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   According to a lab member familiar with the incident, Ho assured
Camargo that such things were done in grant applications all the
time, and threatened retaliation if he made trouble.
</P>
<P>
   When told about the incident, Pascal said, ``We're not aware
that it's happening all the time, it shouldn't be happening all the
time, and we don't get allegations like that and dismiss them.''
</P>
<P>
   Camargo declined to comment. Kaufman, who left Ho's lab late
last year, refused to answer specific questions, saying: ``I'm a
graduate student at Cornell. It wouldn't be good to discuss this
with you.'' But he added: ``I absolutely don't condone any sort of
scientific misconduct like that. I personally don't like to be
involved in the politics of these situations.''
</P>
<P>
   A second round of questions about Ho's work surfaced in the lab
in spring 1997, when Ricardo Caminha, a physician from Brazil
working on his PhD thesis, tried and failed to reproduce results
that Ho had described in a paper being prepared for publication.
The paper, which Ho and others submitted for publication anyway,
aimed to show the mechanism by which the human immune system
overcomes tuberculosis, pointing to novel treatment strategies.
</P>
<P>
   But when Caminha checked old lab data books, two of his former
colleagues said, he discovered that streptomycin, an antibiotic
used against TB, had been added to the culture medium in the
experiments. They said after Caminha confronted Ho, he was cut from
the project.
</P>
<P>
   When this account was related yesterday to Caminha, who was in
Rio de Janeiro, he said: ``I can't talk to you. I can't confirm or
deny anything about this investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Sadhana Chitale, a postdoctoral fellow who was a co-author of
the paper, said she had worked on a different aspect of the
research and could not comment on the streptomycin. She went on to
say, ``I was told there was an oversight, that it was added by
mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   She said, ``I tried to keep myself distant'' from the conflicts
in the lab.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a job to keep,'' she said. ``I do whatever is assigned
to me.''
</P>
<P>
   By fall 1997, a third controversy had erupted in the lab, this
one over the $1.5 million federal research grant that Ho had won in
1996 to study an unusual molecule known as LPG, which other
scientists have shown is used by the parasitic disease
leishmaniasis to thwart the body's defenses.
</P>
<P>
   In his grant application, Ho said that in test-tube experiments
he had found an interesting property of LPG: it reduced the level
of HIV, while not inhibiting the proliferation of healthy cells. At
least two researchers in the lab, Magda Carvalho and Ana Teresa
Nogueira Dumans, built LPG experiments based on that crucial claim.
</P>
<P>
   But lab members said that when Ms. Dumans gathered the lab's
past studies on LPG, she discovered test results in February 1995
demonstrating that contrary to Ho's 1996 grant application, LPG did
inhibit cell proliferation.
</P>
<P>
   Ho's longtime lab technician, Howard Doo, confirmed in a
telephone interview that he had performed LPG tests in 1994 and
1995 that showed the molecule blocked cell growth, and had turned
over all his results to Ho. Two other researchers said that when
Ms. Dumans confronted Ho about this, he denied seeing his
technician's data before writing the grant.
</P>
<P>
   Doo, who worked in the lab for six years and left this spring,
said he could not remember the events well and was unaware of any
misconduct. He added, ``I'm a friend of Dr. Ho.'' Ms. Dumans did
not return calls, and Carvalho declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   The disappearance of the plasmids in December 1997 distressed
the lab members again, researchers said. Sabotage and theft were
possible explanations discussed in the aftermath, Doo said. Ms.
Chitale called the disappearance scary.
</P>
<P>
   Ho took the unusual step of placing a lock on the lab freezer,
retained the key himself and doled out material for experiments bit
by bit.
</P>
<P>
   According to an account confirmed by three researchers, one day
in May Ms. Dumans and Caminha were left without access to the
supplies in the freezer they needed to keep lab experiments from
ruin. After trying to reach Ho at home, they opened the freezer by
unscrewing the hinges. Both were reprimanded by Ho over the
incident, two researchers said, and left soon afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Ho then tried to defuse criticism at a session for his lab's
researchers. Two people who attended said Ho tried to demonstrate
his motivation as a researcher by showing slides of dying children
in a Cambodian refugee camp in Thailand where he had worked as
medical coordinator early in his career.
</P>
<P>
   But the session did not quell complaints. In late June, as the
allegations filtered out, Dr. Warren Johnson, chief of the Division
of International Medicine and Infectious Diseases and Ho's
supervisor, was asked to look into the controversy, said Paul
Macielak, a Cornell spokesman. Johnson, who is principal
investigator in the same 10-year AIDS study on which Ho is working,
declined to comment. But others said that after a brief review,
Johnson told the lab members there was no problem.
</P>
<P>
   Six weeks later, after a researcher pressed the issue with
university officials, the present inquiry began.

EDITORIAL: NUCLEAR GAIN IN SOUTH ASIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Sept. 26:
</P>
<P>
   Four months after shocking the world with their nuclear tests,
India and Pakistan have declared their intention to sign a
comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty. The announcement could
reduce tensions in one of the most volatile parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
   But before the United States can lift economic sanctions imposed
in response to the nuclear blasts last May, it should press India
and Pakistan to reach additional curbs on the production of
weapons-grade nuclear material and the development and deployment
of missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement was delivered in separate speeches Wednesday
and Thursday at the United Nations by Prime Ministers Nawaz Sharif
of Pakistan and A.B. Vajpayee of India. It was a major turnabout
for India in particular, since Pakistan has long said it would sign
the treaty if India would. India had denounced the treaty as
unacceptable as long as the United States and other countries
refused to eliminate their own nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Since both Vajpayee and Sharif sit atop shaky governing
coalitions, it took political courage for them to make their
pledges. Vajpayee, as head of a Hindu nationalist coalition
government, is under pressure from his own camp to press India's
claim to be seen an equal with China and other nuclear powers.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration also deserves praise for getting two
countries that have fought three wars in the last 50 years to
achieve a measure of progress. One key to the agreement was that
India is not being challenged by the United States in its demand
that the problem of Kashmir, India's only Muslim-dominated state,
be settled in negotiations with Pakistan without intervention from
the United Nations or other outside influences.
</P>
<P>
   Tremendous obstacles remain in the way of a true rapprochement
on the Asian subcontinent. Both Vajpayee and Sharif will no doubt
try to link their signatures to promises of U.S. sanctions being
eased and other steps. President Clinton was supposed to visit
India and Pakistan this fall, a trip this page urged him to
reconsider after the nuclear blasts.
</P>
<P>
   Such a trip may still be premature, but the president should
keep up the pressure for progress and schedule a trip, perhaps next
year, as a spur to Indian and Pakistani agreements. With rising
tensions in South Asia, including threats of a war between
Afghanistan and Iran, the region looms as a more important security
concern than ever.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Clinton faces a tough battle in pressing ratification
of the treaty in the Senate, where many Republicans are skeptical
of its effectiveness. Politically distracted as it is, the
administration should redouble its efforts to win ratification of
this important nuclear accord. Surely the Senate opponents will not
want the United States to align itself with North Korea as the only
holdouts on one of the most significant barriers against the spread
of nuclear weapons.

FOR JIMY WILLIAMS, THE JOURNEY CONTINUES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Through it all _ through the early Yankee blitzkrieg
which turned the American League East race into a quest for a
wild-card slot before Father's Day, through the September swoon,
through the trials and tribulations of Pedro Martinez, through the
ongoing Mo Vaughn soap opera, through the snickers and the sniping
from his critics who joked about everything from the way he talked
to the way he managed _ the man in the office just off the Red Sox'
clubhouse at Fenway Park was consistent and unflappable.
</P>
<P>
   Jimy was, well, Jimy, and if that wasn't good enough for some
people, so be it. Jimy Williams really didn't care. He would run
the club the same way he had run the Blue Jays from 1986-89 and
almost the same way he had done things since 1974 when he was a
rookie minor league manager at Quad Cities.
</P>
<P>
   Through all those years and all those teams, Jimy Williams had
never managed a team that won a pennant. Now he has a shot to do it
here, because with Thursday night's 9-6 victory over the Baltimore
Orioles, the wild-card Red Sox are in the AL playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess we're down to zero now,'' said Williams with a smile,
referring to the raging topic of the past several days as the Red
Sox gradually reduced their magic number in quest of their first
playoff appearance since 1995. ``It feels good. They earned it.''
</P>
<P>
   So did Williams, who was greeted in Boston with as much
skepticism as praise when he was hired as the 41st manager of the
Red Sox on Nov. 19, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In typical fashion, Williams deflected the praise, to the
players, to the coaches and trainers, to upper management. He
talked about the highlights of a season that was, despite the woes
of September when almost everyone seemed to be struggling, a joyous
surprise. It all started on Good Friday when Vaughn's ninth-inning
grand slam gave the Sox a come-from-behind victory over Seattle in
their home opener, seemingly setting the tone for the entire year.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Sox can relax for three days and wonder whom they will
face in next week's best-of-five Division Series, either slumping
Cleveland or surging Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say we're a wild-card team. But I call it a four-legged
race,'' said Williams, referring to the two-tiered playoffs that
will determine the AL World Series representative. ``Can we get
there? We'll see. All I know is that we're going to be somewhere
next week. That's what the wild card does. It travels.''
</P>
<P>
   For Jimy Williams _ who came so close in 1987 with Toronto
before watching his team lose its last seven games and get nudged
out by Detroit, who was part of the Atlanta Braves' dynastic run
through the early '90s as a coach, and who is now the leader of
this improbable wild-card team _ the journey is just beginning.

   WASHINGTON WATCH VOTE CHART Questions regarding this
transmission should be directed to 202-628-3100, ext. 224.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 25 -- The following chart shows how senators and
representatives voted on key bills and amendments within the last
week. A ``Y'' means the member voted for the measure; an ``N''
means the member voted against the measure; a ``?'' means the
member did not vote; and a ``P'' means the member voted
``present.''
</P>
<P>
   SENATE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: WAGE
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Tuesday voted to block a minimum wage increase. By a
55-44 vote, senators decided to table -- or set aside for the year
-- a proposal to raise the federal minimum wage by $1 over the next
two years. Supporters of the procedural vote cited an increase in
the minimum wage within the past several years. Opponents of the
motion to kill the increase said it would have helped working
families stay above the poverty line. A ``yes'' vote favors tabling
the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: BANKRUPT
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Wednesday voted, 97-1, to overhaul the nation's
bankruptcy laws, making it more difficult for consumers to file for
bankruptcy. Supporters said the law needs to be changed because
currently many people exploit the bankruptcy system to get out of
paying debts. The opponent said the overhaul would make it harder
for those who legitimately need to file for bankruptcy to do so. A
``yes'' vote favors the bill.
</P>
<P>
   3) BILL NUMBER: FAA
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Friday voted, 92-1, to renew Federal Aviation
Administration programs and earmark $10.1 billion in fiscal 1999
for the agency. The measure would increase flights at busy airports
while restricting flights over national parks. Supporters said the
legislation would provide increased service to underserved areas.
The opponent said the legislation goes against previous agreements
to turn airports over to regional authorities. A ``yes'' vote
favors the bill.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   HOUSE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: SCHOOLS
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Sept. 18, the House approved a measure, 212-198, that
would reallocate money from 31 federal education programs to block
grants given directly to the states. The grants would total $2.7
billion in 1999 and $14.3 billion over five years. Supporters said
it would allow teachers and students to focus on learning.
Opponents said the measure would not address serious education
problems, such as classroom overcrowding and a lack of qualified
teachers. A ``yes'' vote favors the bill.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: IMMIGRANTS
</P>
<P>
   The House Thursday approved, 288-133, a bill that would allow
more skilled immigrants to work in the United States. The measure
would increase the number of visas given to immigrants who would
work in such high-tech fields as computer programming and
engineering. Supporters said the bill would not necessarily result
in immigrants taking jobs away from U.S. workers. Opponents said
companies will lay off U.S. workers to hire immigrants who will
work for lower wages. A ``yes'' vote favors the bill.
</P>
<P>
   3) BILL NUMBER: SS
</P>
<P>
   The House Friday voted, 240-188, to set aside a portion of the
budget surplus for Social Security. The measure would place 90
percent of the estimated $1.6 trillion budget surplus over the next
10 years in a reserve account until the future of Social Security
is set. Supporters, mostly Republicans, said the measure could save
Social Security, and the remaining 10 percent could be used to cut
taxes. Opponents said the entire surplus should be put into the
reserve account and that using the money for tax cuts would be an
assault on Social Security. A ``yes'' vote favors the bill.

PANEL OK'S RELEASE OF SECRET RECORDINGS OF LEWINSKY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER AND ANN SCALES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The secretly recorded voice of Monica S. Lewinsky
discussing her affair with President Clinton will soon reach the
airwaves, after the House Judiciary Committee voted Friday night to
release portions of Linda R. Tripp's audiotapes and nearly 40,000
additional documents related to the sex scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Amid intense jockeying for public support in advance of a
probable full impeachment investigation, the deeply divided
committee unanimously approved releasing edited transcripts and
copies of Tripp's 17 tapes of her talks with Lewinsky. The
transcripts are expected to be available by next Thursday, with the
other 40,000 documents and the audiotapes released several days
later.
</P>
<P>
   In a lengthy, closed-door fray Friday, the Republican majority
on the Judiciary Committee joined far more attempts by Democrats
than in a similar session last week to black out sexually explicit
material that could be damaging to Clinton and offensive to the
public.
</P>
<P>
   But the Democrats were stymied in numerous other efforts,
including attempts to define the scope of the inquiry and to gain
access to about 20 boxes of investigative material on the Lewinsky
case that Starr did not deliver to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were 25 unanimous votes today, but on the biggies, we
didn't make it,'' said Representative John Conyers Jr. of Michigan,
the highest ranking Democrat on the committee.
</P>
<P>
   The Tripp tapes, including some whose authenticity is under
investigation, triggered the probe by the independent counsel,
Kenneth W. Starr, that resulted in the preliminary House
impeachment inquiry. Their release will provide Americans with
their first chance to hear Lewinsky's voice.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike the first avalanche of Starr's investigative material
released Monday, the final batch, including the Tripp tapes, will
include relatively little sexually explicit material, several
lawmakers said.
</P>
<P>
   The mass of evidence to be released also includes FBI interviews
and transcripts of grand jury testimony involving dozens of
witnesses before Starr's grand jury, including such central figures
as Clinton's secretary, Betty Currie, and Vernon E. Jordan Jr., a
Clinton confidant who helped Lewinsky find a job around the time
she filed a false affidavit denying her sexual relationship with
the president.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican majority on the Judiciary Committee, facing
heightened concern about a potential backlash from another large
release of sexually explicit material, rebuffed far fewer
Democratic attempts to black out salacious references in this mound
of investigative material than they did last week.
</P>
<P>
   In one instance, three Republicans joined the Democratic
minority in voting 17-16 to approve blacking out sexually explicit
material.
</P>
<P>
   ``People aren't going to be shocked anymore,'' said
Representative W. Asa Hutchinson, an Arkansas Republican who serves
on the committee. ``The blushing days are over.''
</P>
<P>
   Representative Martin T. Meehan, a Massachusetts Democrat who
serves on the committee, attributed the bipartisanship over
withholding some material to GOP fears of the inquiry backfiring.
``I think Republicans recognize the fact that most Americans feel
the president is being railroaded, so they are making more of an
attempt to at least appear bipartisan,'' Meehan said.
</P>
<P>
   To Democrats, the most important issue other than withholding
inappropriate material was a motion by Conyers to permit the
committee to review the investigative documents that Starr
withheld. Several Democrats said the material could include
evidence that is exculpatory for Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Starr informed the committee he would release the material upon
a joint request from the panel. But Conyers' move failed along
party lines, with all Republcans against it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is not the independent counsel,'' said
Representative Barney Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat. ``It's the
Republicans, who don't want us to see the information.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican counterattack on the Conyers motion was led by
Representative Bob Barr, a Georgia Republican who was one of the
first House members to call for Clinton's impeachment. Other GOP
members joined him, calling the motion a veiled attack on Starr.
</P>
<P>
   The committee also rejected a Democratic motion to investigate
Starr's request in January to Attorney General Janet Reno to expand
his Whitewater probe to the Lewinsky matter. All Republicans on the
37-member committee rejected the motion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not appropriate for us to be diverted by an effort to
discredit the independent counsel,'' said Representative Charles
Canady, a Florida Republican and committee member.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Clinton maintained his newly aggressive stance
toward Congress Friday, lashing out at Republicans for having
approved only one of 13 appropriation bills with a week left before
the end of the fiscal year. He renewed the attack after signing a
stopgap spending measure to keep the government running through
Oct. 9.
</P>
<P>
   ``The legislation is a regrettable sign that the Republican
majority in Congress has failed to address the urgent priorities of
the American people,'' Clinton said before leaving Washington for a
weekend fund-raising blitz.
</P>
<P>
   The attack on Republicans was one more salvo fired by the White
House as it seeks to persuade the public that Clinton is focused on
tending to the nation's business while the GOP is fixated on moving
forward with impeachment proceedings against him. If Congress does
not approve more appropriation bills by Oct. 9, Clinton will be
forced to sign another stopgap measure to avert a government
shutdown.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton flew Friday to Chicago, where he promoted his education
policies at an elementary school and attended a luncheon expected
to raise $250,000 for Representative Glenn Poshard, a gubernatorial
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   From Chicago, Clinton was heading west to San Jose and Los
Angeles for more fund-raising and to join the first lady for a
visit with their daughter, Chelsea. He also was set to attend DNC
fund-raisers in San Antonio and Houston, before returning to
Washington late Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Clinton's private lawyers and those for Paula Corbin
Jones were expected to continue talks over the weekend to end the
four years of legal wrangling over her sexual harassment suit
against the president.
</P>
<P>
   Jones's attorneys approached the Clinton team 2 1/2 weeks ago
with a proposal that they drop their plan to appeal a judge's
ruling in the case in exchange for a roughly $1 million cash
settlement, said a lawyer for Jones. Jones would also drop her
demand for an apology from Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   A few days ago, Clinton's private attorney, Robert S. Bennett,
countered with an offer of about $500,000, according to the Jones
lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know the probability'' for settlement, the lawyer
said. ``In this kind of case, with politicians, you never know.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jones lawyer said an apology, which had been the biggest
obstacle in previous negotiations, was no longer an issue. Jones
now feels vindicated by Clinton's acknowledgment in his Aug. 17
grand jury testimony that he was not necessarily forthcoming or
entirely truthful in the deposition he gave in the Jones case last
January.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's an admission,'' her lawyer said. ``Paula Jones, in the
events over the last couple of months, has been vindicated. It's no
longer he said-she said. You got your basic apology; it's the best
of both worlds.''
</P>
<P>
   A three-judge appeals court panel in St. Paul is scheduled to
hear Jones's appeal Oct. 20. Her case was thrown out by US District
Judge Susan Webber Wright in Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Jones were planning to file a motion of contempt
next week asking Wright to sanction Clinton for lying in the
deposition. Under the terms of the settlement, they would also drop
those plans.

HMO PROPOSES PAYMENTS FROM DRUG MAKER FOR PRODUCT USE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Payments to Foundation Health Systems Inc. of up
to $1 million a month for giving preference to Bristol-Myers Squibb
drugs would not amount to kickbacks, officials at the managed-care
giant said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The payments, proposed in a June draft agreement between
Foundation and the New York-based drug maker, were reported Friday
in the San Francisco Chronicle. They would compensate the
managed-care company for asking physicians to choose Bristol-Myers
products when prescribing medicine in several therapeutic
categories.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Yukelson, a spokesman for Health Net, Foundation's biggest
health plan, said the deal has not been finalized. But if it were
to go through, he said, doctors still could ask for exceptions to
the arrangement on a case-by-case basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't overstate it by saying often, but we do regularly make
exceptions'' to the current formulary, or list of
Foundation-approved drugs, Yukelson said.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the proposed arrangement has raised concern among some
health-care professionals that financial considerations could take
precedent over medical judgment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has a lot of the flavor of kickbacks,'' said Jeff McCombs,
a health economist at the University of Southern California School
of Pharmacy. ``I'd immediately worry about any formulary that would
restrict doctors to only one product within a class.''
</P>
<P>
   McCombs said research conducted at USC found that outcomes are
generally worse overall when physicians are limited to a single
drug to treat a given illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to get worse results, period, whether it's the
best, most expensive drug or not,'' McCombs said. ``So you may be
shooting yourself in the foot'' by such an arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   Under the draft agreement, Bristol-Myers would pay $1 million
per month for up to three years to a Foundation subsidiary that
handles drug benefits for its 4 million-plus HMO members.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange, Foundation would name five Bristol-Myers drugs as
preferred products. Physicians treating Foundation members would be
encouraged to prescribe those drugs when the illnesses they treat
arise. In such cases, nonpreferred drugs would be paid for by
Foundation only upon successful appeal by the physician.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Lott, head of policy development and advocacy at the
Healthcare Association of Southern California, said such
arrangements are not without precedent. But it would be immoral for
a managed-care company to chose a drug primarily because of
financial incentive, he said, rather than the drug's potential
benefit for a patient.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not new ground insofar as limiting drugs available on a
formulary, but if it's true . . . that that's the reason for
choosing a drug, that's morally bankrupt,'' Lott said.
</P>
<P>
   In a written statement, Bristol-Myers Squibb said it could not
discuss the specifics of the proposed arrangement with Foundation,
but that it does not seek to ``undermine a physician's . . .
independent assessment and choice of appropriate pharmaceutical
therapy.''
</P>
<P>
   Foundation shares fell $0.1875 Friday to close at $10.625.

   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ One to go for 4-0.
</P>
<P>
   Boston College will attempt to cap a perfect September and get
off to its best start since 1992 (7-0-1) Saturday against
Louisville.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been here for two years, but I'll tell you, it's a lot
different,'' said junior nose guard Chris Hovan, referring to the
positive atmosphere surrounding the team. ``It's a lot different
when you walk on campus and everything. Guys on this team really
believe in each other. I think it's really the main cog of this
team. It's team unity.''
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles have sailed along in their first three games,
including last week's 31-7 triumph over Temple. Then BC hit its
first bump in the road when coach Tom O'Brien placed junior running
back Quinton Lee, backup to senior workhorse Mike Cloud, on
indefinite suspension following his arrest last Sunday morning on
charges of disorderly conduct and assault and battery on an
officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're fine,'' said O'Brien when asked about his team's
response to its first encounter with adversity. ``They've practiced
hard and they've worked hard. There's no excuse for us not to play
a good game.''
</P>
<P>
   Cloud, the nation's No. 2 rusher (88 carries, 552 yards, 7
touchdowns), will have to shoulder more of a burden but will have
some help from sophomore Cedric Washington and junior Carlton Rowe.
</P>
<P>
   BC will also be without sophomore tight end Robert Ellis, who
injured his left shoulder against Temple. Ellis will be replaced by
redshirt freshman Josh Cervi.
</P>
<P>
   ``Emotionally, I think it was (a loss),'' Cloud said of Lee's
suspension. ``Everyone was friends with Quinton, and Quinton was a
great guy. He was funny and everything. But I think we've just got
to put it in the back of our minds and focus on this next game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a meeting right after it happened, and (senior
cocaptain) Brian Maye said, `We've just got to put it in the back
of our minds and think about the upcoming games.' Quinton was a
friend to all of us, but we've just got to stay focused and not let
all that we've done slip away.''
</P>
<P>
   The challenge facing BC's offense this week will be to maintain
its balanced attack in the face of Louisville's ``storm'' defense,
patterned after Arizona's Desert Swarm, which utilizes a flex
linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   Defensively, BC will have to stop the wide-open passing game
installed by first-year Louisville coach John L. Smith, whose team
snapped a 10-game losing streak last week with a 35-9 win at
Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles, who held Temple's fourth-ranked rushing attack to
151 yards _ barely half its average _ last week, will have to
switch gears, focusing on Cardinals quarterback Chris Redman, the
No. 5 passer in the nation (81 for 151, 993 yards, 6 TDs).
</P>
<P>
   Redman has been sacked just once this season. ``I think it's due
in large part to him because he never holds the ball,'' O'Brien
said. ``It's tough to get to him because the ball comes out fast.
Obviously, they have a good line, but he helps them because he
doesn't hang on to the ball that long.''
</P>
<P>
   Redman's favorite target, tight end Ibn Green, will be back
after sitting out last week's game with a viral infection. Green,
Redman's teammate at Louisville Male High, was hospitalized last
Monday and Tuesday, lost 15 pounds, and was unable to travel with
the team to Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   Redman still completed 27 of 50 passes for 275 yards, including
a 26-yard TD to Arnold Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   He's one of the obstacles standing in the way of 4-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just play it week to week,'' said O'Brien, whose team will
be off next week before hosting Virginia Tech Oct. 8. ``But we just
want to beat Louisville. So if we beat 'em, then we're 4-0 and
that's great. But the key thing is just to win. We want to keep
winning. I said to the team earlier in the week that we'll worry
about the record at the end of the year. We just have to play it
week to week.''

ANALYSIS: HEDGE FUND'S FAILURE RAISES DISTURBING QUESTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Inserts new 5th graf. No other changes.)  (lb) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ If there has been a single refrain as economic
shock waves rolled around the world for the last year, it is the
importance of spotting and addressing financial risks before they
get out of control.
</P>
<P>
   But after a year of demands by the United States that Asia
strengthen banking supervision and provide better information to
investors, and after unheeded warnings to Russia about the
demanding discipline of the markets, the precipitous fall of a
sophisticated Wall Street firm suggests that the Treasury
Department, the Federal Reserve Board and other regulators nearly
missed a potentially big problem at home.
</P>
<P>
   Right under the noses of the same people who were dispensing
advice to the rest of the world, smack in the middle of the
best-supervised, best-capitalized, most open financial markets in
the world, a single firm, Long-Term Capital Management LP, was
making bets so big that when they went wrong they threatened to
destabilize the whole system.
</P>
<P>
   And no one really knows what other problems might surface on
Wall Street and ripple through the economy as the global crisis
hits the United States with greater force.
</P>
<P>
   But in a sign of Long-Term Capital's infectious influence, two
more big European banks reported losses Friday from their dealings
with the fund, on top of a huge loss disclosed Thursday by UBS AG,
Europe's biggest bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are less vulnerable than any other nation in the world by a
huge margin,'' said Roger Altman, a former deputy Treasury
secretary. ``But we are nonetheless vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of us knows for sure whether there is another problem in
this volatile environment which could rear its ugly head soon, and
it might not be a hedge fund but something else,'' Altman said.
``Long-Term Capital Management happened to be a hedge fund. But the
real point was that its failure was judged to be unacceptable, and
that there's so much complexity and leverage in the global
financial system that events like this can occur.''
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the House Banking Committee, Rep. James Leach,
R-Iowa, said Friday that he would hold hearings in the next week or
two to explore the economic and regulatory issues raised by
Long-Term Capital Management's troubles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Questions exist as to whether appropriate national and
international supervision exists and whether funds designed to
hedge risk for individual participants create risk to the system as
a whole,'' Leach said.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the regulatory system worked just as it should.
The Federal Reserve Bank of New York, in its role as monitor of the
financial markets, caught signals several weeks ago that Long-Term
Capital was in trouble. This week it brought together a group of
Wall Street powerhouses to assemble a rescue package that averted a
marketwide problem without calling on taxpayer money.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is how the situation should have played out, given our
current regime,'' said Bert Ely, a consultant to the
financial-services industry. ``However, and this is where the
average citizen should be concerned, it raises public policy
questions about how this got out of control the way it did.''
</P>
<P>
   To some extent, the answer lies in the nature of the financial
instruments being traded by Long-Term Capital Management and other
investment firms and banks. Not only are derivatives so complex
that they are truly understood by only a relative handful of
people, but the trading strategies employed by Long-Term Capital
and other firms are closely guarded secrets.
</P>
<P>
   The hedge-fund industry operates largely outside the scope of
traditional bank and securities regulators, and relies on money
borrowed from a variety of sources, including commercial banks,
which to some degree are gambling with federally insured deposits.
</P>
<P>
   George Soros, perhaps the best-known hedge-fund operator,
described the industry in congressional testimony this month as ``a
daisy chain with many intermediaries, and each intermediary has an
obligation to his counterparts without knowing who else is
involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Soros' appearance before the House Banking Committee on Sept. 15
came more than a week before Long-Term Capital Management's
problems became public. But his firm was almost certainly aware of
the developing difficulties at Long-Term Capital _ it was
approached earlier this month about providing financial help _ and
his description on Capitol Hill of the problems brewing in the
market proved prescient.
</P>
<P>
   After Russia's debt default rocked stock and bond markets around
the world last month, ``many hedge funds and other speculative
accounts sustained large enough losses that they had to be
liquidated,'' Soros said. ``Normal spreads were disrupted, and
professionals who arbitrage between various derivatives, that is to
say, trade one derivative against another, also sustained large
losses.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Soros said, banks were ``frantically trying to
limit their exposure, de-leverage and reduce risk,'' setting off a
global credit crunch that was hurting developing nations and
beginning to squeeze the United States.
</P>
<P>
   With hindsight, the brewing problems at Long-Term Capital were
no doubt a factor in the increasingly explicit hints from Alan
Greenspan, the Federal Reserve Board chairman, and William
McDonough, the president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, that
the central bank might soon reduce interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan specifically mentioned during congressional testimony
on Wednesday that increasing disruptions to the financial system
were one reason that an easier monetary policy might soon be
justified.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, having focused for the last year on the lessons of
Asia's problems, policy-makers in the United States are well aware
of how the bursting of Japan's financial bubble in the early 1990s
and the subsequent credit squeeze have left the world's
second-largest economy moribund.
</P>
<P>
   For the last two years, Greenspan has been making the case that
the Fed has to be concerned with big swings in asset prices as well
as product prices as it sets interest-rate policy, an approach that
seems increasingly justified with each new tremor that hits Wall
Street.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Greenspan has always been reluctant to impose more
heavy-handed regulation on derivatives, arguing that banks and
other financial institutions are better positioned than auditors or
regulators to determine the worth and risk of the securities they
hold and finance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hedge funds are very strongly regulated by those who lend the
money,'' Greenspan told Congress earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   But Greenspan and Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin have been
warning for months about the perils of lenders becoming too
sanguine about risk. And in the case of Long-Term Capital, it
quickly became clear that some of the world's biggest and most
sophisticated banks and investment houses had little if any idea
what bets were being made with the money they lent.
</P>
<P>
   And it raised anew the question of whether the regulatory
approach to hedge funds is adequate today.
</P>
<P>
   Many hedge funds operate under an exemption in the Investment
Company Act of 1940. The exemption was intended to allow family
businesses that invest in securities to avoid federal regulation.
The exemption covered pools of money having fewer than 100
investors, which did not offer shares to the general public.
</P>
<P>
   Funds can also be incorporated offshore and not allow Americans
to invest, thus escaping the jurisdiction of the federal
government. Or hedge funds can operate under the terms of a 1996
amendment to the federal securities laws that exempts from
regulation those funds that limit themselves to fewer than 500
``sophisticated'' institutions or individuals, defined as those
that invest more than $25 million or $5 million, respectively.

AMERICANS ALMOST OUT OF DAVIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE _ Breaker, breaker, breaker, breaker _ broken. And
just about busted out is the United States, whose reserves weren't
much in the clutch _ four tie-breakers _ as lightly regarded Italy
pounced for a huge 2-0 lead in their best-of-five Davis Cup
semifinal Friday at an outpost that seemed a desert island in the
scheme of things.
</P>
<P>
   Though the American cupboard wasn't quite bare after Pete
Sampras, Andre Agassi, and Michael Chang mailed in their regrets,
there wasn't much shelf life in the leftovers _ a frazzled rookie,
Jan-Michael Gambill, and a used-up Todd Martin.
</P>
<P>
   If Gambill, ranked No. 50, and Martin, No. 28, are perhaps
household names here and there in this land, the guys who tied up
and broke them, No. 37 Andrea Gaudenzi and No. 47 Davide
Sanguinetti, are strangers everywhere but Italy, where their
headlines are very heady this morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody is favored in Davis Cup _ funny things happen. We can't
believe it, but we did it,'' beamed the All-American Italian,
Sanguinetti, who ran the slow-reacting, 6-foot-6-inch Martin out of
the Arena, 7-6 (7-0), 6-3, 7-6 (10-8), in the second match.
Sanguinetti, 26 today, won his A-A status five years ago at UCLA,
where he made the NCAA semis, although he was the team's No. 6
player.
</P>
<P>
   Davis Cup debut jitters seized 21-year-old Gambill immediately.
(Remember Sampras freezing in his 1991 coming-out, losing both
singles, to Henri Leconte and Guy Forget, in the defeat by France
in the final?) Though the unorthodox Gambill _ who uses both hands
both ways, a la Monica Seles _ recovered momentarily to bake a
second-set bagel and gamely banged his way out of eight match
points as Gaudenzi anguished, he was down, up, down, down like the
market. In a wacky, suspenseful but loosely played bout, he came
apart, 6-2, 0-6, 7-6 (7-0), 7-6 (7-4).
</P>
<P>
   The critical game: Gaudenzi held to 6-5 in the fourth through
two break points. ``If I don't,'' he said, ``I could be gone.''
</P>
<P>
   The US needs a doubles win today from another rookie,
21-year-old Justin Gimelstob, plus Martin, over Diego Nargiso and
Gaudenzi to avoid impeachment and keep alive a shot at the Cup.
Sweden, leading Spain, 2-0, appears ready to win the 98-year-old
crock for a second successive year.
</P>
<P>
   The Gambill gamble didn't work for US captain Tom Gullikson, who
selected him over sore-armed Jim Courier. ``I was never so nervous;
it was my most disappointing loss. I was playing for more than
me,'' said Gambill, beaten by superior experience. Gaudenzi (11-7
in Cup singles) held down his errors to 37 while the American
sprayed 66. Sanguinetti, unburdened mentally with the 1-0 lead,
made 23 mistakes. Martin, in a must-win situation, had 50 and
couldn't punish with his big gun, the volley.
</P>
<P>
   Has the US ever revived from 0-2? Oh, yes. In 1934, against
Australia in a semi at Wimbledon. Andre Agassi's late
grandfather-in-law, Frank Shields, beat Viv McGrath in the deciding
match.
</P>
<P>
   That's the news. Now the damning questions about US Tennis
Association blunders which call for censure:
</P>
<P>
   Why was this important engagement played in uninterested
Milwaukee, where merely 3,500 attended _ albeit spirited, stomping,
flag-flapping folk _ in an 8,000-seat building?
</P>
<P>
   Why wasn't it played in Las Vegas, home of America's best
Cupper, Andre Agassi, where the 1995 semi against Sweden drew about
10,000 daily? Agassi, who opted out to host a benefit for his
charitable foundation, says he would have found time to play this
weekend in his neighborhood. In the lineup on a hard court, he
would have been worth two wins himself. When you've got Agassi's
phone number, you'd better call often and get his OK on every move.
Obviously. Davis Cup committee chairman Bo Driskill says the USTA
couldn't find a Vegas site. Agassi says he would have found it
personally.
</P>
<P>
   Why, with the home-court edge, did the US generously give that
advantage away by installing a turgid carpet? The Italians,
dirt-kickers who lust for slow courts, couldn't believe the gift.
``The court was so slow, like clay,'' said Sanguinetti with a grin.
So you're stuck with Gambill and Martin? You bring in the fastest
rug you can find, even if you have to soak and freeze it.
</P>
<P>
   Although the USTA has booked Delray Beach, Fla., for the
December final, presumably against Sweden, one hopes it didn't make
a nonrefundable deposit on the hotel rooms.

HOUSE PANEL TO RELEASE EDITED AUDIOTAPES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Americans will soon be able to hear Monica Lewinsky
talk about her relationship with President Clinton whether they
want to or not.
</P>
<P>
   The House Judiciary Committee made that decision for them
Friday, voting to release edited versions of 27 audiotapes that
Linda Tripp surreptitiously made of her conversations with
Lewinsky. Tripp turned the tapes over to independent counsel
Kenneth Starr, who used them to seek expansion of his investigation
to include allegations that the president lied about and tried to
cover up his sexual encounters with the former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   The 37-member panel of 21 Republicans and 16 Democrats also
agreed to make public what one member described as 40,000
additional pages of testimony and other documents that Starr used
to bolster his report to Congress outlining 11 charges against the
president that could amount to impeachable offenses.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's decision after a daylong, closed-door meeting
that was described as ``civil and contentious'' by one member,
fulfilled a House resolution passed two weeks ago calling on the
panel to release as much of the Starr materials as possible.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the country has been exposed to Lewinsky's sexually
explicit testimony about her trysts with the president, as well as
Clinton's own videotaped testimony in which he was questioned
repeatedly about those encounters. Now the public will be able to
hear Lewinsky's own voice as she recounts the affair to Tripp and
then read Tripp's testimony before the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   The information will also include the testimony of Washington
lawyer and Clinton friend, Vernon Jordan, as well as that of the
president's personal secretary Betty Currie.
</P>
<P>
   But committee members insisted that the information, which will
be released late next week, has been severely edited so as not to
include as much graphic and salacious detail as some of the other
Starr materials that Congress has released. Committee member Asa
Hutchison, R-Ark., described the new materials as the G-rated
version, suggesting that instances of profanity, gossip and
references to people unrelated to the Clinton-Lewinsky matter will
be erased from the tapes before copies are released.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say you're not going to get shocked anymore. The blushing
days are behind us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats hailed the decision by Republicans to support more
severe editing of the materials as a victory of sorts. Most of the
16 Democrats on the committee had argued against releasing any
information at all until the committee had at least settled the
question of whether to proceed with impeachment hearings.
</P>
<P>
   Public opinion polls have supported that view as well, and
Democrats were quick to suggest that the GOP had finally gotten the
public's message that ``enough is enough.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a victory in that Republicans recognize they may have
been too hasty in releasing as much information as we have,'' said
committee member Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Although Friday's committee session started off in a bipartisan
fashion with a series of unanimous votes on a dozen motions, the
partisanship reasserted itself when Democrats sought to obtain more
information from Starr, including any notes and briefing papers
that were presented to Attorney General Janet Reno by Starr last
January when he sought and received her permission to expand his
investigation based on the Tripp tapes.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats said they were concerned about reports that Starr
may not have presented an accurate picture to Reno of what the
Tripp tapes contained.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson Lee described the motion to request more information
from Starr as ``a procedural issue of great importance'' that would
have given committee members better information about how the
decision was made to expand a four-year investigation of Whitewater
and other matters to include sex in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans rejected the motion on a party line vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some members on the Democratic side who simply want
to conduct an investigation of Mr. Starr's investigation,'' said
committee member Charles Canady, R-Fla. ``That is not the question
before us. It's not appropriate for us to be diverted by an effort
to discredit the independent counsel.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans also rejected a Democratic motion calling on the
committee to define what constitutes an impeachable offense before
proceeding with the release of more materials or hearings.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson Lee called it ``shocking'' that member of the committee
``could not even reach agreement on that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still not working together and collaborating together on
establishing any standards,'' she told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to release more Starr materials was never in doubt,
given the resolution that passed the House with only 63 dissenters
two weeks ago. But the redactions that the committee agreed to make
in the materials went much further than expected
</P>
<P>
   For example, the testimony from more than a dozen witnesses
before the grand jury will not be included in the released
material. The omitted information includes testimony from FBI and
Secret Service agents, as well as Lewinsky's mother who appeared
twice before the Starr panel.
</P>
<P>
   As of Friday, most members of the committee had not yet gone
through all the materials supplied to Congress by Starr. But over
the next 10 days, the committee staff will prepare a report of its
own on the information, which will be presented to the committee
Oct. 5 or 6. After the committee hears from the staff, it's
expected to pass a resolution calling for the House to open an
official inquiry of impeachment.

   (NYT37) WASHINGTON -- Sept. 25, 1998 -- CLINTON-CONGRESS, 9-25

Conyers Jr. of Michigan, ranking Democrat on the House Judiciary
Committee. The committee approved Friday the release of thousands
more pages of documents that had been delivered by the independent
counsel, finding near unanimity this time on particularly sensitive
information that would be kept from public view. (Shana Raab/New

 &HT;    Hurricanes bring happiness to some
 &HT;    By Rachel Masory
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOCA RATON, Fla. _ Hurricane Andrew brought Katia Lynch a
husband. Hurricane Georges brought her a daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our lives are pretty much marked by hurricanes,'' Katia said.
</P>
<P>
   Katia, 29, and James, 35, were both working for Allstate
Insurance when Hurricane Andrew hit South Florida in 1992. James
worked in New York, Katia in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   James volunteered to come down to South Florida six days after
the hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worked out of the Miami office for one week,'' James said.
``My last day there, I asked her out and she said yes _ after
looking at me like I had three heads.''
</P>
<P>
   James worked out of the Homestead office for another eight
months. The couple got engaged on Aug. 19, 1993; they married on
Aug. 19, 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, in Lake Charleston in suburban Boynton Beach,
the Lynches were preparing for the birth of their first child when
Hurricane Georges threatened South Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our lives are pretty much marked by hurricanes and it's always
been good things,'' Katia said. ``So I guess I shouldn't get
scared.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I got nervous about the hurricane and in my
subconscious, I just decided to go into labor,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Katia gave birth to Erika Lynch, 8 pounds and 3 ounces, at 11:58
p.m. Thursday at Boca Raton Community Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's just perfect, my daughter and my beautiful wife,''
beamed James.
</P>
<P>
   Friends and family have asked if they named their daughter
Georgette or Georgiana. ``I don't think so!'' James said.
</P>
<P>
   James, a homeowner adjuster for SCS &AMP; Associates, expects to be
very busy after Georges passes through. Katia, an accountant, plans
to return to her job in three months.

   Brenda, pregnant with her first child, was paying a visit to her
obstetrician's office. When the exam was over, she shyly began, `My
husband wants me to ask you...`
</P>
<P>
   `I know, I know,` the doctor said, placing a reassuring hand on
her shoulder, `I get asked this all the time. Sex is fine until
late in the pregnancy.`
</P>
<P>
   `No, that's not it at all,` Brenda confessed. `He wants to know
if I can still mow the lawn.`
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HE'S NOT DISABLED, HE'S DRUNK &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A police officer pulls over this guy who's been weaving in and
out of the lanes. He goes up to the guy's window and says, `Sir, I
need you to blow into this breathalyzer tube.`
</P>
<P>
   The man says, `Sorry, officer, I can't do that. I am an
asthmatic. If I do that, I'll have a really bad asthma attack.`
</P>
<P>
   `Okay, fine. I need you to come down to the station to give a
blood sample.`
</P>
<P>
   I can't do that either. I am a hemophiliac. If I do that, I'll
bleed to death.`
</P>
<P>
   `Well, then, we need a urine sample.`
</P>
<P>
   `I'm sorry, officer, I can't do that either. I am also a
diabetic. If I do that, I'll get really low blood sugar.`
</P>
<P>
   `All right, then I need you to come out here and walk this white
line.`
</P>
<P>
   `I can't do that, officer.`
</P>
<P>
   `Why not?`
</P>
<P>
   `Because I'm drunk.`

   One day a man was waking along the beach when he tripped over a
lamp. He turned around and kicked the lamp out of anger. A few
seconds later, a genie popped out of the lamp, but the genie was
angry that the man had kicked his lamp.
</P>
<P>
   Reluctantly, the genie said, `Even though you kicked me, I still
have to give you three wishes. However because of what you did, I
will also give twice what you wish for to the person you hate the
most: your boss.`
</P>
<P>
   So the man agreed and made his first wish. `I want lots of
money`, he said. Instantly 22 million dollars appear in the man's
bank account and 44 million appeared in his boss' account.
</P>
<P>
   For his second wish, the man wished for a couple of sports cars.
Instantly a Lambergini, Ferrari and a Porsche appeared, but at the
same time outside his boss' house appeared two of each car.
</P>
<P>
   Finally the genie said, `This is your last wish, you should
choose carefully`, and so the man replied, `I've always wanted to
donate a kidney.`

   Mr. Clinton says he hasn't quit fighting for a minimum wage
hike. No surprise from a man who may be out of a job before long.
</P>
<P>
   The man at the next desk says talking about this Clinton mess
with his family has been embarrassing _ especially everything his
teen-agers have had to explain to him.

<P>
   The Clintons' legal bills for the whole Whitewater-to-Lewinsky
case now total some $8 million, reports say. See how much he's done
for the economy?
</P>
<P>
   Some members of Congress are seeking a way to punish the
president short of impeachment. Is there a Liars Anonymous with a

</P>
<P>
   ``What are we to do with this treasured moment of prosperity and
progress?'' Mr. Clinton asks. Why, spend it watching his grand jury
testimony, what else?
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States has no more important relationship in the
world than our relationship with Japan,'' Mr. Clinton says. Maybe,
but our relationship with ourself right now seems shaky.
</P>
<P>
   Gasoline prices are at a six-year low, reports say. We'll be
more impressed when they're at a 6 9/10-year low.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers in part of Russia are being paid in vodka instead of
cash, it's reported. So? It's still liquid assets.

   Automakers, it's reported, are competing in a price war. And the

LEAF FIGHTS WAR OF WORDS WITH HALLOW POINTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Streams of unconsciousness while wondering if you can
retroactively change a Heisman ballot:
</P>
<P>
   Some videotape just never gets old, like the frames of the
Chargers' Ryan Leaf throwing a tantrum at a reporter this week. It
took Leaf only three games to become the most immature starting
quarterback in the NFL, breaking the previous record held by Jeff
George.
</P>
<P>
   Leaf, 22 going on 2, got upset because a reporter reported that
Leaf cursed a TV crew filming postgame interviews Sunday. One
presumes the crew was asking Leaf how it felt to go 1 for 15
passing against the Chiefs.
</P>
<P>
   Life isn't easy for quarterbacks in the NFL, especially for
rookie quarterbacks. But you'd think Leaf would know better than to
attempt career suicide so early.
</P>
<P>
   He did play on a Rose Bowl team last year, so he shouldn't be
intimidated by questions. He went through a rough sophomore year,
too, in which Washington State coach Mike Price had to sit on the
kid's habit of blaming everyone else for mistakes and losses.
</P>
<P>
   He also has one of the better agents around in Leigh Steinberg.
Perhaps Leaf should read a copy of the new book written by
Steinberg: ``Winning With Integrity.'' There must be a chapter in
there about losing with integrity in there.
</P>
<P>
   What all this does most is make one wonder about Leaf's
formative years. Sure enough, there's something creepy under his
rocks. The Seattle Post-Intelligencer did a story during the Rose
Bowl crush on Leaf's reputation around his hometown, Great Falls,
Mont.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that Great Falls didn't think Leaf was so great. He
quit his high school basketball team as a junior after flipping off
the home crowd. Local police often found him driving his car 100
miles an hour along the interstate. He was considered cocky, brash
and rude, Great Falls' own version of Brian Bosworth. The Boz was
last seen getting mowed out of the NFL by Bo Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Leaf reportedly ticked off a lot of his Charger teammates by
holding out and then arriving with an attitude. Junior Seau tried
to snap him out of it behind closed doors, but his attempts
reportedly only made Leaf cop more attitude.
</P>
<P>
   If Leaf isn't careful, he'll get fragged by his own troops. ...
</P>
<P>
   Considering his blood lines, it's not the least bit surprising
to see Peyton Manning struggle in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   His dad Archie never played on a NFL team that had a winning
record. Never. The closest he came was 1979, when the Saints went
8-8. In 1983, he was traded to Minnesota, which finished 8-8, but
he didn't play a down for the Vikings all season.
</P>
<P>
   Archie won his first game with the Saints, 24-20, against the
Rams (why is that not shocking?). But the Saints would win only 18
games in his first five seasons. He sat out 1976 with an injury. In
the next five seasons, from 1977 to 1981, Manning and the Saints
would win only 19 more games.
</P>
<P>
   The Saints under Manning went 2-11-1 in 1972, 2-12 in 1975, 3-11
in 1977, 1-15 in 1980, and 4-12 in 1981. With Houston in 1981, the
Oilers went 1-8, and the Vikings went 3-12 in 1984, Manning's last
season in the league.
</P>
<P>
   Manning didn't exactly play for many Hall of Fame coaches. The
list includes J.D. Roberts. John North, Ernie Hefferle, Hank Stram
(post-Chiefs era), Dick Nolan, Dick Stanfel, Bum Phillips
(post-Oilers era), Ed Biles, Chuck Studley and Les Steckle. ...
</P>
<P>
   The rash of quarterback injuries has led me to discover a great
new NFL pool.
</P>
<P>
   Before each season, 20 or so football fans get together and
select which NFL quarterback they think will be sidelined first by
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Or perhaps each player picks three quarterbacks in this injury
pool, and he earns points for each game missed or severity of
injury. A re-entry draft could be included at various stages of the
season to keep the game fresh and lively.
</P>
<P>
   I'm calling the patent office. ...
</P>
<P>
   Bernie Kosar doesn't know it yet, but the front office executive
for the new Cleveland Browns may also have to be the team's backup

   MIAMI _ After leaving nearly 300 people dead in a five-day
rampage across the Caribbean, Hurricane Georges slammed into the
Florida Keys Friday with winds of more than 100 miles an hour,
causing widespread flooding and extensive damage to buildings,
roads and harbors but apparently no deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Friday evening, the powerful storm moved into the Gulf of Mexico
on a track aimed away from the Florida peninsula and almost
directly at Mobile, Ala. But fears that heavily populated areas of
Florida's Gulf Coast could be inundated by the heavy rainfall
accompanying the hurricane led authorities to extend evacuation
directives to include a total of 1.4 million people, or nearly a
10th of the state's population, including 346,000 residents of the
Tampa area.
</P>
<P>
   In both Tampa and Miami, hurricane shelters were said to be
filled to capacity. To ease that strain, emergency management
officials in Tampa suggested that those leaving their homes in
vulnerable coastal areas seek refuge with relatives or friends.
</P>
<P>
   The National Hurricane Center here forecast that the hurricane
would strengthen by late Saturday to a Category 3 storm, with
sustained winds of at least 111 miles an hour. A hurricane watch
was issued for the northern coast of the Gulf of Mexico, from
Morgan City, La., to the Florida panhandle, and meteorologists
warned that the storm could make landfall again as early as Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   With 105-mile-an-hour winds and storm surges of as much as seven
feet, the core of the storm hit Key West just before midday,
creating whiteout conditions much like those of a snowstorm and
knocking out the last remnants of electrical power. The storm's
passage coincided with high tide, leading to extensive flooding
throughout the islands of the lower Keys, most of which are barely
above sea level.
</P>
<P>
   On Little Torch Key, about 22 miles northeast of Key West, the
water was reported to be four feet above canals, causing some boats
to float into the yards of residents. Callers to a local radio
station reported seeing a fish swimming along one submerged road
and a refrigerator floating down another, both in the area of
Cudjoe Key.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the storm was battering the Keys, leading to flooding in
towns such as Tavernier and Marathon and taking roofs off houses in
Key West, Gov. Lawton Chiles was already sending units of the
Florida National Guard to an armory in Homestead, ground zero for
Hurricane Andrew in 1992. With U.S. 1, the only highway in the
Keys, impassable, Guard members were waiting for flood waters to
recede before moving in to help.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to action taken in the 1992 hurricane, which
inflicted $25 billion in damages, making it the most costly natural
disaster in American history, Federal Emergency Management Agency
teams also were being deployed early.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are as ready as we can be, and we pray that the human and
material cost will be limited,'' President Clinton said in
Washington Friday. Later in the day, he declared a state of
emergency in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   A hurricane watch remained in effect for the Gulf Coast of
Florida, from the Everglades through Naples and Fort Myers to
suburban communities north of Tampa. But after the hurricane
departs the Keys, its course was expected to take it far enough out
to sea that those areas would be spared the worst punishment of
winds and water.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``We are on the very periphery,'' Nancy Schapira, a spokeswoman
for Tampa's Emergency Operations Center, said with relief in a
telephone interview Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, said Jerry Jarrell, director of the National
Hurricane Center, ``there should not be a storm surge problem, but
just a lot of rain'' along the Gulf Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Heavily populated areas of south Florida experienced gusts of
high winds and heavy rains intermittently throughout the day, but
suffered relatively little damage. Alex Penelas, mayor of
Miami-Dade County, indicated Friday afternoon that the most serious
problem for the 2 million residents of his county was that the
storm left ``upwards of 100,000 people without electricity.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither the Miami nor the Fort Lauderdale airports was
officially closed, but airlines moved their planes out of south
Florida and suspended their flights as of 9 p.m. Thursday. Marc
Henderson, a spokesman for Miami International Airport, said that
``hopefully in the next day or so, we will get back to normal
operations.''
</P>
<P>
   On the hard-hit island of Hispaniola, rescue operations
continued in the Dominican Republic, where the official death toll
rose to 134, and in Haiti, where 87 were confirmed dead. But
government officials in both countries said the death toll could
increase as rescue workers made their way into isolated rural
areas.
</P>
<P>
   With a state of emergency already in place, President Leonel
Fernandez of the Dominican Republic appealed for international
assistance, and warned his country's 7.5 million citizens that it
could be six weeks before electrical power can be restored.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a word, the picture is one of desolation,'' Fernandez said
after visiting devastated areas. He calculated damage just to the
nation's electrical system at more than $100 million, and said that
up to 90 percent of some major crops peasant farmers depend on for
their livelihoods had been destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Tourist resorts such as Casa de Campo were also badly hit,
according to government officials, as were the country's three
principal airports on the southern coast, including Las Americas
International Airport outside Santo Domingo. ``The problem there is
not the tarmac, but the terminal'' and control tower, both of which
were heavily damaged, Bernardo Vega, the Dominican ambassador to
the United States, said Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Haiti's hillsides have been deforested by peasants in
need of fuel, which increases the possibility of mudslides and
inundations. In the wake of the storm, there were also fears that
epidemics of cholera and typhoid could break out and that swollen
rivers could overflow their banks and deluge the fertile Artibonite
Valley, which grows much of Haiti's food.
</P>
<P>
   Under a disaster declaration by President Clinton, Puerto Rico
was getting $39 million to repair public housing and was authorized
to use $300 million in previously awarded housing aid for disaster
relief.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, three additional hurricanes, Ivan, Jeanne and
Karl, were meandering across the Atlantic. They pose no immediate
threat to the Caribbean or the United States, but are being closely
monitored at the National Hurricane Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has gone on way too long,'' Jarrell, the director of the
center, said Friday, undoubtedly speaking for millions of other
Florida residents. ``We need a break.''

   &UR; IS THIS DIRTY? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Brenda, pregnant with her first child, was paying a visit to her
obstetrician's office. When the exam was over, she shyly began, `My
husband wants me to ask you...`
</P>
<P>
   `I know, I know,` the doctor said, placing a reassuring hand on
her shoulder, `I get asked this all the time. Sex is fine until
late in the pregnancy.`
</P>
<P>
   `No, that's not it at all,` Brenda confessed. `He wants to know
if I can still mow the lawn.`
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HE'S NOT DISABLED, HE'S DRUNK &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A police officer pulls over this guy who's been weaving in and
out of the lanes. He goes up to the guy's window and says, `Sir, I
need you to blow into this breathalyzer tube.`
</P>
<P>
   The man says, `Sorry, officer, I can't do that. I am an
asthmatic. If I do that, I'll have a really bad asthma attack.`
</P>
<P>
   `Okay, fine. I need you to come down to the station to give a
blood sample.`
</P>
<P>
   I can't do that either. I am a hemophiliac. If I do that, I'll
bleed to death.`
</P>
<P>
   `Well, then, we need a urine sample.`
</P>
<P>
   `I'm sorry, officer, I can't do that either. I am also a
diabetic. If I do that, I'll get really low blood sugar.`
</P>
<P>
   `All right, then I need you to come out here and walk this white
line.`
</P>
<P>
   `I can't do that, officer.`
</P>
<P>
   `Why not?`
</P>
<P>
   `Because I'm drunk.`
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PAYBACK &LR;

   One day a man was waking along the beach when he tripped over a
lamp. He turned around and kicked the lamp out of anger. A few
seconds later, a genie popped out of the lamp, but the genie was
angry that the man had kicked his lamp.
</P>
<P>
   Reluctantly, the genie said, `Even though you kicked me, I still
have to give you three wishes. However because of what you did, I
will also give twice what you wish for to the person you hate the
most: your boss.`
</P>
<P>
   So the man agreed and made his first wish. `I want lots of
money`, he said. Instantly 22 million dollars appear in the man's
bank account and 44 million appeared in his boss' account.
</P>
<P>
   For his second wish, the man wished for a couple of sports cars.
Instantly a Lambergini, Ferrari and a Porsche appeared, but at the
same time outside his boss' house appeared two of each car.
</P>
<P>
   Finally the genie said, `This is your last wish, you should
choose carefully`, and so the man replied, `I've always wanted to
donate a kidney.`

   Jack was in front of me coming out of church one day, and the
preacher was standing at the door as he always is to shake hands.
The preacher grabbed Jack by the hand and pulled him aside. The
Pastor said to him, 'You need to join the Army of the Lord!'
</P>
<P>
   Jack replied, 'I'm already in the Army of the Lord, Pastor.'
</P>
<P>
   Pastor questioned, 'How come I don't see you except at Christmas

<P>
   Mr. Clinton says he hasn't quit fighting for a minimum wage
hike. No surprise from a man who may be out of a job before long.
</P>
<P>
   The man at the next desk says talking about this Clinton mess
with his family has been embarrassing _ especially everything his
teen-agers have had to explain to him.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons' legal bills for the whole Whitewater-to-Lewinsky
case now total some $8 million, reports say. See how much he's done
for the economy?
</P>
<P>
   Some members of Congress are seeking a way to punish the
president short of impeachment. Is there a Liars Anonymous with a
12-step program?
</P>
<P>
   ``What are we to do with this treasured moment of prosperity and
progress?'' Mr. Clinton asks. Why, spend it watching his grand jury
testimony, what else?
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States has no more important relationship in the
world than our relationship with Japan,'' Mr. Clinton says. Maybe,
but our relationship with ourself right now seems shaky.
</P>
<P>
   Gasoline prices are at a six-year low, reports say. We'll be
more impressed when they're at a 6 9/10-year low.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers in part of Russia are being paid in vodka instead of
cash, it's reported. So? It's still liquid assets.
</P>
<P>
   Automakers, it's reported, are competing in a price war. And the
three-car owner at the next desk wants to know where to go to
surrender.
</P>
<P>
   The new Miss America, Nicole Johnson, has a journalism degree.
But other than that she seems like a decent human being.

<P>
   &UR; ON THE SECTION FRONT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-OLIGARCHS (Moscow) _ It's the Autumn of the Oligarchs in
Russia, as crony capitalism gives way to some sort of quasi return
to a more state controlled economy. But Victor Potanin, 37, the
head of one of Russia's rangiest business-banking-media combines,
is hardly in full scale retreat. By Timothy L. O'Brien. &UR;  &LR; (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   With Graphic.
</P>
<P>
   VIATICAL-INSURANCE (Undated) _ Could life insurance get a new
lease on life from a morbid bit of dealmaking that sprang up a
decade ago, when an AIDS diagnosis was a virtual death sentence?
Maybe so, if this year's dramatic growth in the business of buying
up policies from healthy people proves to be the start of a trend.
Viatical settlements, as the arrangments are known, are slowly
filtering into the insurance industry mainstream. By Joseph B.
Treaster. (Moved).

career civil servant with a Chinese name, a British knighthood and

accuses of preying on Hong Kong's economy. By Mark Landler.

proposition. (Moved).

motivate their people by shooting the moon _ publicly committing

sales in a year. Does this approach do more harm than good?

   INVEST-HEDGEFUNDS (Undated) _ As some giant hedge funds have
been tanking, banks, investment firms and private money managers
have been aggressively marketing a relatively new type of product
that they argue is a low-risk way to play the hedge fund game. The
structure is pretty simple. A fund of hedge funds takes your money
and divides it among anywhere from six to 80 hedge fund managers _
like Long-Term Capital. The goal is to put your money in the hands
of savvy managers who do not limit themselves to investments as
mundane as stocks and to spread the risk. By Geraldine Fabrikant.

 &HT;    21st victory would place Glavine in select group
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tom Glavine makes his final start today before Cy Young ballots
are due. If he earns his 21st win, he would join John Smoltz as the
only NL pitchers in the last five years to win more than 20. Smoltz
won 24 in 1996, his Cy Young year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll treat it as a normal start from the standpoint that I
want to pitch well,'' Glavine said. ``If I have an opportunity to
win the game, I'd like to do it. At the same time, I don't think
I'm going to stretch myself any further than I have to.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think my emphasis is going to be working on everything and
getting comfortable and getting to the point where I'm happy with
the way I'm throwing the ball to get ready for the postseason.''
</P>
<P>
   Glavine went into the weekend as the league's only 20-game
winner. He is 8-2 since July 17 with a 2.08 ERA and recorded his
third shutout of the season in Arizona last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Cy Young choice has hardly been clarified in the last weeks.
Entering Friday night's game, San Diego closer Trevor Hoffman had
52 saves, the second most ever accumulated after Bobby Thigpen's
major-league record 57 (1990). Kevin Brown started for the Padres
with an 18-7 record and a 2.36 ERA that ranked second in the league
to Greg Maddux's 2.24. Brown also was second in innings pitched and
strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   Walt, meet Keith
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, for the first time since Aug. 22, shortstop Walt
Weiss started a game next to second baseman Keith Lockhart. Weiss
reports his left quadriceps has felt better the last several days,
while Lockhart has felt better about his right hamstring every time
he has tested it.
</P>
<P>
   But manager Bobby Cox was uncertain just how long to go with the
two middle infielders this weekend. Weiss had been sidelined for
eight days and has just 10 at-bats this month. Lockhart has started
just three games in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll play it by ear,'' said Cox. ``We'll have to wait and see
how they do.''
</P>
<P>
   When both Weiss and Lockhart have started, the Braves' record
entering Friday was 40-16.
</P>
<P>
   Neagle mothballs
</P>
<P>
   Limited to just 12 innings this month with bursitis in his left
shoulder, Denny Neagle threw in the bullpen before Friday's game
and was hoping to work one or two innings today in preparation for
his reliever's role in next week's League Division Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it might be best to go (Friday) night,'' he said.
``That gives me three, four days until next Tuesday. If I can't
come back on three days, then I shouldn't be pitching anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Etc.
</P>
<P>
   Dexter Santos, the Braves' director of community relations and
fan development, is leaving the club Oct. 5 to assume a similar
position with the Atlanta Hawks. ... Former Brave Brad Clontz has
been on the Mets' 60-day disabled list since Sept. 11, when he had
bone chips and bone spurs removed from his right elbow.

 &HT;    `Got to disrupt their timing'
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the undefeated Falcons take on the undefeated 49ers Sunday
in San Francisco, cornerback Ray Buchanan and the Atlanta secondary
will be under the gun in a big way.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers pass first, then think about the run. Led by two
future Hall of Famers in quarterback Steve Young and receiver Jerry
Rice, the Niners put all kinds of pressure on defensive backs, with
both skills and scheme.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Rice is fairly big at 6 feet 2, 196 pounds, and
young receivers Terrell Owens (6-3, 217) and J.J. Stokes (6-4, 223)
are bigger. Owens and Stokes developed by leaps and bounds last
year, when Rice missed most of the season with knee injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Communciation will be more important than ever in the secondary.
Buchanan sat down with The Atlanta Journal-Constitution to talk
about slowing the 49ers' ``West Coast'' offense.
</P>
<P>
   AJC: What's the biggest difference in defending against this
passing offense compared with a more typical one?
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan: We have got to be aware of where (teammates) are,
where (the 49ers are), talking all the time, and we have to be in
the right position and make tackles. They're always crossing (in
patterns), motioning one way or another, trying to get DBs to make
the wrong decision as far as who to cover. It's up to us to be
there when the ball is caught, if it's caught.
</P>
<P>
   AJC: You're normally the left cornerback, although in the nickel
defense you go to the slot. For this game, will you move around
more, and perhaps shadow Rice?
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan: (Smiles) That's for me to know, my little secret.
</P>
<P>
   AJC: Other than talking to each other, being in position to make
tackles, and then making them, what can the secondary do to improve
its chances?
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan: You've got to disrupt their timing. It's an offense
based entirely on timing. You've got to get physical with the
receivers, try and throw off their timing.
</P>
<P>
   AJC: How far can you go with that strategy, though?
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan: It's about how the officials let you play. (San
Francisco receivers) throw cornerbacks around, and push off and
things like that. Then somebody in the secondary finally does
something like that, and maybe (officials) throw a flag.
</P>
<P>
   AJC: So both sides do it, making it a matter of who gets caught.

   Buchanan: You talk to officials before the game, and say, ``This
guy's going to be pushing off and this and that, and don't say
nothing if I'm doing the same thing.'' It may come down to how well
known you are (by officials). If you know them pretty well,
sometimes they'll hesitate to throw the flag on you.

 &HT;    Falcon DLs on lookout for Niner cut blocks
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- When the Atlanta Falcons play at San Francisco on
Sunday, the game will be different from most. First, both teams are
2-0 and tied with New Orleans atop the NFC West. Second, the
Falcons will try to end a six-game losing streak in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Atlanta defensive linemen will have to worry about a
game within the game. San Francisco linemen go for the legs _ a
lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``They cut (block) more than anybody,'' left end Lester
Archambeau said. ``I think some of the things they do across the
line (become illegal).''
</P>
<P>
   Cut-blocking is legal in many instances, so long as it's not by
a second blocker when a first blocker is engaged with a defender.
</P>
<P>
   That's not all the Falcons need to be prepared for, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leg-whipping is illegal, and they do it,'' said Archambeau,
who will square off with right tackle Derrick Deese. ``You get
heated; nobody likes to get kicked. It's going to be a battle. You
have to ... get your hands on the guy and keep him from getting all
the way into your legs.''
</P>
<P>
   A key matchup: 49ers Pro Bowl right guard Kevin Gogan (6 feet 7,
330 pounds) vs. Falcons left tackle Travis Hall (6-5, 300), one of
the top young interior linemen in the NFL. In a recent survey of
players, Gogan was voted one of the league's three dirtiest
players.
</P>
<P>
   Roster moves
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons' four early inactives are DT Shawn Swayda, S Omar
Brown, injured LB Henri Crockett and CB Elijah Williams. Williams'
absence means somebody else will return kicks with rookie WR Tim
Dwight. ... A game-day decision could be made on LG Calvin Collins
(ankle). Rookie Bob Hallen is the backup.
</P>
<P>
   Family reunion
</P>
<P>
   Falcon TE Ed Smith's younger brother, Irv, is the 49ers'
starting TE, replacing retired Brent Jones. ``We talk two, three
times a week,'' said Ed, still looking for his first career
reception. ``My mom and dad are coming out from (Trenton) New
Jersey. We're going to make a full weekend out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Extra points
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons will play only one more game on grass after San
Francisco, traveling to New England Nov. 8. They play three more
games outdoors: Oct. 11 at the Giants, Oct. 25 at the Jets and New
England. ... Atlanta is averaging 10 penalties a game, third-worst
in the NFL, trailing Oakland (12.7) and the Giants (10.7), teams
that are a combined 1-5. ... Atlanta and San Francisco are 2-0, but
the Falcons' opponents (Carolina and Phildadelphia) are a combined
0-5 so far, and the 49ers' opponents (Jets, Redskins) are 1-5. ...
San Francisco coach Steve Mariucci said he likes Atlanta's Dwight
as a KR/PR, but Atlanta is averaging just 5.6 yards yards per punt
return, 26th in the NFL. The Falcons are averaging 24.3 per kick
return, 10th in the league. ... LB Malcolm Hamilton (6-1, 235),
signed to the practice squad Wednesday to replace LB Brandon
Tolbert, has looked good. Hamilton was on the Redskins' practice
squad last year and was waived last month by Washington. ... The
Falcons have the NFL's No. 2 defense against the run (58.5 yards
per game), trailing Green Bay (53.5). Atlanta is No. 1 per carry,
allowing 2.6 yards to the Packers' 2.8. ... Falcons reserve QB
Steve DeBerg, a 49er in 1978-80, will show today that he knows the
way to San Jose. He'll travel to his alma mater to be one of the
first two San Jose State alumni inducted into the school's Ring of
Honor. DeBerg played there 1974-76, going back to school and
getting a degree last year. Rams coach Dick Vermeil, a former SJSU
quarterback, is the other inductee.

 &HT;    Unlike Falcons, Niners have a definite grasp on stability
 &HT;    By Terrence Moore
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA CLARA, Calif. -- While visiting the locker room of the San
Francisco 49ers on Friday, something hit an Atlanta columnist like
a 5.2 on the Richter scale. You had defensive end Chris Doleman on
one side and cornerback Darnell Walker on the other. They start for
one of the world's best organizations, but they were considered
expendable by one of the worst.
</P>
<P>
   What's up with that?
</P>
<P>
   Doleman shook his head, then he spoke for Walker and others who
he said had ``escaped'' from Suwanee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not with the Falcons anymore, because we live our lives
to a higher standard,'' said Doleman, a Pro Bowl veteran in his
14th season in the league after stints with Minnesota, Atlanta and
San Francisco. ``Darnell and I didn't get into the petty,
backbiting ways that kills them every year in terms of the players,
the coaches and the management.''
</P>
<P>
   Moments before, the Atlanta columnist had triggered that
response by asking Doleman to compare the 49ers and the Falcons,
especially since he'd played for both within the past three years.
Doleman said, ``I guess the locker rooms are about the same size.''
</P>
<P>
   Rim shot. Even so, when the Falcons enter 3Comm Park on Sunday,
they'll join the 49ers with a 2-0 record. And unlike Doleman's
tenure with the Falcons during the 1994 and 1995 seasons, the
Falcons have watched their front office evolve from owner Rankin
Smith Sr., president Taylor Smith, general manager Ken Herock and
coach June Jones to just Dan Reeves.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor Smith remains president, but he delegated everything from
personnel to coaching decisions to Reeves last year. ``I don't want
this to come out wrong,'' Doleman said, ``but you can't have one
man trying to do everything. Dictatorships don't work in the NFL.''
</P>
<P>
   No, they don't. You needn't look further than the 49ers'
philosophy, which stresses that it takes all five fingers to make a
fist to punch away your competition.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, we have the continuation of one of life's biggest
miracles. Whenever something hints of turning the 49ers into a
fallen king, they gain another crown or threaten to do so. Since
1981, when the 49ers began their run to a record five Super Bowl
victories and 13 NFC West titles in the past 17 years, they've had
three different head coaches, two different quarterbacks, many
Dolemans and many more Walkers.
</P>
<P>
   Now the 49ers have co-owner Eddie DeBartolo trying to avoid an
indictment by the feds investigating charges of gambling fraud in
DeBartolo's involvement with a former Louisiana governor. There
also is the question whether taxpayers will build the 49ers a new
stadium. Then there is the resignation of long-time 49ers official
Carmen Policy.
</P>
<P>
   The results? The 81 points are the most the 49ers have scored in
the first two games of any season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carmen never made a tackle, and that's another difference
between the Falcons and the 49ers,'' Doleman said. ``Everybody here
knows their role, and they concentrate on what they have to do
without worrying about somebody else. It's a matter of pride that
runs all the way down to the person who empties the trash every
day.''
</P>
<P>
   And when that person can block or tackle a little, the 49ers are
even better.

 &HT;    Residents brace for the aftermath of Georges
 &HT;    By Gary Kane
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PLANTATION KEY, Fla. _ Patti Music couldn't bring herself to
look inside her mobile home at Sea Breeze, an oceanfront trailer
park. So, she didn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just put a new floor in a month ago,'' she said, bracing
herself against a mighty gust as she surveyed the damage.
</P>
<P>
   Just hours earlier, Hurricane Georges had muscled a sea surge
that turned the park into a mobile home swampland. Currents of
brown water flowed through front and back yards and submerged the
narrow streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a deck out back. It's gone!'' Music gasped.
</P>
<P>
   Music and her husband, Vince, fled their mobile home when
authorities issued the mandatory evacuation order. They found
refuge at Casa Thorn, a bed-and-breakfast across the highway from
the trailer park.
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided not to evacuate too far this time,'' said Vince
Music. ``During Andrew, we evacuated to South Miami and they
(police) didn't let us back into the keys for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrew took its toll on the Musics' 1972 Ritz Craft mobile home.
Their refrigerator defrosted when the storm knocked out power
lines. Water that leaked from the fridge gradually rotted the
floor. The refrigerator then cracked through the floor.
</P>
<P>
   As Georges seemed to subside by mid-afternoon Thursday, the
couple returned to inspect their property. They stood in pushy
wind, walked about their property, and left without going inside
their trailer.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I went inside, I'd just start nailing things together,''
Vince Music said.
</P>
<P>
   The Musics moved into Sea Breezes about 17 years ago after Vince
retired as a computer operator for a Chicago steel mill. The couple
embraced the keys lifestyle and Vince even began drawing a comic
strip called Conch Crittters for the local weekly newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Musics say they plan to move to Costa Rica, where they
also own a condominium with a view of the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting tired of the Keys,'' Vince Music said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the Central American country is free of hurricanes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, but this year we've been through an earthquake and a
volcano erupted,'' he said.

 &HT;    Irvan puts Pontiac in pole position
 &HT;    By Tom McCollister
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox New Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARTINSVILLE, Va. _ Ernie Irvan put the Ford and Chevrolet camps
on notice Friday that he and his Pontiac will be a handful Sunday,
easily winning the pole for the NAPA AutoCare 500 with a speed of
93.608 miles per hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``The car has been doing everything it's suppose to do,'' said
Irvan of his second pole of the year and 22nd of his career.
``We'll be able to race them real hard Sunday. It's the same
Pontiac we had here last time. There's nothing more I'd like to do
than to win here at Martinsville, but we've yet to get a top
five.''
</P>
<P>
   If Irvan was a minisurprise where few Pontiacs have trod this
year, consider his front row partner, Ricky Rudd, who put a speed
of 93.576 mph on the board. It will be Rudd's best start of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made some pretty good gains late in practice and that put
us up there on the front row,'' Rudd said.``I think if we get our
act together, it's got to happen because we go out and run well.''
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, neither Jeff Gordon nor Mark Martin showed on the
front row. Following a sub-far first lap around the .566-mile oval,
Gordon turned it up, running 93.511 mph, third fastest, to share
the second row with Rich Bickle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew our first lap wasn't going to be good,'' Gordon said.
``After that first lap, we saw some other guys running good on
their first lap, so I knew I'd better make it up on the second one.
It was a great lap, the fastest we've had here in a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin seemed never to get up to speed, settling for the seventh
row, running a poor 92.928 mph.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was an excellent run for what we had to work with,''
Martin said. ``We gave 'em all we had. If they gave us another shot
at it, I don't know if I could do that good again or not. So, we'll
take that and get ready for Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   Overall, this was one of the strangest qualifying sessions of
the year. Bickle failed to make the field at Richmond three weeks
ago; Mike Bliss, a Craftsman Truck circuit regular, starts 25th;
Derrike Cope failed to qualify, as did Jimmy Spencer and Kenny
Irwin.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Earnhardt perhaps put it best after qualifying 32nd.
</P>
<P>
   ``That qualifying lap was just like we had been running in
practice _ sorry. We just ain't going nowhere,'' he said.

 &HT;    Residents unmoved by Georges presence
 &HT;    By Jenny Staletovich
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   KEY WEST _ As the worst of Hurricane Georges assaulted the tip
of this island with a storm surge that sent waves cresting over
streets, Kevin Martine clung to the marker designating the Southern
Most Point and screamed:
</P>
<P>
   ``Because I can!''
</P>
<P>
   The trademark resiliency of the Keys' Conchs showed itself
Friday as Georges pounded the island with driving winds, torrential
rain and pounding waves while residents hunkered down around the
island in houses and businesses.
</P>
<P>
   When the first wave of the storm passed at 11 a.m., islanders
emerged on Duval Street, curious to survey the storm's power.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just so exciting,'' said Donna Dalton, a carpenter
holed up in a Antonia's restaurant with friends. ``It breaks up the
humdrum.''
</P>
<P>
   Dalton, like others staying in restaurants along the street, had
prepared thoroughly for the storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a great feast: filet mignon, lamb chops, mussels and
all the wine you can drink,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Staff and friends at the restaurant kept in touch with a crew
barricaded at Mangoes, where tables became beds, with a two-way
radio. Mangoes' managers Robert Robinson and Rusty Barry said they
stocked up enough food to feed most of Duval Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're one of the few people with a generator so we kind of
have to,'' Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
   During the two-hour lull of the eye, police tried to herd
gawkers back to shelters, but many ignored their warning, as they
did earlier mandatory evacuation orders. All around the island,
they found trees uprooted and utility lines flung across fences and
roads.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we're in the eye now. I've always wanted to be in the
eye,'' said Dustin Shaffer, who moved to the island from Oregon a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
   As the second wave struck with more intense wind and rain, most
fled inside though a few, like Martine, tried to ride the storm
outside. As hurricane winds gusted, some even walked their dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Curry and his four children and former wife tried to stay in
their stilt house with friends, but abandoned it even before the
end of the first wave and fled to the 72-year-old La Concha Hotel,
the tallest building on the island, where dozens found safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``It got a little bit shaky when the window blew out,'' Curry
said.
</P>
<P>
   But even while Curry settled in his family, he insisted he
wanted to return to his house alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to make it,'' he said. ``I don't think my life's
going to be taken.''

DEADLY GEORGES DELIVERS GLANCING BLOW TO FLORIDA 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KIM COBB 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAPLES, Fla. _ Hurricane Georges battered the Florida Keys on
Friday with 105-mile-per hour winds and high water, but spared the
rest of South Florida as it swept into the Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The storm appeared to be aiming its next punch _ possibly Sunday
_ at the coast between Louisiana and the Florida panhandle.
Forecasters worry that the storm may draw strength from the warm
Gulf water, arriving on land as a more deadly Category 3 storm.
</P>
<P>
   Georges, which killed more than 280 people and flattened homes
and crops as it moved across Puerto Rico, Haiti, Cuba and the
Dominican Republic earlier in the week, was kinder to the Keys.
There were no reports of storm-related deaths in Florida. But
preliminary reports indicated that the storm delivered heavy
property damage to some of the Keys.
</P>
<P>
   Monroe County Sheriff's Department spokesman Cindy Peryam warned
late Friday that the extent of the damage had not been tallied.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are just poking our head out of the hole,'' said Peryam at
the Marathon sheriff's department substation. ``It's getting dark,
and we're still under a hurricane watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've sustained some heavy damage, especially in the lower
Keys,'' Peryam said. Miami and the major cities along Florida's
southeast coast suffered little more than downed trees and spotty
power losses.
</P>
<P>
   With fresh memories of Hurricane Andrew's 1992 devastation, many
area residents fled low-lying areas for the safety of public
shelters and aggressively prepared for the storm that ultimately
delivered only a glancing blow.
</P>
<P>
   A hurricane warning remained in effect along Florida's southeast
Gulf Coast until 11 p.m. Friday, but the storm's slight turn back
to the west after leaving the Keys also meant that it was expected
to deliver the coastal communities of Marco Island, Naples and Fort
Myers Beach little more than a slight pummeling by gusting winds.
</P>
<P>
   In the Keys, where the string of tiny islands sits just a few
feet above sea level, connecting U.S. Highway 1 was underwater in
some places. Trees blocked roadways, roofs were blown off and
floodwaters coursed through homes.
</P>
<P>
   A Monroe County Sheriff's deputy reported that the Big Pine Key
area appeared to have taken the brunt of the storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a tale of woe, but I'm not going to let it get me
down,'' said Big Pine Key resident Tom Bryant. He lost everything
in Hurricane Hugo in 1989 when he was living in St. Croix, he said,
and now he'd taken a big hit from Georges.
</P>
<P>
   ``The storm has destroyed my house,'' Bryant said. ``The whole
ground floor has six feet of water because of the storm surge. The
saltwater killed all my coy in the pond. The property had huge
banyan and oak trees. They're all gone, and it's flooded.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he would not leave the house to check out the rest of
the neighborhood until the water subsided.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're asking for danger and death, downed power lines,''
Bryant said. ``I'm here with 17 exotic birds in the kitchen, my
dog, Duke and my two kitties, Daily and Midnight.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant said the wind sounded ``like some kind of monster train
coming through _ wah, wah, wah, wah, wah!''
</P>
<P>
   In Key West, Marc Hightower said the storm woke him rather
abruptly Friday morning, dropping a large tree on the roof over his
bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   Hightower pulled on shorts and sandals and strolled Key West
during the storm, he said, curious to see what it was delivering.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was out all day, cruising and checking it out.''
</P>
<P>
   He captains a boat, he said, and was not frightened by the
storm. He sat down under the shelter of an open-air bar, he said,
and watched the wind blowing across the harbor. It tore off part of
the roof of the Galleon Resort as he watched, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mostly, we have a lot of really huge trees down,'' Hightower
said. ``It's been a long time since we've had a hurricane, so we
have lots of big old trees.''
</P>
<P>
   But he was not the only ``rubbernecker'' wandering about in the
storm, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to get down to the boat and it took me about two
hours because I kept bumping into people,'' Hightower said,
including friends of his who were hoisting a few drinks at the bar
(closed for the storm) where they work.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the old Key West spirit,'' Hightower said.
</P>
<P>
   On the southeast coast of Florida, near Fort Myers, hundreds of
people crowded into shelters Friday even though the storm was not
expected to deliver a heavy blow.
</P>
<P>
   Many were complying with earlier ordered evacuations from mobile
homes, others simply lived in flood-prone areas and didn't want to
risk the high water.

and he was interested in me as a person, not just as a patient.''

prostatectomy - is the most common treatment for early-stage

radiation, either external beam radiation or radioactive ``seeds''
implanted directly in the gland. (Hearst News Service Photo)

diagnosed with prostate cancer six years ago. He opted to have
brachytherapy or seed implant treatment. This is when tiny

NINE DOMINICAN STOWAWAYS ARE FOUND IN CHINESE SHIP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Dominican Republic)  (lb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELIZABETH, N.J. _ The police and customs inspectors on Friday
captured nine stowaways from the Dominican Republic who had spent
five days on rough seas in the hull of a Chinese container ship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apparently they were surviving on candy bars, cookies and bags
of water,'' said John Leyden, a regional director of passengers and
enforcement for the U.S. Customs Service. ``They were living in the
crevices between empty containers.''
</P>
<P>
   While the ship was at Port Newark, six of the stowaways
scrambled from the ship's hold at 8 a.m. when crew members opened
the hatches to load the empty containers, and four of the six tried
to escape by jumping as much as 60 feet down from the ship's deck
into Newark Bay, said Lt. Erich Herkloz of the New Jersey State
Police Marine Unit.
</P>
<P>
   The three remaining stowaways were found hiding inside the
vessel, which is named the Li Bai, Herkloz said.
</P>
<P>
   Leyden said three of the men were treated for dehydration, while
the rest were immediately turned over to immigration officials. The
stowaways, who were in their late teens or early 20s, will probably
be deported, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The captain and 35-member crew of the Li Bai were apparently
unaware of the stowaways' presence, Leyden said.
</P>
<P>
   The Li Bai, owned by Chinese-Polish Stock Shipping Co., was
picking up empty cargo containers, and the crew planned to reload
at Port Newark, a spokeswoman for Cosco North America Inc., the
company leasing the ship, told The Associated Press. The vessel,
which could hold 300 cargo containers, stopped in Venezuela before
going to the Dominican Republic, the authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Often stowaways from South America and the Caribbean are found
to be transporting cocaine, Leyden said, but no drugs were found in
this case. ``Some of them have family members in the metropolitan
area, so it seems obvious they were trying to enter the country
illegally to start new lives,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Leyden said the customs employees who helped apprehend the
stowaways were inspectors on hand for a routine check of the ship.
</P>
<P>
   Herkloz said that none of the men who jumped from the ship's
deck were injured. ``They were cold,'' he said.

USC HAS AN EYE ON THE WEATHER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ USC appears to be dodging Hurricane Georges,
which means the Trojans only have to worry about Florida State.
</P>
<P>
   Or so said the latest report in the topsy-turvy world of
hurricane forecasting, which had Georges skipping today's game but
probably tossing a substantial rainstorm toward Doak Campbell
Stadium this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The most reliable forecast offered a 70 percent chance of
thunderstorms, although no one could rule out the chance the
hurricane might make an unpredictable turn east back toward
Tallahassee.
</P>
<P>
   Amid these conditions better suited for a meteorologist, USC has
arrived with one eye on the weather and the other on the Seminoles.
And fully aware that one local team already had its game canceled
because of hurricane fears.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what happened with UCLA, with Bob Toledo being
interviewed about feeling relieved, our guys feel that (UCLA's)
game was canceled because there was a problem,'' USC coach Paul
Hackett said. ``Ours is not called off because there is not a
problem. I feel like the state of Florida deals with these things.
If they call it off, it's for a good reason. If they don't, it's
going to be a rainy day.''
</P>
<P>
   The state had not made any announcements about canceling the
game Friday night, leaving Hackett more concerned about playing in
inclement conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very unpredictable. The only thing I would hate is if the
weather is so out of whack, the teams can't show what they can
do,'' Hackett said. ``We should be fine. I think this is really
good for us to play in.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to go up north (later in the year). It makes us a
better football team. You've got to find out about this. It will
help answer questions, like `Do we have a mudder runner?'''
</P>
<P>
   Translation: A tailback who can trudge through a muddy field.
Truth be told, it's a question the Trojans would prefer to answer
later in the season.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett is also re-examining his playbook because of the adverse
conditions, expecting to make more decisions today than he has in
any of USC's three previous games, and that's before he even thinks
about Florida State.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really have got to be on the job in terms of orchestrating
the game,'' Hackett said. ``This one's got to be played by ear.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Friday afternoon, Hackett was re-visiting the NCAA
rulebook, checking to make sure that the Trojans had the right-size
cleats for the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we could change cleats,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, teams can only wear {-inch cleats, which is
what the Trojans normally wear.
</P>
<P>
   `We've got the same size they've got,'' he said. ``They don't
have any magic, bionic shoes.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that these issues have been addressed, maybe the Trojans can
concentrate on the Seminoles, who are unbeaten in their past 35
home contests.
</P>
<P>
   ``They made plays in our house last year. Let's hope we can make
plays in their house,'' Hackett said. ``The issue is who's going to
make the play? I think we need to find out where we are.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it's easier to go back to hurricane talk. But seriously,
this is the game USC (3-0) has been waiting for, even though
players were strongly encouraged not to refer to it during the
first three games of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're faster than any team we've faced this season,'' wide
receiver Mike Bastianelli said. ``When you have that speed, it's
hard to match up.''
</P>
<P>
   USC hopes, rain permitting, that it can surprise the Seminoles,
since speedy Chad Morton has replaced the departed Delon Washington
at tailback since the teams played last September.
</P>
<P>
   Florida State (2-1) has its own problems. The Seminoles caused
more worries in Tallahassee than Hurricane Georges, since North
Carolina State's 24-7 upset two weeks ago. It was Florida State's
first loss to an unranked opponent since 1986.
</P>
<P>
   With fan criticism mounting, Seminoles coach Bobby Bowden
basically told upset supporters to buzz off this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure there are a lot of angry people, but to me they are
people who take football too seriously,'' Bowden said. ``There is
more to life than football. Gee whiz, you can't cut your wrists
over a loss.''
</P>
<P>
   Also: Hackett said tight end Antoine Harris, who has practiced
sparingly this week because of a recurring sore ankle, will play.
Center Matt McShane, who has a strained knee ligament, can play in
an emergency. Defensive tackle Darren Collins, who strained a
ligament in his foot, is also available.

BAY STATE TO BEGIN LICENSING FOSTER HOMES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DORIS SUE WONG  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Massachusetts will begin licensing foster homes for the
first time next month, becoming one of the few states to require
that foster parents be literate, have adequate income, and get
yearly training, among other requirements.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Social Services is also cutting the maximum
number of children allowed in a foster home from eight to six.
</P>
<P>
   The heightened requirements of foster parents were driven by the
deaths and alleged abuse of several children in foster homes over
recent years, and are intended to boost the quality of foster care.
But they will also almost certainly diminish even further the
already-dwindling ranks of foster homes, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may weed out some foster homes,'' acknowledged DSS
spokeswoman Lorraine Carli. ``But I think everybody would rather
sacrifice quantity for quality.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, the Legislature ordered DSS to draw up foster
home licensing requirements after the deaths and sexual abuse of
several children in foster care in 1995. They included the
suffocation death of a 3-month-old baby accidentally left in car in
Medway, and the strangulation death a 3-year-old Dorchester boy,
ruled a homicide.
</P>
<P>
   New foster homes will have to comply with the new licensing
requirements &UR;  &LR; beginning Thursday. The state's existing 3,600 foster
homes will be licensed over the next year, as they come up for
their annual evaluations.
</P>
<P>
   While all states require some kind of certification process for
foster parents, Child Welfare League of America officials said the
new Massachusetts rules appear to be more far-reaching than most.
</P>
<P>
   Foster parents will have to demonstrate for the first time that:
</P>
<P>
   _They have sufficient income beyond the $13-$17 a day they are
paid by the state for each foster child. No income guidelines are
specified, and welfare payments will still count as income.
</P>
<P>
   _At least one parent in the home is literate.
</P>
<P>
   _They have a car or other access to transportation, and have a
telephone in the home.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, foster parents will have to provide references
every two years from their employer, their own children's schools,
and three people who can vouch for their character. Until now,
references have only been required from foster parents at the
outset.
</P>
<P>
   Foster parents will also have to pass a physical exam.
</P>
<P>
   Carli said existing foster homes that do not meet the licensing
requirements will not be immediately shut down. Instead, they will
allowed to keep foster children placed with them as long as the
children are deemed safe, but will not get any additional foster
children.
</P>
<P>
   Most foster parents interviewed this week said they believe the
new licensing requirements will professionalize foster care and
improve its image. A few said the new standards are so onerous they
could discourage qualified people from remaining or becoming foster
parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it looks like we are running a tight ship from our end, the
negativity will decrease,'' said Cheryl Haddad of Winchendon, a
foster mother for nine years. ``But is is not going to help with
recruitment.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the new requirements, foster parents will also have to
undergo 10 hours of training each year, in addition to the 30 hours
of training they get now before they are approved.
</P>
<P>
   Some foster parents called it unfair that the licensing apply
only to foster homes willing to take any foster child, but not to
foster parents who care only for their relatives' or neighbor's
children.
</P>
<P>
   DSS will also begin next month limiting the number of young
children who can be in each foster home to no more than two
children under age 24 months and no more than one child under age
one month. Exceptions could be made to keep siblings together.
</P>
<P>
   In January, the agency will reduce the overall number of
children who can be in a foster home. Currently, the maximum is six
foster children and two biological children under age 18. The new
maximum will be four foster children and two biological children.
</P>
<P>
   Critics have been calling for several years on DSS to reduce the
number of children, but state officials had resisted, citing a
shortage of foster homes.
</P>
<P>
   To ease the shortage, DSS has been increasingly relying on
relatives and neighbors to take in children. The state has also
created a number of temporary group residences, called bridge
homes, and plans to contract with private agencies this year to
open and operate 16 foster homes, each with an adult paid to live
there full time to act as a foster parent.
</P>
<P>
   In a number of homes where foster children have died, there were
a large number of children. For example, a Dracut foster home where
a 2-year-old boy drowned in a pool when after being left unattended
briefly in the backyard, had a total of nine children, five of them
foster children.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the new standard, Massachusetts will still allow more
children in foster homes than the maximum of four recommended by
the Child Welfare League of America.
</P>
<P>
   Foster parents seemed divided over the new limits, with some
seeing it as an affront to their parenting skills and saying the
state should decide on a case-by-case basis how many children a
foster home can handle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be personally insulted if they reduce it to four,''
said Haddad. ``I have six foster children and my house runs
great.''
</P>
<P>
   William LaPierre of Haverhill, a foster father for 13 years,
said he believes the new limit is needed, since foster children
scarred by sexual and physical abuse or born drug-addicted require
much more attention than a typical child.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of kids are more damaged than they were a few years
ago,'' said LaPierre.

RAINS SAVE SOUTH TEXAS CITRUS HARVEST DESPITE EARLIER DROUGHT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NELSON ANTOSH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ After a spring and summer of scorching drought, rains
in the Lower Rio Grande Valley of Texas have given the citrus crop
a shot in the arm.
</P>
<P>
   While the heat is likely to mean slightly smaller grapefruit,
the harvest is expected to be at least as big as last year's, and
some in the industry predict a harvest 15 percent larger.
</P>
<P>
   ``It kind of bailed us out in the nick of time,'' said Ray
Prewett, executive vice president of the Texas Citrus Mutual, a
trade group.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is fantastic; it's so beneficial,'' said Dwayne Bair,
president and general manager of the Edinburg Citrus Association, a
cooperative of growers that owns a large packing shed in Edinburg,
a city of 36,000 near the Mexican border.
</P>
<P>
   The National Weather Service office in Brownsville measured 8.62
inches for the first 23 days of September, with rain falling during
12 of those 23 days.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Smith, a grower and owner of a grove care company in
Mission, said he has measured 9 inches of ``nice, sweet rain'' on
his property since Aug. 21.
</P>
<P>
   Up to that point, the entire Valley was turning brown from a
lack of rain that dried up crops ranging from corn to sugar cane.
While there was little growth, the tough citrus trees held onto
fruit set in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were getting pretty desperate, frankly,'' said Bill Weeks,
president of the Texas Produce Association.
</P>
<P>
   The rain flushed the salt produced by irrigation water from the
soil, penetrating deeply, and produced a spurt of growth on
grapefruit and orange trees.
</P>
<P>
   The fruit, which had been growing very slowly until the rains,
has also started to grow. Rain produces more rapid growth than
irrigation water.
</P>
<P>
   ``The size will be all right; you just have to leave them on the
tree a little longer,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Growers in the Valley will harvest about 9.5 million 40-pound
cartons of grapefruit and oranges compared with 8.4 million a year
ago, estimates Bob Thornton, executive vice president of TexaSweet
Citrus Marketing in Mission.
</P>
<P>
   Drought hurt row crops such as cotton and milo much more than
citrus, Thornton said. It will be a good year for grapefruit and
oranges, he said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The harvest is on the verge of starting, with a small quantity
of early ripening Marrs variety oranges picked last Saturday.
Packing sheds would be gearing up to start if the wet soil hadn't
kept harvest crews out of the orchards.
</P>
<P>
   Grapefruit picking won't start until October. Fieldmen who check
orchards for the Edinburg co-op say that some is already passing
the state's requirements on sugar-acid ratio, Bair said.
</P>
<P>
   This year's grapefruit are likely to be one size smaller than
normal, Thornton said, with the bulk of the harvest in the
48-per-carton range instead of the more typical 40 per carton.
Fruit really don't start gaining size until September, so the rains
were timely, he said. The heat of summer always keeps growth slow.
</P>
<P>
   If you let them hang on the tree during the cooler months,
grapefruit continue to increase in size until February, according
to Thornton. They can get as large as 18 per box. The gift fruit
trade typically uses the 40- to 36-per-box range.
</P>
<P>
   This year's fruit is clean-looking and will grade well, he said.
The dry weather held down populations of insects such as the rust
mite and citrus leaf miner. Plus, there was little wind last
spring, he said, during a time that fruit is sensitive to scarring
_ marks on the skin that reduce their value but have no effect on
eating quality.
</P>
<P>
   Weeks questions whether the 15 percent increase over last year
can be attained.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may be looking at a crop comparable with last year, but
that's still good,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The season's first estimate by the federal-state crop reporting
service won't be issued until Oct. 9.
</P>
<P>
   The trees that were planted after the 1989 freeze are maturing
and there should be increased production almost every year, Weeks
said. There is a total of 35,000 acres planted with grapefruit and
oranges in the Valley, a figure that is not expected to increase
because of a glut caused by overplanting in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen packing sheds will be handling citrus, said Weeks, the
same number as last year.
</P>
<P>
   From 8,000 to 8,500 acres of citrus were served by irrigation
districts that ran out of water, Prewett said. They have supplies
now, he said, as the result of rains that boosted water in the
reservoirs from a low of 19 percent of capacity to nearly 34
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The water now in the reservoirs is almost exactly the same
percentage as at this time last year, a sobering thought. ``We are
out of the immediate crisis situation, but we didn't get any
cushion,'' Prewett said.
</P>
<P>
   The rains also have brightened the outlook for fall and winter
vegetables, said Weeks of the produce association. An informal
survey indicates that acres planted in crops such as onions,
cabbage and carrots will be ``pretty much the same as last year,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   During the worst of the drought, predictions were that the
number of acres planted would be cut in half.
</P>
<P>
   Now that there is moisture, some growers are planting less,
while others are planting more, Weeks said. Farmers like to stagger
plantings so that everything doesn't ripen at once, but the recent
rains have made that difficult. ``But they are so happy to get the
rain, they can deal with it.''

BOSTON UNIVERSITY TO GIVE ITS OWN TEST TO TEACHING STUDENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KATE ZERNIKE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Threatened by a state plan that could shut down its
school of education, Boston University is refusing to sponsor any
candidates for the state's teacher test unless they pass a
preliminary test administered by BU first.
</P>
<P>
   The university says it is simply trying to make sure its
students are prepared for the test. But other schools of education
are accusing BU of ``gimmickry'' designed to evade responsibility
and embarrassment as the state plans to close any school where more
than 20 percent of students fail the state test.
</P>
<P>
   Boston University's was among the 42 teacher education schools
with a failure rate of higher than 20 percent during the first two
administrations of the test in April and July.
</P>
<P>
   The results set off an embarrassing public excoriation of those
schools, and prompted state action to tighten standards at schools
of education.
</P>
<P>
   The state Board of Education, led by BU Chancellor John R.
Silber and including BU School of Education dean Edwin J. Delattre,
approved a proposal last week to shut down programs with more than
20 percent of candidates failing in two consecutive years. The
proposal will take effect in 2000. The Department of Education will
decide by Oct. 13 whether schools with high failure rates this year
and next will fall under the requirement, or whether it will apply
only to tests in the two years after 2000.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter sent last week, Delattre told students and recent
graduates that they would have to pass a test Saturday in order to
be sponsored by BU on the third administration of the state teacher
test Oct.3.
</P>
<P>
   Delattre's letter asks those who don't pass the BU test to not
take the state test. If they do, BU will deny that they attended
the university, the letter said.
</P>
<P>
   Students indicate on the test where they did their teacher
training, and the state then verifies that information with the
schools before releasing the school-by-school scores publicly.
Those students disclaimed by BU will appear as ``unaffiliated'' in
the public results, and therefore would not be counted against the
university when the state calculates what percentage of BU students
failed.
</P>
<P>
   Other deans said the school is trying to create a loophole to
avoid the tough new state standards. The BU action creates the
impression, they said, that the goal of reform is to keep schools
open, not to train teachers better.
</P>
<P>
   ``This makes the whole process of evaluating competence appear
to be gimmickry,'' said Mary Brabeck, dean of the education school
at Boston College, where 78 percent of the 151 students who took
the state tests in April and July passed. ``If the goal is for BU
to have 100 percent pass, they can manipulate things so that will
happen. If the goal is to prepare the most well-trained students
for teaching, then this conversation shouldn't even be taking
place.''
</P>
<P>
   State education officials, while they reserved public comment,
also questioned whether the BU action is true to the spirit of the
reform, which was intended to improve teacher education programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the point of the policy was to try to limit the
number of kids,'' one said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
``It was to make sure that everyone was well prepared to be a
teacher.''
</P>
<P>
   Statewide, 59 percent of students failed the test given in
April, and 47 percent the test given in July. In April, 34.3
percent of BU students failed the test, and 28 percent did in July.
Only the Harvard Graduate School of Education and Wellesley College
had more than 80 percent of their students pass each time.
</P>
<P>
   The BU test Saturday is based on sample state test questions
given on the state Department of Education's Web site. It includes
only reading and writing; the state test also includes exams in
specialty areas.
</P>
<P>
   Delattre, because as a board member he knows what questions will
be on the actual test, said he recused himself from preparing the
test BU will give Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Delattre said BU is giving the test to prepare students, but
also to see whether it could be a reliable way to screen transfer
students, who performed poorly on the two state tests and one
reading test given by BU this fall.
</P>
<P>
   He also shot down suggestions that BU is merely trying to ensure
an 80 percent passing rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want the state to have everybody denying their own
students to get 80 percent,'' he said. ``We don't want to do that
ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The Commonwealth Education Deans Council, a group of education
deans, said it does not know of any other school that plans to
disclaim students. Brabeck suggested that BU should be tightening
whom it admits in the first place, rather than allowing students to
pay tuition and attend school, only to be denied the right to take
the state test as a BU student.

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, Sept. 27, will move Saturday in the `a' category. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MORAL-REVIEW _ President Clinton's admitted immoral behavior has
thrust to the forefront a fundamental question about the meaning of
the American presidency: Should the president be a moral leader?
And if so, what is a moral leader? Contrasting themselves with
Clinton, candidates around the country are declaring that they are
virtue personified. They are emphasizing their families and the
values by which they live. They are making the point, in essence,
that moral leaders are role models. By Richard L. Berke. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   INTERNET-REGULATE-REVIEW _ Governments have long grappled with
how, if at all, they should regulate the global flow of images and
information over the Internet, seeking to balance concerns about
free speech, for example, with those about pornography. But only
recently have policy makers in Washington, in state capitals and
around the world begun to confront the economic implications of a
new retail marketplace that recognizes no political or geographical
boundaries. The issues are sweeping. Where does a transaction take
place when buyer and seller can be defined to be in multiple
locations? Will the borderless nature of the Internet force
governments further down a road that has already led them to drop
trade barriers, harmonize tax policies and form currency unions? By
Richard W. Stevenson. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SEX-DEFINE-REVIEW _ In his legal defenses, President Clinton has
tried to distinguish between ``sexual relations'' and oral sex.
That isn't a distinction most Americans might make, and it
certainly isn't one the Bible focuses on in defining sexual sin.
The Bible does single out adultery for special attention in the 10
Commandments _ but defines it in a way that might surprise many
people. Most Americans would probably say that regardless of what
happened between Monica Lewinsky and the president, he committed
adultery, which they understand to mean breaking the marital vows.
By Gustav Niebuhr. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-ENABLERS-REVIEW _ A nation of Clinton Enablers?'' a
headline in The New York Post queried. ``We have all been enablers
for Bill Clinton,'' declared Time magazine. Last week, an editorial
in this newspaper spoke of Clinton's ``documentably dysfunctional
personality'' and warned that ``we must not become a nation of
enablers.'' In a recent speech, the television evangelist (and
sometime Clinton counselor) Robert Schuller asserted that ``we all
share part of the shame'' for stubbornly high public approval
ratings that have enabled Clinton so far to avoid confronting the
problem of his sexual behavior. By Joe Sharkey. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-PUNISH-REVIEW _ By now, virtually no one in the capital
contends that President Clinton shouldn't be punished for his
deceptions in the Lewinsky affair. But what to call the punishment?
By Todd S. Purdum. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SCHOOL-SAFETY-REVIEW _ The American classroom today echoes with
dire warnings about dangers and evils that seemingly lurk
everywhere, from marijuana peddlers to child molesters. The old
notion of sticking to basic education, in the view of some safety
advocates, belongs in a dreamily outdated age of innocent, white
picket-fence childhoods. What good are the three Rs, after all, to
a child trapped in the trunk of an abductor's car, a scenario
actually discussed in some child safety programs around the nation.
By Dirk Johnson. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   KURDS-REVIEW _ The Kurdistan Workers' Party, which is fighting
to create a Kurdish homeland in southeastern Turkey, has offered a
cease-fire. The party leader, Abdullah Ocalan, said his forces
would not attack Turkish troops as long as troops did not attack
them. Ocalan's offer, like at least three others he has made in
recent years, fell on deaf ears. The Turkish military, which does
not take orders from civilians, refused to budge from its long-held
view that negotiating with ``separatist terrorists'' is
unthinkable. By Stephen Kinzer. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   EXERCISE-REVIEW (Undated) _ Exercise requires metabolism, and
metabolism generates free radicals, those harmful reactive
chemicals that vitamin pills and other supplements are said to
combat. The notion that vigorous sports may actually be bad for you
is hardly new or illogical. Every tale of a former football player
with brain damage or bad knees can reinforce a popular notion that
a life committed to strenuous athletics carries bodily stress to
unhealthy levels. But there is no evidence that exercise in itself
reduces life span. By Nicholas Wade. &QL;

SOSA'S 66TH MATCHED BY MCGWIRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ For a guy who essentially conceded the race five days
ago, Sammy Sosa is still doing a pretty good impression of a home
run king.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs slugger temporarily seized the 1998 lead and all-time
record when he hit his 66th homer Friday night. But typical of this
historic duel that has evolved into a game of leapfrog, he soon had
company. Later in the evening, at St. Louis, Mark McGwire _ whom
Sosa had declared the likely champion Tuesday when he trailed the
Cardinals slugger by two and was in an 0-for-21 slump _ responded
with his 66th.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa did his damage in the fourth inning at the expense of the
playoff-bound Houston Astros. He slammed an 0-1 pitch thrown by
fellow Dominican Jose Lima, a close friend, into the
left-center-field seats. Sosa made it look easy, and it probably
was. He now has four home runs against Houston, three off Lima.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 23, Lima gave up two home runs to Sosa in one game at
Wrigley Field. The other was at the Astrodome Aug. 16 off Sean
Bergman, a solo shot.
</P>
<P>
   A sellout crowd was on hand despite the fact that Houston had
long since wrapped up the National League Central title. They
simply could not resist the lure of Sosa and a race that has been
give-and-take for months.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, it was suggested that Lima might groove a pitch
to his old friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are friends,'' said Sosa. ``But not on the ball field.''
</P>
<P>
   In his pregame session, Sosa had more than home runs on his
mind. After all, the Cubs were locked in a battle for the NL wild
card with the Mets, with whom they were tied entering the night,
and the Giants, who trailed by a game. Two days after tying McGwire
with Nos. 64 and No. 65 in Milwaukee, he entertained a new herd of
media who invaded Texas on a football Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa used the forum to plead for financial assistance for
victims of Hurricane Georges, which has ravaged Puerto Rico, Cuba,
and the Dominican. Sosa gave more than lip service to the cause. In
conjunction with the Cubs, he announced that donations would be
accepted for the Sammy Sosa Charity Foundation to help sponsor a
relief effort. Additionally, he announced that if he was able to
gain possession of home run ball No. 62, with which he became the
second man to break Roger Maris's 37-year-old season record, he
would put it up for auction, with all the proceeds going to the
hurricane victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president of the Dominican Republic called me and told me
how bad things were,'' said Sosa. ``Then he said, `I know you have
to go out and play the game. Don't worry about it. We're going to
take care of things here.'
</P>
<P>
   ``He was right. This is my job. I'm here regardless of what
happens. The only way it can better is that I make something
happen. I almost feel bad that I had to come here and do it in the
other team's park. But all I do is try to get the job done.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday night's home run came almost on cue. Most of the fans
were not in their seats when Sosa came to the plate in the first
inning, and he popped out. But by the fourth, everybody was settled
in quite nicely. They seemed to know what was coming.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Sosa was back in a groove.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just relaxed,'' he said. ``I said to myself that I was in a
tight situation. My teammates, they need me. If it happens, it's
going to happen for Mark or myself. I'm not thinking about a win.
I'm thinking about making it to the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa relaxed his way. He went to the Cubs' video room and
watched himself on tape for an hour. It paid off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had been swinging at too many bad pitches,'' he said. ``I
wanted to know what I was doing wrong. I was trying to find my good
mechanics, my swing, what I've been doing with my feet. I found out
from watching the video what I was doing wrong.''

A HAPPY HOMER CHASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ The best moment came at 8:37 p.m. CST when both
Sammy Sosa and Mark McGwire were standing in their respective
batter's boxes at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Sammy had already homered in Houston, to take a 66-65 lead. But
now McGwire, trailing in the Great Home Run Chase for all of 45
minutes, launched his 66th into the left-field lower deck at Busch
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   It is never going to get better than this, sports fans. The
greatest baseball season of them all is winding down in
near-perfect fashion. Two days remain _ maybe three for Sammy's
contending Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   There was some thought Friday night that McGwire might be done
hitting homers in 1998. He'd cranked No. 65 in Milwaukee Sunday,
then was robbed of No. 66 by a bad umpiring decision. When he spoke
with the media before Friday night's game against the Montreal
Expos, he sounded like a man who'd put his bat in the rack for the
winter.
</P>
<P>
   Then Sosa cracked No. 66 in the fourth inning in the Astrodome.
</P>
<P>
   Big Mac didn't stay second for long.
</P>
<P>
   It was the sixth inning in Houston and the fifth in St. Louis
when McGwire came up for his third plate appearance of the night,
his first against Expo righthander Shayne Bennett. A split screen
was needed. Both men were at the plate at the same time. Standing
in the press box in St. Louis, you didn't know where to look. Sammy
on TV or Mark live and in color?
</P>
<P>
   Happily, Sosa grounded out before McGwire saw his first pitch.
And Big Mac didn't get cheated. He ripped at Bennett's first serve
and hit it high and far, into the third deck of Busch. Alas, it was
foul, correctly called by third base ump Joe West.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire ran the count to 1-2, then ripped another Bennett pitch,
this one fair, over the wall in left.
</P>
<P>
   There was a scramble in Section 282 and bedlam throughout Busch.
The Great Home Run Chase was tied. Again. But for how long?
</P>
<P>
   McGwire broke his silence before the game. Since homering
Sunday, he'd been communicating only through a pool reporter, but
he agreed to a short press conference at 3:45 p.m. Friday.
</P>
<P>
   He was asked how he would feel about finishing tied with Sosa
and said, ``I think it would be fantastic. But if I'm ahead or he's
ahead, just look at what we've done. People have been saying for 37
years that this (breaking Roger Maris's record of 61 homers)
couldn't be done, and yet two guys have done it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to have fun. I'm not going to go away hanging my
head if Sammy is ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he was asked about Bob Davidson's blown call in Milwaukee _
a gaffe that could change history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I'm happy about it,'' said McGwire. ``It was a
home run, but I respect the ruling.''
</P>
<P>
   Cardinal manager Tony La Russa, attemping to preserve the
integrity of the game, said he would not bat McGwire leadoff to get
him any extra plate appearances.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire walked on a 3-2 pitch on his first trip against righty
Miguel Batista. Cardinal fans put down their cameras (thank
goodness today is a day game and there'll be no flashbulbs) and
booed with gusto when McGwire trotted to first.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire was standing on first in the top of the third, holding a
baserunner, when the big boaad in centerfield posted Sosa's No. 66.
Minutes later, Big Mac returned to the plate and lined deep to left
on an 0-2 pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the dramatic fifth inning in St. Louis. How often does
a man hit a foul home run, then follow it up with a fair one?
Rarely. Almost never. Then again, no one's ever hit 66 home runs in
a season before this year.
</P>
<P>
   Now we have two men, chasing each other, chasing history,
assured of immortality. Perhaps today will be better than Friday
night. And perhaps tomorrow will be better than today. And maybe
Sosa will hit a Bobby Thomson playoff homer Monday to put the Cubs
in the Division Series.
</P>
<P>
   It just keeps getting better. To the finish.

 Tut Aims for King's Ransom  
 By David Einstein  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
Hoping to take advantage of a revived market for initial stock
offerings, Tut Systems plans to go public just as its home
networking technology appears to be taking off.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The small company, based in Pleasant Hill, will announce on
Monday a system to bring high-speed Internet access to apartment
complexes through regular phone lines.
</P>
<P>
   Tut, which filed for its IPO on July 31, said yesterday the
stock could start trading within weeks. According to the prospectus
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Tut wants to
sell 2.5 million shares _ about one-quarter of its total _ for
between $14 and $16 a share.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which was founded in 1991, is not yet profitable,
having lost $8 million last year on sales of $4.5 million. Like
many young technology companies, it has been spending more money
than it makes in an effort to develop products that can gain it a
foothold in the market.
</P>
<P>
   Plans for the offering come as the window for IPOs appears to
have reopened. The online auction company eBay showed earlier this
week that investors are eager for hot new stocks. Its shares nearly
tripled on the first day of trading.
</P>
<P>
   The timing couldn't be better for Tut. In the past two months,
its system for home networking has been embraced by two of the
biggest names in the computing industry, chip giant Intel and
Compaq Computer, the leading maker of PCs. With those companies
behind it, Tut's technology could soon be built into many new PCs.
</P>
<P>
   What may really fire up investor interest, however, is the
system the company has developed for bringing high-speed access to
existing apartment buildings _ a market for which Tut claims to
have the first practical solution.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``Tut's new system leverages our technology to distribute
high-speed Internet access within a multitenant complex,'' said Tut
Systems chief executive Salvatore D'Auria.
</P>
<P>
   The system that Tut will announce Monday consists of a box about
the size of a toaster oven that connects to a high-speed access
line coming into an apartment complex. The box connects to the
central phone system for the complex and provides 1-megabyte data
access to every phone line in every apartment. That's about 20
times as fast as a 56K modem.
</P>
<P>
   Tut's system also makes it possible to use a single phone line
simultaneously for a computer connection and a telephone call,
eliminating the need for separate lines.
</P>
<P>
   To get the high-speed access, users in the apartments must
install a network card in their computers and attach an adapter
that lets the network card connect to a regular phone jack.
</P>
<P>
   Installation of the card and adapter is expected to cost users
around $100, with monthly Internet service running between $35 and
$50 a month. That's roughly on a par with cable modem systems such
as AtHome, which advertises higher speeds, and considerably less
than what phone companies are charging for DSL, which offers
comparable high-speed access. And neither cable modem service nor
DSL is generally available to apartment dwellers because they
involve special wiring.
</P>
<P>
   Tut charges about $5,000 as a base price for its box and related
equipment. It will sell the system directly to an apartment complex
owner, or to an Internet service provider.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tut's system is pretty cool stuff,'' said analyst Jim
Balderston of Zona Research. ``It's relatively simple. You don't
have to hire guys to tear up floors or pull wires through walls.''
</P>
<P>
   With an estimated 34 million apartment dwellers in the United
States, the market for systems such as Tut's could be enormous. Not
only does it promise revenues for Tut, it also is seen as a way for
apartment owners to attract tenants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's going to set us apart from other apartment
communities,'' said Doug Kampillo, director of information for BRE
Properties. BRE has a pilot installation of the Tut system at its
Promontory Point apartment complex in San Ramon. Complexes in San
Rafael and Palo Alto are scheduled to go online within weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone who's tried it seems to love it because they get the
same speed at home that they have at work,'' said Kampillo.
</P>
<P>
   Optimism is running high at Tut, which employs about 100 people.
Said marketing vice president Craig Stouffer: ``If I gave an honest
answer about how I feel about this new system, I'd be in trouble
for hyping the stock.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the company understands that it's in a fiercely
competitive field in which prices drop faster than you can say
shrinking margins. In addition, other networking companies
including Cisco Systems and Ascend Communications can be expected
to jump into Tut's markets, especially if they prove lucrative.
Meanwhile, a range of other vendors are also offering home
networking systems similar to Tut's.

 Video Search Technology Lets Web Users Quickly Find Clips  
 By Jon Swartz  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
Voyeurs who want to watch President Clinton squirm at the mention
of the blue dress don't have to sit through four hours of video
testimony on the Internet.
<TEXT>
<P>
   A San Mateo startup says it has developed the first video search
engine that lets online users type in a phrase or keyword and then
view only the video segments associated with those words.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've done for video what Internet directories have done for
online text searches,'' said Dave Bayliss, a spokesman for Virage.
``You no longer have to painfully watch X minutes of jerky motion
images to get to the good parts.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Virage's first public deployment of its Video Cataloger
technology went up on Tuesday at  &LR; video.altavista.com &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   It contains a search bar where users type in a keyword or
phrase. It then conducts a search over the four-plus hours of
Clinton's grand jury testimony and comes up with a list of video
clips on that topic. Users have a choice of playing one- to
two-minute video clips and/or reading a transcript of that clip.
</P>
<P>
   Without Virage, people had to sit through entire video from
start to finish or watch it on a site that had edited it into
smaller segments.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, many viewers decided to watch Clinton's testimony
last week on TV rather than the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Another benefit of Virage: Users can view snippets of the
document without downloading the entire video, which can clog up
the computer.
</P>
<P>
   The new video-engine technology _ which was developed last year
for corporations to catalog videos internally _ converts real-time
video into data code that can be searched on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   The data code is collected from the Clinton videotape, captured
onto clips and translated into other formats, including HTML.
</P>
<P>
   For the Clinton video, Virage paired the video with a written
transcript obtained from closed-caption TV. Soon, it will add voice
recognition and speaker identification to distinguish between
different voices.
</P>
<P>
   Virage, a 4-year-old privately held company, is licensing its
technology to online news media and other sites that use video.
</P>
<P>
   So far, ABC News, the British Broadcasting Corp., CBS News, CNN
and federal agencies are early licensees of Video Cataloger and are
expected to make it a staple of their Web sites. Several plan on
indexing scores of existing video clips online so consumers can
perform searches, Bayliss said.
</P>
<P>
   ``While everyone was racing to put a bunch of dumb video on
their Web sites, we produced the first intelligent video,'' Bayliss
said. ``We expect use of this technology to become widespread.''
</P>
<P>
   The 60-person company is backed by Adobe Ventures, Sutter Hill
Ventures, Trinity Ventures and others.

 Oddball Coalition Was the Loser in High-Tech H-1B Struggle  
 By Tom Abate  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
When the votes were finally tallied, the high-tech industry had won
a resounding, bipartisan victory in its bid to raise the quota of
foreign temporary workers it could hire under H-1B visas.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The loser in Thursday's lopsided 283-to-133 vote in the House of
Representatives was the odd coalition of liberal, pro-labor
Democrats and conservative, anti-immigration Republicans who had
given the tech lobby its toughest fight in years.
</P>
<P>
   Of the Bay Area's 17 House representatives only three voted
against the H-1B increase: East Bay Democrats Barbara Lee and Pete
Stark, and Windsor Republican Frank Riggs, known for his kiss-my-ax
stand on timber issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``High-tech has been among the selfish and least helpful
corporations in the country,'' Stark said. ``All they've ever done
is come to us and ask for tax breaks and free trade. They're all
take and no give, and (the visa bill) to me is another example of
that.''
</P>
<P>
   The thread uniting these congressional naysayers is that they
represent minority or blue-collar constituents who feel edged out
for the best jobs by skilled foreigners. Visa opponents claim tech
firms would rather hire quickly from abroad than take the time to
train people at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one good thing that came out of this fight is that it
brought blacks together with over-40, white professionals,'' said
John Templeton, an entrepreneur who formed the Coalition for Fair
Employment in Silicon Valley, an ad hoc group that advocates
training and hiring of minorities.
</P>
<P>
   African American activists like Templeton formed one strain of
opposition to the H-1B hike. Indeed, H-1B opponents in the House
staged their last stand around amendments sponsored by
Representative Melvin Watt (D-N.C.) and Representative John Conyers
(D-Mich.), leaders of the Congressional Black Caucus.
</P>
<P>
   Watt and Conyers wanted to force all employers to swear that
they hadn't laid off U.S. workers to hire H-1B employees. After
their amendments were rebuffed, House members piled on to support a
White House-backed version of the bill, which took milder steps to
prevent foreigners from displacing U.S. workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was close to a betrayal of the African American
community,'' said Templeton of the White House's bargain with the
high-tech lobby.
</P>
<P>
   One reason tech execs prevailed in the debate was that early on
they popularized the notion of a huge shortfall of engineers.
Although the study they used was later debunked, the shortage
notion stuck.
</P>
<P>
   The tech lobby also created the impression that H-1B workers
were essential to the booming tech economy _ writing cutting-edge
software or founding the next Intel _ when in fact one-quarter of
these foreign temps are physical therapists and another one-quarter
work in noncomputer fields.
</P>
<P>
   Norman Matloff, the University of California at Davis professor
who has taken up the cause of older high-tech workers, predicted,
``There's going to be a larger and larger pool of angry and bitter
computer professionals'' because of the H-1B vote.
</P>

 &HT;    Panel to release more Starr papers, as Democrats lose
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republicans trotted out of the House Judiciary
Committee's chambers Friday night declaring a newfound comity with
Democrats in the bitter battle over whether to move forward in the
impeachment process aimed at President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Meeting behind closed doors for most of the day, the panel voted
in a series of motions to make public some 60,000 pages of
documents, grand jury testimony and other related evidence turned
over to the committee by independent counsel Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   The material is expected to back up Starr's allegations that
Clinton committed perjury, obstructed justice and abused his
presidential powers to conceal a sexual affair with former White
House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats quickly dismissed the notion that harmony had been
achieved, saying the committee was actually as divided as ever.
</P>
<P>
   The disagreement about the level of partisanship shaped public
statements Friday about the decision to make public the remaining
documents turned over to the panel by Starr earlier this month.
Already, the panel has released the 445-page Starr report, the
president's grand jury testimony and more than 3,000 pages of
depositions, interviews and FBI reports.
</P>
<P>
   The latest batch of evidence is expected to include grand jury
testimony from Linda Tripp, the former White House employee who
revealed to Starr that Lewinsky had a sexual relationship with the
president. The committee vote to release edited versions of these
tapes was unanimous.
</P>
<P>
   Also expected to be released is grand jury testimony from Betty
Currie, the president's personal secretary, who was aware of
Lewinsky's visits. Testimony from Vernon Jordan, the president's
friend and confidant, also will be included in the latest release.
Jordan helped arrange a job for Lewinsky after the affair sputtered
to a close, but the job fell through when the firestorm over the
affair began.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to release additional documents was a foregone
conclusion, but Democrats on the panel tried unsuccessfully to
prevent it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, Democrats said that they believed the public has had
too much of the lurid details of this investigation, and voted to
stop the release of all of this grand jury material,'' said
Michigan Democratic Rep. John Conyers, the ranking member of the
committee, after the daylong debate.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Republican Bob Barr had a different view.
</P>
<P>
   While the debate was contentious, Barr said, it was civil and
successful in that the material will be released and the public can
judge for itself whether the president committed impeachable
crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a good day,'' agreed Rep. Steve Buyer (R-Ind.),
echoing his Republican peers on the committee and pointing to
bipartisan vote tallies as evidence.
</P>
<P>
   But before a gaggle of television cameras, Rep. Barney Frank
(D-Mass.) quickly disagreed with Buyer and Barr's assessment.
</P>
<P>
   Frank pointed out that the Republicans, led by Barr, voted down
a Democratic proposition to require Starr to release more
information outlining how Tripp taped telephone conversations with
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is whether Starr wired Tripp to tape her conversations
with Lewinsky before U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno approved
expanding his probe into the Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
   But Buyer argued that the committee's Democrats were the ones
who were trying to keep information out of the public domain.
</P>
<P>
   The material is expected to be made public next Thursday, when
the committee also plans to hear its own lawyers present Starr's
evidence of potentially impeachable offenses.
</P>
<P>
   The committee is expected to vote by the end of next week on
whether to launch a formal impeachment inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   That will be followed by a House vote on the inquiry, probably
on Oct. 5 or 6.
</P>
<P>
   Even Democrats say there is nothing they can do to stop the
``impeachment train.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House continued to mount its campaign against
impeachment, emphasizing polls that showed Clinton's popularity
rising after his videotaped grand jury testimony on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton himself accused the GOP of placing ``partisanship over
progress, politics over people.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats such as Martin Meehan (D-Mass.) said that the
Republicans were clearly trying to drag out the impeachment process
to engage in a ``mud fight'' that would improve their chances of
taking over the White House in 2000.

<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.) scoffed at such
notions, saying Clinton's remarks amounted to ``a gratuitous
slap.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing our work,'' said Lott. ``Maybe he just hasn't
noticed. ... What he's trying to do is distract attention from his
problems.''

THE NAME'S MAVROVIC, AND HE'S OUT TO STOP LEWIS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn.)  (lb) 
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNCASVILLE, Conn. _ It is not easy being Zeljko Mavrovic. He has
been virtually ignored as he prepares to take on Lennox Lewis, the
World Boxing Council heavyweight champion, in a title bout Saturday
night and his name is mangled so much that he simply wants to be
referred to as ``Zed.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis calls him ``Magnovich,'' which is not remotely close to
the correct pronunciation and is said with a hint of derision. When
Mavrovic held his first telephone news conference with reporters in
New York last month to announce his bout with Lewis on Saturday
night, he introduced himself and one of the reporters in the room
shouted, ``How do we know it's you?''
</P>
<P>
   But if Mavrovic (pronounced mahv-RO-vitch) can upset Lewis
inside the big white tent that has been set up outside the Mohegan
Sun Casino, a lot of people will have to become familiar with his
name. That includes Evander Holyfield, the International Boxing
Federation and World Boxing Association heavyweight champion, who
has referred to Mavrovic as ``Maverick.''
</P>
<P>
   Mavrovic, who is from Croatia, takes his low profile in America
in stride.
</P>
<P>
   ``What can I say?'' he said. ``If you talk about me in Europe,
they know me. I have been three years European champion. Anybody
who knows and likes boxing knows about me. In the United States it
is a different story. Not many people know about me, because I
haven't had many fights in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Mavrovic has fought three times in the United States against
opponents with less name recognition than he has. His bout against
Lewis, which will be broadcast on HBO as part of its Championship
Boxing Series at 10 p.m., will give him more exposure than he has
ever had.
</P>
<P>
   Mavrovic, 27, looks like a punk rocker with his dirty-blond
mohawk haircut, which he says is a result of a barbering mistake by
his girlfriend, Jelena Balabanic. Balabanic also dabbles in
astrology and does not believe the stars are in the proper
alignment for Mavrovic, an Aquarius, to do his best on Saturday
night. But she is withholding any more bad news until the bout is
over.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, who weighed in at 243 pounds Friday, believes Mavrovic
will be in survival mode when the bout gets under way. But Mavrovic
is more confident than that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm too quick for him; so, so quick,'' Mavrovic said. ``I have
a big right hand, too. I can knock people out with my right hand.''
He added: ``Lennox Lewis is not someone who can take a lot of
punches. If you punch him in the right place at the right time, he
will go down. I saw that in Atlantic City.''
</P>
<P>
   Mavrovic was at ringside for Lewis' last fight, against Shannon
Briggs in March, a bout in which Lewis was rocked in the first
round by Briggs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lennox Lewis is a great talent,'' Mavrovic said. ``But what I
saw in that fight was that he didn't have good preparation and
motivation.''
</P>
<P>
   Mavrovic, who weighed in at 214 1/4 pounds (his lightest in
three years), has been preparing for this bout against Lewis for 11
months, because that is when he found out that he was the WBC's No.
1 contender. The bout kept being postponed, and Mavrovic kept
training in Croatia. He has also been on a macrobiotic diet, which
includes no meat. It has resulted in him being 10 pounds lighter
than he has been in his six previous fights.

HAMPTON MAY UPSTAGE WILLIAMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   All the hoopla will surround Doug Williams, the coach with the
National Football League background, Super Bowl ring and legacy to
follow. But at the conclusion of the 28th annual New York Urban
League Football Classic on Saturday, coach Joe Taylor and his
Hampton University Pirates are very likely to be the ones in the
spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton, the defending black college national champion, is
favored to defeat Grambling State University in the 5 p.m. game at
Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J. Even Williams, Grambling's
first-year coach, admits that his Tigers (1-1) are probably
overmatched.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I was blessed with 6-foot-6, 320-pound offensive
linemen like coach Taylor is,'' said Williams, who has replaced the
legendary Eddie Robinson, the winningest coach in college football
history. ``We're going to get there, though. We're not coming to
the Meadowlands just to lay down, but it would be a pleasure just
to go into overtime with Hampton and lose if that's the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Grambling, which has played in all but three of the Classics, is
billing this season as the ``Dawn of a New Era.'' Williams, who
starred at Grambling from 1974-1977 and went on to lead the
Washington Redskins to victory in the 1989 Super Bowl, is the first
coach besides Robinson to lead the Tigers since 1940. He has
replaced Robinson's historic wing-T offense with a multiple pro set
and substituted the traditional black and gold for the Tigers' red
and multicolored uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will always give coach Robinson his props,'' Williams said.
``But at the same time, it's time to move on to the future. Let the
Doug Williams era begin.''
</P>
<P>
   While it may be Williams' time at Grambling, it is Taylor's time
in black college football. His Pirates (3-0) are dominant, having
won 78 percent of their games since he took over seven years ago.
In just their fourth year after moving up to Division I-AA in the
NCAA, they are ranked fifth in the nation and first in the Sheridan
Broadcasting Network's ranking of historically black colleges.
Taylor, last season's SBN coach of the year, has a record of
117-44-4.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who reveres Robinson, says he looks up to Taylor as
well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hoping to have just half the amount of success that coach
Taylor has had,'' Williams said.

LAWYER'S JOB AND SEX ACTS ARE MATTERS OF DEFINITION 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVID MARGOLICK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a cascade of contrition, President Clinton has almost
greedily accepted responsibility for his present predicament. But
when blame for the Monica Lewinsky matter is apportioned, the
finger-pointing goes in another direction: toward Clinton's
lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Privilege shrouds all discussions between the president and his
legal counsel, making it impossible to know who said what to whom
and whether Clinton has received bad advice or has refused to
follow good advice. But authorities on legal ethics and culture _
that is, lawyers who monitor other lawyers _ say the president's
problems stem in part from systemic weaknesses in the legal
profession, a profession ill-equipped to represent extraordinary
clients or to take the national interest into account.
</P>
<P>
   These weaknesses, some experts say, are both as timeless as the
inherent tension between lawyers and powerful clients and as new as
the deterioration in the training lawyers now receive.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows whether Clinton was initially any more candid with
his lawyers, notably Robert Bennett and David Kendall, than he was
with his closest associates, his Cabinet or his family. But what
legal experts do argue is that by training and temperament, lawyers
don't always press their clients for the truth or try to learn the
truth themselves.
</P>
<P>
   That has always been the case. But to some experts, the
president's highly legalistic defense, using a tortured definition
of sex that has earned him great ridicule, could be related to
something new: the training elite lawyers are now likely to get,
which can blind them to what matters most.
</P>
<P>
   While the best and brightest have always marched off to Wall
Street-style law firms, the firms themselves have changed, largely
as result of a vastly more competitive marketplace. Increasingly
profit-oriented, less likely to have long-term counseling relations
with loyal clients, less concerned with inculcating values into
young associates, these firms seem to be producing lawyers who are
more parochial, with dulled ethical and political instincts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lawyering business really has kind of shrunk from a
profession of general counselors and advisers to the notion of a
very narrow technical specialty in which what the lawyer does is
simply advise on the available legal strategy,'' said Robert
Gordon, a legal historian at Yale Law School. As a result, Gordon
said, lawyers are more likely to focus on minutiae than on the
larger issues usually involved in highly charged political cases.
``You get very little sense from Bennett or Kendall that what is at
issue is a president, his capacity to govern, his place in
history,'' Gordon said.
</P>
<P>
   To William Simon of Stanford Law School, the very lack of
perspective for which Clinton's lawyers have often been faulted
applies in even stronger measure to the unrelenting Whitewater
independent counsel, Kenneth Starr. ``When you put lawyers in
charge of a moral crusade, you risk that they'll handle it without
any sense of proportionality, largely because it's not part of
their makeup,'' he said. ``We try to teach lawyers to make value
judgments, to weigh principles, but the professional culture of
technicality and literalism is even stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   Legally speaking, it was Paula Jones who begat Monica Lewinsky;
perhaps the most fateful decision by Clinton and his lawyers was
not to settle Mrs. Jones' sexual harassment suit out of court.
Strictly as a legal proposition, her case was extremely weak, and
sure enough, Bennett's elaborate, powerful arguments persuaded a
federal judge (a Republican) to throw it out. (Even had it gone to
trial, they were confident that it could be disposed of in a week
or two.)
</P>
<P>
   But in the unique context of presidential politics, what
mattered most was less the merits of Mrs. Jones' case against
Clinton than what her lawyers learned about Clinton along the way.
Bennett's approach, like that of many lawyers, reflected great
faith in precedent, logic and the primacy of winning in court _
safe assumptions in many cases but not necessarily in so
politically charged a suit. That Clinton's lawyers have recently
resumed settlement talks with the Jones lawyers only underscores
this initial mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``Legal education and legal culture make victory in court the
only victory,'' said Stephen Gillers of New York University Law
School. ``But the Jones case was only partly about what will happen
in court, and mostly about the survival and reputation of the
president. So it became dangerous to let lawyers control the
progress of the case. People unencumbered by legal training and
experience might have chosen differently.''

<P>

</P>
<P>
   In his new, posthumously published memoir, ``Lawyer: A Life of
Counsel and Controversy'' (Public Affairs, 1998), Arthur Liman
makes a similar criticism of Starr, comparing him to other
prosecutors who have wrongly ``tried to make criminal cases out of
political offenses.'' Liman himself, however, was faulted as being
overly legalistic in the Iran-Contra hearings, letting Oliver North
outflank him in the court of public opinion.
</P>
<P>
   That clients lie to their lawyers is nothing new. ``The first
reaction of every white-collar client is not to tell the whole
truth and nothing but the truth,'' said Kenneth Mann, a law
professor at Tel Aviv University and the author of a study on
American lawyers who represent white-collar criminal defendants.
And lawyers are not ethically bound to ferret those lies out. ``I
never ask a client whether he did it or not,'' Alan Dershowitz of
Harvard Law School once told Charlie Rose. ``I don't want the
client to feel that he has to start his relationship with me by
lying.''
</P>
<P>
   While the American Bar Association has condemned the practice of
avoiding knowledge, no lawyer has ever been sanctioned for doing
so. But what is ethically tolerable is not always tactically wise.
``About half of the practice of a decent lawyer is telling would-be
clients they are damned fools and should stop,'' Elihu Root, a
prominent New York lawyer who went on to become secretary of state,
once said.
</P>
<P>
   The Linda Tripp tapes, the questions from the Jones lawyers, the
White House phone logs and Secret Service documents as well as
Clinton's own past evasiveness and hair-splitting on topics like
sex, the draft and drug use _ the president is, after all, a
graduate of Yale Law School and a former law professor _ were all
tip-offs that the president's denials about Ms. Lewinsky were
implausible. The question is whether Bennett and Kendall pushed
Clinton aggressively enough to change his answers before the issue
of perjury arose.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lawyers too often submit to demanding and powerful clients,''
said Gillers, who examines Clinton's counsel in the coming issue of
The American Lawyer. ``To call the president a fool or to tell him
he's acting like an ass is no easy thing. But it's precisely when
you represent a president that you have to be tough and blunt and
shake him up a bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone agrees that Clinton's lawyers _ or today's crop of
lawyers _ are deficient. Leonard Garment, former counsel for
President Richard Nixon, says that Clinton's improved fortunes in
the polls in the last few days reflects that his lawyers have
pulled off the impossible: maintaining his political viability
while limiting his legal liability.
</P>
<P>
   Monroe Freedman of Hofstra Law School, a pioneer in the field of
legal ethics, said Clinton's high-caliber counsel probably pushed
him as far as they could. Nor, he said, were contemporary lawyers
necessarily any less public-spirited and worldly, or yesterday's
lawyers any more enlightened, as Gordon contends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can he think that the lawyers who represented the robber
barons were not pulling hypertechnical stuff?'' Freedman asked.

CONVICTION IS DISMISSED IN A RECANTED CASE OF SEX ABUSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW CITY, N.Y. _ Six months after a young woman recanted graphic
sex-abuse accusations against her father, a judge threw out the
father's conviction Friday and said it was unlikely that a retrial
would succeed.
</P>
<P>
   Although prosecutors held out the possibility of an appeal, they
too said that a retrial itself was ``highly unlikely.'' Thus
Friday's decision begins to draw the curtain on a four-year-long
ordeal for Joseph Hoehmann, a 38-year-old building contractor.
</P>
<P>
   Hoehmann was forced out of his home by the abuse charges, and
his troubles deepened when his infant daughter later died in a fire
_ a death Hoehmann believes might not have happened if he had still
been at home.
</P>
<P>
   Absorbing the news at the apartment of Stacey Hoehmann, the
20-year-old daughter who accused him at a 1996 trial and then
reversed herself last March, Hoehmann said Friday that he was still
worried that prosecutorial zeal might make it difficult for him to
resume his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``When do we put the brakes on and say, `Hey, this is a
malicious prosecution'? '' he said. ``Let everyone live their lives
and get on with their lives. If only these people would get their
minds out of the gutter and let the family be.''
</P>
<P>
   The case began in January 1995 when Ms. Hoehmann, who had been
bridling for years under her father's discipline, began telling
friends that he had molested her on three occasions, starting when
she was 14 years old. In October 1996, Hoehmann was convicted at a
non-jury trial by Clarkstown Town Justice Victor Alfieri Jr. of
third-degree sexual abuse and endangering the welfare of a child.
</P>
<P>
   While she was the only eyewitness to the supposed abuse, Alfieri
repeatedly said he found her accusations sincere and credible. That
feeling may have been strengthened when Ms. Hoehmann, at her
father's sentencing, made an angry speech, telling her father,
``You're burning in hell for what you did.'' Hoehmann was freed on
bail, but has been spending every day since under the cloud of a
one-year jail sentence and an even more painful stigma. He has been
unable to find steady work.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1998, Ms. Hoehmann wrote a startling letter to the
judge saying that she had lied. Prosecutors shot back at a July
hearing that she was repudiating her testimony to get back with her
family and had even told two friends the recantation was a lie.
</P>
<P>
   But Alfieri signaled his inclination to overturn the conviction
by lifting an order of protection, enabling father and daughter to
reunite for the first time in four years. On Friday, he threw out
his own finding of guilty because he said he found her recantation
as credible as her original accusations had been.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He said that Stacey understood that by recanting, ``she is in
fact accepting the responsibility and blame for her sister's
death'' _ a 15-month-old sister killed in an electrical fire while
the father was barred from his own home _ and the breakup of her
family. He was also persuaded by her willingness to recant knowing
that, in theory, criminal charges of perjury could be filed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may very well be the case that Stacey has purchased the
companionship of her family with perjured recantation testimony,''
the judge wrote in a 29-page decision. ``If this is so, the
defendant has made a fool's bargain.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge explained that even if the recantation is a lie Stacey
``may always be an outcast'' in the family.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, Ms. Hoehmann, who manages a coffee
shop at the Palisades Center mall and studies at St. Thomas Aquinas
College in Sparkill, said that her family had ``accepted me back.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are still things that need to be worked out, but we're
pretty much there,'' she said.

COLISEUM DISPUTE FORCES GAME CANCELLATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOHN T. McQUISTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINEOLA, N.Y. _ Legal skirmishing over the structural safety of
the Nassau Coliseum forced cancellation of Friday night's scheduled
exhibition game between the New York Islanders and the New Jersey
Devils.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just not going to get this matter resolved by game
time,'' said state Supreme Court Justice Burton Joseph at the end
of a frustrating day-long hearing on safety issues at the
26-year-old arena.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before 7:30 p.m., the judge adjourned the hearing until
Monday morning, and ordered the lawyers involved in the dispute not
to discuss the matter over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're under a gag order not to say anything,'' said Gary
Bettman, commissioner of the National Hockey League. ``But I'm
hopeful we've taken a step in the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Bettman said the Islanders remained under a temporary
restraining order issued by Joseph a week ago, barring the team
from playing any scheduled home games anywhere but the Coliseum.
The next scheduled game is with the Washington Capitals on Oct. 4.
</P>
<P>
   The owners of the Islanders claim that the cement and steel
reinforced trusses that hold up the Coliseum are cracked, that the
scoreboard that hangs over center ice was held in place by a
defective hoist and that the roof was leaking, creating safety
hazards.
</P>
<P>
   Nassau County, which owns the arena, contends the arena is safe
and that the owners of the Islanders, who bought the team in
February, are using the safety issue as a ruse to break their
long-term contract with the county and SMG, a group that manages
the Coliseum for the county.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph, in an effort to resolve the dispute, gained the help of
Bettman and his aides during a hearing on Wednesday in which they
appointed a team of engineers and assigned them the task of
inspecting the Coliseum. However, the engineers and lawyers
returned to court on Thursday and again early Friday morning,
complaining to the judge that they could not agree on what items to
inspect.
</P>
<P>
   Bettman told the judge he needed at least another day and a half
for his engineers to complete the job, but the county resisted the
move, claiming its engineers and appropriate county regulatory
officials had already approved the safety of the Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   The judge attempted to limit the inspections to four items _ the
scoreboard support system, the truss supports, the arena's cement
bleachers and the external walls of the Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Ortego, a lawyer representing the county, argued that the
county did not believe the NHL was a neutral party in the dispute
and should not be given such powers by the court.
</P>
<P>
   Ortego argued that only county and state regulators had the
power to rule on safety issues at the Coliseum. ``Thc court should
not permit the NHL to usurp those powers and let the Islanders
continue their fishing expedition,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bettman acknowledged during the hearing that the bitter
differences between the Islanders and Nassau County were
detrimental to both and that it harmed their future hopes of
building a new arena, hotel and convention center on the 80-acre
Coliseum site in Uniondale.

DAISY ANDERSON, 97, OLDEST KNOWN CIVIL WAR WIDOW 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Colo.)  (js) 
 BY ROBERT MCG. THOMAS JR.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Daisy Anderson, an old man's darling who kept the flame of her
own youthful love and her husband's searing slave memories burning
for more three-quarters of a century, died last Saturday at a
nursing home in Denver. She was 97, and, as the oldest of the
nation's three known surviving Civil War widows, may also have been
the last widow of a Southern slave.
</P>
<P>
   The death of Miss Daisy, as she was known, leaves only two known
surviving widows of Civil War veterans, one each from the Union and
Confederate armies.
</P>
<P>
   One, Alberta Martin, 91, of Elba, Ala., whose husband fought for
the South, joined Miss Daisy at a ceremony at Gettysburg last year.
The other, Gertrude Grubb Janeway, 89, of Blaine, Tenn., is the
widow of a Union soldier.
</P>
<P>
   No official records exist of the marital histories of former
slaves, but the arithmetic suggesting that Miss Daisy may have been
the last woman married to a man born into Southern bondage is
compelling.
</P>
<P>
   When they were married in Forest City, Ark., in 1922, Miss Daisy
was 21, and her husband, Robert Anderson, was 79.
</P>
<P>
   For Miss Daisy, or Daisy Graham, a native of Hardin County,
Tenn., whose impoverished sharecropping family had moved to
Arkansas because of racial tensions when she was 17, it was hardly
love at first sight.
</P>
<P>
   When she first saw Anderson, in church, she recalled snickering
at the sight of his bushy white beard.
</P>
<P>
   But Anderson, who was born into slavery in Green County, Ky., in
1843 and grew up on a flax and hemp plantation before fleeing with
his master's blessing to join the Union Army in the waning days of
the Civil War in 1865, had more than whiskers to offer the lithe
young woman who eked out a living teaching the alphabet to
neighborhood children and owned one dress.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, who saw no action in the Civil War but later took part
in the western Indian campaigns, had done well since being mustered
out of the Army in 1867.
</P>
<P>
   After several abortive farming ventures he had acquired a
2,000-acre homestead in Nebraska and made such a success of it that
by the time he visited a brother in Forest City in 1922, Anderson,
a bachelor, was rich as well as lonely.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever her reaction to his whiskers, once Anderson began
talking about his experiences as a slave, soldier and gentleman
farmer, Miss Daisy was captivated.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty days after being introduced by a matchmaking preacher,
they were married and began what Miss Daisy later described as an
eight-year honeymoon, which ended when her husband was killed in an
automobile accident in 1930.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson took his bride on an extensive trip through the West
and lavished her with clothes and other gifts. The gifts continued
after they settled on his ranch, which she recalled had 20 hands
and two cooks.
</P>
<P>
   He also regaled his wife with stories of his childhood as a
slave, so impressing her that she turned them into a book, ``From
Slavery to Affluence: Memoirs of Robert Anderson, Ex-Slave,'' which
was published privately in 1927.
</P>
<P>
   After her husband's death, Miss Daisy, who said she had been
spoiled by his generosity, became such a spendthrift that she soon
lost the farm in the Depression.
</P>
<P>
   After that she had a largely hardscrabble life, joining a sister
in Steamboat Springs, Colo., and eventually acquiring a 10-acre
farm in nearby Strawberry Park, where she raised geese and
chickens, kept a garden, ran a restaurant with a sister and worked
as a guide.
</P>
<P>
   For all the drama of her own life, Miss Daisy, who lectured
widely in her later years, becoming such a celebrity that she was
introduced to Pope John Paul II in Denver in 1993 and presented
President Clinton with a copy of her book there last year, made it
her life's mission to work for racial harmony and keep the memory
of her husband alive.
</P>
<P>
   Originally named after his owner, Col. Robert Ball, Anderson,
who never saw his mother after she was sold to a Louisiana sugar
plantation when he was 6, later adopted the name Anderson after the
neighboring farmer who owned his father.
</P>
<P>
   Although he always described his own master as kind, Anderson
suffered horribly at the hands of the man's third wife, a drunken
harridan who once gave him a savage rawhide whipping, then rubbed
salt and black pepper into his wounds, leaving such extensive scars
that Miss Daisy later said the welts on his back were as thick as
her own fingers.
</P>
<P>
   She was in a position to know. She had lovingly used her own
fingers to trace the very scars of slavery and had vowed that they
would not be forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Daisy, who never remarried and had no children, is survived
by two nieces, Mary L. Cox of Westminster, Colo., and Anne Williams
of Los Angeles.

EPA DEALS TURNPIKE LINK A NEW SETBACK 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 
 BY RONALD SMOTHERS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDISON, N.J. _ In the latest setback for New Jersey's longest
pending highway project, the federal Environmental Protection
Administration announced Friday that it was opposed to a $300
million, high-speed, limited access highway that would connect the
New Jersey Turnpike with the thriving business corridor along Route
1 in the central part of the state.
</P>
<P>
   After nearly 18 months of studying the proposed highway, the
agency concluded that the highway would not solve the area's many
transportation problems as its proponents had insisted it would and
that it would not justify the loss of 18 acres of wetlands.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the agency and its transportation consultants found
that a series of improvements and expansions of existing local
roads at a number of key points could do just as much to ease
congestion as the highway would.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the cost of losing irreplaceable wetlands and at $300
million, Route 92 is an overpriced solution,'' said EPA regional
administrator Jeanne Fox, at an agency compound here as she
announced that the agency would oppose the issuance of a permit by
the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to build the road. ``It is an
expensive proposal which in reality solves little and would
diminish the natural resources we must endow to future
generations.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately clear whether the EPA ruling doomed the
project. Gov. Christine Todd Whitman and the State Department of
Environmental Protection are on record as supporting the highway,
and within the next 30 days they can challenge the agency's
position before the permit is taken up formally by the U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers.
</P>
<P>
   Jayne O'Connor, a spokesman for the governor, said she would
first take time to review the EPA position before deciding how the
state would proceed.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, a spokesman for the turnpike authority disputed
whether the local roads could under any circumstances handle the
existing and projected traffic volumes, especially the truck
traffic. Even so, the statement continued, the highway authority
would study the alternatives suggested by the EPA.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In one form or another, the proposed highway link has been in
state planning documents since 1938 and in that time it has
metamorphosed from a 25-mile long freeway linking the western part
of the state with the Atlantic shore to the current, 6.5-mile,
75-cent toll road running virtually uninterrupted and without exits
between Princeton and Jamesburg. It is the last major highway
project on the drawing boards in the metropolitan region.
</P>
<P>
   About 11.1 million square feet in commercial development and
12,000 units of housing are planned for the area around the Route 1
corridor. The proponents of Route 92 envisioned it as a way to keep
the office-park developments along Route 1 to the west and the
growing warehousing and trucking operations that cluster to the
east both accessible and expanding.
</P>
<P>
   Cathy Dowgin, a South Brunswick resident and a leader in the
local campaign against Route 92, applauded the environmental
agency's ruling, saying it would save soybean fields and fruit
orchards that are visible from her house from being turned into a
ribbon of concrete.
</P>
<P>
   But Anthony Pizzitullo, chairman of 92 Now, the coalition of
labor, business and educational institutions that have supported
the proposed highway, called it ``a sad day for central New
Jersey.'' He said the ruling was ``an unbalanced and narrow
decision'' that, if left unchallenged, would have devastating
consequences for the area and its growth.
</P>
<P>
   The major EPA alternative would be a 1.2-mile access road on the
existing Route 32 as it runs between the turnpike and several
connecting, local roads. Such a project would cost $73 million by
the EPA's estimate.

PROSECUTOR STOPPED ON HIGHWAY COMPLAINS OF RACIAL PROFILING 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ Essex County Prosecutor Patricia Hurt, one of the
top black law-enforcement officials in New Jersey, has complained
that a state trooper used racial profiling when he pulled over her
official government sedan for driving erratically on the Garden
State Parkway earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   But state police officials, who have increasingly come under
fire in recent months because of accusations that troopers use race
as a criterion for stopping motorists, quickly rebuffed Ms. Hurt's
assertion, saying that 911 operators received multiple complaints
from motorists who reported seeing the prosecutor's car speeding
and weaving in and out of lanes with its dashboard-mounted red
light flashing.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hurt was a passenger in the car, a black Ford Crown
Victoria, and Lescia Rosa, a Hispanic investigator in the
prosecutor's office, was driving when it was stopped, said Sgt. Al
Della Fave, a New Jersey State Police spokesman. The car was pulled
over in Brick Township by Trooper Scott Ebner while it was
traveling south on the Garden State Parkway at 4:30 p.m. on Sept.
12, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Motorists who called 911 on their cellular phones complained
that the sedan was being ``operated in an unsafe manner and also
that they felt the individuals were posing as police,'' said Della
Fave.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hurt declined to be interviewed about the incident, which
was first reported in The Star-Ledger of Newark. Ray Weiss, Ms.
Hurt's spokesman in the prosecutor's office, referred most
questions to her private lawyer, Peter Harvey, of Morristown.
Harvey did not return repeated messages left at his office Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of profiling came into full view last April when state
troopers on the New Jersey Turnpike pulled over a van carrying one
young Hispanic man and three young black men to a college
basketball clinic. State troopers fired 11 shots into the van,
wounding three of the passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Della Fave said that because of a complaint filed by Ms. Hurt,
state police would conduct an internal investigation into the
actions of Trooper Ebner, who is white. Until that investigation is
complete, Della Fave said state police cannot discuss the
interaction between Ebner and Ms. Hurt.
</P>
<P>
   But Della Fave did describe the circumstances surrounding the
stop. He said that after the complaints to 911, the license plate
of the black Ford sedan was checked on state police computers,
which could find no record of it. Such a result is not uncommon in
a state with a large fleet of vehicles, he said, but may have added
to the suspicious appearance of the car.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that one of the first complaints about the sedan's
erratic driving had come from a motorist on the Parkway in
Sayreville ``who was pushed over to the right'' as the car sped
down the left lane and who then watched as the car approached the
Raritan toll plaza, turned off its flashing light, slowed down to
pay the toll and then turned the light back on.
</P>
<P>
   Several officials said that Ms. Hurt's young niece, Andrea
Patricia Hurt, and two of her teen-age friends were in the back
seat of the sedan when it was pulled over.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with The Star-Ledger, Harvey was quoted as
saying: ``I can only imagine what his assumptions were. But he
probably didn't know Essex County had a black woman prosecutor.''
In The Star-Ledger's report, Harvey did not deny that the car had
been speeding with its light on.
</P>
<P>
   Under state law, official vehicles are allowed to exceed the
speed limit only when responding to emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   Weiss confirmed that Ms. Hurt was on her way to a county
prosecutors' convention in Atlantic City, and he identified Ms.
Rosa as an investigator in the prosecutor's office.
</P>
<P>
   Della Fave said that Ms. Rosa was issued a $77 summons for
careless driving, a single charge. While that charge could
encompass a wide range of motor vehicle mischief, Ms. Rosa was not
issued tickets for speeding or other such traffic infractions. A
hearing is scheduled for Oct. 6 in Municipal Court in Brick
Township.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Davis, a spokesman for New Jersey Attorney General Peter
Verniero, whose office oversees both the 21 county prosecutors and
the state police department, said, ``The only thing we can say at
this point is we are aware of the incident and at this point the
matter is going to go before a Municipal Court judge and it will be
resolved.''
</P>
<P>
   Ebner, 29, who has been on the state police force since January
1995, will remain on active duty, officials said. Ms. Hurt was not
issued a summons or charged with any crime. When she was appointed
by Gov. Christie Whitman late last year, Ms. Hurt became only the
second black woman to be named a county prosecutor in New Jersey.

`IL BARBIERE DI SIVIGLIA': NEW VOICES TAKE ON EVERGREEN ROSSINI 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By BERNARD HOLLAND   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ One of the unwritten mandates of the New York City
Opera is presentable productions of the standard repertory offered
at affordable prices. Thursday night's return of ``Il Barbiere di
Siviglia'' checked out nicely. It also gave us a look at some
interesting young singers.
</P>
<P>
   Desmond Heeley's bright, traditional sets offer no surprises,
but they are honest representations and blessedly distant from the
moth-eaten productions with which the company struggled during the
1980s. The newcomer to Rossini will not be misled and the
connoisseur not terribly disappointed. Albert Sherman's direction
is jokey but rarely out of control.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the singing was exceptionally promising. Among those
making their debuts was Kristine Jepson as Rosina. She is
self-assured and scrupulous onstage. The voice carries easily in
this big space and negotiates the music's intricacies without
incident. Ms. Jepson is the kind of finished young American singer
who keeps international opera houses, large and small, more or less
in business, and her presence should help the City Opera
considerably.
</P>
<P>
   As the old theatrical saying goes, careers are often launched
atop the misfortunes of others, and so it was here. Daniel Mobbs, a
company baritone, was ill on Thursday, but Mel Ulrich was ready to
take his place as Figaro.
</P>
<P>
   Ulrich, also new to the company, did very well. The voice, suave
and elegant, is generated by excellent diction. Ulrich looks good
and moves well onstage; he is a natural Figaro. For all its
seamlessness, however, the voice sounds young. Everything it did
succeeded, but one felt a technique operating just at the edge of
its capacity.
</P>
<P>
   I worry about such a promising talent pushing hard in a large
space like this, but if Ulrich and his handlers are very careful,
he might become a notable operatic personality.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the cast, Matthew Polenzani sang Almaviva in his
light and attractive tenor. Laura Knoop, another newcomer, made a
nice impression as Berta.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Glavin brought to Dr. Bartolo the requisite agility for
Rossini's rapid patter. At one point, Glavin sang flat for comic
effect; too often his waywardness of pitch was less a matter to
smile over. Recitative in particular careered so eccentrically that
Bartolo's interlocutors had to work hard remembering the key they
had begun in.
</P>
<P>
   Time, as ever, is the City Opera's constant enemy. There is
never enough to truly make things work. Robert DeCeunynck's clever
mimicking at the harpsichord still couldn't rescue the often
halting connections between players during recitatives. Guido
Ajmone-Marsan conducted a performance that in broad outlines was
alert and deft, but full of small smudges and missed connections.
</P>
<P>
   Shon Sims (Fiorello), Kevin Maynor (Don Basilio), John Lankston
(Ambrogio) and William Ledbetter (the Official) all did well. The
lighting is by Ken Tabachnik, and Frederic Hand played the guitar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Il Barbiere di Siviglia'' repeats at Sunday's matinee.
Listeners who don't know the opera will be honestly informed and
have a good time. No one will be cheated.

 JEFFREY A. MOSS, CREATOR OF THE COOKIE MONSTER AND OTHER SESAME
STREET REGULARS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By DOUGLAS MARTIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Jeffrey A. Moss, a writer and composer whose
accomplishments included dreaming up the ``Sesame Street''
characters Cookie Monster and Oscar the Grouch, died on Thursday at
his home in Manhattan. He was 56.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was colon cancer, said his wife, Anne Boylan.
</P>
<P>
   Moss was perhaps best known for the many songs he created for
the Muppets, including ``Rubber Duckie,'' ``I Love Trash'' and
``Captain Vegetable.'' These whimsical ditties became the musical
bounce for an educational children's show seen by more than 120
million children in 130 countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``His wonderful lyrics and music reflected the mood and the
style of the show _ fun, energetic, sometimes sentimental and
always entertaining,'' said Joan Ganz Cooney, chairwoman of the
executive committee and co-founder of Children's Television
Workshop, the producer of ``Sesame Street.''
</P>
<P>
   As head writer and composer-lyricist for the show, he won 14
Emmys and wrote songs for four Grammy-winning recordings. His music
and lyrics for ``The Muppets Take Manhattan'' earned him an Academy
Award nomination. He was also the author of more than a dozen
best-selling books under the ``Sesame Street'' name, including
``The Sesame Street Book of Poetry.''
</P>
<P>
   He also wrote three popular children's poetry collections,
including ``The Butterfly Jar,'' ``The Other Side of the Door'' and
``Bone Poems.'' In addition, he wrote ``Bob and Jack: A Boy and His
Yak'' and ``Hieronymus White,'' stories in verse.
</P>
<P>
   When Moss helped start ``Sesame Street'' in 1969 with Jim
Henson, creator of the Muppets, and the musical director, Joe
Raposo, among others, the intention was to appeal to both adults
and children. Preschool children could delightedly imbibe the
beginnings of reading and arithmetic while adults laughed at the
skits and jokes, often performed by famous entertainers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could mix the silly and the profound _ not just for
children but for adults as well,'' said Deborah Futter, who edited
several of his books for Bantam. ``You laughed and you cried, it
hit you on so many levels.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview in The New York Times five years ago, Moss
explained his approach. ``I look at kids as being us, but
younger,'' he said. ``What makes kids laugh is the same as what
makes us laugh. And losing something or someone dear to you is also
universal. The key is to keep the vocabulary so children can
understand it. That way you keep the kids watching and smiling, and
it's something you watch yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   In several more recent interviews, Moss has said his perspective
on his own work broadened in recent years as he watched his son
Alexander, now 7, enjoy ``Sesame Street.'' He is also survived by
his wife and a stepson, Jonathan Smith.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Moss, born in 1942, grew up in Manhattan. He began writing
poetry and music at an early age. His father was an actor and his
mother a writer, and they filled their home with classical music
and Broadway show tunes. He graduated from Princeton University,
and was offered two jobs by the Columbia Broadcasting System. One
was as a news writer, the other as a production assistant for
``Captain Kangaroo.'' He chose the latter. After six months in the
Army, he returned to the show as a writer.
</P>
<P>
   He was recruited as a writer for ``Sesame Street,'' a new show
intended to enrich the imaginations and intellect of children not
able to attend preschool. He came up with ideas for characters in
the manner of a fiction writer. In the case of Cookie Monster, he
studied one of Henson's Muppets, then known only as Boggle Eyes. He
began to see the character as humorous, with a childlike obsession.
</P>
<P>
   At Cookie Monster's debut rehearsal, the Muppet, played by the
puppeteer Frank Oz, said just two words: ``Milk'' and
``COOOOOOOOOKIIIIEEEEEE!'' Colleagues recall falling off their
chairs in laughter.
</P>
<P>
   He also put songs in the mouths of Muppets. ``I Love Trash,''
for instance, became the theme song of Oscar the Grouch, who lives
in a garbage can and loathes sunshine. It goes: ``I hate ice cream,
I hate smiles. I love trash in great big piles.''
</P>
<P>
   Another ``Sesame Street'' writer, Christopher Cerf, said Moss
brought integrity even to his silliest writing. ``I go for the
silly joke every time,'' Cerf said.
</P>
<P>
   Moss began to write children's poetry when the actress Marlo
Thomas asked him to write a piece for a book she was sponsoring,
``Free to Be a Family.'' He wrote a poem called ``The Entertainer''
about a girl who feels put upon because her parents often ask her
to perform at parties. Other poems then flowed, and before long he
had 90. They became ``The Butterfly Jar.''
</P>
<P>
   One poem in the collection is called ``Meeting Strangers.'' It
is narrated by a shy monster character who epitomizes the fear of
not being liked by others. ``They act like a monster when I'm the
one who's new,'' he moans.
</P>
<P>
   It was this ability to strike resonant chords that those who
knew Moss mentioned on Friday. His literary agent, Esther Newberg,
remembered the awe with which children at the American Museum of
Natural History regarded him when he read from his book about
dinosaurs. A friend mentioned how today's Princeton students, all
weaned on ``Sesame Street,'' would crowd around a piano and join
him in belting out ``Rubber Duckie.''
</P>
<P>
   Cerf said that the day he died, Moss, who had hidden his cancer
for years, was writing a new song for ``Sesame Street.'' The title
was ``You and You and Me.'' It describes Elmo, Ernie and Telly
trying to figure out who should go through a door first. ``Jeff
wrote from the heart and still was funny,'' Cerf said.

`SAME OLD SONG': BUOYANT MUSICAL COMEDY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes at end of review.) 
(mk) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Where does self-delusion end and lying begin? And how
much do our deepest feelings correspond to old songs we retain that
pop into our minds at the oddest moments? These and other
less-than-burning questions are contemplated in Alain Resnais'
buoyant film, ``Same Old Song,'' a contemporary musical comedy
about real estate, agoraphobia, hypochondria and Parisian tourist
landmarks, among other topics.
</P>
<P>
   The movie, which is being shown at the New York Film Festival
Saturday at 9 p.m. and Sunday at 4:15 p.m. at Alice Tully Hall, is
the noted French director's affectionate tribute to English
dramatist and screenwriter Dennis Potter. It uses fragments of old
recordings in much the same way that Potter did in movies like
``Pennies From Heaven'' and ``The Singing Detective.'' By having
his characters burst into lip-synched song to express their inner
lives, Potter underscored the delirious irrationality of emotion
and the zest for life in a way that conventional movie narratives
rarely do.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Same Old Song,'' directed from a screenplay by Agnes Jaoui
and Jean-Pierre Bacri, Resnais puts his own stamp on the technique.
Instead of conjuring period and genre as they do in Potter's work,
the film's musical fragments gleaned from everything from scratchy
music-hall recordings to hard-edged contemporary pop help draw out
the characters' personalities and reveal truths that they struggle
to conceal or deny. Men sometimes sing in women's voices and women
in men's. Some of the musical interludes last no longer than two or
three seconds, while others are extended soaring choruses.
</P>
<P>
   Because so many of the songs are intensely romantic in a classic
Gallic mode, ``Same Old Song'' also suggests a psychologically
convoluted variation of Jacques Demy's candy-colored
singing-and-dancing bonbons, ``The Umbrellas of Cherbourg'' and
``The Young Girls of Rochefort.'' Here, as in the Demy musicals,
love is what makes the world go 'round, even when that love is
uncertain or duplicitous.
</P>
<P>
   The story follows six characters around Paris as they negotiate
their relationships and play games that involve prevarication.
Odile (Sabine Azema) and Camille (Ms. Jalou) are a pair of
attractive sisters who turn out not to be the people they claim to
be. Odile complains that her husband, Claude (Pierre Arditi), never
takes charge of a situation, but is revealed to be a control-freak
of the first order. Camille, a Parisian tour guide and university
student, at first appears almost frighteningly self-possessed, then
develops attacks of acute agoraphobia.
</P>
<P>
   Camille has two avid suitors: Marc (Lambert Wilson), an
arrogant, dishonest young real-estate agent who sells Odile an
apartment that is not what it's cracked up to be, and Simon (Andre
Dussollier), an older employee of Marc's who claims to make his
living writing radio plays. Complicating matters is the sudden
reappearance of Nicolas (Jean-Pierre Bacri), an old boyfriend of
Odile's who has come to Paris to rent an apartment for his family.
Nicolas, a raving hypochondriac who visits a succession of doctors,
is unable to make up his mind on a place to live. He also becomes
Simon's confidant.
</P>

   ``Same Old Song'' skips along merrily, as its characters
intersect, chasing one another around Paris in a round-robin game
of real estate salesmanship and romance. Their stories finally mesh
at a lavish housewarming party at which collective neuroses and
lies are exposed.

RE-CREATING MADISON AVE. DOWNTOWN: IN SOHO, CONSUMERISM IS AN ART 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By TERRY PRISTIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A uniformed security guard stands by the door of the
imposing new Louis Vuitton store on Greene Street. Inside,
fashionably dressed couples, many from Europe or Japan, eye the
rich leather bags arranged one to a shelf like exemplars of a rare
type of ancient pottery. Downstairs, clothes are displayed with a
studied casualness _ a long skirt here, a jacket there. A steamer
trunk with a price tag of $25,000 rests on the highly polished
floor.
</P>
<P>
   Louis Vuitton? In Soho?
</P>
<P>
   Yes. And yes. And it is hardly alone. Before long, Vuitton will
be joined by the likes of Yves Saint Laurent, Prada, Helena
Rubenstein and the jewelers H. Stern and Bulgari.
</P>
<P>
   Madison Avenue is migrating downtown, hoping to draw a mix of
affluent customers, including inhabitants of increasingly costly
Tribeca and Soho loft buildings, foreign guests of two new Soho
hotels and weekend daytrippers from the suburbs. Some retailers say
they plan to use their new stores, many in former gallery spaces,
to try out new ideas, broaden their customer base or display a
wider range of goods than they could accommodate uptown.
</P>
<P>
   Around Soho these days, a good number of old-timers are more
than a little upset that all of this is happening to a place that
has long defined itself as an antidote to uptown taste in art and
fashion.
</P>
<P>
   It was that ``funky'' character that attracted Sean Sweeney to
this neighborhood of cast-iron facades and wide-open loft spaces 22
years ago. ``If there's one place in the world I didn't want to
live in, it was the Upper East Side,'' said Sweeney, who is the
executive director of the Soho Alliance, a community group. Now, he
said, ``It looks like it's turning into that.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, as with pretty much any hip New York neighborhood,
Soho has been getting steadily less so ever since it became an
acronym (which is about as long as people have been bemoaning the
loss of the ``old'' Soho). The high-end retailers' southward
stampede is actually only the latest change to wash over a
neighborhood that became an artists' enclave nearly three decades
ago as loft buildings once occupied by light manufacturing were
converted into studios and living spaces. In recent years, as rents
rose, many of the art galleries that followed the artists have had
to give up their storefronts and were replaced by home furnishing
shops.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, this newest incarnation is really, in a sense, a
return to Soho's roots: In the mid-19th century, the area south of
Houston Street formed a luxury shopping district not unlike the one
that is crystallizing there today. Tiffany &AMP; Co., Lord &AMP; Taylor,
Brooks Brothers and Crouch &AMP; Fitzgerald were just a few of the
elegant stores of that era to find a home on lower Broadway, the
eastern end of Soho.
</P>
<P>
   One such establishment, E.V. Haughwout &AMP; Co., at Broadway and
Broome Street, supplied the White House with china during the
Lincoln presidency. The store dazzled the eye with every imaginable
type of serving vessel and even carried its own brand of champagne.
</P>
<P>
   But lower Broadway's role as a carriage-trade thoroughfare was
short-lived. By the end of the Civil War, most of the tony shops
had moved north to Union Square. Soho evolved into a center for
manufacturing, wholesaling and warehousing.Soho
</P>
<P>
   These days, real estate brokers say, luxury stores are competing
furiously for space in Soho, and spending heavily once the deal is
secured. Helena Rubenstein, for example, will invest more than $5
million in a spa and cosmetics store on Spring Street.
</P>
<P>
   It may eventually be joined by Ralph Lauren. Along with a
British partner, Polo Ralph Lauren bought a 55,000-square-foot
garage on West Broadway last year and then, in January, acquired an
additional 30,000 square feet of space in a building a few doors
away. But no workers can be spotted at those locations, and the
company ``has not made any determination on how the space will be
used,'' said Lynn Tesoro, a spokeswoman for Ralph Lauren.
</P>
<P>
   These high-end retailers are avoiding Broadway, which is a mere
four blocks from West Broadway but much farther away in spirit.
Broadway is now lined with nationally known medium-priced chain
stores like A/X Armani Exchange, Victoria's Secret and the Pottery
Barn. The much-admired iron-front building where Haughwout once
welcomed its customers now houses a Staples office supply store.
</P>
<P>
   But the pricey stores are turning up everywhere else in the
neighborhood _ from side streets like Wooster, Greene and Mercer to
the wider and more heavily traveled blocks of Prince and Spring
Streets and West Broadway. During Soho's brief moment as the
antebellum equivalent of Madison Avenue, ``major retailers did not
bother with the side streets,'' said Christopher Gray, an
architectural historian and a contributor to The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   Boardinghouses _ and later, houses of prostitution _ abounded on
those streets, he said, and as the neighborhood deteriorated, the
major retailers fled uptown.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Now, instead of a stigma, the side streets are beginning to have
cachet, said Stephen Tarter, a Soho real estate broker. ``But a
major difference in the past year,'' he said, ``is that the very
high-end luxury retailers are going onto side streets. It used to
be `either West Broadway or Spring or don't show me any space.'''
</P>
<P>
   Rents in Soho, as elsewhere in Manhattan, are soaring as
retailers compete for scarce space. Storefronts on Spring and
Prince Streets that cost $100 a square foot a year not long ago can
now command as much as $150 a square foot (or even $250 a square
foot, for a small space suitable for, say, an optician). On Wooster
and Greene Streets, rents have risen to about $100 a square foot
from $60. Prices like these are beyond the means of most gallery
owners and retailers, but Soho is still a bargain compared with
Madison Avenue, where space goes for $300 a square foot or more.
</P>
<P>
   Several retail executives said they hoped to draw customers who
shun uptown shopping. ``We know where our customers live and where
they shop,'' said Thomas J. O'Neill, the president of Louis Vuitton
Americas. ``We know that downtown people don't shop uptown.''
</P>
<P>
   H. Stern is building a 6,000-square-foot store on Prince Street.
``We're not going for kings and queens in Soho,'' said Roberto
Stern, the executive vice president. ``But we are going for the
people who have taste, are educated and who don't like to buy on
Fifth Avenue or Madison. They are intellectual and more interested
in the arts and design.'' In contrast to the company's Fifth Avenue
store, where a necklace can fetch $100,000, the Soho shop will
carry a contemporary collection of jewelry priced at $1,500 to
$4,000, Stern said.
</P>
<P>
   Soho has also become the neighborhood of choice for less famous,
but equally expensive, European retailers. Among them are
Philosophy di Alberta Ferretti, a women's clothier based in Milan;
Fortuna Valentino, a shoe store, also from Milan; and Rene Lezard,
a German clothing store, all of which opened their only New York
stores downtown. ``We get a lot of people from uptown because the
product is a very uptown product,'' said Aitor Azua, the manager of
Fortuna Valentino, where boots made from reptile skins can cost as
much as $800.
</P>
<P>
   Real estate brokers tend to be very upbeat about the
neighborhood's prospects. Caroline Banker, a broker with New
Spectrum Realty, said that haughty Madison Avenue is losing some of
its luster, particularly in contrast with the less intimidating
Soho, where stores keep longer hours and stay open on Sundays.
``There's no buzz on Madison right now,'' she said. ``Madison
Avenue dies at 6 o'clock. On weekends, especially in summer, there
is no one walking on those streets.''
</P>
<P>
   But Isaac Lagnato, the president of Tactical Retail Solutions, a
marketing research company, sounded a warier note, predicting that
Soho would be unlikely to provide the highest-priced retailers with
a reliable customer base.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a profitable proposition, I'm very skeptical,'' he said.
``It's a little bit of an ego trip.'' He said that stores with a
wider range of prices, like Ralph Lauren, would have a better
chance of performing well. Soho Faith Hope Consolo, the senior
managing director of Garrick-Aug Associates, a midtown company
specializing in store leasing, agreed that Soho could prove a risky
proposition, especially for stores that depend on only one location
for all of their United States revenues. ``What scares me,'' she
said, ``is that a market can become so hot that it outprices itself
for the kind of sales it can do.''
</P>
<P>
   But Christophe Girard, the executive vice president of Yves
Saint Laurent in Paris, said that Soho is the ideal location for
its Rive Gauche Homme men's wear collection, which has a new young
designer who is very much in tune with the spirit of the
neighborhood. Next month, the men's department, which carries suits
that cost as much as $2,500, will move from Madison Avenue, to a
new store on Wooster Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going to Soho is a natural move for us,'' he said, pointing
out that the company opened its first store in
St.-Germain-des-Pres, on the Left Bank in Paris, in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   Today, however, St.-Germain-des-Pres is in a ``much more
bourgeois state,'' he said. And why?
</P>
<P>
   ``There are only luxury stores,'' he said. ``There are no young
designers. It's too expensive. Things change. This is life.''

THINK TANK: ABOUT LIFE, DEATH AND THE PAUSE THAT SEPARATES THEM 
</HEADLINE>
  (Ideas) 
(Eds: Words in bold should be set in italics.) 
(lb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In Margaret Edson's new play ``Wit,'' Kathleen Chalfant plays
Vivian Bearing, a literature professor whose specialty is the
17th-century poet John Donne. The 50-year-old professor, who wrote
her thesis on Donne's sonnet ``Death Be Not Proud'' _ with special
consideration given to the punctuation _ now finds herself in a
hospital ward, dying of cancer. In this scene, Vivian flashes back
to her graduate-school days.
</P>
<P>
   PROFESSOR ASHFORD: Your essay on Holy Sonnet Six, Miss Bearing,
is a melodrama, with a veneer of scholarship unworthy of you _ to
say nothing of Donne. Do it again.
</P>
<P>
   VIVIAN BEARING: I, ah ...
</P>
<P>
   PROFESSOR: You must begin with a text, Miss Bearing, not with a
feeling.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Death be not proud, though some have called thee
</P>
<P>
   Mighty and dreadful, for, thou art not so. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   You have entirely missed the point of the poem, because, I must
tell you, you have used an edition of the text that is
inauthentically punctuated. In the Gardner edition _
</P>
<P>
   VIVIAN: That edition was checked out of the library _
</P>
<P>
   PROFESSOR: Miss Bearing!
</P>
<P>
   VIVIAN: Sorry.
</P>
<P>
   PROFESSOR: You take this too lightly, Miss Bearing. This is
Metaphysical Poetry, not the Modern Novel. The standards of
scholarship and critical reading which one would apply to any other
text are simply insufficient. The effort must be total for the
results to be meaningful. Do you think the punctuation of the last
line of this sonnet is merely an insignificant detail?
</P>
<P>
   The sonnet begins with a valiant struggle with death, calling on
all the forces of intellect and drama to vanquish the enemy. But it
is ultimately about life, death, and eternal life: overcoming these
seemingly insuperable barriers.
</P>
<P>
   In the edition you chose, this profoundly simple meaning is
sacrificed to hysterical punctuation:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; And Death &LR;  _ capital D _  &UR; shall be no more &LR;  _ semicolon!
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Death &LR;  _ capital D _ comma _  &UR; thou shalt die &LR;  _ exclamation
point!
</P>
<P>
   If you go in for this sort of thing, I suggest you take up
Shakespeare.
</P>
<P>
   Gardner's edition of the Holy Sonnets returns to the
Westmoreland manuscript source of 1610 _ not for sentimental
reasons, I assure you, but because Dame Helen Gardner was a
scholar. It reads:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; And death shall be no more, &LR;  comma,  &UR; Death thou shalt die. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Nothing but a breath _ a comma _ separates life from life
everlasting. It is very simple really. With the original
punctuation restored, death is no longer something to act out on a
stage, with exclamation points. It's a comma, a pause. This way,
the uncompromising way, one learns something from this poem,
wouldn't you say? Life, death. Soul, God. Past, present. Not
insuperable barriers, not semicolons, just a comma.
</P>
<P>
   VIVIAN: Life, death ... I see. It's a metaphysical conceit. It's
wit! I'll go back to the library and rewrite the paper _
</P>
<P>
   PROFESSOR: It is not wit, Miss Bearing. It is truth.
</P>
<P>
   The paper's not the point.
</P>
<P>
   VIVIAN: It isn't?
</P>
<P>
   PROFESSOR: Vivian. You're a bright young woman. Use your
intelligence. Don't go back to the library. Go out. Enjoy yourself
with your friends. Hmm?
</P>
<P>
   VIVIAN (to the audience): I, ah, went outside. The sun was very
bright. I, ah, walked around, past the ... There were students on
the lawn, talking about nothing, laughing. The insuperable barrier
between one thing and another is ... just a comma? Simple human
truth, uncompromising scholarly standards? They're connected? I
just couldn't ...
</P>
<P>
   I went back to the library.

COMMENTARY: LONGING FOR GOTHAM ON LEFT COAST 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DAVID GONZALEZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``I recently moved to Silicon Valley, and I am
constantly homesick for all aspects of New York life,'' Rosemary
Shashoua wrote in a recent e-mail. ``Please write a column
regarding this feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   In the interest of being a user-friendly, full-service column,
why not?
</P>
<P>
   After all, who among us has not felt utterly lost when family or
career beckoned with a new ZIP code? Sure, there's a certain
novelty to having strangers greet you on the street with a smile or
being able to shop in supermarkets that are big enough to hide a
jumbo jet.
</P>
<P>
   But those comforts do nothing to prevent the longing that grips
your soul in those moments when you bite into what passes for a
bagel or a slice of pizza anywhere outside the five boroughs of New
York City. Never mind the rush of nostalgia that washes over those
unfortunates who catch a glimpse of Gotham on some TV show.
</P>
<P>
   What then?
</P>
<P>
   Calls are made daily to friends and family, catching up on
gossip and news, while avoiding The Big Question: Why did you leave
in the first place? The truly desperate run to the video store,
getting their hands on anything set in the city _ but please, no
Canadian stand-ins with midblock alleys or mountains on the
horizon.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Shashoua, 51, knows these rituals. She and her husband
moved to San Mateo, Calif., in 1996 after living in Jackson
Heights, Queens, and out on Long Island, in Islip. Maybe it was a
good idea then, but listen to her now as she describes life amid
abundant sunshine, good vibes and malls.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing else people need out here,'' she said.
``Except to have their heads examined.''
</P>
<P>
   She traded coasts in 1996 to help her brother-in-law with his
Italian-food distribution business. And food is something that she
soon noticed was just not the same as what she was used to. She
felt like a trained mouse in a swapped maze when she started going
to the Safeway supermarkets after decades of shopping at
Waldbaum's.
</P>
<P>
   ``The aisles are different,'' she said. ``Don't ever go from
Waldbaum's to Safeway. In Safeway, you can't find something, they
take you by the arm and show you where it is. At Waldbaum's, they
tell you it's on the bottom of aisle six on the right. But they
don't know left from right, which is a lot of fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like Safeway is a safe bet, right?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like Safeway,'' she insisted. ``The stuff they have is
junk.''
</P>
<P>
   And expensive, like everything else. She tried haggling when
shopping for a vacuum cleaner, but in one store she couldn't even
get a clerk to pay attention to her. She thinks he was interested
only in making a fat commission by selling her a computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is Silicon Valley,'' she said. ``They want to suck you
dry.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Shashoua used to be involved in community issues and local
politics back on the East Coast. But the level of discourse where
she now lives leaves her longing for the rough-and-tumble attitude
embodied by Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really homesick because the people out here are wimps,''
she said. ``They listen too much to all the flak that comes from
the Beltway. If Clinton sneezes, they run with a tissue. Then they
want to know what made him sneeze. They rub his back. They don't
care what they rub; they just want to placate him.''
</P>
<P>
   What would placate her? She longs to see a Broadway play, hear
the noise of a city street or take a ride on the subway _ which to
her has its own bit of theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``I miss the solicitation on the subway when the homeless people
try to sell you something,'' she said. ``Boy, I miss that. Here
they wear a placard that says, `I need a beer.'''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes an episode of ``Spin City'' eases her homesickness.
She says the television show gives her a dose of New York, as well
as showing different ways of dealing with bad situations. Too bad
it also reminds her how the local politicos where she now lives are
``wishy-washy'' in comparison.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody here talks a lot but doesn't do anything,'' she
said. ``The representatives out here don't do anything. They love
giving out medals for good deeds.''
</P>
<P>
   She would probably give a medal to whoever would help her find a
new source of herring. She used to buy it in bulk, but the store
stopped selling it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suppose because the general public didn't purchase enough of
it,'' she lamented. ``I will hunt around the local supermarkets and
ask people if they can find out where else I can get it. If not, my
brother-in-law has contacts in Brooklyn. He has a lot of contacts
in Brooklyn.''

TOLEDO FAVORS RESCHEDULING GAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ UCLA guard Andy Meyers peered out the window
Friday afternoon and glanced at the Southern California sky.
</P>
<P>
   ``Know what I see?'' he asked quarterback Cade McNown.
</P>
<P>
   ``What?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not a hurricane.''
</P>
<P>
   A few hours later _ after a spirited two-hour practice at
Spaulding Field _ McNown echoed Meyers' sense of relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody wanted to play,'' he said of today's game at Miami,
canceled because of Hurricane Georges. ``But if we had, we probably
would have found a silver lining, even if it was over the Dominican
Republic. That's a big cloud.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps nobody wanted to play. Now the question is: Do they want
to reschedule? Bruins coach Bob Toledo said he will talk to players
and coaches about a Dec. 5 makeup date, then discuss it with
athletic director Peter Dalis.
</P>
<P>
   The schools are expected to talk about rescheduling next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``You only have 11 opportunities, hopefully 12,'' Toledo said.
``You work hard, you practice hard, and the games are the rewards.
That's what makes it fun. Personally, I would like to play the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowl Championship Series implications: The cancellation would
have its greatest impact if the Bruins finish 10-0. The formula to
determine No. 1 vs. No. 2 in the Fiesta Bowl combines top-25
rankings, computer rankings, strength of schedule, strength of
opponents' schedule and Division I-A wins.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, the Bruins have lost a potential I-A win. And if
Miami finishes 7-3, the cancellation might hurt UCLA's strength of
schedule, as well. But if the Hurricanes finish 3-7 or 4-6, the
cancellation helps UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   Rose Bowl implications: There's one scenario in which the
cancellation could cost UCLA a Rose Bowl appearance: if the Bruins
are involved in a three-way tie with two teams that have 3-0
nonconference records.
</P>
<P>
   Under all other scenarios, the determining factors will be
head-to-head competition and/or the Rose Bowl participation rule,
which eliminates the team with the most-recent Rose Bowl
appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Financial implications: The cancellation cost UCLA approximately
$700,000. That's $500,000 from its share of the Pac-10 television
contract, a $200,000-$300,000 payout from Miami, minus travel
expenses.
</P>
<P>
   The $19 million Adidas contract, which begins in July and
includes a $3 million cash payment in 1999-2000, will more than
offset the loss.
</P>
<P>
   Heisman Trophy implications: With a noon EDT start and CBS
national telecast, McNown lost his best chance to impress Heisman
voters in the East.
</P>
<P>
   In typical fashion, he shrugged it off.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we stay in the top five, they'll see what's going on,''
McNown said. ``If we were (ranked) 15-18 or out (of the polls), if
we needed the exposure, it'd be a different deal.''

   NEW YORK _ Joseph Torres, 27, moved into a new two-family house
in the East Tremont section of the Bronx two weeks ago. A few
nights later, he heard gunfire for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Six shots,'' he said. ``Bap-bap-bap-bap-bap-bap. Like that.''
</P>
<P>
   He quickly installed a tall, spiked metal fence around his stoop
and driveway, at the corner of East 181st Street and Vyse Avenue.
Now he is even thinking about lining the walls inside with metal
plates, to shield his wife and three children from any stray
bullets.
</P>
<P>
   Torres, a porter at a Manhattan apartment building who moved
from a rental apartment in the Parkchester section of the Bronx,
said he bought his house because it was only three blocks from the
subway and a block from the Bronx Zoo. Most important, the area
seemed safe. ``I saw kids playing outside until 11 at night,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   He had no idea that his new neighborhood was one of the few in
New York City where homicides were on the rise. At a time when
crime is continuing to fall citywide, the 48th Precinct has had 17
killings this year, the most recent and perhaps most disturbing on
Sept. 1, when a 55-year-old man driving home with his wife from
their night-shift jobs was struck in the neck and killed by a stray
bullet fired by strangers in a gunfight on East 180th Street.
</P>
<P>
   The homicide total of 17, though hardly a number to compare with
the murderous days of the early '90s, is still nearly double the
total at the same time last year. In all of 1997, there were just
14 homicides in the precinct, down from 24 killings in 1996 and 40
in 1993. Though the 17 homicides are the most of any precinct in
the Bronx _ and the fourth-highest total citywide _ police say that
the precinct is much safer than the murder rate suggests. Other
statistics support this argument: assaults are about even with last
year, and over all, major crimes are down 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But the realization that violence has not relaxed its grip in
the neighborhood has nonetheless dampened what was a celebratory
mood in East Tremont, Fordham and West Farms, where more than 600
new homes have been built in the last five years, many of them
bought by working-class families with assistance from nonprofit
groups and government programs. Officials have long hoped that
these new homeowners would propel the community's recovery from
decades of decay and abandonment.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, some residents say, despite their new three-story
houses, neat front yards, freshly painted metal gates and driveways
with late-model cars, they are troubled by the specter of street
crime.
</P>
<P>
   Jessica Scott, 34, who moved up to 180th Street from Concourse
Village last month, said she missed the big complex's indoor
parking garage, 24-hour security guard and the safety she felt
living in a high-rise, far above any street crime. Now, she said,
she and her mother, Anne, hear everything. And any time they need
to drive off, they first have to open and close the driveway gate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like we're vulnerable,'' Jessica Scott said, pointing
to teen-agers on the street around the corner, men standing in
front of a bodega across the street and an apartment nearby that
she said contained a drug market. ``I'm a corrections officer, and
I carry a gun, but I still don't feel safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Her mother, a retired schoolteacher, said she felt more secure,
but only because of the bars on her windows. ``I'm in jail here,''
she said, chuckling.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Michael Phipps, the commander of the 48th Precinct, winces
when he hears things like this, because, he says, perceptions, not
statistics, govern the way people live their lives. ``If you think
it's dangerous, it might as well be,'' he said in an interview
Friday at the station house, under the Cross Bronx Expressway along
Park Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   But Phipps said that things were safer than the murder rate
suggested. There are only 78 known drug-dealing locations in the
48th Precinct, compared with a few hundred in some precincts to the
west and south, he said. And the murder rate is still much lower
than 5 or 10 years ago, when the yearly death toll routinely ran as
high as 40. Because last year's murder total was so low, Phipps
added, any rise seems dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he said that law-abiding residents _ those hundreds of
new homeowners, for example _ have rarely been caught up in the
violence. ``You're not going to get shot walking the streets of the
four-eight, except in circumstances that you put yourself in,'' he
said. Of the 17 people killed this year, he said, ``probably there
were only two or three who didn't know the person who killed them,
and only one true, honest-to-goodness innocent victim, whose
life-style didn't open them up to this.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of those killed were involved with drugs, Phipps said,
telling one bloody tale after another:
</P>
<P>
   Rafael Rodriguez, 24, was gunned down Jan. 2 by a man riding a
mountain bike at 181st Street and Crotona Avenue in the start of a
brief war between rival drug gangs. On July 30, Terrence Celestine,
24, was shot at least 12 times behind 2111 Lafontaine Ave.
</P>
<P>
   Others were killed over lust or money. Darrel Carrol, 20, gunned
down Feb. 28 on Bronx Park South, was killed for $50 by a man whom
he shot and wounded a year earlier in a dispute over $40, Phipps
said. Ruben Collazo, 23, who had just opened a livery-cab business
on Washington Avenue, was shot Aug. 4 by a driver whom police say
he was planning to fire.
</P>
<P>
   And then there were the baffling cases: Donald Glover, 36, shot
March 21 at a birthday party on Southern Boulevard, after a fight
erupted between several guests, and Kim Evans, 27, a prostitute who
was thrown off the roof of a 21-story apartment building on East
178th Street on July 18.
</P>
<P>
   But the most recent killing, several residents said, was the
most haunting. On the morning of Sept. 1, Luis Burgos, 55, was
driving home with his wife when he was struck in the neck and
killed by a stray bullet fired in a gunfight on 180th Street. They
were only three blocks from their co-op apartment. A suspect,
Rafael Rosario, is still being sought in the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, the 48th Precinct revised its patrol system to
insure more police presence on the three streets where most of the
shootings have occurred: 180th Street, Crotona Avenue and Boston
Road. Uniformed officers are riding the lengths of those roads, and
6 to 17 more plainclothes officers from the precinct are assigned
to the three streets, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a special task force of 32 plainclothes officers
that was formed to focus on rapists has been temporarily assigned
to the 48th Precinct. ``Every night, all they do is stop, question
and frisk people in the street,'' Captain Phipps said. ``It's
obvious that we were not stopping enough people because people
didn't feel afraid carrying a gun, that they were going to be
stopped.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, for months, residents have been begging for more police
officers to be assigned to the 48th Precinct. And in January, their
pleas may be answered. The Police Department expects to create a
new task force in the precinct, patterned after the South Bronx
Initiative, with 50 to 100 undercover narcotics investigators and
uniformed backup officers.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, however, Phipps said he thought the stepped-up
patrols and borrowed manpower might be having the desired effect.
Since Sept. 1, he said, there have been no shootings in the
precinct.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Sept. 26:
</P>
<P>
   Reports of some schools adopting peanut-free zones in lunchrooms
and even total peanut butter bans may sound like a freakish health
fad, but there have been rare cases where children who were
severely allergic to peanuts have died after coming into contact
with peanuts in school. With increased reports of food allergies
among children, the impetus to protect the susceptible is
understandable.
</P>
<P>
   About 7 percent of children have some kind of food allergy, with
effects that can range from mild itching to traumatic shock or the
closing of breathing passages. While less than 1 percent of
children are allergic to peanuts, peanut allergies can be more
severe than allergies to other foods. Although there are very few
deaths a year from food allergies, schools would still be wise to
develop policies on this issue, particularly if a student comes
forward with this problem.
</P>
<P>
   Most experts, however, say banning a food is not a good
solution, except perhaps in very controlled settings. In a typical
school, a ban may create a false sense of security since there is
no way to insure that no student will ever bring a snack that may
contain the offending substance and then share that item with an
allergic student. Besides, banning one food might cause other
parents to demand other bans. Some children have allergies to milk,
eggs and wheat. It would not make sense to ban all those items too.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of bans, the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and
Immunology recommends that schools clearly identify the ingredients
in all foods served, and have medical response plans, including
access to epinephrine injections to stop severe allergic reactions.
Precautions such as improving food-handling methods, washing
utensils and tables more carefully, adopting a ``no-trade'' rule on
food and educating students about the seriousness of allergies are
more sensible than food bans.
</P>
<P>
   These measures would not limit what non-allergic students eat,
while promoting good sanitary conditions for everyone. Parents of
children who are severely allergic have good reason to fear what
happens in cafeterias. There is probably no way to eliminate all
risk, but schools have a responsibility to create policies that
reduce this hazard.

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Sept. 26:
</P>
<P>
   There are many ways to measure the force of a storm _ by
rainfall, tide height and wind speed, by the number of utility
customers inconvenienced or residents displaced, by the damage in
dollars or human lives. But none of these measures the profound
psychological force of a storm like Hurricane Georges, which has
devastated the Caribbean and southern Florida over the last few
days.
</P>
<P>
   A keen sense of what is normal protects most of us most of the
time. The occurrence of hurricanes, which arise predictably enough
to form a ``season,'' is certainly normal, even though the
conditions they embody _ torrential rain, massive disturbance of
tidal patterns, and 100-mph winds _ are extreme. The notion that
Georges is somehow a normal event brings solace to no one, for the
effect of a storm like this one is to undermine the very idea of
normality, to leave the human emotions exposed, unbuffered for a
moment, by the continuum of everyday life.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have argued that repeated exposure to rapid climatic
change is one of the underlying conditions that helped define the
human character as it evolved. This may be true of the species over
eons, but anyone who has experienced a truly violent storm knows
how quickly it can bring you to the edge of emotional self-control,
to a place that feels less like evolution than extinction.
</P>
<P>
   A storm like Georges does more than blow the roofs off houses,
flood the sewer systems and take human lives at will. It redefines
the extraordinary benignity of this earth _ the storm's eye in
which we nearly always live _ even as it makes the blue skies that
will surely follow seem tentative, a veil over a planet whose
extremes we barely know at all.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House Judiciary Committee on Friday approved
the release of thousands more pages of documents that had been
delivered by the independent counsel, finding near unanimity this
time on particularly sensitive information that would be kept from
public view.
</P>
<P>
   After days of wrangling, Republicans and Democrats on the panel
agreed to release the audiotapes of surreptitiously recorded
conversations between Linda Tripp and Monica Lewinsky, the White
House intern who had an affair with President Clinton. The
committee voted unanimously to make the same sort of deletions of
sensitive or immaterial information on the audiotapes as it did the
accompanying transcripts of the conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's meeting of the Judiciary Committee brings to an end the
first phase of the preliminary inquiry, a process marked mostly by
discord, as members and the committee staff took on the task of
sorting through the two sets of 18 boxes of documents shipped to
Congress by the independent counsel, Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   The panel is scheduled to meet again in early October and vote
whether to go forward with an impeachment inquiry, after which the
resolution would come before the full House. The measure is
expected to pass by a comfortable margin in the House, Democrats
and Republicans say. It would be the second time in 25 years that
the House of Representatives considered whether to impeach a
president.
</P>
<P>
   The documents are set to be released on Thursday at the
earliest, with the tapes probably made available a few days later
for technical reasons, promising the public a third round of
details about Clinton and his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the Tripp tapes, the documents also include the
transcripts of grand jury testimony of several important witnesses
in the case, including Clinton's secretary, Betty Currie, and his
confidant, Vernon Jordan, as well as a number of depositions and
FBI interviews with a long list of people.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing a sharp distinction from the committee's last go-around,
which was sharply partisan, Republicans cast Friday's proceedings
as a model of cooperation and comity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, we're trying to be sensitive to the American people,
of whether they need more or less,'' Rep. W. Asa Hutchinson,
R-Ark., said regarding the release of information.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats immediately tried to dispel that notion of
togetherness. There was ``a modest change'' signaling ``a
Republican retreat in the face of public opinion polls showing
increasing disappointment of what they are doing,'' said Rep. John
Conyers of Michigan, the ranking Democrat on the panel. ``At
another level, the partisanship continues.''
</P>
<P>
   In a stark departure from last week's partisan roll call,
Republicans and Democrats took 15 unanimous votes on what
information to redact or withhold, some of it for national security
reasons. On one occasion Whitewater independent counsel Kenneth
Starr requested that three transcripts _ two of people interviewed
by the independent counsel and one grand jury witness _ be kept
secret, and the committee agreed.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Many of the rest of the 23 votes on the matter were near
unanimous, with a few exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats who have listened to the tapes say they are
helpful to Clinton because they portray Mrs. Tripp as scheming and
manipulative and Ms. Lewinsky as lewd.
</P>
<P>
   The tapes contain hours of meandering conversations between the
two women as they discuss the ups and downs of Ms. Lewinsky's
relationship with the president and their legal troubles as
potential witnesses in the Paula Jones sexual misconduct case. The
tapes pose other problems because Starr noted in his report to
Congress that some of them show signs of duplication. Starr said
the matter was still under investigation because Mrs. Tripp had
testified to the grand jury that no copies were made.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans briefly considered withholding the tapes and simply
releasing the transcripts with deletions, and even Democrats were
uncertain about how to handle the tapes. But Democrats were furious
that Republicans had easily released Clinton's videotaped grand
jury testimony, and then sought to keep secret Mrs. Tripp's tapes,
accusing them of political motives. In the end, the argument for
full disclosure, which had carried so much weight with Republicans
last week, won out.
</P>
<P>
   Facing polls that show the public's distaste for the committee's
handling of the material, which many consider lurid, Republicans
said on Friday that they ``listened to each other'' and did their
best to meet Democrats halfway.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats won on several votes that split Republicans, including
one on the question of how to deal with the ``Jane Does''
interviewed by prosecutors. One vote concerned information about
Dolly Kyle Browning of Dallas, a classmate of Clinton's who has
said that she had a relationship with him for more than three
decades, which at one point included an affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``We agreed to give up on everything virtually they wanted us to
give up on,'' said Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., who is on the
committee.
</P>
<P>
   A round of verbal sparring broke out immediately following the
meeting as the two sides squabbled over the genuineness of the
bipartisanship and their eagerness to appear before the cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., conceded that ``Republicans are not
automatically saying no.''
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats were infuriated by the party-line rejection of one
of their motions to put forward a joint request for the remainder
of Starr's information, material he deemed immaterial to the case
but that Democrats believe could benefit the president. Starr has
said the Republican-controlled committee could look over the
remaining documents if they put in a ``joint request.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The key is to get more information,'' Frank said. ``To be told
we shouldn't have more information is disappointing.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said they expect to make that joint request but did
not wish to entangle Friday's proceedings with that issue, and
other issues, including the scope of the anticipated impeachment
inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Republicans tried to shift the focus back on the
committee's newfound communion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a very good day,'' said Rep. Charles Canady, R-Fla.,
``vote after vote after vote. We need to look at the record of
those votes.''

YANKS SET AMERICAN LEAGUE MARK WITH 112TH VICTORY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., N.Y., Ohio)  (js) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Yankees sent a platoon of scouts to the series
between the Anaheim Angels and the Texas Rangers this week, when it
appeared that the winner would emerge as the team that would play
in Yankee Stadium in the American League playoffs next week.
</P>
<P>
   But now there is a very real chance the Yankees will play
Cleveland in the first round, rather than the Rangers. If Texas
surpasses or matches the Indians' won-lost record this weekend, the
Rangers will play host to Boston in a division series, while
Cleveland will have to play the Yankees _ a team the Indians
eliminated in a division series last year. Going into Friday
night's play, the Rangers (87-72) were one game behind the Indians
(88-71).
</P>
<P>
   The shifting tides, however, will not affect the preparation or
the planning of Yankee manager Joe Torre, whose club has regained
its stride as it nears the regular-season finish line. The Yankees
have won five consecutive games, and Friday night, in front of
32,447 at Yankee Stadium, they established the American League
single-season record for victories, beating Tampa Bay, 6-1.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have 112 victories, one more than the 111 won by the
1954 Cleveland Indians (who played a 154-game season). With two
games remaining, the Yankees have won more games this season than
any other team except for the 1906 Chicago Cubs, who finished
116-36.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando Hernandez (12-4), who is expected to start Game 4 in the
division series, pitched five innings Friday night and allowed one
run in five innings. Andy Pettitte, who will most likely start Game
2, pitched three shutout innings. David Wells is expected to start
Game 1 on Tuesday and David Cone Game 3 on Friday. Torre intends to
formally announce his rotation over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Torre said the identity of the division series opponent would
not affect the make-up of the Yankee bullpen, which slowly has
rounded into form this month. ``The majority of our guys out there
are right where we hoped they would be,'' said Mel Stottlemyre, the
team's pitching coach.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Nelson, the most crucial piece of the Yankees' middle
relief, came back from lower back trouble Sept. 4 and Torre and
Stottlemyre were not sure if his back would hold up, despite
Nelson's stubborn insistence he would be fine. Nelson has been
excellent: in six and two-thirds innings over nine appearances, the
right-hander has allowed one hit, walked three and struck out nine.
Pitching the ninth inning in a save opportunity on Thursday against
Tampa Bay, Nelson mostly threw fastballs, whiffing Wade Boggs with
a slider that broke across the outside corner, before blowing a
high fastball past Randy Winn to end the game. ``He's answered all
the questions about whether his back would be sound enough for him
to pitch,'' Stottlemyre said.
</P>
<P>
   Said Torre: ``Nelson was, last night, by far the best outing
he's had. He had the stuff, but his command was the best he's
had.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Stanton, the left-handed set-up man, has had some moments
of inconsistency, but since blowing a lead on Aug. 25, he has
pitched 181/3 innings and allowed five runs, his earned run average
dropping from 6.41 to 5.49. He has walked four and struck out 16 in
that span.
</P>
<P>
   Mariano Rivera, the closer, is finishing what has been a strong
season, with 36 saves in 41 opportunities; he has held opposing
batters to a .209 average, walking only 14 and allowing just 3
homers in 591/3 innings. Rivera has not pitched in recent days,
however, after being hit on the chest by a batted ball, the bruise
bothering him somewhat.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend Torre met with Graeme Lloyd in Baltimore and told
him that he had a week to reverse a September slump, the inherent
threat being that Lloyd might be dropped off the post-season
roster. Lloyd, confused and somewhat miffed over the latest
uncertainty, has pitched effectively in his last two outings,
lowering his ERA to .172. The velocity of his fastball increased to
89-90 miles an hour, from 86-87 mph, and his cut fastball moved
more sharply. Lloyd, a left-hander who specializes in facing
left-handed batters, has held opponents to a .189 average this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Hideki Irabu (13-9, 4.00) and Ramiro Mendoza (10-2, 3.27) most
likely will be part of the team's long relief in the playoffs,
stepping in if a starting pitcher gets into trouble early. Torre
said he wanted to carry 10 pitchers on his post-season roster, and
Darren Holmes, an experienced reliever who has been terrific this
month _ he has allowed one run in 101/3 innings over his last seven
outings _ may be left off the post-season roster.
</P>
<P>
   -----------
</P>
<P>
   Inside Pitch
</P>
<P>
   If Texas and Cleveland finish with identical records, Texas will
win the tie breaker because the Rangers have a better record in
head-to-head play. . . . Bernie Williams was two for two Friday
night, raising his average to .337; Boston's Mo Vaughn was two for
four, improving to .336.

   At the top of the list, financial planners say, are people who
are straining to pay large premiums on term policies but whose
loved ones won't need the benefits. Simply dropping the insurance
means that the premiums go to waste, because term policies have no
cash value. A sale can redeem at least part of the years of
payments while putting a halt to the policyholder's cash outlays.

   Others who might wisely decide to sell their policies, planners
say, are wealthy people who have life insurance intended to cover
the taxes on their estates but whose assets have lost value,
leaving them with more insurance than they need.

   A company that buys insurance on the lives of employees in
high-ranking positions may want to sell a policy after an executive
retires. Similarly, a partnership or small business may have
unneeded insurance after a partner leaves or a business shuts down.

   In the right circumstances, selling an insurance policy ``could
solve some other financial problems,'' said Rick Adkins, a planner
who owns the Arkansas Financial Group in Little Rock. ``It's like a
reverse mortgage, where instead of making house payments, people
start receiving income.''

   Gary Chodes, the president of Viaticus Inc., a Chicago company
that buys unwanted insurance policies, said that about half the
people who explore deals with his company don't end up selling
their policies. Sometimes, he said, the most the company can offer
is, say, $40,000 when the cash value that has built up in a
whole-life policy comes to $50,000. In that case, he said, the
policyholder simply cashes in with the insurance company. Other
times, he said, the offer may be so small in proportion to the face
value of the policy that the owner decides to keep the coverage.

   Insurance company executives say that to build the best value in
a life insurance policy, the holder should see it through to the
end rather than share a substantial portion with a middleman.
Holders of whole-life policies can borrow against the cash value if
they are short of cash. Policies can also be used as collateral for
loans. Or, with some policies, owners can use the cash value to pay
premiums, said Mel Feinberg, a vice president at New York Life
Insurance Co. Alternatively, Feinberg said, premiums can be
reduced, or in some cases eliminated, by scaling down the face
amount of the policy.

   When the owner of a multimillion-dollar policy finds huge
premiums to be more than he can handle, said David D'Alesandro,
president of John Hancock Insurance Co. of America, heirs may
consider taking over the payments. That way, he said, the family
keeps the sum that would go to a middleman if the policy were sold.

   He also suggested that a university endowment fund or other
charity might be willing to take over the premium payments in
exchange for the death benefit; there can be tax benefits for the
policyholder in such arrangements.
