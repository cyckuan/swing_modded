<HEADLINE> German President Meets Chinese Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 11 (Xinhua) -- German President Roman Herzog met
with visiting Chinese leader Li Ruihuan here today, and stressed
that Li's visit marked the return of German-Chinese relations to
the track of healthy development.
</P>
<P>
Li, chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference, conveyed the cordial regards
from Chinese President Jiang Zemin to the German president, and
said that although this was a short visit, he had achieved a lot
from it.
</P>
<P>
Li said both China and Germany are working for regional and
world peace and stability and for promoting economic
development. Both countries stand for a multi-polarized world and
oppose the situation in which world affairs are decided by one or
two superpowers, he said.
</P>
<P>
Li stressed that China and Germany have many points in common
in various fields, such as disarmament and environmental
protection.
</P>
<P>
On China's domestic situation, Li said people should understand
China's current position from three aspects. The first is that
China must adhere to Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism
with Chinese characteristics. This theory has an extensive and
profound social foundation in the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
The second is that China must maintain unity and social
stability and guard against disturbance, he said. The Chinese
people had the common understanding that only with unity and
stability could the country develop and become strong.
</P>
<P>
The third aspect is that China should work hard to solve,
without delay, thorny problems in the economic and social life, Li
said. China's economic restructuring was going smoothly on the
whole, but there also existed certain problems.
</P>
<P>
Li said that the Chinese people are fully confident they can
handle properly the issues in the three aspects and bring China,
which is full of vigor and vitality, into the coming 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Herzog said that the important visit paid by Li signaled that
relations between Germany and China are back on the track of
healthy development.
</P>
<P>
He said Germany and China are friendly countries and China's
stability and development is of political and economic importance
for Germany.
</P>
<P>
He also said that Germany and the whole world hope to see a
stable and developing China, and Germany is willing to strengthen
its friendly relations and cooperation with China.
</P>
<P>
Herzog asked Li to extend his cordial regards to Chinese
President Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Li also briefed Herzog on China's Hong Kong
policy. Herzog said Germany is following with great interest Hong
Kong's return to its motherland on July 1. He said this is an
event of great importance, for it represents a new beginning of
the reunification process of China.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also exchanged views on international issues of
common concern.

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Rita Suessmuth, president of the
Bundestag, the lower house of the German parliament, met here
today with visiting Chinese leader Li Ruihuan.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Li, chairman of the National Committee of
the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, said
China has always attached importance to Germany's major role in
European and other international affairs, and to China's relations
with Germany.
</P>
<P>
He praised the German parliament for its important influence on
developing Sino-German relations. "We welcome more German
parliamentarians to visit China," Li told Suessmuth.
</P>
<P>
Li also said Suessmuth would be welcomed to visit China, and
briefed her on China's situation.
</P>
<P>
He said it is very important to maintain good relations between
China and Germany. China respects Germany's social system and
values, and has an earnest regard for Germany's opinions and
suggestions about China. China also hoped Germany would respect
China's various choices and views, which were based on its own
national conditions.
</P>
<P>
Suessmuth and Li also, frankly and sincerely, exchanged views
on democracy and human rights.
</P>
<P>
Suessmuth said Li's visit will surely help enhance mutual
understanding between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Opium War Film Premieres in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The premiere of "the Opium War,"
 a Chinese film epic depicting Britain's opium-peddling and the
ceding of Hong Kong, was staged here tonight.
</P>
<P>
The 140-minute film that shows history through real people
tells the audience that in June 1839 the Chinese Emperor's
Special Envoy Lin Zexu confiscated and burned over 20,000 cases of
 opium from British traders.
</P>
<P>
Thus, with support from Queen Victoria, the British parliament
agreed to launch the invasion war against China, with 271 pros
against 262 cons in voting, and occupied Hong Kong later, the
film says.
</P>
<P>
The film also shows how the Chinese people heroically fought
back against the British aggressors in the last century. Its
shooting took seven months and cost about 15 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the premiere ceremony in the Hong Kong Convention
and Exhibition Center, first Chief Executive of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region Tung Chee Hwa said the screening is
of special significance today when Hong Kong's handover is
nearing.

GENEVE, June 11 (Xinhua) -- World football body FIFA on
Wednesday said it had found there was no evidence to suggest
that Spanish referee Manuel Diaz Vega had favoured Swiss team in
 a World Cup qualifier last November.
</P>
<P>
Vega took charge of the match between Switzerland and Norway on
November 10 in Berne, following which there were allegations in
the Swiss media that Kurt Roethlisberger had acted as an
intermediary to try to persuade the Spanish official to favour the
Swiss team.
</P>

Roethlisberger was suspended for life by UEFA and FIFA in April

<HEADLINE> U.S. Big Three Narrows Gap with Japanese Rivals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The Big Three U.S. auto makers
last year narrowed their productivity gap with Japanese rivals in
North America, the Wall Street Journal reported today.
</P>
<P>
Largely due to their improved vehicle design, General Motors
Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. all made improvement in
efficiency, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Ford Motor Co. retained its standing as the most efficient
among the three major auto makers, it said. Based on a 1996 survey
by a consulting group, however, Ford still lagged behind the North
American factories of Nissan Motor Co., Honda Motor Co. and Toyota
Motor Corp., the study said.
</P>
<P>
General Motors Corp., the largest among the three, improved its
production from better-engineered components requiring fewer parts
and less time to assemble.
</P>
<P>
Chrysler Corp. did the similar improvement in reducing the
number of parts required.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese auto makers -- which together now have about as
much North American production capacity as Ford does -- remain
substantially more efficient than their Big Three rivals,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Nissan's plant in Tennessee remained the most efficient among
the auto makers in North America. It required an average of just
28.3 hours of labor to produce a vehicle. Toyota required 29.5
hours, and Honda, 30.9. Meanwhile, Ford required 37.6 hours,
Chrysler 40.5 hours, and GM 44.6 hours, the report found.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong will continue to
thrive after its return to the motherland, a high-ranking Hong
Kong official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a luncheon meeting of the German Business
Association of Hong Kong, Director-General of Trade Alan Lai said,
"As Hong Kong will become the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (HKSAR) of the People's Republic of China, "Hong Kong" will
be formally known as "Hong Kong, China" in our participation in
international organizations and conduct of international
relations.
</P>
<P>
He said that HK's beliefs and deeds have withstood the test of
time and changes and such beliefs and deeds will not be changed,
and it is this continuity in a time of change which will make Hong
Kong live and thrive after its return to the motherland on July 1.
</P>
<P>
"I am confident that Hong Kong will continue to face all these
changes with something that has remained unchanged in all these
years."
</P>
<P>
"It is the same Hong Kong people with the same resilience and
self-reliance," Lai said.
</P>
<P>
"And government and the people share a clear vision of the
economic role of the city: to live and thrive, holding on whatever
we could amidst all changes.
</P>
<P>
"The proven elements of Hong Kong's success have been enshrined
in the Sino-British Joint Declaration and the Basic Law," he
noted.

<HEADLINE> Homeless Kinds Sleep in New York City Offices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, June 12 (xinhua) -- More and more homeless children
sleep in the New York City offices, psychiatric hospitals and
private home because of the child welfare system is virtually
filled to capacity.
</P>
<P>
According to a report of the New York Times today, the number
of children pouring into foster care has surged for the first time
since 1989, leaping by 2,535, or 30 percent, over the last year.
Foster officials described the beds shortage as the worst since
late 1980's.
</P>
<P>
The report attributed the rapid rise in the number of children
pouring into foster care to two reasons. One is the City
government's decision to absorb state cuts by slashing payments to
foster care agencies, the other is the City's implementation of
its policy of removing young people more quickly from abusive and
neglectful homes.
</P>
<P>
As a result, more and more children squeezed into a system with
fewer and fewer beds.
</P>
<P>
Over the last six months, more than 1,000 foster children, most
of them teeen-agers, have spent at least one night huddled on the
floor of the city's placement offices, child welfare statistics
show. More than 60 children now languish in psychiatric wards for
weeks or longer, while an uncounted number struggle to get by with
families unable to meet their special needs.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Approval of China's MFN Renewal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton on
Wednesday urged Congressional leaders to approve the renewal of
China's most-favored-nation (MFN) trading status, warning that
denying China the status would hurt Hong Kong's economic growth.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to House Speaker Newt Gingrich and minority leader
Dick Gephardt, Clinton said: "Reversing our course on trade with
China would rebound to the detriment of Hong Kong."
</P>
<P>
Half of the U.S-China trade flowed through Hong Kong, Clinton
said. So revocation of China's MFN trading status would halve Hong
Kong's economic growth, double its unemployment with the loss of
85,000 jobs and reduce its trade by 32 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The White House also released a letter from all former
secretaries of state expressing their support for renewing the MFN
status for China.
</P>
<P>
The letter said that revoking China's MFN status "would
effectively cut off trade between our two countries and thereby
deal a devastating blow to our overall relationship".
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Wednesday, Defense Secretary William Cohen told a
conference of the Asia Society that denying China the MFN status
would not only hurt U.S. economic interests, but also damage
U.S. strategic influence and interests in Asia.
</P>
<P>
"Our friends and allies throughout Asia would question our
ability to carry out a coherent policy toward China, and thus
toward the region as a whole," he said.

<HEADLINE> Global Agencies Urged to Adopt "Pro-Poor" Policies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Globalization needs more
management -- to open opportunities for the poorest countries, not
close or restrict them in order to create employment and avoid
greater economic disparities -- both among and within countries,
according to a UN report.
</P>
<P>
Richard Jolly, special adviser to United Nations Development
Program (UNDP) and principal coordinator of the report, noted that
all countries and all major financial international agencies must
do more than just stand cheering on the sidelines about the
virtues of globalization.
</P>
<P>
The Human Development Report 1997 commissioned by UNDP said
that the global expansion of the trade and investment is
proceeding at breakneck speed -- but largely for the benefit of
the more dynamic and powerful countries in the North and South.
</P>
<P>
The just-released report points out that unless globalization
is carefully managed, poor countries and poor people will become
increasingly marginalized.
</P>
<P>
Already, annual losses to developing countries from unequal
access to trade, labor and finance have been estimated at 500
billion dollars, 10 times what they receive in foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
Though the ratio of trade to gross domestic product (GDP) for
the world has been rising over the past decade, the least
developed countries, with 10 percent of the world's people, have
only 0.3 percent of the world trade -- half their share of two
decades ago.
</P>
<P>
The share of the poorest 20 percent of the world's population
has shrunk from 2.3 percent of world income in 1960 to 1.1 percent
today -- and it is still falling.
</P>
<P>
The report offers six policies that can help governments
minimize the damage of globalization and maximize the
opportunities:
</P>
<P>
-- manage trade and capital flows more carefully. A selective
approach to the global market would follow the example of most
East Asian countries, which have some import protection, some
industrial intervention and some limit on foreign direct
investment;
</P>
<P>
-- invest in poor people, including better education and more
training programs;
</P>
<P>
-- stimulate exports from small enterprises;
</P>
<P>
-- manage new technology with investment in appropriate
technology accompanied by strong policies to build up human
capital and foster small enterprises;
</P>
<P>
-- adopt policies of poverty reduction and building up safe
nets to mitigate income inequality and economic upheaval; and
</P>
<P>
-- improve governance to build up a stronger state to suppress
social chaos and organized crime.

<P>
CAIRO, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Prime Minister Kamal
el-Ganzouri will go to Ankara Saturday to represent his country at
the first summit of the eight-member Islamic Group slated for
Sunday, the Egyptian MENA new agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The eight most populous Muslim countries, namely
Egypt, Turkey, Pakistan, Iran, Nigeria, Bangladesh, Malaysia and
Indonesia, are expected to sign a declaration launching the
Developing-8 (D-8) economic group.
</P>
<P>
Ganzouri will attend the summit on behalf of President Hosni
Mubarak, who has apologized for not attending.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Amr Moussa will head Egypt's team to attend
the foreign ministerial meetings Saturday to prepare for the
summit.
</P>
<P>
Last Wednesday, experts from the group met here to discuss joint
trade and economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said after the meeting that the June 15 summit is still
in its early stages and the prospects for economic cooperation is
yet to be seen.
</P>
<P>
According to a decision taken by the foreign ministers of the
group during their first meeting in Istanbul, each member state
will be responsible for a certain field of cooperation. Egypt was
put in charge of the trade and cotton industry sectors.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Turkish Minister of State for Foreign
Affairs Abdullah Gul held important talks with Mubarak here
Wednesday on the Turkish military incursion into northern Iraq, an
issue that has prompted Egyptian and Arab condemnation.
</P>
<P>
Gul delivered a message from Turkish President Suleyman Demirel
to Mubarak defending the military operation.
</P>
<P>
Demirel said in the message that Turkey respects Iraq's
territorial integrity but he declined to fix a date for its troop
withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak sent a message to Demirel last week in which he
expressed the Arab world's concern at the Turkish military
operation in northern Iraq that began on May 14.

TEHRAN, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Iran will advance subsidies worth
1.67 billion U.S. dollars in the bread, the staple food for the
country's 62 million population in the Persian diet, this year.
</P>
<P>
Mahmoud Karimi Nouri, director general of Iran's Crop
Organization (ICO), was quoted by today's Persian daily Hamshahri
as saying that the subsidies are meant to alleviate economic
hardship for local citizens.
</P>
<P>
However, the official said, subsidies will be given directly to
the people to prevent the wasting of bread and the illegal sale of
subsidized wheat flour.
</P>
<P>
Nouri said that Iran consumes 10 million tonnes of wheat
annually, half of which is imported.
</P>
<P>
Bread riots used to be the source of social unrest before the
1979 Islamic revolution. The government now considers wheat a
strategic product, and encourages farmers to grow wheat.

UNITED NATIONS, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Much of the world's

decades but extreme poverty can be eradicated only after multiple
strategies are adopted, according to a newly released UN agency's

setbacks that create and recreate poverty, including HIV/AIDS,
violent conflict and environmental degradation.

The report, the eighth in a series of annual reports
commissioned by UNDP, noted that for the developing countries the
gains in human and economic development have covered as much
distance in the past 30 years as the industrialized world did in a
century.
</P>
<P>
The achievements include: more than three-fourths of the
population can expect to survive to age 40; adult illiteracy has
been reduced by nearly half; and infant mortality has been cut
nearly three-fifths.
</P>
<P>
However, the other aspect of the reality is still alarming:
nearly a third of the developing world's population -- about 1.3
billion people -- live on less than one US dollar a day; more than
800 million people do not get enough to eat; nor has the progress
been equally distributed.
</P>
<P>
While recognizing that each nation will need to adopt is own
prescription for reducing poverty, the report identifies six
priorities for action:
</P>
<P>
-- initiate people-centered policies that give individuals,
households and communities expanded access to economic, social,
political, environmental and personal assets;
</P>
<P>
-- work toward gender equality, both as an end and as a means
to eradication of poverty;
</P>
<P>
-- focus on pro-poor growth in the 100 or so countries from the
developing world with a minimum target of three percent per capita
income growth per year;
</P>
<P>
-- improve the management of globalization, including better
trade policies, fair rules and fair terms for poor countries to
enter markets;
</P>
<P>
-- create a political environment so that poor people and poor
communities can be heard rather than suppressed and oppressed; and
</P>
<P>
-- take special actions for special situations to prevent
economic reversal, including peace-building efforts in war-torn
countries, providing more support to reduce their debt, increase
their share of aid and enhance their entry into global market,
especially for Africa's agricultural exports.
</P>
<P>
UNDP estimated that in the next decade the additional cost of
achieving basic social services for all and to help the poor to
get rid of poverty will amount to 80 billion dollars a year, only
0.32 percent of the world income of 25 trillion dollars or less
than the combined net worth of the seven richest men in the world.
</P>
<P>
"The resources needed to implement this agenda are a mere
fraction of the resources available -- globally and in most
countries," said Richard Jolly, special advisor to the UNDP and
principal coordinator of the report.
</P>
<P>
UNDP Administrator James Gustave Speth said that the report's
most important message is that poverty is no longer inevitable.
The world has the material and natural resources, the know-how and
the people to make a poverty-free world a reality in less than a
generation.

<P>
SARAJEVO, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of the Security
and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) announced on Thursday that it has
decided to extend the deadline of in-country voter registration
for Bosnia's local elections.
</P>
<P>
The extension of the deadline from June 16 to June 28 was aimed
at allowing more voters inside Bosnia to register, according to
David Foley, a spokesman for OSCE. The deadline for out-of-country
voter registration remains on June 14.
</P>
<P>
Foley said that out of estimated 3.5 million eligible voters,
only 1.8 million have registered, including both people inside
Bosnia and refugees abroad.
</P>
<P>
The Bosnian local elections, arranged by OSCE, will be held in
September and the race is participated by more than 100 parties.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 12 (Xinhua) -- A furniture company which is the
largest of its kind founded in Beijing by the Ministry of Forestry
started operations today.
</P>
<P>
This marks a big step forward for China's forestry departments
in making the most of their advantages, said a ministry spokesman.

State-Owned Forestry Farm Exploring Corporation invested more than
40 million yuan (nearly 5 million US dollars) to the joint venture.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Heavy Fighting Breaks Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, June 12 (Xinhua) -- There are reports of heavy
fighting between the forces from the Ethiopian government and
militiamen loyal to the Islamic fundamentalist group of Al-Itihad
Al-Islam along the border region of Gedo this morning.
</P>
<P>
Early reports said the Ethiopian forces using more than 25
tanks and armored vehicles in support with quite a large number
of infantry troops have captured the towns of Luq and Bulo Hawo.
The forces of invasion have also captured dozens of villages
including Malkaharrey, Bohol Garas, Dhusay and Karaban.
</P>
<P>
According to the report the fighting has started early in the
morning at Karaban village 25 km west of Luq town, the main
headquarters of Al-Itihad. The report further more said the line
of the fighting has today been the largest covering more than 70
km terrain.
</P>
<P>
All VHF field and commercial radios in the important towns of
Bulo Hawo and Luq went out of the air just before mid day local
time. However a radio owner who escaped the town of Bulo Hawo
said he could see a cloud of smoke atop the town.
</P>
<P>
Since the invasion has been quick and not anticipated, most of
the inhabitants of those towns have been inside their places when
the Ethiopians have captured their towns. Few of the young men
and the armed militiamen of Al-Itihad have hardly run out of the
towns to escape possible killing and torture.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Al-Itihad Al-Islam here in Mogadishu, Mr Ahmed
Bile Hassan said he can not give out the casualty figures, but
admitted the fall of the two towns to the Ethiopians. Mr Hassan
said their forces have showed resistance to the forces of
occupation, but later on retreated out of their headquarters town
for what he called military tactic.
</P>
<P>
The reason for the renewed Ethiopian advance into Somalia's
territory is not yet known, however, the spokesman for Al-Itihad
claimed that the aim of the Ethiopians is to capture the port
town of Kismaio in their attempt to obtain a seaport for their
country after loosing Assab of Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the fighting still continues at this moment at
the outskirts of Luq town with the Ethiopian forces still chasing
out the militiamen of Al-Itihad Al-Islam. The fighting is
reported to be the most serious, however no casualty figures are
available from either side.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian forces have earlier been controlling the border
town of Dolow-Somalia since December last year. The Ethiopian
incursion into Somalia followed Ethiopia's claim of chasing out
Muslim fundamentalists based in Gedo region of southern Somalia.
The invasion on the pretext of fighting an Islamic organization
has been criticized by most of the Somali politicians.
</P>
<P>
This fighting today is taking place at a time when more than
20 Somali factions are flying into Addis Ababa for what is called
a reconciliatory conference in an effort to end up the long
standing political crises in Somalia.

<HEADLINE> Party Building in Colleges Stressed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 12 (Xinhua) -- China's colleges should regard the
work of training the successors of the country's socialist
construction as fundamental for building up the Communist Party,
said an official with the State Education Commission (SEC).
</P>
<P>
He urged colleges to balance academics with the cultivation of
ethics, with priority given to ideological and political
construction, said Zhu Kaixuan, minister in charge of the SEC.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a meeting on the Party building of the Communist
Party of China (CPC), which was held yesterday by the Organization
Department and the Propaganda Department of the CPC Central
Committee and the SEC, Zhu stressed that all universities and
colleges should teach students to be both politically conscious
and professionally competent.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Party organizations and Party members serving
in the higher education field should strive to find answers to the
two major issues facing education.
</P>
<P>
One is the need to coordinate with the overall demand of the
modernization drive. The other is that the overall quality and
results of the educational system must be improved, and the
socialist cultural and ethical progress should be further
accelerated.
</P>
<P>
Zhu pointed out that the first task for the Party organizations
in the near future is to improve the general morale on college
campuses.
</P>
<P>
The Party must also improve its leadership in colleges, and
step up the reform in education on Marxist theories and on
ideology and ethics, he added.

used.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed by ZAMTEL Director for public relations

cellular telephones which the company intends to introduce on the
market soon.
</P>
<P>
Sakala said, "Previously ZAMTEL could not introduce the GSM
digital cellular telephones on the market because the company was
still using analogue microwave links."
</P>
<P>
with the new investment in place, ZAMTEL will be able to
introduce the GSM cellular telephones that are widely used in
most parts of the world.
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Director of fisheries Gordon
Mudenda has called on chiefs along lake Bangweulu in Samfya to
persuade their subjects to stop immediately using bad fishing
methods.
</P>
<P>
He told 10 chiefs at a workshop on fishing held in Samfya that
the bad methods have led to a reduction of the fish population in
the lake Bangweulu, the largest lake in the country.
</P>
<P>
According to a research, Zambians consume 70,000 tons of fish
of which 15,000 is caught from lake Bangweulu.
</P>
<P>
"The number has greatly dropped from the 1960s because of bad
fishing methods used by fishermen," Mudenda said.
</P>
<P>
He urged the chiefs to educate the fishermen to consider
future generations who would benefit from the fish there.
</P>
<P>
It is important for the chiefs to work hand in hand with the
fisheries department since the department has limited wildlife
officers to monitor had fishing methods, the director said.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 12 (Xinhua) -- France considers the on-going
fighting in the Congo Republic a threat to the whole region of
central and western Africa.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Ministry spokesman Yves Doutriaux said: "France
expresses its deep worry over the gravity of the situation in
Brazzaville.
</P>
<P>
"It strongly condemns the fighting which has already resulted
in numerous victims in the civilian population of Congo, the
destruction of the country and which could make up a threat for
the peace of the whole region."
</P>
<P>
He called on the two warring sides of the Congo Republic to
start a lasting ceasefire and join negotiations mediated by the
mayor of Brazzaville, Bernard Kolelas, and Gabonese President Omar
Bongo, in order to restore "civil peace" which was indispensable
for the holding of the country's presidential election on July 27.
</P>
<P>
Though some Frenchmen repatriated from Congo have complained
about the incapability of the French services in helping them, the
spokesman praised the French troops, the French embassy and
consulates in Congo.
</P>
<P>
They were operating "beyond the possible" to help evacuate
thousands of French nationals and other foreigners from
Brazzaville.
</P>
<P>
About 1,200 French troops, backed by tanks and armored
vehicles, are stationed in Brazzaville to escort foreigners to
safe areas, and to keep open the Brazzaville international airport
to evacuate them on military aircraft.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's Crown Prince Hassan Ibn
Talal said here today that Jordan is concerned about Turkey's
cross-border military operations which are going on in northern
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Hassan made the remarks upon his arrival at the Ankara airport
for a one-day working visit to Turkey to present the views of King
Hussein of Jordan to Turkish President Suleyman Demirel.
</P>
<P>
The crown prince said that "Jordan always condemns all kinds of
terrorism. We know that the (military) operations are staged
against terrorism. But, we can not accept any change which will
take place in the map of the region."
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian government supports a solution to the problems
through dialogue, said Hassan, adding that the stance of Jordan on
this issue will be a subject during his talks with Demirel and
Turkish Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan.
</P>
<P>
About 50,000-strong Turkish government troops launched a
massive cross-border military campaign on May 14 to attack the
illegal Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) in northern Iraq, drawing
severe criticism from many regional countries.
</P>
<P>
More than 23,000 people, including PKK members, civilians and
government troops, have been killed in conflicts since August
1984 when the PKK started a separatist war for an independent
Kurdish state in eastern and southeastern Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Rigid Law Enforcement on Stock Market Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The People's Daily, China's
leading newspaper, will publish a commentary tomorrow, calling for
more rigid law enforcement on the stock market.
</P>
<P>
The commentary says that the government has repeatedly issued
decrees and documents to ban misconduct in the stock market,
including the flow of bank money into the market, which is in
violation of government rules, and the manipulation of the market
by some listed companies.
</P>
<P>
However, a few institutions and persons have engaged in such
activities recently by ignoring the law and official decrees,
using millions of yuan of capital to cause upheaval in the stock
market.
</P>
<P>
Their actions have harmed the interests of the investors, and
disturbed the normal market order, the commentary points out.
</P>
<P>
In response to the situation, departments concerned have
severely punished responsible persons of banks and companies
involved in the cases in accordance with the law. The move is
meant to ensure the implementation of the regulations of the stock
market, and demonstrates the government's firm resolution to
safeguard the normal order on the market and protect investors'
legitimate rights and interests, the commentary says.
</P>
<P>
It continues to say that to protect the principles for an open,
fair and just stock market and to maintain its healthy
development, the supervision and management systems must be
reinforced, and law enforcement over them must be strengthened.
</P>
<P>
It says that the best way to get to the root of the misconduct
is to cut the illegal flow of bank capital into the stock market,
ban the speculation of stocks by some state-owned enterprises and
listed companies, prevent institutions and big investors from
manipulating the stock market, and standardize the flow of
information and capital.
</P>
<P>
All those who are involved in the stock market must draw
lessons from those charged with misconduct, and avoid committing
the similar mistakes. China will use both the criminal law and
administrative measures to deal with violators, the commentary
says.
</P>

prevent any risks of the stock market from occurrence and remove
them in time, it says.

WASHINGTON, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Diplomats and United Nations officials were less than
enthusiastic about the strings attached to a deal worked out by
the Clinton Administration and the Senate that would allow
repayment of a large part of the American debt to the
organization. Several envoys said that not all the demands made by
Senators would be accepted by all 184 member countries.
</P>
<P>
-- Republicans in Congress moved to prevent tens of thousands
of Welfare recipients from being covered by the minimum wage. They
want to overturn a recent ruling by President Clinton that
guarantees the minimum wage for welfare recipients participating
in "workfare" programs run by public agencies or non-profit
organizations.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- At odds with congressional Republicans on the best approach
for fighting juvenile crime, President Clinton said yesterday he
is using his executive power to create rules designed to prevent
guns from falling into the possession of minors.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- A house panel decided this week to cut the Pentagon's
fiscal '98 purchase of a new version of the F-18 to four from 20,
and use the 2.1 billion dollars saved to buy old, cheaper versions
of the fighter. The move, while unlikely to stand, explicitly
rejects the strategy Defense Secretary Cohen had chosen.
</P>
<P>
USA Today:
</P>
<P>
-- The Clinton administration will nominate NACCP Legal Defense
Fund Lawyer Bill Lann Lee to head the Justice Department's civil
rights division.

<HEADLINE> China Punishes Stock Market Rule Violators (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 12 (Xinhua) -- A number of financial institutions
and people that violated securities market rules, including the
Shenzhen Development Bank and its president, have been severely
punished, according to an official decision, which was made public
here today.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made after thorough investigations by the
Securities Committee of the State Council, the People's Bank of
China, the State Auditing Administration, the China Securities
Regulatory Commission and other relevant government departments.
</P>
<P>
The Shenzhen Development Bank used a total of 311 million yuan
to speculate in its own stocks between March 1996 and April this
year, illegally making 90.34 million yuan in profit, the decision
said.
</P>
<P>
"This act has violated the regulations of the Commercial Bank
Law banning commercial banks from engaging in stock business and
violated State rules prohibiting listed companies from trading in
stocks of their own companies," it said.
</P>
<P>
What's more serious is that the Shenzhen Development Bank
continued to speculate in its own stocks until April this year,
which has gravely disturbed the normal market order and misled
investors, the decision said.
</P>
<P>
It said that relevant departments have decided to discharge He
Yun from his post as President of the Shenzhen Development Bank
and deny his access to the financial and securities market for
five years.
</P>
<P>
Li Wei, who was in charge of securities operations of the
Shenzhen Development Bank, was also disciplined, according to the
decision.
</P>
<P>
The Shenzhen Development Bank has been fined and its illegal
profits confiscated. It has also been ordered to sell its holdings
of its own stocks and turn all profits over to the State coffer.
</P>
<P>
The decision said that between September and December of 1996,
the Shanghai branch of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China
(ICBC) provided lendings and overdrafts in huge amounts to some
securities companies for stock speculation.

<P>
During the period, ICBC Shanghai lent 910 million to Haitong
Securities Company and 6.31 billion yuan to Shenyin &AMP; Wanguo
Securities Company. It also provided Haitong with overdrafts
averaging 1.2 billion yuan daily in late October and one billion
yuan in November. Its overdrafts to Shenyin &AMP; Wanguo averaged 580
million yuan in September, 830 million yuan in October and 910
million yuan in November.
</P>
<P>
ICBC Shanghai continued to provide credit overdrafts to certain
securities institutions after the publication of a commentary in
the People's Daily on December 16, 1996, with the amount reaching
395 million yuan on December 25 alone.
</P>
<P>
"The act of ICBC Shanghai has violated State regulations
banning all financial institutions from offering lendings or
providing overdrafts for stock trading, encouraged speculation at
the stock market and had a very bad impact on the standardized and
stable development of the stock market," the decision said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the relevant departments have decided to dismiss
Shen Ruolei from his post as president of ICBC Shanghai, the
decision said.
</P>
<P>
Guangshen (Guangzhou-Shenzhen) Railway Stock Co. Ltd. is a
company listed in Hong Kong. Without a decision by the board of
directors, Chairman of the board Ge Wen'an in December 1996
entrusted Jun'an International Finance Co. Ltd, which is not
qualified to raise funds inside the country, to carry out "capital
asset management" for 300 million yuan of the funds the company
raised through stock offerings, according to the decision.
</P>
<P>
The latter then transferred the funds to Jun'an Securities
Company for stock speculation and illegally made 40 million yuan
in profits.
</P>
<P>
"These acts have gravely violated relevant State regulations
and accounting rules on securities," the decision said.
</P>
<P>
The relevant departments will, through legal procedures,
dismiss Ge Wen'an as chairman of the board and Zeng Xianzhao as
the chief accountant, and will have their demerits recorded.
</P>
<P>
The company has also been ordered to withdraw the 300 million
yuan it has used in violation of rules.

<P>
Investigations have also shown that since last September,
Haitong Securities Company, Shenyin &AMP; Wanguo Securities Company,
and Guangfa Securities Company have illegally obtained huge
amounts of bank funds. Through continual buying and selling and a
great number of two-way offsets, they manipulated the stock prices
of Shanghai Petroleum, Lujiazui, Nanyou Industry and other
companies, which resulted in abnormal fluctuations in the prices
of these stocks, disturbed the normal order of the stock market,
harmed the interests of other investors, and boosted
over-speculation at the stock market.
</P>
<P>
The relevant departments have decided to discharge Li Huizhen
as board chairman and general manager of Haitong Securities
Company, Kan Zhidong as chairman of Shenyin &AMP; Wanguo Securities
Company, and Ma Qingquan as general manager of Guangfa Securities
Company. Their demerits have also been recorded.
</P>
<P>
These three companies have been fined and their business of
trading in stocks has been suspended for one year.
</P>
<P>
Because of rule violations, Jun'an Securities Company has also
been barred from trading in stocks for half a year and has its
illegal incomes confiscated.
</P>
<P>
It is learned that the State financial and securities
regulatory departments have decided to further beef up law
enforcement in order to deal a blow to all sorts of law and rule
violations at the financial and securities markets.
</P>
<P>
Leading officials of the state-owned banks that provide other
institutions or individuals with funds for stock speculation and
the listed companies, securities firms and institutional investors
that speculate in stocks with bank credits, together with market
manipulators, will be dismissed and denied market access, the
decision said.
</P>
<P>
Those whose wrongdoings are illegal will be brought to justice,
the decision noted.

<HEADLINE> Moi: Africa Faces Marginalization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
had cautioned that Africa faced marginalization as Africans were
moving in the wrong direction and disadvantaged in the
globalization of trade.
</P>
<P>
Moi was quoted as saying on Wednesday at a workshop of the
stakeholders in the small-scale enterprises that nearly the whole
of Africans spent most of their time on empty politicking.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Africans were waging wars against themselves as
if destined for total destruction, adding that they were
completely oblivious of development and social welfare.
</P>
<P>
Like the rhino and elephant, the president said, the Africans
are an endangered species owing to their drive for
self-destruction, Kenya Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the mighty Group of Seven were the ones
who dictated the world's economic order, adding that developing
countries were disadvantaged in the globalization of trade as
they had to compete with the technological giants of the West.
</P>
<P>
Ever since the days of Alexander the Great, Moi said, some
nations have never conquered their instinctive desire to colonize
others.
</P>
<P>
"There was Alexander the Great who wept for lack of more space
to colonize. Then came the Roman Empire, followed by the
Ottomans and later the British Empire, and now America is a
superpower," the Kenyan Head of State said,
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that no foreigners would help Africans develop
and the development of the region would depend on the people
themselves and on the effectiveness of the local economic blocs
like the East African Co-operation.

<HEADLINE> Painful Illness Hits Dairy Cows in England </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 12 (Xinhua) -- A new and painful illness is
afflicting dairy cows in England, the Daily Telegraph reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Unlike mad cow disease, which terminally damages the brain, ATT
- acute tailhead trauma - attacks the rear of the animal. Some
young black-and-white Friesian-Holstein dairy cows have been found
writhing in agony on farms in Somerset, southwestern Britain,
after falling victim to the ailment which has left farmers and
veterinarians baffled.
</P>
<P>
"There appears to be a weakness at the base of the tail and we
don't know whether it is genetic," the report quoted John Shaw,
who has treated a number of cases, as saying.
</P>
<P>
The affected cattle, which suffered dislocated bones at the
base of their rather limp tails, recovered after injections of
painkillers.
</P>
<P>
However, the condition could present farmers with a delicate
problem. The affected area is the part which supports most of the
weight of the bull during mating.

<HEADLINE> New Reservoir Constructed Near Iranian Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani today picked the ground for Mamloo reservoir dam near
Tehran, a project designed to alleviate the water shortage problem
in the capital.
</P>
<P>
The dam, on the juncture of Damavand and Jajroud rivers, 40
kilometers east of Tehran, has a designed capacity of 250 million
cubic meters of water which will irrigate 5,400 hectares of
farmland. It will also operate a 8.5 megawatt hydro-electric power
plant.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the site of the dam, the president said that the
main obstacle in the way of development of Tehran is water
shortage.
</P>
<P>
To solve the water shortage problem for Iran's capital with a
population about 10 million, the Iranian president said, all
measures must be taken regardless of cost to transfer water to
various cities and parts of Tehran province, including Damavand,
Varamin, Shahryar, Robat-Karim and Karaj.
</P>
<P>
Mamloo dam will harness more than 200 million cubic meters of
river water and turn it to drinking and irrigation water, he added.
</P>
<P>
Construction of Mamloo dam and the power plant, which will
be completed by the year 2001, will cost 180 billion rials
(about 60 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The water shortage problem is serious for Tehran this year
though the capital city is supplied with water from two main
reservoirs -- one in the west and the other in the east of the
city.

<HEADLINE> Moi Accuses Amnesty of Applying Double Standard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
has accused Amnesty International of applying double standard in
the assessment of human rights violation in the country.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking on Wednesday at both the Kenyan International
Conference Center and the Kenya Science Teachers College during a
workshop of the stakeholders in the small-scale enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The president wondered why government officers serving in the
police force were never regarded as victims of human rights
violation whenever they were murdered or injured during their
course of duty.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan Head of State pointed out that Amnesty
International treated police officers as if they were not part of
mankind.
</P>
<P>
He wondered what standards were used to define human rights in
Africa as children carried guns in certain countries while mass
killings occurred in others yet no human rights action appear to
deter the trend.
</P>
<P>
President Moi pointed out that Kenya's human rights record was
far much better than the grim picture the Amnesty International
were trying to paint and urged the organization to be more
serious in its work.
</P>
<P>
He said that Kenyans did not require people like Pierre Sane,
Secretary General of the Amnesty International, to lecture them
on how to conduct their affairs.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held yesterday following a 12-day
fact-finding mission in Kenya, Sane accused the Kenyan government
of alleged human rights violations and police torture of suspects
in the east African country.
</P>
<P>
In a statement in response to the manefesto and press release
issued by Amnesty International, the Kenyan government said that
all allegations by the organization were calculated to incite
Kenyans against their government.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Palestinian Jerusalemites Opposed to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 12 (Xinhua) -- A Palestinian opinion poll
shows that the overwhelming majority of the Palestinian
residents in Jerusalem are opposed to Israel's claim of sole
sovereignty over the city.
</P>
<P>
According to the poll, conducted by two researchers, Nader
Sa'id and Jerome Segal, to over 900 Palestinian Jerusalemites,
Jerusalem is of enormous importance to Palestinians, the JMCC, a
Palestinian press service based in East Jerusalem reported today.
</P>
<P>
Ninety-two percent of the interviewees said that it is "very
important" to them personally and 94 percent said no to a
suggestion that Palestinians support Israel's sole sovereignty
over Jerusalem, "even if that would be the only way a Palestinian
state could come into being."
</P>
<P>
Seventy-two percent agree: "In case of an unacceptable
agreement on Jerusalem, Palestinians have the right to use all
means necessary to block its implementation. Thus, it is
extremely unlikely that real peace can be achieved if there is
not a compromise acceptable to both sides on Jerusalem."
</P>
<P>
Most Palestinian Jerusalemites support real peace under
certain conditions. Seventy percent "support genuine and lasting
peace with Israel in exchange for recognition of a Palestinian
state with its capital in East Jerusalem, and resolution of the
refugee issue, even though this will inevitably fall short of
justice for the Palestinians."
</P>
<P>
Palestinian Jerusalemites are open to a variety of proposals
with respect to the future status of the city. These include:
</P>
<P>
-- West Jerusalem under Israeli sovereignty and East Jerusalem
under Palestinian sovereignty, with special arrangement for
Israeli control of the Jewish neighborhoods in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
-- The Palestinians would get sovereignty over the Haram
al-Sharif (ak-Aqsa Mosque) in exchange for Palestinian
recognition of Israeli sovereignty over the Western Wall.
</P>
<P>
-- In the Old City, Israel retains sovereignty over the
Jewish neighborhoods while the Palestinians maintain sovereignty
over the Palestinian neighborhoods.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Philippine Ruling Party Facing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 12 (Xinhua) -- With the merger of three major
Philippine opposition parties Wednesday, the country's ruling
Lakas-NUCD party will face a stronger-than-ever opposition in the
May 1998 general elections.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the country's largest opposition party, Laban Ng
Demokratikong Pilipino (LDP), and two other opposition groups --
the Nationalist People's Party (NPC) and the Patrido ng Masang
Pilipino (PMP), signed an agreement to formally merge their forces
in order to win the 1998 polls.
</P>
<P>
Political observers here believe that a stronger-than-ever
opposition party emerging from the merger will become a major
obstacle for the Lakas-NUCD party led by President Fidel Ramos to
continue its one-party rule in 1998.
</P>
<P>
They said the merger enabled the previously-fractional
opposition to have better chances to beat the governing party,
which itself is in danger of breakup as its presidential aspirants
are competing for the anointment of President Fidel Ramos.
</P>
<P>
Under the merger agreement, the three opposition parties will
be dissolved to form a new opposition party called Laban Ng
Makabayang Masang Pilipino (Fight of Patriotic Common Filipinos).
</P>
<P>
The leader of the three parties agreed to choose a common
presidential standard bearer for the new party to compete with the
presidential candidate put up by the ruling party in the 1998
polls.
</P>
<P>
Controlling 14 of the 24 seats in the Senate, the new party
enjoys a comfortable majority in the upper house. In the
204-member House of Representatives, the new party holds 49 seats,
compared to 112 held by Lakas-NUCD members.
</P>
<P>
The party also has the support of 35 provincial governors and
vice governors and 500 other government officials.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, analysts here said the final ruling given Tuesday by
the Supreme Court on the fate of charter change move also gave the
new unified opposition party a good opportunity to contend with
the ruling party in the general elections.
</P>
<P>
The ruling upheld the court's earlier decision prohibiting a
pro-Ramos group from proceeding its bid to change the constitution
to lift the term limit of Ramos, effectively dashing any hope for
Ramos of running for a second term.
</P>
<P>
Under the country's 1987 constitution, Ramos should step down
as his six-year single term expires in June 1998. But Ramos, whose
economic reforms revitalized the staggering economy, is widely
seen to gain a runaway re-election victory if being allowed to
serve a second term.
</P>
<P>
"With the unbeatable Ramos not available for re-election,
opposition presidential candidates will have greater chances in
winning the election," said Senator Juan Flavier.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the ruling party is facing the danger of
breakup as its presidential aspirants will intensify their efforts
to get the endorsement of Ramos, equal to 4 million votes, after
the Supreme Court handed down the final ruling.
</P>
<P>
"The ruling party is facing higher risk of breakup than the
united opposition," said Senate President and NPC chief Ernesto
Maceda.
</P>
<P>
But meanwhile, analysts said the new opposition party still
falls short of being a formidable challenge to the ruling party
for the moment since it fails to include two other opposition
heavyweights.
</P>
<P>
They said the new party should win over the Kabalikat ng
Malayang Pilipino party and the People's Reform Party in order to
expand the united opposition front.

<HEADLINE> Four Keys Posts of HKSAR Judiciary Filled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The Judicial Officers
Recommendation Commission (JORC)(Designate) has unanimously
recommended Justice Litton, Justice Ching and Justice Bokhary be
appointed permanent judges of the Court of Final Appeal (CFA) and
Justice Patrick Chan be appointed chief judge of the High Court on
July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Announcing these recommendations today, Chief Executive Tung
Chee Hwa said that, in exercise of the duty imposed upon him under
Article 88 of the Basic Law, he would accept them.
</P>
<P>
"The three judges recommended for appointment as permanent
judges of the CFA are all distinguished Justices of Appeal and
were outstanding legal practitioners before they joined the bench.
I am pleased to accept the JORC (Designate)'s recommendation on
their appointments," he said.
</P>
<P>
The JORC (Designate), an independent body set up under Article
88 of the Basic Law for the purpose of advising the Chief
Executive on judicial appointments, recommended on May 20 that
Andrew K.N. Li be appointed chief justice of the HKSAR CFA.
</P>
<P>
"Now that the composition of the CFA is decided, the chief
justice (designate) can finalize preparations for the
establishment of the CFA," Tung said.
</P>
<P>
He voiced the confidence that "the CFA will play a pivotal role
in the development of Hong Kong's jurisprudence and legal system
in the years to come."
</P>
<P>
On the recommendation of the appointment of the chief judge of
the High Court, Tung said, "I am equally pleased with the JORC
(Designate)'s unanimous recommendation of Justice Patrick Chan as
chief judge of the High Court."
</P>
<P>
"The chief judge of the High Court will be a new post for the
HKSAR judiciary. As president of the Court of Appeal and court
leader of the High Court which will be retitled Court of First
Instance on July 1, Justice Patrick Chan will play a key role in
the HKSAR judiciary after its establishment," Tung said.
</P>
<P>
He stated: "Justice Patrick Chan is highly respected by members
of the Judiciary and the profession for his personal and judicial
qualities."
</P>
<P>
"I am particularly delighted to note that Justice Patrick Chan
was among the first batches of local law graduates from Hong Kong
University's law school. With the establishment of the HKSAR
under the policy of Hong Kong people ruling Hong Kong, there is a
great symbolic significance in having one of Hong Kong's own law
graduates filling a leading position in Hong Kong's judiciary,"
Tung noted.
</P>
<P>
"With all five key posts filled by the most capable and
suitable candidates, the HKSAR Judiciary and indeed Hong Kong's
legal system are not only assured of a smooth transition, it is
poised to continue the development of the common law in Hong Kong
in the new and challenging era ahead," Tung stressed.
</P>
<P>
Article 90 of the Basic Law requires the Chief Executive to
obtain the endorsement of the Legislature on the appointment of
the judges of the CFA and the chief judge of the High Court.
</P>
<P>
On June 14, HKSAR Secretary of Justice Elsie Leung will move a
motion to seek support from the Provisional Legislative Council
(PLC) for the four appointments.
</P>
<P>
The appointment of Andrew K.N. Li as chief justice of the CFA
won unanimous support on May 24 at the provisional legislature.

<HEADLINE> Kim Young-sam Questioned on Election Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, June 12 (Xinhua) -- South Korean opposition lawmakers
put an open questionnaire to President Kim Young-sam today, asking
him to disclose the truth on the controversial campaign fund in
the 1992 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
The seven-point open questionnaire, submitted by 124 opposition
lawmakers from the National Congress for New Politics (NCNP) and
the United Liberal Democrats (ULD), launched a new round of attack
on the president and the ruling New Korea Party (NKP) before the
coming presidential election in December.
</P>
<P>
In a public address two weeks ago, Kim admitted that he spent
in excess of the legal ceiling in the 1992 election, but refused
to reveal the amounts, saying no records were available five years
after the election.
</P>
<P>
In today's questionnaire, the opposition turned the target to
the sources of the funds as well as the expenditures, directly
asking the president to reveal the amount of funds he received
from businesses and citizens in the 1992 election which he can
still recall, even though he has little information on the funds.
</P>
<P>
They also asked whether Kim had received political funds from
former President Roh Tae-woo and the Hanbo Business Group before
and during the 1992 election, whether he had received any
congratulatory money after he won the election and whether he had
received a report on the management of the leftover campaign funds
which his son Kim Hyun-chul took over.
</P>
<P>
The opposition lawmakers said that any money received
indirectly by the president through his son and his close aide
would be viewed as a direct receipt of funds.
</P>
<P>
Kim was also asked whether he really wants to reform the
current high-cost election system by mentioning the "political
reforms and the grave decision" in the address to the nation two
weeks ago.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Further Develop Ties with Pakistan: Zno </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Visiting South African Foreign
Minister Alfred B. Zno said here today that there is tremendous
potential for further development of the Pakistan-South African
relations.
</P>
<P>
Zno said the bilateral relations between South Africa and
Pakistan were growing well. And still there exited much potential
for the two countries to develop their ties, particularly in
economic and trade areas, he added.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference at the Foreign Ministry, Zno
said that he had broad-ranging discussions this morning with his
Pakistani counterpart Gohar Ayub Khan.
</P>
<P>
The two countries decided to set up a ministerial-level
institute for regular exchanges of views and visits by senior
Foreign Ministry officials of the two countries, said Zno.
</P>
<P>
Zno, who arrived here Wednesday on a four-day visit to Pakistan
at the invitation of Ayub Khan, said South Africa strongly
supported Pakistan's participation in the proposed "Indian Ocean
Rim Association for Regional Cooperation".
</P>
<P>
South Africa also welcomed the recent development towards
improving Pakistan-Indian relations, said Zno, adding that his
government hoped that Pakistan and India would resolve the Kashmir
issue through discussions.
</P>
<P>
Ayub Khan said on the occasion that during the discussions
today he briefed his South African counterpart on Pakistan's stand
on the Kashmir issue, the latest situation in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Ayub Khan also said that he would visit the central Asian
countries including Iran, Turkey, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and
Kirghizstan next week.

<HEADLINE> 2,000 Year Old Tomb Unearthed in Guangzhou </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, June 12 (Xinhua) -- A 2,000-year old tomb dating
back to the Western Han Dynasty (206 B.C.- A.D. 24) has been
unearthed in Guangzhou, capital of south China's Guangdong
Province.
</P>
<P>
A local archaeologist said that the 12.5-meter long burial
chamber was lined with wood, and this was the first time that such
material was discovered lining one of the area's tombs.
</P>
<P>
Some 430 funerary objects ranging from lacquer ware, wooden and
bamboo articles to pottery, jade ware, and iron ware have also
been found, he said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, thousands of fruit seeds and crops samples
have been well preserved in the tomb thanks to the grave builders'
skill in sealing up the structure to prevent the infiltration of
water.
</P>
<P>
Characters found on some of the funerary articles are of high
value to archeologists engaged in research on ancient
calligraphy. He added that many wooden models of daily-life
instruments were also unearthed.

<HEADLINE> Macao Announces New Measures to Woo HK Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Macao enacted a set of new
regulations today to woo retired Hong Kong residents to invest in
Macao.
</P>
<P>
Retired Hong Kong residents or veterans will be allowed to live
in Macao for up to three years or more provided they make
investment of no less than 500,000 patacas (about 63,290
U.S. dollars) worth in the territory buying properties.
</P>
<P>
That amount of investment was only half of the previous
requirement. The government cut the investment demand from two
million patacas to one million in April last year.
</P>
<P>
According to a latest government gazette, the newly-revised
edition of residency regulations says that a person who is viewed
as a major investor of no less than 500,000 patacas and his or her
family members are entitled to acquire an 18-month temporary
residence permit, which is also renewable if necessary.
</P>
<P>
Major investors themselves, specialized technical professionals
and their family members are entitled to acquire a three-year
permit, which is also renewable.
</P>
<P>
But the gazette says that beneficiaries of the new regulations
are restricted only to permanent Hong Kong residents, retired
professionals or veterans, who can economically support
themselves.
</P>
<P>
The move was applauded by local businessmen as a boost to
Macao's sluggish economy.
</P>
<P>
"It is a spring season coming late," said Chui Sai Cheong,
president of the Macao Society of Economics Study. "The policy to
attract investment will benefit the property market and bring a
boom to the consumption market."
</P>
<P>
An analysis in today's Macao Daily News, however, is cautious
about the effect of the new regulations. It says the fact that
people outside Macao are reluctant to move into Macao is not
because they do not have enough money, but because the government
has to improve its working efficiency in handling applications.

<HEADLINE> Mud Chinese Map Made </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, June 12 (Xinhua) -- A man in northeast China's
Heilongjiang Province has made a Chinese map made of soil from 31
provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions of the country in
order to express his excitement over the return of Hong Kong to
the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Niu Shigang, from Harbin, capital city of Heilongjiang, toured
around the country to gather soil samples for more than four
months. In Beijing, he collected soil from the Old Summer Palace
which was burned down by the British and French joint forces in
1860. In Sichuan Province he took soil from Guang'an, hometown of
late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
"The places from which I collected soil from are the most
sensitive to the memories of the nation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Once back home in Harbin, he placed his soil samples in
31 glass structures in the form of outlines of the provinces,
municipalities and autonomous regions. The colorful map weighs
nearly 100 kilos.
</P>
<P>
The man said that the map is not yet complete, "with places for
Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan still vacant."
</P>
<P>
He hopes that some Hong Kong people can help him fill in the
Hong Kong area gap with Hong Kong's soil on July 1.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the map hangs at the entrance of the Zhaolin Park in
Harbin.

HONG KONG, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong will send its largest

Chinese inland areas, a local newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
About 200 students and graduates from the Chinese University of
Hong Kong have been awarded training placements or study trips to
the Chinese inland areas as part of the China Career Development
Program.
</P>
<P>
Vice Chancellor Arthur Li Lwok-cheung said the program was
launched to promote academic links with Chinese universities and
to cater for future market needs.
</P>
<P>
About half of the participants, selected from more than 300
candidates with knowledge of Putonghua, will visit renowned
Beijing University and Qinghua University.
</P>
<P>
The four-week course includes visit to public institutions in
Beijing and talks by Chinese officials and academics on
socio-political and economic systems of the Chinese inland areas.
</P>
<P>
"I hope the first-hand experience I get in Beijing will help me
prepare for my future career, especially if I'm offered a job
there," said Connie Tang Pek-man, a business administration
student.
</P>
<P>
The internship part of the program is a six-week placement at a

<HEADLINE> Annual MFN Debate Hindering Sino-US Trade Growth: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The US Congress' annual debate on
whether to grant China the most favored nation status (MFN) goes
against the need for trade and economic cooperation between the
two countries, Foreign Ministry spokesman Cui Tiankai said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Cui said that the annual debate also hinders the further
expansion of bilateral trade and economic relations.
</P>
<P>
He told a press conference that China believes that the ongoing
debate about China's MFN status in the US is unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the two sides are well aware that retaining
the MFN status for China will bring a lot of benefits to both
countries. If the MFN status were revoked, both countries will
have their interests damaged, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that bringing a stable, long-term bilateral
relationship into the 21st century is a prominent responsibility
of the two big nations for the Asia-Pacific region and the world
as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Trade and economic relations constitute an important component
of the Sino-US relationship, he said, adding that bilateral trade
and economic cooperation should be normal, reciprocal and mutually
beneficial.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that it is hard to comprehend the motive of
some US people insisting on carrying out the annual debate about
the MFN issue.
</P>
<P>
He said that despite continued growth of US exports to China
and rapid expansion of bilateral trade in recent years, the US
restriction on the export hi-tech products to China has become a
major reason for its trade deficit with China. The restriction has
posed many obstacles to the expansion of US exports to China, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese side hopes that the US side will take measures to
reduce obstacles in bilateral trade and economic cooperation, he
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar sank to its
lowest level in four months today as new job data was interpreted
as strongly supporting the prospects of another cut in official
interest rates in the near term.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar ended at 75.18 US cents, off a post-data
low of 75.03. It had closed previously at 75.98 US cents.
</P>
<P>
Rothschild Australia foreign exchange trader Paul Macarounas
said the unit had been trading quietly ahead of the jobs report at
around 75.65 US cents.
</P>
<P>
"And then there was no hesitation from the market to sell it,"
he said, noting the break of key support at 75.50 US cents.
</P>
<P>
The May labor force report showed total employment fell by a
seasonally adjusted 40,300 to 8.38 million in the month, compared
to a rise of 37,000 in the previous month.
</P>
<P>
The unemployment rate rose to 8.8 percent from 8.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
A survey of 22 economists conducted today by the Australian
Associated Press found that 41 percent thought there was now a
better than 50 percent chance of a rate cut occurring in the third
quarter.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Australian dollar regained some ground against
the Japanese yen on the day, in line with a bounce higher in the
US dollar/yen rate.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar was at 85.69 yen, up from 84.23 Wednesday
and ended at 1.2944 marks, from 1.3012 Wednesday.

<P>
CANBERRA, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Australian shares raced to a
record closing high today, inspired by dramatic surge in News Corp
and renewed speculation of another easing in monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
The all ordinaries index closed 24.4 points up at 2,638.1, off

</P>
<P>
The close beat the previous record of 2,628.9 points reached on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Lance Jones' broker Hamish Dee said the market rallied on a
combination of strong performances from News Corp and ANZ bank,
and weaker-than-expected employment figures which revived talks of
an interest rate cut.
</P>
<P>
"News Corp was the big mover along with ANZ, so those two
stocks between them were the main reason for our market closing up
as strongly as it did," Dee said.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Bureau of Statistics released the labor force
data, showing the country's unemployment rate was a seasonally
adjusted 8.8 percent in May after being 8.7 percent in April.
</P>
<P>
Economists had been expecting a jobless rate at 8.7 percent and
the creation of about 15,600 jobs during the month.
</P>
<P>
The fall prompted economists to increase their expectations for
the Reserve Bank of Australia to ease rates further in the second

<HEADLINE> Internet to Offer S. Africans Cheaper Phone Calls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 12 (Xinhua) -- South Africans will enjoy
much cheaper international telephone calls when the Global
Internetwork service is introduced in South Africa next month,
the local daily "Business Day" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The launch of Internet service will see the price of
international calls fall 80 percent in some cases to equal the
cost of local calls, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The two-way system, which is capable of transmitting voice,
fax, video and data via the Internet, would not require the
caller or recipient to have a computer, Ivan Fafandjel, the local
presentative of call-back operator U.S.A. Global Link was quoted
as saying.
</P>
<P>
The system transforms analogue voice tones to digital signal
for transmission over the Internet. The digital signal is
reconverted to analogue for transmission over the local telephone
service.
</P>
<P>
Fafandjel said the discounted call rate is expected to attract
strong support from local private and business users.
</P>
<P>
However, the plan has been slammed by South Africa's
state-owned telephone company, Telkom, which stands to lose
valuable long-distance call revenue.
</P>
<P>
Rhynie Greef, the managing executive of Telkom's international
business unit, said the use of the Internet for voice
communications was in direct conflict with Telkom's exclusive
rights to provide fixed-line voice communication services.
</P>
<P>
He referred to operators that used the system as "pirates",
taking what was not theirs and investing nothing in the
establishment or maintenance of the local telecommunications net
work.

BRUSSELS, June 12 (Xinhua) -- NATO defence ministers gathered
here today for a two-day meeting to discuss reforms of NATO's
military command structure, peacekeeping mission in Bosnia and
NATO's eastwards expansion.

<P>
The U.S.-France struggle for control of the Allied Forces
Southern Europe, NATO's joint command headquarters, in Italy's
Naples, will also be on the top of the meeting's agenda.
</P>

France has demanded that the post in the Southern Region, which
has so far been held by an American general, be handed over to an
European in order to make the European defence identity more
visible, while the United States has rejected the suggestion.
</P>
<P>
The ministers will discuss a greater international role in
Bosnia, demanded by the United States, including sending a special
force to find and arrest indicted war criminals, though there are
talks of NATO cutting its 35,000 peace protection troops in Bosnia
to 20,000 by November.
</P>
<P>
They will exchange views on the countries to be invited to join
NATO during its summit in Madrid on July 8-9.
</P>
<P>

while most of the European allies insist that Romania and Slovenia
be added to the wave.

<HEADLINE> Bank Offers 1.5-Billion Yuan Loans for Aviation Technology Upgrading </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of China (BOC) has signed
an agreement with the China Aviation Technology Import and Export
Corporation, to provide loans totaling 1.5 billion yuan (180.7
million US dollars) for the enterprise as circulation funds for
the rest of 1997.
</P>
<P>
The loans will ensure capital support for the company's major
projects, and the interest rate will be in line with the standard
set by the People's Bank of China, the central bank, instead of
being raised, according to Zhao Ange, vice-president of BOC.
</P>
<P>
In July 1996, China's State Economic and Trade Commission
(SETC) issued a circular to banks urging them to implement the
policy of assisting 300 key state-owned enterprises. The China
Aviation Technology Import and Export Corporation was one of those
300 enterprises and it was covered by BOC.
</P>
<P>
Since the corporation was set up in 1979, BOC has granted it
loans to the tune of some 10 billion yuan (1.2 billion US
dollars).

<HEADLINE> Glamor of An Euro-Style Street Restored in Northeast China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Harbin, June 12 (Xinhua) -- People here compare it to London's
Regent Street, or even the Champs Elysees in Paris. It is
convincing when the century-old Central Street bears its refreshed
look, a result of 18-month repairing, painting and decorating.
</P>
<P>
The 1.5-km-long Central Street, with its exotic appearance fronted
by hundreds of European-style buildings, has become an outstanding
landmark of Harbin, capital of northeast China's Heilongjiang
Province.
</P>
<P>
Its history dates back to 1890 when massive construction of
railway network in China's northeast drew flocks of migrants from
Russia, France, the United States, Germany, Britain and Italy to
the city. They resided along the street, and built buildings
characteristic of their homelands.
</P>
<P>
Within a decade or two, Central Street had became one of the
best-known and prosperous streets in East Asia.
</P>
<P>
However, in the past 100 years, its glamor gradually faded.
The look and interiors of many buildings along the street became
rundown and tarnished.
</P>
<P>
At the end of last year, the municipal government of Harbin
decided to refurbish the street and make it a shopping street. At
the same time the street became a traffic free zone.
</P>
<P>
Now the fruits of the work can be enjoyed. The street now bears
a bright appearance, mainly of yellow, white and green colors, only
occasionally a gray. As for the architectural styles, there are
examples of Baroque, Renaissance, Neo-Classicalism and even a bit
of avant-garde.
</P>
<P>
To Chinese people, the street is a gallery of European art
and architecture. Besides, Harbin wants it to be a tourist
attraction to foreign visitors who, while walking in and out
exquisite shops, may feel they are at home.

<HEADLINE> Toilet Revolution Relieves Local Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Central China's Henan province is
spearheading a toilet revolution with real Chinese characteristics.
</P>
<P>
The "funnel-like toilet with double-urns" is the province's
special invention for farmers, who were used to relieving
themselves in shallow pits dug on farmland.
</P>
<P>
The new toilet is said to have more functions than the old one,
and benefits both farm production and the call of nature. Experts
said that it can effectively kill harmful bacteria while
preserving 95 percent of the effluent's nitrogen.
</P>
<P>
Waste recovered from the toilet can be used to fertilize the
fields -- and it's cleaner, making the spread of infectious
diseases less of a threat, experts said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the toilet is quite cheap, according to sources,
who said that the toilets are being used by 6.8 million farming
families in Henan.
</P>
<P>
Toilet revolutions are also being waged in cities, where the
main problem is the stench of old public lavatories in back
alleyways.

international appraisal standards since the industry was
established in 1989, an official of the State Administration of
State Property said.
</P>
<P>
The issuing and implementation of a set of regulations on the
evaluation of state assets in 1991 marked the first step, which
indicated that China's asset appraising industry had
embarked on a path of standardized development, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Other major steps include the founding of the China Asset
Evaluation Association in December 1993, the introduction of a
system of certified public valuers and the publication of
opinions and advice on practical asset evaluation.
</P>
<P>
As enterprises reform, transfer of property rights and asset
restructuring are on the increase, hence asset evaluation
has become important.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show that China had more than 3,300 asset
evaluation agencies and over 50,000 professional appraisers by the
end of last year. Evaluators appraised assets worth more than
2,202 billion yuan (about 265.3 billion US dollars) in book value
between 1989 and last year, with the post-evaluation value of the
appraised assets reaching 3,241 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
According to existing Chinese laws and regulations, state
assets must be appraised for economic activities such as setting
up Sino-overseas equity joint ventures or contractual ventures,
asset auctions and transfers, enterprise mergers, bankruptcies and
alliances.
</P>
<P>
The symposium was jointly organized by the China Asset Evaluation
Association, United Nations Development Program and China
International Economic and Technical Exchange Center of the
Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Criticizes AI for "Presumptuous" Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(by Wang Jinyu)
</P>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government last night
criticized Amnesty International (AI) for its "presumptuous"
report "calculated to incite Kenyans against their government".
</P>
<P>
In a press release issued here on Wednesday following a 12-day
fact-finding mission in Kenya, the AI accused the government of
violations of human rights and of dragging its feet on legal and
constitutional reforms.
</P>
<P>
In a strongly worded rejoinder last evening to the AI
statement, the Kenyan government told the visiting AI
Secretary-General Pierre Sane that it would not tolerate
prescriptions from AI on how to deal with alleged violations of
human rights.
</P>
<P>
Kenya reminded AI that it had machinery and a working system
of handling matters such as human rights violations and would
continue to address itself to cases of human rights violations.
</P>
<P>
The rejoinder said that the AI obsession with the torture and
human rights violations in Kenya were not genuine but were
political in support of opposition political activities.
</P>
<P>
It pointed out that some cases of torture and human rights
violations had always been individualized and the government had
already taken actions against the perpetrators of such crimes.
</P>
<P>
"If Amnesty wanted to be fair and objective, it should have
recognized the positive steps that the government has taken to
deal with law enforcement officers who have gone overboard in the
execution of their duties."
</P>
<P>
During its stay in Kenya, the AI delegation claimed that they
interviewed a cross section of Kenyans, among them politicians,
human rights activists, donors and diplomats, and released a
manifesto on human rights situation in Kenya to which Kenyan
Vice-President George Saitoti reacted angrily.
</P>
<P>
In a commentary, the local newspaper Kenya Times, organ of the
ruling Kenya African National Union, accused AI of having taken
side on Kenya's political affairs, asking "can Amnesty
International be trusted to produce a credible report on the
human rights situation in this country?"
</P>
<P>
The commentary said that "while hundreds of thousands of
innocent people were slaughtered in Rwanda, Amnesty International
was busy searching for non-existent 'evidence' of human rights
abuses in peaceful Kenya."

<HEADLINE> Anti-Smoking Campaign Launched In Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 12 (Xinhua) -- A national anti-smoking campaign
designed to encourage smokers to kick the habit was launched today
by federal Health Minister Michael Wooldridge.
</P>
<P>
The campaign, which targets the 25 percent of Australians who
smoke, is the first to enjoy the support of federal, state and
territory governments, Wooldridge said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
According to him, 18,000 Australians died each year from
smoking-related illness, while treatment for smoking-related
illness costs the community 12.7 billion Australian dollars
(nearly 10 billion U.S. dollars) a year.
</P>
<P>
The federal government has committed 7 million Australian
dollars (5.32 million U.S. dollars) over two years to the
campaign.
</P>
<P>
The campaign includes television and print advertisements and
practical support for smokers who want to quit. The television ads
use graphic images which show how smoking damages a person's
health.
</P>
<P>
"This is a determined effort by governments, and supported by
the Australian Cancer Society, the Australian Heart Foundation,
the Australian Medical Association and the College of General
Practitioners," the minister added.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Welcomes IMS-GT Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 12 (Xinhua) --Singapore today welcomed
Indonesia's offer to include five more of its provinces into the
Indonesia-Malaysia-Singapore Growth Triangle (IMS-GT).
</P>
<P>
Singapore Minister of Trade and Industry Lee Yock Suan said
this at a one-day Ministerial Meeting of IMS-GT in Jahor Baharu,
370 km southeast of Kuala Lumpur, according to reports reaching
here.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian provinces to be included into the growth
triangle are Bengkulu, Jambi, Lampung, South Sumatera and West
Kalimantan, according to the reports.
</P>
<P>
With the inclusions, the IMS-GT will expand its geographical
area from 208,000 square km to 565,000 square km and its market
size from 15 million to 34 million people.
</P>
<P>
Apart from Singapore, the IMS-GT growth triangle presently
covers Riau and West Sumetera of Indonesia and Malaysia's states
of Negeri Sembilan, Melaka (Malacca), Johor and Pahang.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the IMS-GT region received more than 8 billion U.S.
dollars in foreign direct investment (FDI).
</P>
<P>
The Singapore minister urged the IMS-GT to continue to sharpen
its competitive edge and improve the investment climate for
investors.
</P>
<P>
"We must continue to work together and maintain a pro-business
environment to allow businesses to prosper. We must streamline
government regulations and procedures to make it easier to do
businesses here," he was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said is up to member countries to turn the IMS-GT's strong
potential into benefits for both the business community and the
people in the region.
</P>
<P>
The IMS-GT, part of the broader framework of ASEAN cooperation,
would benefit from the formation of the ASEAN Free Trade Area
(AFTA) and the development of growth triangles would in turn
enhance ASEAN integration, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Being three close neighbors within ASEAN, we (Singapore,
Indonesia and Malaysia) can set the pace for forging economic
links within ASEAN," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian International Trade and Industry Minister Rafidah
Aziz and Indonesia's Minister for Production and Distribution
Hartarto also attended the meeting.

<HEADLINE> Oil and Gas Exploration Active in West China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region
in northwest China is expected to produce 30 million tons of crude
oil and 6.9 billion cubic meters of natural gas by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
To date, a total of 35 oil and gas fields have been developed
in the three great basins of Tarim, Junggar and Turpan-Hami in the
region, with total annual crude output hitting 12.8 million
tons. In addition, Xinjiang has developed a refining capacity of
eight million tons.
</P>
<P>
Oil and gas production and petrochemical processing in Xinjiang
has generated an annual output value totaling 14.5 billion yuan,
according to an official from China National Petroleum Corporation
(CNPC).
</P>
<P>
The three hydrocarbon-rich basins of Xinjiang, with total
areas of 740,000 sq km, account for one quarter of the country's
total oil and gas resources. The region's crude oil resource is 28
percent of the national total, and its gas, 33 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to CNPC, the three great basins of Tarim, Junggar and
Turpan-Hami have entered a peak period in oil exploration and
production, where a total of 75 large-sized industrial oil-bearing
structures have been identified.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has invested over 10 billion yuan over
the past two years to speed up oil and gas development in the
basins, which are expected to produce 15 million tons of crude by
the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
The oil experts here said that two oil fields, each with
reserves above 100 million tons, have been discovered in the Tarim
Basin and Junggar Basin.
</P>
<P>
So far, nine oil fields and 34 oil-bearing structures have been
found in Tarim, which has developed an annual crude output of 2.5
million tons.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that the Tarim Basin has oil and gas resources
totaling 10.1 billion tons and 8.3 trillion cubic meters
respectively, amounting to one seventh and one quarter of the
country's reserves.
</P>
<P>
Fourteen large-sized oil and gas fields have so far been
discovered alone in the Junggar Basin, with gas-bearing areas
covering over 800 sq km. Presently, the Cainan Oil Field, the
country's first desert oil field with reserves in excess of one
million tons, has become operative.
</P>
<P>
Output from fields in the Turpan-Hami Basin is expected to
double this year to three million tons.
</P>
<P>
The CNPC source noted that notable progress has also been made
in oil and gas exploration in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia region,
the Sichuan Basin and Qinghai province where a gas-bearing area
covering more than 2,000 sq km has been found with proven gas
reserves totaling 100 billion cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
A senior CNPC official noted that the northwestern parts of
China will pay attention to both oil and gas development and oil
processing. By the end of the century, the region will be
developed into the country's most important bases of both oil
production petrochemical processing.
</P>
<P>
China plans to invest 29 billion yuan in the coming five years
to develop 39 petrochemical projects, with petrochemical output
value expected to hit 16 billion by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
And by that time, the annual output value is expected to reach
a value of 28.8 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
To speed up large-scale oil and gas development, the government
of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region has worked out a series of
preferential policies in terms of examination and approval of
projects, raw materials supply and use of land.

<P>
HAIKOU, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Only 3.5 percent of the residents
in Hainan, one of China's most open and economically-developed
provinces, said that they are not satisfied with their marriages,
a recent survey shows.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted in China's southern island province of
Hainan, revealed that more than 91 percent of the respondents
are satisfied or basically satisfied with their marriages.
</P>
<P>
Most respondents believe that love and harmony are the most
important factors for a family, and money should not take an
important position in dealing with family relations, according to
the survey conducted by the Hainan Provincial Women's Federation.
</P>
<P>
The survey shows that traditional value still dominates family
life. Some 63 percent of the respondents said that they have
maintained a good relationship between themselves and their
mothers-in-law. Only 1.9 percent said they are in a bad
relationship with their mothers-in-laws.
</P>

Hainan families, and 94 percent of the respondents said that they
would turn to the legal means to protect themselves if their
rights and interests are infringed.

<HEADLINE> Bus Links up Villages in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Wang Xixu, a 62-year old man
living in Cuijia Village, Huantai County in Shandong province,
never dreamed of having a regular bus stop nearby his house
located in one of the most remote parts of the province.
</P>
<P>
Now he has got the chance because Huantai, which covers 510 sq
km and has a population of 470,000, has become one of the few
counties in the whole country to link up its villages with regular
bus services.
</P>
<P>
"I used to get to the market or county town by riding a
bicycle," said Wang, "and it wasn't much fun on rainy days."
</P>
<P>
In November 1995, one year after Huantai achieved its goal to
connect all the county's 343 villages with asphalt-covered roads, a
well-managed inter-village bus network came into being.
</P>
<P>
The inter-village bus system has boosted the growth of the
county economy. Numerous factories and household-based businesses
have sprung up in this traditionally agricultural county. In
1996, the county's industrial output stood at 6.19 billion yuan,
up 32.7 percent compared with that of two years before.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the convenient passenger-transporting system has
helped over 80,000 excess rural laborers in Huantai go to other
parts of the country to find jobs. Last year, these farmer-turned
-workers brought home 628 million yuan, up 36.3 percent over the
figure of 1994.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, a fledgling tourism industry has started in
Huantai -- a direct benefit brought by the bus service. In
1996 alone, some 800,000 domestic and overseas tourists traveled
to the county and spent eight million yuan there.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Ministry of Communications told Xinhua that
the ministry has for long promoted the policy of encouraging
localities to develop passenger-transport means in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
They stress that it is economic reform and increasing rural
demands which have stimulated development in the respect. "So we
have never regarded the bus service a government enforced effort,"
they said.
</P>
<P>
However, consistent efforts by both central and local
governments to develop road networks in the countryside have paved
the way for the rural bus service, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
"All buses in Huantai are privately-owned and managed," said an
official from the county's transport bureau, "but they are
under strict supervision from the government."
</P>
<P>
"Those who violate rules will be deprived of their licenses,
and meanwhile, to maintain a reasonable profit-making level, the
number of buses involved in the network has been strictly
controlled," he said, noting that over 50 applications for
licenses were turned down by his office.
</P>
<P>
A bus that joins the service can generate around 20,000 yuan
per year in net profits to its owner, said the official.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhang Zhiqiang, Director of the Highway Management
Department under the Ministry of Communications, inter-village bus
networks, covering all local villages, have been formed in only 43
counties in the country. However, many counties are working hard
to reach the goal, he said.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1996, according to Zhang, China had 370,000 buses
in regular, public service throughout the country, of which 45
percent were operating in rural areas. Meanwhile, 100,000
taxi cabs operate in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Last year, rural passengers accounted for 60 percent of the
total handled by land passenger carriers, he said.
</P>
<P>
The official said that, at present, 95 percent of small towns
as well as 74 percent of villages have been hooked up to the
network of bus services across the country. China has 16,000 bus
stations acting as hubs on the network.
</P>
<P>
The ministry hopes to make 95 percent of small towns and 80
percent of villages accessible by regular passenger bus services by
2000, the official said.

<HEADLINE> China, ASEAN Viewed as South Korea's Prime Competitors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, June 12 (Xinhua) -- South Korean export companies see
China and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) as
the most formidable competitors in international trade markets, a
survey on local trade firms has shown.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey conducted by the Korea International
Trade Association (KITA) on 1,000 export firms in 33 business
categories, 34 percent of them hold this view.
</P>
<P>
This represents a sharp contrast with past trends when the
newly industrialized countries and areas (NICA) like Singapore,
Taiwan and Hong Kong were the strongest rivals for South Korea.
</P>
<P>
About 27 percent of the questioned in the current survey viewed
the NICA as the most powerful competitors to be followed by Japan.
</P>
<P>
With regard to the competitiveness of South Korea's export
commodities, 53 percent said that they have less advantage
compared with their rivals.
</P>
<P>
Some respondents said the weaker competitiveness of South
Korea's export goods is due to higher price and lower quality.

<HEADLINE> Australia Retorts Japan's Criticism of Hanson Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Australian Deputy Prime Minister
Tim Fischer hit back today at Japan for its criticism against
Australia's handling of human rights and Hanson issues, saying
Japan has one extreme group with a very unreformed view with
regard to World War II.
</P>
<P>
In his bid to defend Australia's handling of the Pauline Hanson
issue, the deputy prime minister said Japan also has extreme
organizations which his government does not feel happy about.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Financial Review reported Wednesday Japan has
softened its support for Australia's role in Asia after doubts
were expressed by a Japanese Foreign Ministry official about the
direction of the race debate and the government's handling of
human rights issues.
</P>
<P>
The official expressed surprise at the way in which the debate
over Pauline Hanson's comments has been allowed to drag on and not
dealt with quickly by the federal government, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
"We were embarrassed when Australia opposed Myanmar's entry
into the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the
way it was handled," said the official.
</P>
<P>
Japan Wednesday denied it was softening support for Australia's
role in Asia and said views expressed by the Japanese official did
not represent the official policy.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese Embassy issued a statement reaffirming support for
Australia's participation in this year's Asia-Europe meeting as an
Asian member, currently a major focus of Australia's diplomacy in
the region.
</P>
<P>
The deputy prime minister told the Australian Broadcasting
Corp. AM program today, "I remind Japan ... that we have
difficulties with some aspects and elements of their more extreme
organizations".
</P>
<P>
"I acknowledge also that they are a democracy with freedom of
speech, so is Australia; there are things you must accept as you
get with the bilateral relationship," said Fischer.
</P>
<P>
"One extreme group has a very unreformed view with regard to
World War II. I don't like that," he added.
</P>
<P>
The deputy prime minister, who is also the country's trade
minister, did not say which group he was referring to.
</P>
<P>
"I am not going to dwell on it because what I am focusing on
it as minister for trade is building up the overall momentum of
the bilateral relationship between Australia and Japan," Fischer
said.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday night, Fisher told an institute of company directors
meeting in Melbourne that education and tourism were the
Australian industries most likely to be negatively affected by
overseas publicity about Hanson.
</P>
<P>
"The Pauline Hanson agenda is destructive of Australian jobs.
No ifs, no buts, it should be seen that way," Fischer said.
</P>
<P>
"We have over 50 billion Australian dollars (38 billion U.S.
dollars) of our export trade directed at Asia and each and every
one of the negative stories she generates about Asia are picked up
by (Australia's trade) competitors and faxed through the networks
of Asia," He said.
</P>
<P>
Independent MP Pauline Hanson has been advocating reduction in
intake of Asian immigrants and an end to foreign investment in
Australia.

<HEADLINE> Second IMS-GT Ministerial Meeting Held in Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia today urged the
governments in the Indonesia-Malaysia-Singapore Growth Triangle
(IMS-GT) to play a pro-active role in promoting investment and
trade cross-flows within the region.
</P>
<P>
The main objective is to have a focused approach in
implementing ASEAN regional and sub-regional cooperation and
integration and to realize the optimum benefits of public-private
sector partnerships, Malaysian International Trade and Industry
Minister Rafidah Aziz told the Second IMS-GT Ministerial Meeting.
</P>
<P>
The one-day meeting was being held in Johor Baharu, 370 km
southeast of the capital. Singapore's Minister of Trade and
Industry Lee Yock Suan and Indonesia's Coordinating Minister for
Production and Distribution Hartarto were attending the meeting,
the Malaysian national news agency Bernama reported.
</P>
<P>
Rafidah said there must be a coherent and systematic management
of the economic synergy and the business communities of the
sub-region must benefit from such an effort.
</P>
<P>
Within the context of Pan ASEAN trade liberalization and
investment facilitation, the sub-regional public-private sector
initiatives should assume the necessary catalystic role in moving
forward such objectives, she said.
</P>
<P>
She said the experience of the business community operating at
the sub-regional can provide an impetus to the respective
governments to continually monitor policies and procedures so as
to make for enhanced transparency, predictability and credibility.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN commitment to evolve a dynamic and liberal ASEAN Free
Trade Area (AFTA) and an attractive and competitive ASEAN
Investment Area should be realized and operationalized at the
sub-regional level in the most effective way, she said.
</P>
<P>
Borders within the sub-region can virtually be eliminated and
cross-border resource flows and activities could be significantly
promoted, she added.
</P>
<P>
"Within the IMS-GT sub-region, each individual constituent
member becomes the other's economic hinterland and provides each
other with the complementing inputs for optimizing economic
resource mobilization and assisting in individual development
objectives," Rafidah said.
</P>
<P>
She said the IMS-GT could make for a more balanced distribution
of growth and development benefits as well as exploiting the
economic potential of the areas in the sub-region.
</P>
<P>
Today's IMS-GT ministerial meeting provided a good opportunity
for the three neighbors to review the present status of
cooperation within the triangle in efforts to further consolidate
economic linkages.
</P>
<P>
The IMS-GT, formerly known as the Singapore-johor-Riau (SIJORI)
Growth Triangle, covers Singapore, West Sumatera in Indonesia, and
Malaysia's states of Pahang, Negeri Sembilan and Melaka (Malacca).
</P>
<P>
It has emerged as a viable ASEAN investment area. Malaysian
businessmen have benefited greatly from reverse investments in
Sumatera, Indonesia, and this has been the same for Singapore,
whose investments in Malaysia have been growing.
</P>
<P>
The governments of Malaysia, Indonesia and Singapore are making
everything effort to facilitate cross-border investments in the
IMS-GT.
</P>
<P>
Any growth in the triangle could serve as a model for other
triangles in the ASEAN region and for cooperation on a global
basis, observers said.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong to Be More Prosperous After Return: Statesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong will become more
prosperous under the principle of "one country, two systems" after
its return to China on July 1 this year, a senior Japanese
statesman said.
</P>
<P>
Hata Tsutomu, former Japanese prime minister and president of
the Japanese Dietmen's League For Japan-Hong Kong, told Chinese
reporters recently that China's resumption of the exercise of
sovereignty over Hong Kong is an event of great significance in
the contemporary world.
</P>
<P>
China has settled the issue of Hong Kong, a thorny one
concerning national sovereignty, through negotiations with
Britain, in which the late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping played an
outstanding role, said Tsutomu, who is also the leader of Japan's
Sun Party.
</P>
<P>
He noted that politically, the appropriate solution of the Hong
Kong issue depends on the concept of "one country, two systems,"
initiated by Deng.
</P>
<P>
"I have heartfelt esteem for Mr. Deng Xiaoping's insight,
wisdom and decision," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the prospects of Hong Kong after the return, he said it will
maintain its position as the financial center and entrepot of
Asia, and its stability and prosperity beneficial to China as well
as to Asia and the whole world.
</P>
<P>
The successful solution to the Hong Kong issue will contribute
to the final reunification of China, he said.
</P>
<P>
Tsutomu said that as a genuine friend of China, he will go to
Hong Kong to attend celebrations marking its return to China and
to witness the great moment and feel its historical significance
himself.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Restructuring to Boost Science Development (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Most of Chinese scientists and
engineers in research institutions, who used to launch research
programs according to state plans, now have to seek
market-oriented research projects.
</P>
<P>
Only a number of them can be engaged in state-funded basic
research and high-tech projects.
</P>
<P>
The present restructuring is deemed as a strategic
transformation by the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), China's
top research organ with 123 institutions and 12 branches.
</P>
<P>
Wang Yumin, CAS Deputy Secretary-General, said among 70,000
researchers in the CAS, about 10,000 have moved to high-tech
enterprises and half of the personnel have shifted from the
research of basic sciences to projects of regional economic
development and market-oriented ones.
</P>
<P>
Song Yong, head of Restructuring Department of the State Science
and Technology Commission (SSTC) noted that starting from this
year, China began an overall restructure reform in state and
ministry level research institutions all over the country.
</P>
<P>
He said that the restructuring would not "produce laid-off
scientists." The problem is that too many scientists were engaged
in basic researches under the planned economic system.
</P>
<P>
The official stressed that "China is greatly in need of
scientists, they are far more from being outnumbered. The reform
is aimed at abolishing repeated research organs and establish new
ones according to the world trend and economic development."
</P>
<P>
China now has 1,058 research organs at state or ministry levels
which employed over 600,000 people.

<P>
Statistics from CAS show that the annual per capita research
fund for a US scientist or an engineer is 160,000 US dollars,
190,000 in Japan, 36,000 in the Republic of Korea, but 6,600 in
China.
</P>
<P>
The research institutions under the Ministry of Communications
will lead the rest of China in experimenting such restructuring. An
official with the ministry said the Ministry of Communications
will establish three research centers, namely shipping, highway
transport and water transport engineering by the end of 2000.
</P>
<P>
The researchers will be selected from the original 16 research
organs under the ministry. The rest of the research organs will
either join the enterprise groups of the ministry or turn into
science and technology oriented enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The CAS Institute of Applied Mathematics will also spearhead
such reform in the CAS. Zhang Xiangsun, director of the institute
said the total number of researchers in his institute has been
reduced from 120 to some 80 after some incompetent research staffs
quit here and other aged scientists retire.
</P>
<P>
He explained that his institute has imposed a contract system
for the young researchers while providing "iron rice bowls" for
the old.
</P>
<P>
The director said, the newly invited researchers, chosen from
people with doctor's degree by exams, concentrate on their
research programs despite relatively low income.
</P>
<P>
The young researchers here are encouraged to have short-time
study or work in the western countries to master the global trend and
increase their income at the same time.
</P>
<P>
Sang Yong said the SSTC will not issue any compulsive orders on
the reform of the research institutions, but such restructuring
will be implemented step by step.
</P>
<P>
He believed that after the overall restructuring, China's
research organs will become more competitive in science
development and viable for self-development.

<HEADLINE> Branch of China's Largest Bank Reports Record Deposits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fuzhou, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Savings deposits at the Fujian
Provincial Branch of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China
(ICBC), the country's largest bank, has been growing at an annual
rate of more than 10 billion yuan (about 1.2 billion US dollars)
in the past three years.
</P>
<P>
The lastest statistics show that the branch had outstanding
savings deposits of 58.7 billion yuan at the end of May, the
largest among all local banks.
</P>
<P>
A bank official said that the effort to offer a broader range
of intermediate services and agent services was a major reason for
the substantial increase in the deposit amount.
</P>
<P>
A rapidly expanding electronic service network, which has been
extended to 16 large and medium-sized cities outside the province,
has also made the branch a magnet for savings deposits, the
official explained.
</P>
<P>
As the income of Chinese residents increases as a result of the
country's economic boom, the total amount of savings deposits in
China has surged in recent years. Official figures show that the
total outstanding savings deposits in China have exceeded four
trillion yuan.

<HEADLINE> India Levies Anti-dumping Duties on Newsprint </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 12 (Xinhua) -- India's Commerce Ministry has
recommended the imposition of provisional anti-dumping duty on
newsprint from the United States, Canada and Russia, the Indian
Express said today.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has given its recommendation to the Finance
Ministry, which is expected to issue a notification to this effect
soon.
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Ministry had initiated investigations in December
last year into charges of dumping newsprint by the U.S., Canada
and Russia.
</P>
<P>
The charges, made by the domestic newsprint makers, said that
the three countries were exporting newsprint to India at prices
below normal.
</P>
<P>
In a petition to the Commerce Ministry, the Indian Newsprint
Manufacturers Association said that the export of cheap newsprint
by these countries was causing "material injury" to them.
</P>
<P>
The ministry after making preliminary investigations reached a
conclusion that newsprint "originating or imported" from the three
countries was indeed being sold in India at below normal value.

<HEADLINE> US Congress Resolution Welcomed by Israel, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 12 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. Congress resolution
recognizing united Jerusalem as Israel's capital has been praised
by Israel and criticized by the Palestinian National Authority
(PNA).
</P>
<P>
The U.S. House of Representatives voted 406-17 Tuesday to
recognize Jerusalem as the undivided capital of Israel, despite
opposition by the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
The house also voted to provide 100 million U.S. dollars for
moving the U.S. Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians, who see East Jerusalem as the capital of a
future Palestinian state, sharply criticized the resolution,
which they said would hurt the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
PNA Higher Education Minister Hanan Ashrawi described the
resolution as obvious support for Israel, saying it "puts a big
nail in the coffin of the peace process and the credibility of
the U.S. as a peace broker."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, members of the Israeli government welcomed the
resolution, which was, in their word, "obviously reflecting the
will of the American people."
</P>
<P>
"We are delighted that the Congress has recognized Jerusalem
as the undivided capital of Israel and it will remain forever,"
said David Bar-Ilan, Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu's media
adviser.
</P>
<P>
Bar-Ilan also expressed happiness at the prospective transfer
of the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem "in 1999."
</P>
<P>
Most countries in the world, including the U.S., have not
recognized Israel's annexation of East Jerusalem immediately
after the Six Day War in 1967.
</P>
<P>
It has been the position of successive U.S. government that the
city must never be divided again, but its future must be settled
through negotiations.

<HEADLINE> Northwest Chinese Region To Build Largest Wolfberry Base </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region
in northwest China plans to build its area to divert water from
the Yellow River into the country's largest Chinese wolfberry
production base.
</P>
<P>
Wolfberry, a special product in Ningxia, is known as a
nutritious Chinese medicinal herb.
</P>
<P>
The base will cover more than 3,300 ha of farmland, and is
expected to produce over 60 million yuan of output value annually
upon completion.
</P>
<P>
The ethnic region is to invest 55 million yuan in building a
wolfberry garden, a seedling raising base, a new variety breeding
base, a new technology spreading system, and some deep processing
projects.
</P>
<P>
To promote a rising pillar industry, the regional government
has set up a leading body as well as a group of experts to take
charge of the construction of the wolfberry production base, and
has signed contracts with eight counties and cities involved to
ensure the smooth construction of the base.

<HEADLINE> Jordan to Receive U.S. Aircraft in December </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, June 12 (Xinhua) - Jordan will receive the first batch
of 16 F-16 fighters from the United States in December as part of
a military aid package worth 300 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
This was announced late on Wednesday night by Chief of Staff
of the Jordanian Armed Forces Abdul Hafiz Miree Kaabneh at the
conclusion of the 3-week long Jordanian-U.S. joint military
exercises codenamed "Infinite Moonlight 1997."
</P>
<P>
Jordan has dispatched its pilots to the U.S. to be trained on
the aircraft, Kaabneh said.
</P>
<P>
"we will upgrade and improve our military relations, which
are already deep-rooted, as much as we can. The exercise we
witnessed is a sign of our cooperation to preserve the mutual
interests of our both countries," the military chief said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the Jordanian Armed Forces will conduct more
exercises with British and French forces and U.S. troops this
year as part of the kingdom's endeavor to strengthen combat
effectiveness of its armed forces.
</P>
<P>
The joint war game, the second one between the two sides
within the year, was conducted following the failure of the
recent international efforts to reactivate the deadlocked
Palestinian-Israeli peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The exercises were carried out in the Qatraneh desert, some 90
kilometers south of the Jordanian capital of Amman.
</P>
<P>
Jordan, which is given by the U.S. the status of non-ally of
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), has the access to
U.S. military assistance.
</P>
<P>
Last December, Jordan received a 100 million dollars
U.S. military aid as part of a total of 300 million dollars'
assistance pledged by the U.S. administration.
</P>
<P>
The aid included 18 UH-1H helicopters, 50 M60A3 tanks, 250
M1008 and M1009 trucks, 2 MK-4 personal boats, an air-sea rescue
vessel as well as machine-guns and 1,000 night-vision goggles.
</P>
<P>
The remaining 200 million dollars of the assistance will be
spent on 16 F-16 jet fighters.

<HEADLINE> India's Industrial Growth Slowdown to Continue: Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The slowdown in India's
industrial growth will be bottomed out only by the end of the
current financial year (April 1997-March 1998) and in the first
quarter of 1998-99 fiscal year when the industry will grow between
10.5 and 11.5 percent, a study says.
</P>
<P>
The study, published by the National Herald today and it covers
over 175 large, medium and small corporates having a cross section
of business interest, also indicates that the present slowdown is
a temporary phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
This trend will be reversed due to the combined effect of the
just-adopted budget for 1997-98, the new credit policy, relaxation
in the external commercial borrowings and a host of other steps
which are being taken by the United Front government led by Prime
Minister Inder Kumar Gujral.
</P>
<P>
The study is based on certain assumptions -- the rate of
borrowing would come down to 17 to 18 percent and inflation would
be hovering around 6 to 7 percent.

the 1997 world auto market show.
</P>
<P>
The leading US auto magazine "Automotive News" has reported

</P>
<P>
Hyundai occupied 13th place in 1995 with sales of 1.16 million

</P>
<P>
"It is rare for an automaker to jump over two places in the
ranking in one year in such competitive world auto market," said
an official of the Korea Automobile Manufacturers Association
(KAMA).
</P>
<P>
Hyundai is expected to join the top 10 of the world vehicle
sellers by the year 2000, a Hyundai official said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Bulls Win Game Five to Lead Finals 3-2 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SALT LAKE CITY, June 11 (Xinhua) -- the Chicago Bulls,
four-time NBA champions, took the crucial Game Five of the NBA
Finals Wednesday night, beating the Utah Jazz 90:88 to move within
one game win of their fifth NBA championship in seven years.
</P>
<P>
Michael Jordan's last-minute three-pointer shot contributed to
the victory as it gained a three-point margin that the Jazz found
hard to get enough time to make a balance.
</P>
<P>
Jordan, who started slowly, got only four points after the
first quarter, but he stormed an offensive in the fourth, scoring
15 of his 38 points.
</P>
<P>
With Utah leading 85-84, Jordan made the first of two free
throws to tie the score and soon received a pass from Scottie
Pippen and made the wide-open three-pointer from the left side to
gain the Bulls a 88-85 lead.
</P>
<P>
It was a key game for both teams as the two made 2:2 even in
the last four Finals, particularly for the home team Jazz as it
will fight a uphill battle in the next one or two games at Bulls'
home -- Chicago.
</P>
<P>
Like the last games, the two teams, champions of the West and
East of the United States, played aggressively throughout the
game. The Jazz gained an uphand all the way until the last
minutes. It led a 16-point advance in the second quarter before
the bulls, led by Jordan, regained their loss.
</P>
<P>
The two teams inched up their scores in the last minutes after
the Bulls balanced the score by Jordan's two three-pointers.
</P>
<P>
Pippen added 17 points and Luc Longley 12 for the Bulls. Karl
Malone scored 19 points and Greg Ostertag and John Stockton added
13 apiece for the Jazz.
</P>
<P>
The Bulls hope to wrap up their fifth title with a victory at
home in Game Six on Friday.

<HEADLINE> India, Bangladesh Agree on Power Exchange Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 12 (Xinhua) -- India and Bangladesh have
recently agreed on a project to export power to each other in a
bid to optimize the resources available in the two countries, the
Times of India reported today.
</P>
<P>
At a high-level meeting held in Manila recently under the aegis
of the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the two countries agreed to
enter into the power-sharing arrangement, initially for five
years.
</P>
<P>
According to the newspaper, the ADB has offered to fund the
project designed to facilitate export of power from eastern India
to western Bangladesh and from eastern Bangladesh to northeastern
India.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, each country is to construct all necessary
facilities up to its international border.
</P>
<P>
Apart from exchange of electricity, the two sides also showed
keen interest in cooperation in sectors like gas and
communications.
</P>
<P>
Eastern India has surplus power which creates problems of
over-voltage and high frequency. Power-deficit northeastern states
like Tripura and Mizoram face the opposite problem of low voltage
and low frequency.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh, which is between the two regions, has most of its
generating capacity concentrated in the eastern part whereas the
demand is concentrated in the western part.
</P>
<P>
Difficult topography comes in the way of transfer of power from
eastern Bangladesh to western Bangladesh. The project will not
only help the two countries overcome the problems of frequency and
voltage, but also lead to reduction in transmission losses.

<HEADLINE> Life Insurance Booming in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 12 (Xinhua) -- This, China's largest trade and
financial center, has generated a total of 1.29 billion yuan (155
million US Dollars) in life insurance premium income in the first
quarter of this year, which indicates a bright future for local
life insurance business.
</P>
<P>
The figure was up 122 percent from the same period of last
year. The city sold only 2.6 billion yuan-worth (313 million US
dollars) life insurance policies last year.
</P>
<P>
Insurance experts said that the rapid growth of Shanghai's life
insurance market is attributed to the growing awareness of local
residents in life insurance.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey conducted by the Shanghai Insurance Institute
shows that 80 percent of locals are planning to buy life
insurance, and 15 percent of Shanghai people have done that before.
</P>
<P>
"Most of them think that they should have more ways to
counteract life risks, and commercial insurance have been taken as
a way for long-term investment by local residents," experts said.
</P>
<P>
Now there are some 20,000 life insurance sales agents serving
across the city, and commercial life insurance has become an
integral part of the daily life of local people.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai is also one of the only two cities open to overseas
investors. The other is Guangzhou, capital of south China's
Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
The municipality's life premium income edged up with that
generated in local property insurance industry last year, both
accounting for 49.6 percent of the city's total.

<HEADLINE> Thai Scholars Rap U.S. Interference in Thai law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Thai traditional medicine scholars
Wednesday accused the United States of interfering Thailand's
internal affairs as it tended to block a Thai draft bill to
protect local medicine wisdom, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Pennapa Subcharoen, director of the National Institute of Thai
Traditional Medicine, expressed surprise over a U.S. warning that
the draft bill, which is in the final stage of the drafting
process, could violate global trade rules.
</P>
<P>
The draft bill is aimed at protecting local villagers from
being exploited by multinational companies, Pennapa said.
</P>
<P>
Foreign countries, including the U.S., could also benefit from
the bill as research and development of traditional medicine could
be more institutionalized, she noted.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. needs no worry that its powerful pharmaceutical
industry and researchers would no longer have access to Thailand's
rich resources, she added.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. embassy in Bangkok earlier this year sent a letter to
Thailand's Department of Intellectual Property to express concern
that the bill could violate global trade rules and affect future
research of Thai traditional medicine.
</P>
<P>
The letter reportedly also required clarification on 11 points
concerning the registration of traditional Thai medicines.

<HEADLINE> Serbia Holds Exhibition on Return of Hong Kong to China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, June 11 (Xinhua) -- A picture show on the return of
Hong Kong to China was held in Novi Sad, capital of Vojvodina
Autonomous Province in the Serbian Republic today.
</P>
<P>
Vojvodina Vice Prime Minister D. Radenkov said today at the
opening ceremony that the return of Hong Kong to the motherland is
of great historic significance. The return has resulted from the
long time unremitting efforts for peaceful settlement of the Hong
Kong issue made by the Chinese government and Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
He said the Chinese government made great efforts on the smooth
transition of Hong Kong. The transition is not only of historic
significance to China, but also of broad international
significance in the whole world, Radenkov said.
</P>
<P>
The peaceful settlement of Hong Kong is a model of the
solutions to disputes through long and patient negotiations. The
vice prime minister said the traditional friendship between the
Yugoslav and Chinese people has experienced historical tests. "We
will share the happy moment with the Chinese People."
</P>
<P>
Chinese Ambassador to Yugoslavia Zhu Ankang said that the
return of Hong Kong to the motherland is a great event both to
China and the world. It does not only mean an end to an era and
the beginning of a new century in Hong Kong, but also an important
step for the Chinese people to realize reunification of the
motherland.
</P>
<P>
About 100 pictures on the British invasion in Hong Kong and the
long struggle for the transition were on display at the show.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition will last until June 20 and then go on to other
cities in Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> Nepal, Germany Sign Agreement on Air Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The governments of Nepal and
Germany have signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) on
operating air services between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Under the MOU, the two governments agreed to operate nine
two-way passenger flights and six cargo flights every week between
Nepal and Germany, a joint communique issued here said today.
</P>
<P>
With the signing of the MOU, private sector airlines in Nepal
will be allowed to operate flights to Germany, trade sources said.
</P>
<P>
The MOU was signed here Wednesday by representatives of the two
country's air authorities.
</P>
<P>
A Nepali civil aviation official said on the occasion said that
the liberal aviation policies adopted by the two countries would
make Visit Nepal Year 1998, the official tourism promotion program
aimed at attracting 500,000 foreign tourists next year, a success.
</P>
<P>
German officials disclosed that a German airline will operate
air services to Kathmandu in the near future after the German
national flag carrier Lufthansa stopped its Nepal operation last
month due to financial reasons.
</P>
<P>
According to the Nepali Ministry of Tourism and Civil Aviation,
Nepal has signed air service agreements with 22 countries and the
state-owned Royal Nepal Airlines (RNA) has been operating with 12
destinations in 10 countries.

<HEADLINE> Four Detained in Money Laundering Crackdown in Italy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Four Italian construction magnates
were arrested, with their apartment blocks confiscated and assets
of 11 companies seized, when Finance Guards police cracked down on
a major Mafia money laundering ring in Palermo today.
</P>
<P>
In an operation coded as Dirty Buildings in Palermo, Sicilia,
the police detained Vincenzo Rappa, Francesco Pecora, Salvatore
Sbeglia and Domenico Graziano for questioning for suspected
collaboration with the Mafia.
</P>
<P>
Filippo Rappa, son of the 75-year-old Vincenzo Rappa, a
well-known builder, was also detained. Filippo, 54, is a former
Christian Democrat city councillor and owner of Trm, a leading
local TV station.
</P>
<P>
Others placed in custody included two father and son business
partnerships, Domenico and Camillo Graziano, 60 and 30
respectively, and Francesco and Giovanni Pecora, 58 and 24
respectively. Custody orders were also served on two car dealers,
Giuseppe Curcio and Mario Umbertone.
</P>
<P>
Judicial sources said preventive custody orders were also
served on two jailed Mafia bosses, Raffaele Ganci and Francesco
Rappa. Ganci was arrested on June 10, 1993 as the right-hand man
of Boss of Bosses, Salvatore Riina.
</P>
<P>
As the list of those detained lengthened, judicial sources said
in the late morning that seven custody orders had now been served
on jailed Mafiosi.
</P>
<P>
The investigators say the construction companies whose assets
were seized may have been used to launder a large part of the
Mafia's millions of dollars in revenue from drug dealing.
</P>
<P>
The finance police have combed through thousands of pages of
company and bank accounts to find clues and they said they also
enjoyed information from a witness.
</P>
<P>
One of the confiscated companies was Guido Umbertini SpA, which
is well-known for rebuilding Palermo's Favorita stadium for the
1990 World Cup.

<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Chilean Foreign Minister Jose
Miguel Insulza confirmed today that he will definitely attend the
handover ceremony of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
He made the promise after certain world leaders said they would
boycott the ceremony to "protest" against the Provisional
Legislature, which they said was "not democratic".
</P>
<P>
China had to have the Provisional Legislative Council created
after the British Hong Kong authorities failed to abide by the
principles of the Sino-British joint declaration.
</P>
<P>
When asked by the press whether he will boycott the ceremony
scheduled for late June 30 and early July 1, Insulza said: "No,
no, no, whatever may happen, I will be present at the handover
ceremony."
</P>
<P>
He said he could find no reason at all to boycott it.
</P>
<P>
The Chilean foreign minister is one of the dignitaries China
has invited for the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The Chilean government has said it will maintain its consulate
general and commercial office in Hong Kong after the transfer of
power in order to develop sound relations with the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region and China as a whole.

<HEADLINE> Cool Summer Expected in Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 12 (Xinhua) -- A cool summer and long rainy season
is expected in Japan this year as the so-called El Nino phenomenon
has apparently returned after a four year hiatus, local press
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Abnormally high temperatures recorded last month in the Pacific
Ocean around the equator suggest the phenomenon, which causes
abnormal weather patterns across the globe, has returned, the
report quoted Meteorological Agency officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
El Nino typically causes temperatures in the Pacific Ocean off
the coast of Peru to rise one to two, or sometimes two to five
degrees higher than normal. The phenomenon lasts for one to one
and half years and occurs every two to seven years, according to
the report.
</P>
<P>
Meteorologists are concerned that El Nino could bring a
relatively cool summer and long rainy season this year in Japan,
the report said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Activists Against NATO Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 11 (Xinhua) -- A group of influential U.S. social
activists will stage mass protests against NATO expansion during
the western military alliance's summit in Madrid next month.
</P>
<P>
The planned demonstrations were announced today by Cora Weiss,
one of the leading figures of a group called Action For Peace.
</P>
<P>
The massive expenses involved in NATO 's eastward enlargement,
estimated at between 25 billion and 125 billion U.S. dollars, was
an important reason for the group's opposition to the plan, Weiss
told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
Weiss and her colleagues are on a visit to Moscow to mobilize
international support for the action against NATO expansion.
</P>
<P>
Russia has consistently opposed NATO's eastward expansion,
saying the move will threaten its own security.
</P>
<P>
Members from Action For Peace have already been to London and
Brussels and will head for the Polish capital Warsaw after their
Moscow visit. Poland is widely expected to be one of the first
wave of countries to be invited to join NATO.
</P>
<P>
Michael Newlin, another activist, said he believes NATO
expansion will increase the threat of nuclear confrontation.
</P>
<P>
If the group fails in its efforts to check NATO's scheme, they
will keep a close watch on the process of implementing the accord
on Russia-NATO relations, said Newlin, who is an adviser to the
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and former
U.S. ambassador to Algeria.
</P>
<P>
Russia and NATO signed an agreement defining their
relationship, cooperation and security matters in Paris on May 27,
a deal seen as paving the way for NATO expansion.
</P>
<P>
The Madrid summit is expected to finalize the list of new NATO
members, although they won't be admitted until 1999 when NATO
celebrates its 50th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
Russian officials have reiterated their opposition to NATO
enlargement.

JAKARTA, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Over 200 people have been
evacuated from the area around Mount Karangetang on Siau Island in
Indonesia's North Sulawesi province, where volcanic eruption
continued to spew clouds of hot ash and lava, local press reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Evacuations were carried out from Tatahadeng village on the

</P>
<P>
Alpo Rusi, a special advisor to Finnish president Martti

<P>
Tarja Halonen, Finnish foreign minister, told the conference

NATO and Russia should share their views on benefits for enlarging

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Economy Expected to Have Sustainable Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's economy will start
recovering this year and achieve sustainable growth in 1998, about
a year behind most developed countries in the Asia-Pacific region,
noted economists predict.
</P>
<P>
Suhadi Mangkusuwondo, a member of the Indonesian National
Committee of the Pacific Economic Cooperation Council (INCPEC),
said the one-year lag of Indonesia's economic recovery was because
economic development in Indonesia followed trends in Japan and the
United States.
</P>
<P>
"Indonesia and several other developing countries will
experience this lag," he said at a meeting Wednesday at the Center
for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), which was attended
by several well-known economists.
</P>
<P>
Quoting an INCPEC's Pacific Economic Outlook, an annual
short-term forecast of 20 East Asian, North American and Latin
economies, Suhadi said most Pacific Rim economies were expected to
have a slightly faster economic growth this year and next year --
marked by low inflation rates -- following a "soft landing" in
1995 and a recovery last year.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's 1994 economic growth stood at 7.5 percent and rose
to 8.2 percent in 1995 before slowing down to 7.8 percent last
year.
</P>
<P>
The report predicted economic growth at 7.3 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
"The soft landing by most countries in the Asia-Pacific began
in 1995, the recovery in 1996, and the forecast for sustained
growth in 1997 and 1998 reflects the strong macro-economic
fundamentals and enhanced economic management capabilities in most
of the region," he said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia achieved a soft landing last year, after it went
through rapid growth in 1995 which caused an overheating of the
economy.

<HEADLINE> Czechs Keep Title as World's Top Beer Drinkers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The Czech Republic was the world's
top beer drinking nation last year, winning the title for the
fourth year in a row.
</P>
<P>
The average person in the Czech Republic drank about 160 liters
of beer in 1996, 28 liters more than Germany, which was knocked
off the top perch in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Beer consumption per person in Germany was 132 liters last
year, four liters lower than in 1995, because of cool weather. The
world's third biggest beer-consuming nation is Denmark, whose
population downs an average 121 liters each year, the media here
reported.
</P>
<P>
Beer is the national drink in the Czech Republic where it's
regarded as "liquid bread." It's a must at gatherings of family
and friends and at state banquets.
</P>
<P>
Beer is also part of the country's social fabric. Just as
Chinese people enjoy sitting in tea houses drinking tea, Czech
people enjoy sinking a few pints in a bar or pub.
</P>
<P>
In a country of just 10 million people, there are more than 70
large and medium-sized breweries and total annual beer output is
1.8 billion liters.
</P>
<P>
In addition to producing for the domestic market, breweries
export beer to Slovakia, Poland, Germany, Austria and the United
States. Beer has now become a pillar export industry in terms of
foreign exchange earnings.

<HEADLINE> Lianyungang Nuclear Power Project Proceeds Well </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIANYUNGANG, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Preparation work has been
proceeding smoothly for the construction of a six million kw
nuclear power project in Lianyungang, a port city in east China's
Jiangsu province.
</P>
<P>
According to an engineer in charge of the construction, they
will build the nuclear power plant with the state-of-the-art
technologies as they pursue the government policy of "safety and
quality comes first" in developing the nuclear power industry.
</P>
<P>
The nuclear power plant, to be equipped with Russia-made
VVER-1000 reactors and German Simens-made control system, will be
built in three phases.
</P>
<P>
For the first phase, two pressurized Russia-made VVER-1000
reactors will be installed and put into operation in 2004 and 2005
respectively, and running parallel in timing is the second-phase
which will focus on infrastructure of the projects.
</P>
<P>
When operational, the nuclear power plant is expected to be
able to generate 15 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity a year.
</P>
<P>
About 30 billion yuan will be spent on the first-phase of
construction. Lianyungang Nuclear Power Co. Ltd. will be
responsible for building and operation of the nuclear power
plant. The company was jointly invested by China National Nuclear
Corp., Jiangsu International Trust and Investment Corp., East
China Electric Power Corp. and Jiangsu Provincial Electric Power
Company.
</P>
<P>
A special leading group for the construction of the power
plant, mainly composed of officials from Jiangsu provincial
government, Lianyungang city and relevant departments, was earlier
announced to be established to help coordinate the building of the
nuclear power plant.
</P>
<P>
China has so far built two nuclear power stations, namely, the
Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant in east China's Zhejiang province and
the Nuclear Power Plant at Daya Bay near Shenzhen in south China's
Guangdong province.
</P>
<P>
In addition, China will also build another nuclear power plant in
Ling'ao of Guangdong province.
</P>
<P>
China's nuclear power output reached 14.3 billion kilowatt
hours (kwh) in 1996, up 12 percent over the previous year,
according to earlier reports.
</P>
<P>
The Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant in Zhejiang generated 2.23
billion kwh, while the Daya Bay Plant in Guangdong produced 12.11
billion kwh.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Maintain Close Economic Ties with HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Foreign Minister
Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said today that Malaysia would continue to
have close trade, economic and cultural relations with Hong Kong
as they exist now after China resumes the exercise of sovereignty
over Hong Kong on July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
With the establishment of a consulate general in the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region from July 1, 1997, Malaysia will
continue to have its presence there. This is a "clear indicator of
Malaysia's confidence in the mutually beneficial relationship that
it enjoys with Hong Kong, the minister said in a written interview
with Xinhua today.
</P>
<P>
"In fact, we believe that Hong Kong's position as a top
international commercial and financial center should be further
consolidated and promoted by China as it would complement and
strengthen China's own dynamic economic development and progress,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the forthcoming return of Hong Kong to China is
"undoubtedly of historical significance" and Malaysia is "happy"
to see the event taking place in a peaceful and amicable manner.
</P>
<P>
He believed the resumption of the exercise of sovereignty over
Hong Kong by China should not affect Malaysia's overall excellent
relations with either China or Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"Our existing close and friendly relations with China will
continue and be further strengthened as our substantive economic
links with Hong Kong would also constitute an important component
of our overall relationship with China," he said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the present relationship between Malaysia and
China, the minister, who paid an official visit to China last
month, said he achieved his main objective during his recent
visit, namely, to further strengthen Malaysia-China relations
through the meetings with China's top leaders, and to deepen his
own understanding of China.
</P>
<P>
He said as Malaysia is the current chairman of the ASEAN
Standing Committee, his visit also enabled him to consult with
China on overall ASEAN-China cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Describing the current Malaysia-China relations "very good" and
"extremely well" developed in recent years, he said, "Malaysia is
happy with the momentum and progress in its bilateral relations
with China."
</P>
<P>
The minister said the exchange of high level visits, in
particular, reflects the seriousness and commitment of the two
sides to forging closer cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia wishes to continue the momentum in developing and
fostering bilateral cooperation with China in various fields, he
said, adding there is enormous potential to further enhance trade
and economic cooperation between both countries for mutual
benefit.
</P>
<P>
The business communities from both countries should be more
adventurous in exploring opportunities that both countries could
offer, he said.
</P>
<P>
With economic cooperation between Malaysia and China continuing
to record an upward trend in tandem with the momentum in the
growing political relations, he said, "I am of the view that
prospects for Malaysia-China relations are very bright indeed."
</P>
<P>
He said as Malaysia and China share similar aspirations and
objectives for lasting peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific
region, both countries can work closely to promote peace and
stability.
</P>
<P>
The increasing bilateral economic cooperation between the two
countries should also further contribute towards the dynamic
economic growth and development currently enjoyed by the region
into the next century, he added.

<HEADLINE> Colombian Guerrillas Accused of Kidnapings in Venezuela </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Colombian guerrillas and gangsters
have obtained nearly 20 million U.S. dollars from kidnapings and
extortions committed in Venezuela in 1996, said the Internal
Policy Committee of the Chamber of Deputies (lower house of
parliament).
</P>
<P>
Of that amount, 90 percent was sent to the Colombian Insurgence
and 10 percent to Colombian criminals who committed crimes in
Venezuelan border areas, the committee said in a report published
today.
</P>
<P>
Colombian rebels obtained 14 million dollars through extortions
and 3.67 million through the kidnapping of Venezuelan farmers and
cattle ranchers, while gangsters obtained 3 millions from both
activities.
</P>
<P>
The committee ruled out the possibility of a dialogue with the
Colombian guerrillas since that could lead to greater conflicts,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
The document proposed that the Colombian guerrillas be declared
a regional threat to democratic institutions and suggested that
police and military forces prevent and control crimes in border
towns.

<HEADLINE> Argentine President Stresses Importance of Educational Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Argentine President Carlos
Menem stressed today the importance of a revolutionary change in
education in order to meet the world's demands.
</P>
<P>
At a university ceremony, Menem also criticized those who are
opposed to educational reforms.
</P>
<P>
He said that a revolution in education "is what is occurring in
all countries on this planet" and even small countries have become
stronger after young people received better education.
</P>
<P>
The objective of the "new proposal for education" to which
impetus has been given is to perfect management of human resources
in this country, so that Argentina can catch up with the
development of science and technology, particularly computer
technology in the world.
</P>
<P>
But the proposal has been opposed by teachers and students, who
have held demonstrations against charging school registration fees
and modifications in subject curriculums.
</P>
<P>
At today's ceremony, Menem gave the award of "Presidency of the
Nation" to 33 university students who gained the highest grades in
their study.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Mailmen Bear Heavy Load </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 12 (Xinhua) -- A recent investigation finds that
Beijing, the busiest postal hub in China, delivers 3,000 tons of
mail, parcels and newspapers each day, said today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The findings were revealed at a birthday meeting for Beijing
Postal Administration (BPA), which has named 1997 "Postal Service
Year" to celebrate the centenary of the founding of the capital
city's postal service.
</P>
<P>
A report based on the investigation, while endorsing the
achievement made by BPA, nontheless criticizes Beijing postmen for
loss of mail and publications.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, complaints from the city mailmen said too many
real estate developers neglect to apply for mail delivery and
pick-up, leaving their tenants high - literally - and without
their daily mail, according to the natioanl English newspaper.
</P>
<P>
A survey counted 29,389 highrise residential buildings in the
capital.
</P>
<P>
By the end of May, postal service was provided for residents of
27,559 high-rise buildings.
</P>
<P>
The remaining 1,830 have no mailboxes or no building numbers -
or no roads leading to the buildings.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Postal Administration (BPA) said that postal
development needs more understanding and support from
everyone. It's very difficult for the post office alone to solve
the problems.
</P>
<P>
The BPA built 15 new postal and telecom offices and set up 24
more with the help of other departments last year, said a BPA
official.
</P>
<P>
With a staff of nearly 20,000, the BPA serves a population of
11.65 million within an area of 16,800 square kilometers.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the total turnover of the postal services reached 815
million yuan (98.2 million US dollars) - up 17 percent above 1995
- and postal revenues were 1.23 billion yuan (148 million US
dollars)- up 27 percent over the same period of the previous
year.

<TEXT>
<P>
HUHHOT, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The University of Inner Mongolia in
north China produced its first test-tube calf this year.
</P>
<P>
Chinese scientists hailed it as a major step forward in the
cattle in-vitro fertilization technology.
</P>
<P>
So far, the university's Experimental Animal Research Center
has obtained eight calves by using the in-vitro fertilization
technology on quality Australian cattle. The first seven calves
were born in Dalian in northeast China's Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
China listed research in cattle in-vitro fertilization
technology as a key project in its decade-long hi-tech development
program beginning in 1986.
</P>
<P>
The Experimental Animal Research Center has summed up a set of
mature test-tube calf techniques, and set up a modernized
laboratory in cooperation with the University of Melbourne in
1995. Fertilized embryos were shipped to China and transplanted
into Chinese cows after they are defrosted.
</P>
<P>
As a result, more than 30 cows have been fertilized, eight of
which have made deliveries. The rest will make deliveries before
August this year.

<HEADLINE> Navy Has A Part in Guarding Cleanness of Port </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 12 (Xinhua) -- China has attached great
importance to the military ports' environment and made marked
efforts to improve the cability of supervising, monitoring and
treating pollution in the ports.
</P>
<P>
The ports have set up a comprehensive system to supervise and
monitor the cleanness of the coastline and deal with pollutions,
according to Wang Kuicheng, a senior colonel of the Navy's
Logistics Department.
</P>
<P>
The navy's personnel, technology and equipment are capable of
understaking the environmental protection work in the ports on
their own, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
The navy has set up 18 environment monitoring stations in its
military ports in 1985 with the approval of the Central Military
Commission, marking the beginning of its environmental efforts.
</P>
<P>
Grease is the main pollutants in the military ports. The
navy has developed a kind of vessels that can treat the grease
and built treatment stations in Lushun, Qingdao, Zhanjiang and
Shanghai. At present, the military ports can handle some 100 tons
of grease an hour. Monitoring ships are deployed in the ports to
check pollutants discharge.
</P>
<P>
According to Wang, the navy's port monitoring and supervising
organ is a leading member of thcience
and technology information network of the Ministry of
Communications and national oceanographic monitoring network. The
navy has also participated in the revision of the national
environmental protection codes and international environmental
protection conventions.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Seeks "Partnership" with Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Thailand has submitted a "white
paper" on Thai-Japanese economic relations which calls for the two
countries to develop a "partnership" in subregional cooperation
projects, according to a press release issued by the Thai Foreign
Ministry available today.
</P>
<P>
The document, which will be discussed in a review on economic
relations due to take place in Tokyo in August or September, was
handed to Japanese Ambassador Hiroshi Ota Tuesday by Thai Deputy
Foreign Minister Pitak Intrawithayanunt.
</P>
<P>
Pitak will head the Thai delegation at the conference and hold
preparatory talks on a scheduled visit to Japan by Thai Prime
Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh in early October, the press release
said.
</P>
<P>
The white paper, the third of its kind after publications in
1985 and 1991, says the development of a "partnership" and
"economic alliance" in subregional projects would bolster the
regional role of Japan and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The document cites the "economic hexagon" encompassing the
Mekong River countries of Myanmar, Cambodia, Laos, Thailand,
Vietnam and China, the growth triangle linking Thailand with
Malaysia and Indonesia, subregional road plans, and Thailand's
eastern and southern seaboard projects.
</P>
<P>
The document also calls for cooperation to reduce Thailand's
trade deficit with Japan, including access to the Japanese market
for tapioca products, frozen chicken, fresh shrimp, pork,
vegetables and fruit.
</P>
<P>
In investment, Thailand proposes being an industrial base for
Japan to produce vehicles, electrical and electronic products.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: New Economic Center to Emerge in Southwest China (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The Authorities of Chongqing
have planned to build the city, China's largest, into an economic
power house in southwest China and the upper reaches of the
Yangtze River through a decade's efforts.
</P>
<P>
Located in the intersection between economically developed
coastal China and resource-rich western China, the city is
recognized an economic hub in China's vast inland areas and a key
river harbor in China's longest river, the Yangtze.
</P>
<P>
After Chongqing was expanded and put directly under the
leadership of the central government, it was asked to "give full
play to its strategic location for speeding up overall social and
economic development in the region."
</P>
<P>
The city now occupies an area of 82,000 square kilometers and
has a population of 30.02 million.
</P>
<P>
The local authorities have mapped out their own development
program in accordance with the state guideline.
</P>
<P>
The annual gross domestic product (GDP) growth is set to reach
11 percent by the year of 2000. The city also planss to eradicate
poverty among its large rural population and form a new industrial
belt before 2000.
</P>
<P>
The longer-term targets set for 2010 are to quadruple its 1995
GDP and build up a medium-developed city in China in terms of
comprehensive economic strength.
</P>
<P>
Even though the city has registered a more than ten percent
growth rate for four years in a row, its GDP in 1995 was merely
101.3 billion yuan, at the lower middle level among major Chinese
cities.
</P>
<P>
Local experts believed the city can benefit from the Yangtze
River development strategy blueprinted by the central
government. The strategy aimed to gear up overall development in
the whole valley of the Yangtze River with Shanghai's Pudong New
Area as its locomotive.

<P>
Overseas investors in the past years have flocked to gain
foothold in the city, considered a springboard to enter China's
vast inland areas.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1996, the city has approved 2,560 projects with
overseas investment. The capital actually utilized by the city
topped 2.81 billion US dollars. Overseas investment in the city
accounted to 15 percent of its total investment in fixed
assets. The city's foreign trade volume last year hit 1.41 billion
US dollars, or ten percent of the total GDP.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing's new municipal status turned the city more
attractive for overseas investors. The number of projects with
overseas investment approved by the city posted a rise of 17
percent in the first five months this year. The actually unitized
capital increased 27 percent in the period.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a number of investors, such as the Japanese Isuzu
Motors and Thai Chia Tai Group, added investments in their
existing ventures in the city.
</P>
<P>
Pu Haiqing, newly elected mayor of the city, said that the
city, historically an important industrial and commercial hub,
will continue efforts to turn it into a trade, financial and
information center, a transport and telecom hub, and a high-tech
industrial base.
</P>
<P>
Local economists hoped that the Three Gorges Project, China's
largest hydropower project, and development at reservoir areas
will boost the adjustment of Chongqing's social and economic
structure.
</P>
<P>
Also, the industrial belt to emerge in the city will become
another economic powerhouse for China's sustained economic growth
in the coming new century.

<P>
BEIJING, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
today sent a message of greetings to his Philippine counterpart,
Fidel Ramos, on the 99th anniversary of the independence of the
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
"On the occasion ... I wish to extend, on behalf of the Chinese
people and in my own name, our warm congratulations and best
wishes to Your Excellency, and through you, to the Government and
people of the Republic of the Philippines," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"Since the establishment of diplomatic relations between China
and the Philippines 22 years ago, the friendly and cooperative
relations in all fields between our two countries have recorded
remarkable progress.
</P>
<P>
"The maintenance of the good-neighborly and friendly relations
between China and the Philippines conforms to the fundamental
interests of our two peoples and conduces to peace and stability
of this region.
</P>
<P>
"I am confident that, under the concerted efforts of both
sides, Sino-Filipino relations will be consolidated and
strengthened steadily."
</P>
<P>
He wished prosperity of the republic and well-being of its
people.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines had been a Spanish colony since the 16th
century. General Emilio Aguinaldo declared independence of the
Philippines on June 12, 1898, with the help of the United States
which defeated Spain in the Spanish-American war.
</P>
<P>
It was placed under the American rule the same year and was
given internal self-government in 1935. The country was occupied
by Japan during the Second World War and American rule was
restored after the surrender of Japan in 1945. It became
independent on July 4, 1946.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Leader on Sino-German Ties, Human Rights (Part 2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Li Ruihuan, chairman of the National
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference today outlined China's policies on Sino-German
relations, human rights and Hong Kong's return to China.
</P>
<P>
When asked about China's attitude on human rights and
legislative accomplishments, Li pointed out that many Western
people failed to understand the real situation of China's human
rights -- which have been purposely distorted by some people.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese leader epitomized China's three serious and
consistent positions on human rights.
</P>
<P>
First, the universally accepted principles on human rights
deserved respect and should be applied by all members of the
international community.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party of China, since its establishment in 1921,
had been devoting itself to achieving and protecting all basic
rights of the Chinese people, and it had been steadfastly
struggling for their political democracy and economic well-being.
</P>
<P>
China, a member of the United Nations Human Rights Commission
had actively participated in all U.N. activities on human rights,
including the drafting and formulating of a series of human rights
documents.
</P>
<P>
China had signed 17 international conventions on human rights
and was poised to ratify the International Convention on Economic,
Social and Cultural Rights by the end of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, Li noted, the universal principles of human rights
must be combined with the particular situations of different
countries.
</P>
<P>
Due to the differences in historical background, cultural
traditions and levels of economic development, countries differ in
both content and form, means and measures in implementing the
universal principles of human rights, Li said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese leader stressed that even the most common principle
acknowledged by all peoples around the world may not do if
divorced from real situations.
</P>
<P>
He gave the example of China's birth control policy. While
giving birth to babies, and deciding how many basic rights there
are for a woman, the future of China, a country with a population
of 1.2 billion, would be unthinkable without family planning.
</P>
<P>
With China's population keeping on doubling, the world as a
whole would become unimaginable, he said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, Li said, China upholds that the implementation of
the universal principles of human rights must proceed with
reality, must be in the interests of the majority, must follow
order and advance step by step, and great attention must be paid
to its objective effects.
</P>
<P>
"Chanting beautiful words or simply copying the policies of
other countries is impossible for achieving any success, and may
bring even worse consequences," Li said.
</P>
<P>
The third point Li stressed is that the implementation of the
universal principles of human rights is a developing course which
never ends, since the principles themselves develop as economies
and social lives develop.
</P>
<P>
The seemingly perfect principles yesterday are far from perfect
today, while today's perfect principles may leave a large room for
improvement tomorrow, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Implementing human rights principles is a course to ever
pursue, because it is forever changing and forever developing. In
this way, the basic rights of human beings are promoted to a
higher stage, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Li pointed out that all countries in the world are on this
course, though their stages are different.
</P>
<P>
No matter what stage a country was at, it had the
responsibility to enhance the level of human rights its people
enjoyed.
</P>
<P>
He also suggested that different countries should join hands in
promoting the development of human rights causes through equal
dialogue and communication.
</P>
<P>
Li was critical of certain people who were overconfident about
their countries' human rights conditions, and made unwarranted
charges against other countries, especially developing ones.
</P>
<P>
"This will bring nothing good to the implementation of the
universal principles of human rights," Li said.
</P>
<P>
Sound jurisdiction is necessary to better protect human rights,
Li said.
</P>
<P>
He quoted the late Chinese leader, Deng Xiaoping, as saying
that legality must be strengthened so as to guarantee people's
democracy.
</P>
<P>
Li noted that after the reform and opening up, China had done a
lot of work in perfecting socialist legality by introducing a
series of important laws and strengthening law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said, China believes that the level of human
rights a country's people enjoy depends on the development of the
country's economy and culture.
</P>
<P>
Prosperity, democracy and civilization were the three goals
China had set for its comprehensive development.
</P>
<P>
China is making efforts to enhance the level of its people's
human rights along with the enhancement of the country's economy
and society as a whole, Li said.

LIMA, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The population of vicunas increased
from 66,600 to 94,000 throughout Peru in the past three years,
said a census report made by the Agriculture Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The report published today attributed the accomplishment to the

The creation of the National Vicuna Society, which is currently

in Peru, has also led to the improvement and marketing of its wool

<P>
The report said after the International Convention of the Sale

<TEXT>
<P>
When asked in what aspects Hong Kong will remain unchanged
after its return and what influence it will exert on the inland
areas, Li said: "Our government's resumption of exercising
sovereignty over Hong Kong marks our Chinese people's expunging a
century-old disgrace. It is of paramount importance in Chinese
people's hearts and becomes a focus of international
attention. Under Comrade Deng Xiaoping's great concept of "one
country, two systems", Hong Kong will keep its capitalist system
after its return.
</P>
<P>
"To be accurate, three things will remain as they are at
present: the social and economic system, the way of life and its
extant laws. We believe that the 'one country, two systems' policy
will be conducive to Hong Kong's sustained stability and
prosperity, our country's reforms and modernization, our country's
ultimate reunification with its other territories, our trade with
foreign nations and world peace.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong has contributed much to China's reforms and its
economic construction for more than a decade. For instance, about
half of foreign investments in China have come from or through
Hong Kong. More than half of China's exports have gone to Hong
Kong or gone to their destinations via the port city. Besides,
Hong Kong has served as a base of information, technology and
personnel for the inland areas. So we are quite confident that
with the economic development in inland areas, Hong Kong will play
a bigger role after its return.
</P>
<P>
"We're optimistic and confident about the future of Hong Kong
after its return. The compatriots in Hong Kong created the current
prosperity, it shows that they have enough wisdom and ability to
do well in governing Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"Rapid economic growth, public stability, and the people's
solidarity in the interior areas provides powerful backing for the
long-term prosperity and stability of Hong Kong. Preparations for
resuming the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong, and a smooth
transition, are progressing smoothly with concerted efforts from
different quarters.
</P>
<P>
"We believe our compatriots in Hong Kong, grasping their
destiny in their own hands, will surely perform new miracles in
the land of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"Certainly we won't oversimplify the issues. The concept
of 'One country, two systems' is a new thing, we lack experiences
in many aspects. So two principles must be mentioned while talking
about the issue of Hong Kong, one is to be confident, the other is
to be circumspect."

<HEADLINE> Italians Driving Slower But Ignoring Seatbelt Laws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Italians are driving their cars more
slowly, but most of them still ignore laws requiring them to wear
seatbelts, according to the results of an international study
published here today.
</P>
<P>
The study says that almost nobody wears their seatbelts in town
and very few on the motorways.
</P>
<P>
The second study carried out under the Social attitudes on road
traffic risks in Europe (Sartre-2)study, said the Italian attitude
could be summed up: "Better a good luck charm than a seatbelt."
</P>
<P>
Researcher Pierangelo Sardi said that observance of the
seatbelt laws could dramatically reduce the current accident toll
on the roads; 9,000 deaths annually, 800,000 people treated in
casualty departments, 170,000 admitted to hospitals, 25,000
seriously disabled.
</P>
<P>
The cost of the country is estimated to be more than 50,000
billion lire (about 30 billion U.S. dollars) in the first half of
the year, according to Franco Taggi of the Higher Institute of
Health.

city of north China have made remarkable progress in pursuing
sustained development while paying close attention to
environmental protection and energy saving.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, the city has so far set up more

city's total industrial output value.
</P>
<P>
They have built 396 pollution treatment projects over the past
three years by investing 33.68 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Since the introduction of an energy-saving technology across
the city, the rural brick and tile production enterprises here
have saved, on average, 160,000 tons of coal.
</P>
<P>
To achieve better results in environmental protection and
reduce pollution, the municipal government has urged all towns and
villages to build industrial parks to house rural enterprises, so
that centralized power, heat and water supply systems can be
built.

<HEADLINE> Guangdong, Yunnan Gain from Each Other through Economic Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 12 (Xinhua) -- South China's prosperous Guangdong
Province signed 38 agreements Wednesday with Yunnan Province in
Southwest China to expand economic ties between them.
</P>
<P>
Insufficient raw materials and energy sources prevent Guangdong
from growing as fast as it could. Yunnan needs more investments to
develop its rich natural resources.
</P>
<P>
The agreements, worth 1.37 billion yuan (165 million US
dollars), involve finance, energy development, sugar processing,
food stuffs, textiles, light industry, agriculture and forestry,
science and technology, medicine, aquatic products and trade.
</P>
<P>
Ten of the projects require investments of more than 10 million
yuan (1.2 million US dollars) each. Two involve investments of
more than 100 million yuan (12.1 million US Dollars) each.
</P>
<P>
Chaozhou Jinman Group of Guangdong Province signed a contract
with Yunnan Yuxi city to invest 500 million yuan to raise eels in
Yunnan.
</P>
<P>
And Guangdong Qiancheng Co signed an agreement with a firm in
Yunnan's Qujing city to develop a town gas project which needs 250
million yuan (30 million dollars) to be completed.
</P>
<P>
A Guangdong Province economic commission official said the
economies of Guangdong and Yunnan are strongly supplementary.
</P>
<P>
"The big southwest Chinese market and the potential southeast
Asian opportunities attract Guangdong manufacturers and traders,
while Yunnan expects Guangdong to help it open more means of
expanding in Hong Kong and Macao and the world market," the
official said.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong has 20 projects worth 10 million yuan (1.2 million US
dollars) each in Yunnan province.
</P>
<P>
Last year, about 500 Guangdong manufacturers sold 600 million
yuan (73 million dollars) worth of products in Yunnan.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Revenues generated from green
coffee bean exports in Brazil more than doubled in the first five
months of the year, the Brazilian Federation of Coffee Exporters
(Febec) said today in Rio de Janeiro.
</P>
<P>
In the five months, exports of green coffee beans reached 1.13
billion U.S. dollars, an increase of 253 percent compared with the
same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Febec said the average price of a 60-kilo sack of green coffee
beans hit 202.76 dollars in May due to the shortage of this
product in major coffee-importing countries.
</P>
<P>
In May, Brazilian coffee exports totaled 1.326 million sacks.
Between January and May, a total of 6.473 million sacks were
shipped abroad.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Leader on Sino-German Ties, Human Rights (Part 1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 10 (Xinhua) -- Li Ruihuan, chairman of the National
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference, today outlined China's policies on Sino-German
relations, human rights and Hong Kong's return to China.
</P>
<P>
China attaches great importance to developing its friendly and
cooperative ties with Germany, Li said in an interview with the
German newspaper "Die Welt", here today.
</P>
<P>
Generally speaking, China and Germany enjoyed good relations.
</P>
<P>
Li said Sino-German relations, which suffered twists and turns
in past years, have been brought back to a healthy and progressive
track after hard work by the two countries.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the two nations should sum up their
experience and draw lessons to avoid a repeat of such an
unpleasant performance.
</P>
<P>
"Germany is one of the most developed countries and China is
the largest developing nation in the world. The two countries
boast great complementarity in economies, and vast potential for
cooperation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Germany was China's largest economic and trade partner in
Europe, with its technical exports to China ranking first among
all European countries.
</P>
<P>
"We hope to continue comprehensive cooperation with Germany in
all respects including economy, trade, science and technology, and
culture and to make more achievements," he said.

<HEADLINE> Mary Slaney Suspended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 11 (Xinhua) -- American athletics officials
have suspended Mary Slaney for an alleged positive drug test,
making her ineligible for the national championships beganning in
Indianapolis on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The queen of American running also could be forced to forfeit
her silver medal from the women's 1,500 meters at the March world
indoor championships if further U.S. hearings fail to exonerate
her, according reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Reports said a USA Track and Field (USATF) board had suspended
the U.S. women's distance star on Tuesday night. USATF spokesman
Pete Cava declined comment. Slaney's husband, Richard, said the
couple had not been notified "personally."
</P>
<P>
USATF officials on Tuesday declared Slaney an "eligible
athlete" for the championships after receiving a letter from the
IAAF saying she was suspended and that she was ineligible to
compete either in the United States or internationally until a
U.S. hearing is completed on a disputed doping test.
</P>
<P>
IAAF president Primo Nebiolo 11 days ago banned Slaney and
fellow American athletes Sandra Farmer-Patrick and Stephon Flenoy
until their doping cases were resolved by U.S. officials.

WASHINGTON, June 11 (Xinhua) -- An arbitrator has ordered
American 400-meter hurdler Stephon Flenoy be allowed to compete in
the national championships starting in Indianapolis Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Flenoy's attorney Ed Williams said Wednesday: "After a full
day's hearing, the arbitrator ruled that he (Flenoy) did not get a

he had been declared ineligible for the U.S. championships.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items In Leading Australian Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 12 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Australian newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The Australian
</P>
<P>
-- Genta Hawkins Holmes, the new U.S. ambassador to Australia,
flagged yesterday a fresh era of U.S.-Australian relations with
the focus shifting from security concerns towards global warming,
human rights and international crime. In her first big bilateral
policy statement ahead of Prime Minister John Howard's U.S. visit
later this month, she warned Australia it had to compromise on
greenhouse gas emissions and criticized the country's use of
hydrocarbons.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald
</P>
<P>
-- The New South Wales Chamber of Commerce has issued the most
dire warning yet from business of the impact on trade of the
domestic race debate and has challenged Prime Minister John Howard
to "stop being concerned about losing the votes of Hanson
supporters and concentrate on the implications".
</P>
<P>
The Age
</P>
<P>
-- A state government department authorized the use of young
children from a Victorian orphanage in a post-war experiment
involving trials of a whopping cough vaccine on animals. The
newspaper reported earlier this week hundreds of orphaned children
have been used in experiments during 1945 and 1970 with adult dose
of vaccines or vaccine on animals.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Financial Review
</P>
<P>
-- Australian companies risk missing lucrative opportunities in
Japan because they are clinging to outdated ideas that the market
is too difficult to penetrate, a new Department of Foreign Affairs
and Trade study has warned.

<HEADLINE> White House Cautiously Welcomes UN Arrears Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 11 (xinhua) -- The White House today
cautiously welcomed the agreement reached late Tuesday on how to
pay the U.S. arrears to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Chairman Jesse Helms of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee,
a Republican critic of the U.N., reached a deal with the Democrats
to pay off most of the more than 1 billion U.S. dollars arrears to
the U.N.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Mike McCurry said, "It's good that we get
a commitment to move forward on the payment of the arrears." But
he added there are "a lot of details still left to be ironed out."
</P>
<P>
Also State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns responded to the
progress cautiously.
</P>
<P>
"There is no deal yet. There has been a major step forward in
the negotiations," Burns added.
</P>
<P>
"I should caution that much more work remains to be done on
this particular piece of legislation before we can declare...
victory," he added.
</P>
<P>
Under the deal, the U.S. will pay 819 million U.S. dollars it
owes to the U.N. only after the U.N. takes significant steps in
reforms, including reducing its budgets and cutting the U.S. share
of the U.N. fees, officials were quoted by local reports as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, future payment of the U.S. dues to the U.N. will be
made on a variety of conditions raised by Chairman Jesse Helms of
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
</P>
<P>
Helms proposed that if diplomats in New York did not pay their
parking tickets, the U.S. would cut its aid to their countries.
</P>
<P>
In addition, under the agreement, the U.S.'s annual dues share
at the U.N. will drop from 25 percent to 20 percent by the year of
2000.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believe that the conditions will be strongly protested
at the U.N., where the U.S. is already viewed as playing hegemony
by many countries.
</P>
<P>
The agreement still requires approval by Congress and the
signature of President Bill Clinton and will be made public when
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee meets Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations with the Senate Foreign Relations Committee
have not resolved all issues, including the timetable for paying
back the debt.
</P>
<P>
Bill Richardson, the U.S. representative at the U.N., said
Tuesday evening that the administration remained concerned about
some of the conditions in the agreement, but considered it "a
major step forward."
</P>
<P>
"We have a chance to get a real bipartisan package that will be
acceptable at the United Nations," Richardson told reporters.

<HEADLINE> Kohl, Kok Meet to Prepare for EU Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 11 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Helmut Kohl met
with Dutch Prime Minister Wim Kok today, discussing the upcoming
European Union (EU) summit meeting in Amsterdam on June 16-17.
</P>
<P>
Kok said he was confident that the Amsterdam summit would be a
success which would push the EU a great step forward. He added
that this was also the wish of the French government.
</P>
<P>
Kok arrived in Bonn from a visit to Paris today. Paris Tuesday

pact necessary for the 1999 start-up of the single European
currency, the euro, and asked for the extension of the pact to
address its job concerns.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel told
parliament that Bonn, which had been opposing the EU jobs pact,
now approved it to meet the demand of France, and said that France
would sign the stability pact.
</P>
<P>
The currency union stability pact and the reformed Maastricht
II Treaty are supposed to be signed at the Amsterdam summit.
</P>
<P>
During his talks with Kok, kohl praised the preparation work of
the Dutch government for the EU summit, adding that Germany would
do its best to make the meeting a success.

<HEADLINE> US Dollar Weakens Against Yen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar hit a nine-month
low against the Japanese yen today after Japan reported a sharply
higher trade surplus.
</P>
<P>
It was the fifth straight day the dollar declined against the
yen, and the selling helped pull the U.S. currency lower in most
other foreign-exchange dealings.
</P>
<P>
The dollar fell to an intraday low of 110.52 yen, the weakest
since September 11, before recovering somewhat to settle in New
York at 111.20 yen, down from 112.25 yen Tuesday. The dollar cost
1.7160 marks, down from 1.7185. The pound cost 1.6377 U.S.
dollars, down from 1.6385 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The dollar has so far retreated more than five yen or 4.3
percent in a week and fallen more than 16 yen or 12.8 percent from
its four-year high of 127.27 yen reached on May 1.
</P>
<P>
Japan's Finance Ministry reported that Japan's April surplus
rose 92.7 percent to 1.1 trillion yen in April compared with the
year earlier. It was the second straight monthly increase.
</P>
<P>
The dollar's weakness against European currencies partly
reflected the continuing uncertainty over the future of the euro.
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
TORONTO, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The Environment Ministerial
Meeting of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) concluded here
today, with commitments of more efforts into the region's
sustainable development.
</P>
<P>
The ministers "commit to sustainable development as a
fundamental objective to achieve human prosperity and a healthy
environment," said a joint statement released at the meeting's
end.
</P>
<P>
They challenged "all orders of government, the private sector,
local communities, and individuals to join us in transforming
sustainable development principles into meaningful practices and
visible results," the document said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was supposed to "find better ways of putting the
principle of sustainable development into practice," according to
Sergio Marchi, who chaired the opening of the meeting and has been
transferred from the environment to international trade portfolio
in today's cabinet reshuffle.
</P>
<P>
During the three-day meeting, the discussions were focused
mainly on items of sustainable cities, sustainability of the
marine environment, cleaner production and environmentally
sustainable growth.

<P>
"Sustainable development in the APEC region is fundamentally
linked to the sustainability of cities," the document noted.
</P>
<P>
Cities in APEC economies are growing at a rapid pace. Ten of
the 15 largest cities in the world are now in APEC economies. By
2015, the proportion of APEC populations living in cities is
expected to grow to 65 percent.
</P>
<P>
"All aspects of urban planning and development must therefore
be people-centered and take into account environmental protection
and economic and social considerations," it stressed.
</P>
<P>
On sustainability of the marine environment, the ministers
"commit to take action to protect this collective resources, as we
pursue our commitment to make dramatic progress toward clean
oceans and seas in the APEC region."
</P>
<P>
The meeting endorsed the Strategy for Sustainability of the
Marine Environment in the APEC region and commended it to APEC
economic leaders when they meet in Vancouver in November.
</P>
<P>
As of cleaner production, the document said that new investment
in the region "offers an opportunity to incorporate flexible and
cost-effective environmental management techniques to achieve more
sustainable industrial development."
</P>
<P>
"APEC will promote cleaner production in industrial sectors, by
identifying and expanding best practices and establishing a
cooperative agenda for technology diffusion," it said.
</P>
<P>
The document also called for improved coordination to link and
integrate the many sustainable development initiatives with APEC.
</P>
<P>
APEC is made up of Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Canada, Chile,
the People's Republic of China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, the
Republic of Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New
Guinea, the Republic of the Philippines, Singapore, Chinese
Taipei, Thailand and the United States.

<HEADLINE> UN Iraqi Weapons Inspector Asks for Council's Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 11 (Xinhua) -- U.N. weapons inspectors in
Iraq asked the Security Council for support today after Iraq
forced them to halt arms inspection last week by interfering with
four helicopter flights.
</P>
<P>
The chief inspector, Rolf Ekeus, briefed the Security Council
on reports that Iraqi officers manhandled U.N. personnel, grabbed
pilot controls, threatened to shut off a fuel pump and endangered
the lives of helicopter crew members.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the council
will likely issue a formal statement Thursday urging Iraq to
respect the safety of U.N. inspectors. The inspectors are in Iraq
to determine whether Baghdad has complied with U.N. orders to
destroy its weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
On the complaints of the U.N. weapons inspectors, Iraq said the
incidents occurred when the U.N. teams were attempting to fly over
sensitive areas.

<HEADLINE> Putonghua to Become Popular in Hong Kong Schools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 11 (Xinhua) -- A Putonghua festival is to be
launched in all primary and secondary schools in Hong Kong, in an
effort to encourage teachers and students to learn the most
commonly used spoken Chinese.
</P>
<P>
Starting from October 1, the three-month Putonghua Festival
will be mainly organized by the Hong Kong Putonghua Society, Hong
Kong Education Workers' Association and the Putonghua Channel of
Radio Television Hong Kong (RTHK).
</P>
<P>
Sin Kam Wai, chairman of the preparatory committee of the
festival, said that the event would be highlighted by a
listening-and-comprehension competition, which each school can
choose five students to take part in. The top five winners will
become Hong Kong's Putonghua messengers to travel to Shanghai,
the largest metropolis in China.
</P>
<P>
During the festival, schools are encouraged to hold various
activities helping students to learn Putonghua.
</P>
<P>
Sin, who is also principal of the 20-year-old Hong Kong
Putonghua Society, said: "We want all teachers and students to
realize that Putonghua is the common spoken language of the
Chinese nation. We hope that more and more Hongkongers can
communicate with other Chinese people in Putonghua."
</P>
<P>
Cantonese is a dialect widely used in Hong Kong, where
Putonghua is not as popular.
</P>
<P>
As the return of Hong Kong to her motherland is drawing near,
an increasing number of Hong Kong people are learning
Putonghua. Many schools have planned to teach Chinese in Putonghua
instead of Cantonese. Gift Talents School, a well-known primary
school in Hong Kong, has started from the third grade to teach
pupils Chinese in Putonghua, according to principal Leung Siu
Tong.

<HEADLINE> Indian Scientists Search for Nuclear Reactions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Sitting amidst sophisticated
detectors under a tall chimney, Indian atomic scientists have made
a fascinating discovery of possible nuclear reactions taking place
during lightning discharges, Press Trust of India reported today.
</P>
<P>
A team from India's Bhabha Atomic Research Center (BARC) based
in Bombay (Mumbai) observed bursts of neutrons -- uncharged
particles present in the nucleus of an atom -- during lightning
discharges.
</P>
<P>
Dome bursts contained as many as a billion neutrons. Such
neutrons are usually released in nuclear reactions.
</P>
<P>
Lightning discharges in the air are already known to carry
currents of several tens of kilo amperes, high energy X-rays and
gamma rays.
</P>
<P>
The scientists say they have detected neutrons indicating the
occurrence of nuclear reactions during lightning.
</P>
<P>
Their findings were reported in the latest issue of the Indian
Journal of Radio and Space Physics.
</P>
<P>
The neutrons are probably produced when hydrogen ions (natural
hydrogen is present in the form of water) collide with air
(containing nitrogen and oxygen) or with trees (containing carbon)
or even lightning arresters (containing copper), the scientists
say.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Meets Libyan Foreign Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 11 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela met visiting Libyan Foreign Minister Omar
Muntasser yesterday, but had not offered his country as a neutral
territory for the Lockerbie air disaster trial.
</P>
<P>
A foreign ministry spokesman said today that the issue had not
been raised by either man although it had been discussed by
foreign minister Alfred Nzo and Muntasser.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said Muntasser had private discussion with
Mandela and details would not be made public.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations imposed sanctions against Libya in 1992
because of Libya's insistance on a neutral venue for the trial of
two of its citizens suspected to have been involved in the 1988
Lockerbie air disaster.
</P>
<P>
More than 250 people died when a Pan American aircraft
exploded over the town of Lockerbie in Scottland.
</P>
<P>
The matter of a neutral venue had been discussed in talks
between Nzo and Muntasser,the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Nzo had expressed South Africa's support, in line with
resolution of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU), that the
suspects should be tried by Scottish judges under Scottish law in
a neutral territory.
</P>
<P>
But according to the spokesman, South Africa had not been
offered as a venue.
</P>
<P>
In January, after talks with Muntasser ahead of OAU council of
foreign minister's meeting in the Libyan capital,Tripoli, Nzo
said his government would consider offering South Africa as a
neutral venue if requested to do so.
</P>
<P>
Muntasser, after meeting Nzo on Monday, repeated the two
suspects were willing to subject themselves to a trial in a
neutral country.
</P>
<P>
The Libyan foreign minister is in South Africa for an official
visit.
</P>
<P>
Britain, France and the United States are demanding the
extradition of the suspects to Scottland to stand trial.They have
rejected Libya's offer to deliver the two men to the
international court or to a neutral country.

<HEADLINE> AT&AMP;T Finds Hard to Knit Local Service Net </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, June 11 (Xinhua) -- AT&AMP;T Corp. has made scant
progress in entering local service network a year after it
promised to do so, according to a report by the Wall Street
Journal today.
</P>
<P>
The company vowed to spend billions of U.S. dollars to erect
rival networks that would capture in just four years one-third of
the local phone business which generates 100 billion U.S. dollars
a year.
</P>
<P>
AT&AMP;T is now deeply involved in merger discussions with Bell
giant SBC Communications Corp., a transaction that would be valued
at more than 50 billion U.S. dollars. Such a combination would let
AT&AMP;T forgo offering local service in the two big regions SBC
covers and add its power for pushing into other regions, according
to the report.
</P>
<P>
AT&AMP;T planners now realize it could take as much as 30 billion
to crack the nation's local markets by building networks across
the country.
</P>
<P>
The company chairman Robert Allen was quoted as saying that
resistance by the Bells to open their local markets fully to
competitors is an even bigger constraint than capital.
</P>
<P>
But the company worked out an aggressive plan to attack on all
fronts rather than creep into individual markets one at a time.
Last year, AT&AMP;T began building the first of 52 fiber-optic "rings"
for carrying long-distance traffic. These rings will eventually
be linked to more than 100 smaller local rings offering local
service in communities nationwide, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
AT&AMP;T's own internal studies show it could lose up to one-third
of its long-distance business to the Bells within 18 months to two
years after they enter the market.

<HEADLINE> Congolese President Orders Troops to Cease Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Congo Republic President Pascal
Lissouba today ordered his troops to start a ceasefire immediately
in their engagement with the militiamen supporting former
President Denis Sassou-N'Guesso, according to reports reaching
here.
</P>
<P>
"I order a ceasefire from this instant as I address to you, to
give a chance to the national mediation already under way and to
an international mediation which will follow," said Lissouba in a
broadcast speech on the national radio in Brazzaville.
</P>
<P>
He said that the government soldiers were originally carrying
out a task to restore law and order, but that turned out to be a
civil war.
</P>
<P>
Fighting broke out last Thursday after government troops
surrounded the residence of Sassou N'Guesso and tried to disarm
the private force owned by the latter.
</P>
<P>
Sassou-N'Guesso also said today that he supports a ceasefire in
Brazzaville if the government troops stop bombarding with heavy
artilleries the districts under the control of his men.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the RTL, a private broadcasting network
based in Luxembourg, Sassou-N'Guesso asked "the aggressor to stop
the bombardments of the popular districts which we control," as a
precondition for a ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
The mayor of Brazzaville Bernard Kolelas, who is also president
of the national committee of mediation and the head of a third
force of Congo, had earlier asked Lissouba to order a ceasefire
"in a first step," before Sassou N'Guesso asked his men to stop
shooting.

<HEADLINE> Foreign News Agencies Free to Channel News in Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Foreign news agencies and
other information providers would soon be free to channel news
and information direct to subscribers in Malaysia, bypassing the
national news agency, according to a government decision today.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian government today decided to withdraw the
exclusive rights granted to the National News Agency Bernama for
the distribution of foreign news in the country in a move to allow
a free flow of information, Information Minister Mohamed Rahmat
announced here.
</P>
<P>
The minister told reporters that steps were being taken to
amend the Bernama Act to remove the rights now enjoyed by the
national news agency.
</P>
<P>
Mohamed said his ministry was working with the
Attorney-General's Chambers to draft the amendments which he hoped
to bring to the cabinet as soon as possible before being tabled in
Parliament.
</P>
<P>
Under the existing Act, the flow of foreign news into Malaysia
is required to go through Bernama, not for the purpose of
censorship but for providing the national news agency with an
additional source of revenue.
</P>
<P>
The rights bring Bernama about 8 million Ringgit (about 3.2
million US dollars) in royalty annually, or 20 percent of its
gross income of about 40 million Ringgit (about 16 million
dollars).
</P>
<P>
"We want to ensure a free flow of information. If Bernama
suffers a loss due to this move, we will make up for it through
other means," the minister said, adding Bernama could be given
other business opportunities with several proposals to be
presented to the cabinet to compensate Bernama for its loss of
revenue.

significant role in safeguarding state sovereignty and security.
</P>
<P>
He voiced the hope that the Air Force will follow the command
of the CPC Central Committee and the CMC, so as to maintain the
Party's absolute leadership over the army and improve its overall
quality and its combat effectiveness in the hi-tech age. Doing so
will help build it into a strong and modernized force.
</P>
<P>
The congress required the rank and file to rally more closely
around the CPC Central Committee and the CMC with Jiang Zemin at
the core, and firmly follow their command and direction, and to
greet the convocation of the 15th CPC National Congress scheduled
for this autumn.

<HEADLINE> U.S. May Pay U.N. Dues with Conditions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 11 (xinhua) -- The Clinton Administration
reached agreement late Tuesday with the Republican-dominated
Senate on a plan to pay 819 million U.S. dollars arrears to the
United Nations with conditions.
</P>
<P>
The payment would come only after the U.N. took significant
steps in reforms, including reducing its budgets and cutting U.S.
share of the U.N. fees, officials were quoted by local reports as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, future payment of the U.S. dues to the U.N. would be
made on a variety of conditions raised by Chairman Jesse Helms of
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
</P>
<P>
Helms proposed that if diplomats in New York do not pay their
parking tickets, the U.S. would cut its aid to their countries.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believe that the conditions would be strongly
protested at the U.N., where the U.S. is already viewed as playing
hegemony by many member countries.
</P>
<P>
The agreement still requires approval by Congress and the
signature of President Bill Clinton and will be made public when
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee meet on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Bill Richardson, the U.S. representative at the U.N., said
Tuesday evening that the Administration remained concerned about
some of the conditions in the agreement, but considered it "a
major step forward."
</P>
<P>
"We have a chance to get a real bipartisan package that will be
acceptable at the United Nations," Richardson told reporters.

<HEADLINE> Blair, Chirac to Exchange Views on EMU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Britain's new Prime Minister Tony
Blair, who is to pay a brief visit to France later today, would
not persuade French President Jacques Chirac into delaying the
European Monetary Union (EMU) project, according to British
government officials.
</P>
<P>
Blair will hold talks with President Chirac in Paris this
evening as part of a round of diplomacy ahead of the European
Union (EU) summit to be held in Amsterdam next week, British
officials said.
</P>
<P>
They stressed that Blair, well aware of the political
difficulties in Paris on the single European currency, would not
take counterproductive and hostile stance on the EMU issue, saying
"He's not going to rain on their parade."
</P>
<P>
However, the British Prime Minister is expected to stress the
need to avoid fudging the economic convergence criteria for the
single currency, they said.
</P>
<P>
On Britain's EMU membership, Blair has said that it is very
unlikely that Britain will be among the first wave of EU countries
to join the EMU, but Britain is well placed to influence the
project because it has not ruled out joining later.
</P>
<P>
"The option is genuinely open that we will join at some
stage," a senior aide for Blair said.

BONN, June 11 (Xinhua) -- German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel
said today that Poland was among the top candidates for joining
the European Union (EU) and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization

Kinkel made the remarks while meeting with visiting Polish

<P>
They both agreed that the enlargement of EU or NATO should

Kinkel praised Poland's tremendous efforts to qualify for
membership of the two organizations, and noted that any member
country of NATO enjoys full right and bears equal responsibility
as others.
</P>
<P>
In the process of its eastward expansion, NATO should help
boost the military integration of the new members with it and
provide political cooperation, Kinkel said, adding that meanwhile,
the new member states could in advance join the works of some

<HEADLINE> Kinkel: Bonn Approves Jobs Deal for Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 11 (Xinhua) -- German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel
told parliament today that Bonn would approve a jobs pact demanded
by France and that the currency union would start as planned in
1999.
</P>
<P>
Bonn's approval of the European Union (EU) jobs deal which it
had been opposed was in concession to Paris, which Tuesday voiced
attempt to delay a currency union stability pact needed for the
planned launch from 1999 of the single European currency, the
euro.
</P>
<P>
Paris said that it still needed more time to consider the pact,
which, agreed last December and supposed to be signed at the
upcoming EU summit in Amsterdam on June 16-17, would impose huge
fines on single currency states failing to meet the budget deficit
criteria.
</P>
<P>
Paris later asked for the extension of the pact to address its
job concerns and French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin said he
thought the pact would be signed at Amsterdam.
</P>
<P>
In his speech on the EU Amsterdam summit which is due to
conclude constitutional reforms known as Maastricht II, Kinkel
stressed that job creation remained primarily the task of
individual EU member states and that Bonn would reject expensive
state employment programs.
</P>
<P>
France would sign the currency union stability pact, he
assured, and warned of a possible lack of political will to renew
efforts to introduce euro if the single currency was delayed.
</P>
<P>
It was also very likely that the reformed Maastricht II Treaty
would leave out many of Germany's proposals such as calls for
common asylum, visa, refugee and immigration policy, and an end to
the national veto right of single EU state and more majority
voting.
</P>
<P>
"None of the members states -- ourselves included -- will be
able to force through their maximum demands," said Kinkel, who
stressed that small steps would be taken before the emerging of a
united Europe.

<HEADLINE> Pak Large Scale Manufacturing Witnesses Lowest Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan has experienced the
lowest growth rate of minus 1.4 percent in large scale
manufacturing during the current fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Sartaj Aziz made the remarks today when
launching the annual "Economic Survey" which was released before
the announcement of the federal fiscal budget.
</P>
<P>
Aziz, who will present the budget for the 1997-1998 fiscal year
on Friday, said at a a crowded press conference that the
pre-budget document was based on the estimates of the first nine
months of the 1996-97 fiscal year ending June 30.
</P>
<P>
The survey underlined the dismal performance of economic
indicators, with the hope to revive the economy through the
economic reforms program of the government lead by Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif.
</P>
<P>
For the current fiscal year, the survey draws a bleak picture
of the economic performance with sharp decline in growth, steep
rise in inflation and significantly widening trade and fiscal
deficit.
</P>
<P>
Giving details of the gloomy performance in the GDP (gross
domestic product) growth, the finance minister said it was 3.1
percent in the current fiscal year as against the target of 6.3
percent. Last year the GDP growth was recorded at 4.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
But the large scale manufacturing sector received major
setbacks recording a negative 1.4 percent growth which was
unprecedented in the country's economic history, the minister
added.
</P>
<P>
Quoting the Economic Survey, he said that the decline in
industrial growth led to a decline in per capita income and a rise
in inflation.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out the sky-rocketing inflation as one of the major
areas which witnessed the worst performance during the current
fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
From 1993 to 1997 inflation remained at an average of 12
percent, showing a 50 percent increase in prices, he added.

<HEADLINE> Angola to Implement Education Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The Angolan government will soon
implement an elementary and vocational education plan for youth
out of school.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the plan is to increase job opportunities for
the large number of youth, especially those in the countryside
through fundamental education and vocational education in such
fields as agriculture, sewing, carpentry, taloring, fishery,
sundry goods sales, construction, machinery industry, welding and
piping erection.
</P>
<P>
It will take five years to carry out the plan beginning this
July. The first two years are the experimental stage during which
two training centers will be set up in Luanda province and Huambo
province in the central part of the country to provide
three-month and six-month curriculums for 920 youth. Some war
damaged educational facilities will be repaired during this
period.
</P>
<P>
The second stage which will take three years will consolidate
and enhance the experience gained during the first stage and
extend the plan to four or six more provinces and then to the
country as a whole.
</P>
<P>
The plan will be targeted at 14 to 30 year old youth,
especially females, peasants and demobilized armymen.

handover at mid-night on June 30, and the pigeons will then fly
all the way back to their hometowns.
</P>
<P>
The pigeons will be brought here on June 29 to get ready for
the special ceremony to mark the handover, it was announced here
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The event is jointly organized by Hong Kong's Regional Council,
the Chinese State Physical Culture and Sports Commission, and the

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Leaders Review Peace Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Egypt's key policy-makers met today
to take stock of the latest Mideast development and the current
efforts to revive the peace process, Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
said.
</P>
<P>
President Hosni Mubarak called the meeting to make a complete
evaluation of the Mideast peace drive, Moussa said after the
meeting which was also attended by Prime Minister Kamal
el-Ganzouri and Presidential Political Advisor Osama el-Baz.
</P>
<P>
"The gap remains wide in place as the Palestinian and Israeli
negotiators are geared up for their second meeting in three
months," he added.
</P>
<P>
Egypt brokered a first meeting in three months between experts
of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) and Israel here Sunday
in a bid to break the deadlock caused by the Israeli move to build
new settlement for Jews in disputed Arab East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
No breakthrough was made at Sunday's meeting, but the
Palestinian and Israeli negotiators agreed to meet in Israel
Thursday again, with the participation of Egypt, to narrow the
wide gap dividing them.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said Baz will meet with PNA President Yasser Arafat and
Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu to make preparation for
tripartite talks which "cannot be held in a vacuum."
</P>
<P>
"The important issue (about holding another expert meeting) is
making progress. But the gap remains wide and the issue of
settlements still sticks out," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian top diplomat also expressed regret over
Netanyahu's recent statements that Israel will not withdraw to the
pre-1967 borders, that Jerusalem will remain the united capital of
Israel and that Israel will never give up East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
"Such statements make the peace process very difficult, and if
this is the case, all ongoing efforts are bound to fail," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said contacts were going on in all directions, but he
stressed "we should concentrate on contacts that have already been
made."
</P>
<P>
Without elaborating, he said "we should wait for the results of
tomorrow's meeting."
</P>
<P>
Arafat has been pressing Israel for a three to six months halt
in settlement building to allow talks on a final resolution of the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict to restart.
</P>
<P>
However, the controversy over the Jewish settlement expansion
policy seemed to be deepening Tuesday as Netanyahu rejected the
key Palestinian demand.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Pakistan's Export Target Unlikely to Be </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's export target for the
current fiscal year is unlikely to be achieved because of the poor
performance of the pivotal textile sector.
</P>
<P>
Export earnings for the 1996-97 fiscal year were projected at
10 billion US dollars as against 8.71 billion dollars achieved in
the previous fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
According to the Economic Survey for 1996-97 released here
today, the export receipts during the 10 month period (July
1996-April 1997) were 6.812 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Official sources said here today that with export earnings of
only two months uncalculated, the export target for the current
fiscal year ending June 30 was apparently beyond achievement.
</P>
<P>
The sources attributed the lower exports to restricted
performance of the textile sector which accounts for more than 60
percent of the country's total export items.
</P>
<P>
Of 432 textile units in Pakistan, 49 composite units and 120
other units have been either closed down due to financial
constraints or are heading towards that end, according to the
sources.
</P>
<P>
Due to shortage of raw materials and increased manufacturing
costs, the local cloth production has been substantially reduced.
</P>
<P>
It is for this reason that Pakistan's export, which mostly
depends upon the overall performance of the textile sector, has
been hit hard during the current fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Cotton-related exports constitute over 60 percent of Pakistan's
total exports, and earn on an average six to seven billion dollars
in foreign exchange earnings.
</P>
<P>
However, during the 11 months of the current fiscal year, the
textile sector exports remained below the four billion dollar
mark.
</P>
<P>
Textile exports during the last four years had shown a
considerable decline. In 1991-92, textile exports were 65 percent
of total exports with earnings of 5.6 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
In 1992-93 and 1993-94, the percentage of textile exports
dropped to 52 percent, as the overall exports of the country
declined. The foreign exchange earnings from textile exports were
4.8 billion dollars in 1994-95 and slightly over 4.9 billion
dollars in 1995-96.
</P>
<P>
However, in the current fiscal year, textile exports as well as
overall exports failed to show any improvement despite a bit
relaxed cotton availability situation and huge demand in the
international market.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that under the prevailing conditions there is
little chance of improvement in the overall export figures for the
outgoing fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The export earnings for the whole year is expected to stay
around a mere eight billion dollars. The textile sector exports is
to remain around 4.2 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, unconventional exports, to which much importance was
attached by the former government, did not show expected
performance.
</P>
<P>
Economists here believe that lack of financial assistance to
exporters and rapid changes in the government policies and
restrictions by importing countries are the main reasons for the
poor performance of the unconventional export sector.

<HEADLINE> Former Japanese PM Confident of Hong Kong's Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Former Japanese Prime Minister
Tsutomu Hata says he is confident that Hong Kong will enjoy more
stability and prosperity under the "one country, two systems"
principle after China resumes exercising sovereignty over Hong
Kong on July 1.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua News Agency on Tuesday,
he said Hong Kong's return to its motherland is the greatest event
of the age.
</P>
<P>
As the president of the Japanese Dietmen's League for
Japan-Hong Kong and the leader of the Sun Party, Hata still lives
an active political life and has been much concerned about Hong
Kong's future.
</P>
<P>
Hata said he admired the late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping's
insight, wisdom and his concept of "one country, two systems",
which has played a key role in the peaceful solution of the Hong
Kong issue.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Hong Kong's future, he said it will continue to
serve as Asia's financial and trade center, maintain its
prosperity and achieve steady development. This is a situation
from which China, Asia and even the world will benefit, he said.
</P>
<P>
The successful solution of the Hong Kong issue under the
principle of "one country, two systems" will exert positive
effects on China's ultimate reunification with its other
territories, he added.
</P>
<P>
Hata also noted that there is only one China and that the
Taiwan issue is China's internal affair. Hong Kong's sustained
prosperity and magnetism to foreign investors, businessmen and
common people desirous of living there will be helpful to the
ultimate solution of the Taiwan issue.
</P>
<P>
He finally said that as China's true friend, he would be
present at the ceremony for Hong Kong's return to witness the
arrival of the great historic moment and to experience its
significance.

<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of Cyprus' major Greek and
Turkish communities today received U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan's invitations to participate in direct negotiations on the
Cyprus problem next month.
</P>
<P>
The invitations were handed over to Cypriot President Glafcos
Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash by U.N. Resident
Representative Gustave Feissel.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after his meeting with Clerides, Feissel
said the talks will begin on July 9, and will take place somewhere
near New York.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. official refrained from giving any details on the
content of the invitation, saying that both sides should come to
talks in a spirit of good-will and be ready to make their
contribution to an overall settlement.
</P>
<P>
Feissel said he is not aware if Annan has extended invitations
to foreign government envoys concerned in the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Previous reports have said that representatives of Britain,
France, Russia and the U.S. will be present at the direct
negotiations between the two Cypriot sides.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. invitations were issued after the three-month U.N.-led
proximity talks between the Greek and Turkish Cypriot sides in an
effort to create right atmosphere for the direct talks.
</P>
<P>
Both Clerides and Denktash have responded positively to the
U.N. proposed direct negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The peace process in Cyprus has remained deadlocked since
October, 1994, when Clerides and Denktash held two rounds of
informal meetings in Nicosia under the U.N. auspices.
</P>
<P>
This Eastern Mediterranean island has been divided since 1974
when Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of
the island in the wake of a short-lived coup seeking union with
Greece.

<HEADLINE> Performance of Economy Below Expectation: Pak Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The performance of Pakistan's
economy during the 1996-97 fiscal year was below expectation with
a decline in GDP growth and only a nominal increase in per capita
income, an economic report said today.
</P>
<P>
Based on data for the first 9 months of the year, the country's
GDP (gross domestic product) has been tentatively estimated at 3.1
percent in 1996-97, which shows a decline from the growth of 4.6
percent during 1995-1996, according to the "Economic Survey"
released here today.
</P>
<P>
The annually pre-budget report said that the agricultural
sector, the largest sector of the national economy, has shown a
nominal growth of 0.7 percent against last year's high growth of
5.27 percent, which essentially resulted from a decline of 4.51
percent in the major crops sub-sector.
</P>
<P>
The report said that monetary expansion remained well within
targets but the deficits in the budget and balance of payments
were very much higher than planned.
</P>
<P>
Excluding raw cotton the exports grew by 9 percent but overall
exports remained static while imports grew at a rate of 1.5
percent during the first 10 months of the year, it said.
</P>
<P>
Domestic prices got shocks from domestic output set-backs and
policy adjustments in the utilities' pricing and the increase in
support prices of agricultural crops, it said.
</P>
<P>
In the manufacturing sector, small scale manufactures have
grown by 8.4 percent while the large manufactures registered a
decline of 1.4 percent, meaning that the growth of manufacturing
as a whole is estimated at 1.8 percent in 1996-97 compared with
4.4 percent last year, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Total investment has gone up by 12.7 percent and stood at 18.4
percent of GNP (gross national product), the report said, adding
private investment has increased by 15.6 percent, national savings
increased by 12.2 percent and foreign savings by 13.4 percent, it
said.

<HEADLINE> Santer Calls for EU Leaders to Make Amsterdam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 11 (Xinhua) -- European Commission President
Jacques Santer on Wednesday urged European Union member nations to
make improvements to approve plans on EU reforms at a summit in
Amsterdam next week.
</P>
<P>
"If we can make improvements let's do that, but let's not
jeopardize the project by last minute special pleading which may
undermine the balance we have arrived at," Santer told the
European Parliament.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking two days after France's new Socialist
government threw the EU into turmoil by telling its partners it
wanted time to study an already agreed deal, the stability pact,
designed to keep budget deficits tight after the single currency
is introduced on January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The pact was supposed to be ratified by EU leaders in Amsterdam
on June 16-17 as they are to approve internal EU reforms in a
revised treaty designed to prepare the 15-member bloc for its
ambitious expansion eastward.
</P>
<P>
EU member states are trying hard to find a compromise by
including additional elements on employment policy in the
so-called Maastricht II treaty, to be agreed in Amsterdam, to meet
France's concerns.
</P>
<P>
Dutch Foreign Minister Hans van Mierlo, whose country currently
holds the EU presidency, told the EU assembly that he was
confident that France would find a solution to allow the stability
pact to be approved at Amsterdam.
</P>
<P>
Santer said that there was no question of renegotiating the
stability pact which has been agreed by EU leaders in Dublin in
December.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Amsterdam summit should not backtrack on
provisional agreements to give the EU more powers to act on issues
which concerned its citizens, especially unemployment and social
issues, free movements of people around the Union, health and
consumer protection.
</P>
<P>
He urged EU governments to reach a deal next week which would
reconcile efforts to create a Union more integrated with the needs
of its citizens, to give the EU a strong united voice in world
affairs backed by military capacity and to make its own
institutions more efficient and democratic in time for
enlargement.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has decided
to introduce enterprise education in primary schools to inculcate
a business culture among children in the eastern African country.
</P>
<P>
The new subject, Entrepreneurship Education, will focus on
practical aspects of business management and industrial
development, Education Minister Joseph Kamotho announced on
Tuesday in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"The intention is to inculcate a business and enterprising
culture in the minds of learners at an early age," he claimed.
</P>
<P>
However, it is just an additional one to the 13 subjects
taught in primary schools and will be non-examinable.
</P>
<P>
The move is one of the eight strategies for training and human
resource development in preparation for the country's
industrialization, said Kamotho.
</P>
<P>
Other strategies include strengthening of educational and
training programs for the disabled, ensuring street children get
access to education and offering a second chance to drop-outs to
improve their literacy and get short-time career training.
</P>
<P>
Training in the country's institutions would be harmonized
with the labor market requirements to correct the mismatch
between labor supply and demand, he stressed.

corruption and lawlessness from the society at all levels.
</P>
<P>
In his televised address to the nation this evening, Sharif
said that the ehtesab (accountability) committees are being
established to provide relief to the poor and to save them from
the hands of oppressors.
</P>
<P>
"These committees will not only help the poor but also will
keep an eye on the persons having state authority, so that they

He said that the poor are still being deprived of the fruits of
independence as they are still being persecuted and not considered
a human being.
</P>
<P>
"I am establishing ehtesab committees with the idea that these
will help the poor whose cries had never been heard," said the
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
These committees have very important role to play, said Sharif,
adding that he wants the committees to be successful.
</P>
<P>
Nawaz Sharif said, "I am taking this step with all humility,
sincerity and honesty. I expect that the people will work to
reform the society and to restore respect and honor of the poor."

ISLAMABAD, June 11 (Xinhua) -- During July-April 1996-97,
Pakistan's Consumer Price Indicator (CPI) recorded an increase of
13.03 percent, Wholesale Price Index 12.11 percent and Sensitive
Price Indicator 13.32 percent, said an economic report released
here today.
</P>
<P>
Giving account of the prices, the Economic Survey for 1996-97
said that it came under greater pressures in the 1990s, when
inflation rate on average remained in double digit.
</P>
<P>
Price situation remained under stress during the current fiscal
year, the survey said. A host of cost push and supply-side factors
were on the forefront to pressurize domestic prices.
</P>
<P>
Devaluation of Pakistani currency of rupee, increases in
utility tariffs, revision in sales tax and excise duty raised the
cost of production while depressed domestic production constrained
the availability in the local market, it said.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, support prices of agriculture crops which were
raised to protect the interests of farmers had an inflationary
impact, the survey said.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Willing to Expand Economic Cooperation With </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, June 11 (Xinhua) - Jordan today expressed willingness to
expand economic cooperation with Qatar, a Gulf nation that severed
ties with the kingdom during the Gulf War in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The integration of economic construction with human dimension
should be emphasized and the Jordanian-Qatari cooperation is one
aspect of the integration, said Jordanian Crown Prince Hassan while
meeting a Qatari businessmen delegation here today.
</P>
<P>
The delegation headed by Board Chairman of Qatar's National
Hotels Company Sheikh Abdullah Ben Ahmad Al Thani, arrived here
yesterday on a 5-day visit to seek investment opportunities in the
kingdom.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Thani said that Qatar is interested in
setting up joint ventures with Jordan, especially in the tourism
sector.
</P>
<P>
Tourism is one of Jordan's pillar industry. It earned 600
million U.S. dollars a year in the 1980s, some 10 percent of the
kingdom's gross national product.
</P>
<P>
Also today, Jordanian Deputy Prime Minister Abdullah Ensour
briefed the delegation on the government's investment policy and
the strategy to promote the private sector's role in the national
economy.
</P>
<P>
The delegation met Jordanian Minister of Tourism and
Antiquities Akel Beltaji yesterday and will hold further talks
with Jordan's trade and economic representatives in the coming
days.
</P>
<P>
Qatar severed its relations with Jordan after the Gulf Crisis
broke out for Jordan sided with Iraq. When Jordan later distanced
itself away from Iraq to end international isolation, Qatar began
to restore touch in various sectors with Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's exports to Qatar reached some 25 million U.S. dollars
in 1996 compared with about 14 million dollars in the previous
year, according to a report of the Amman Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
Qatar exported some 8 million U.S. dollars worth of goods to
Jordan in 1996 compared with 9 million dollars in the previous
year.

<HEADLINE> Taliban Retreats from Northern Provincial Capital: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Afghan Islamic Taliban militia
were pushed back today by opposing forces from Pul-e-Khomri,
capital of northern Baghlan province, sources said.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban's offensive was repulsed by forces led by Mansoor
Nadvi, an ally of former military chief Ahmad Masood, said the
Taliban sources in Peshawar, Pakistan's northwestern major city.
</P>
<P>
But the sources claimed that it was a "tactic retreat", adding
that the Taliban were preparing a fresh attack on Pul-e-Khomri,
about 150 kilometers north of Kabul.
</P>
<P>
About 2,000 to 3,000 Taliban forces led by their "information
minister" Muhammad Muttaqi were now trapped in Pul-e-Khomri. In
the past few days the Islamic militia tried in vain to rescue the
group.
</P>
<P>
Muttaqi's forces became stuck when an enemy-turned-ally
switched allegiances again as the contingent was heading for the
northern capital of Mazar-e-Sharif, leaving them surrounded by
opposition forces.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban are currently facing an opposition of coalition
allies made up of Masood, ethnic Uzbek general Abdul Malik and the
Shiite religious minority faction Hezb-e-Wahdat in northern
Afghanistan.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon to Raise Import Duties on Cars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon announced today that import
duties on cars will be raised to protect environment.
</P>
<P>
The decision was taken at an extraordinary cabinet session
Tuesday night with the aim of "protecting the environment,
reducing the number of vehicles in Lebanon and improving the
country's balance of payment," said Fuad Sinyoura, minister of
state for financial affairs.
</P>
<P>
He was quoted by the state-owned Lebanese National News Agency
as saying today that Lebanon is having too many cars, importing
some 75,000 cars annually at a cost of around 800 million
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
He said that there are a total of 1.3 million cars in the
country, or a car for every three persons -- a ratio higher than
that in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Sinyoura said the burden of duty increase would fall on buyers
of middle-class and luxury vehicles as the duty on economical
vehicles has not changed.
</P>
<P>
Second-hand cars valued at less than 10,000 U.S. dollars will
not be affected because the minimum duty on them, which is 5
million Lebanese pounds (3,250 dollars), does not change, the
minister said, adding that new cars with a value of 10,000 dollars
or less will have 20 percent duty.
</P>
<P>
More expensive cars, costing between 10,000 U.S. dollars and
32,500 dollars, carry a 50 percent tax, which doubles to 100
percent for cars priced between 32,500 dollars and 65,000
dollars, he said.
</P>
<P>
The customs duty on luxury cars costing more than 65,000
dollars is set at 200 percent, he added.
</P>
<P>
Sinyoura stressed that the taxes would discourage people from
owning cars and boost public transport.

<HEADLINE> Turkey: No Fixed Date for Withdrawal From </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Turkish military operations that
began a month ago in northern Iraq will continue until routing
terrorism in the region, Turkish State Minister for Foreign
Affairs Abdullah Gul said here today.
</P>
<P>
Gul, who arrived this morning on a brief visit, made the
statement after handing over a message to Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak from Turkish President Suelyman Demirel on the
fragile situation in northern Iraq and the controversial
Turkish-Israeli military manoeuvers.
</P>
<P>
Emerging from the meeting, he defended Turkey's incursion into
northern Iraq as a mission to "protect its territorial integrity
and citizens and fight terrorism."
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Turkish troops, backed by air power, poured into
northern Iraq on May 14 in a cross-border operation against the
outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) bases which were used for
raids into southeast Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Gul told reporters that the military operation will end only
after meeting its aim, namely routing terrorism.
</P>
<P>
But Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa disputed the point
and said that Iraq should not be left open to any intervention
without considering its sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Moussa also lamented the failure of Turkey to announce a fixed
date for getting out of the Iraqi territories.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak has previously sent a message to Demirel voicing deep
concern over the Turkish military movement in northern Iraq which
has stirred Arab anger and world condemnation.
</P>
<P>
The message from Demirel also dealt with the planned joint
Israeli-Turkish military exercises in the Mediterranean in the
summer, said the Egyptian top diplomat.
</P>
<P>
Moussa confirmed that these manoeuvers have not yet taken
place, but he warned the military coalition between Israel and
Turkey is dangerous.
</P>
<P>
"Such relations could undermine or damage the situation in the
region as well as the Mideast peace process," he said.
</P>
<P>
"This move can escalate tension, especially that its timing
was not suitable," Moussa added.
</P>
<P>
Gul argued that those relations could never harm interests of
countries of the region.
</P>
<P>
He said consultations and contacts between the two presidents
are continuing in this respect "as we sometimes find an
interpretation which differs from the essence of the
Turkish-Israeli ties."
</P>
<P>
The planned war games that involve Israel, Turkey and the
U.S. in the Mediterranean in the summer have sparked fear in the
Arab world despite Ankara's assurance that they are of a
"humanitarian nature" and not targeted against any Arab country.

<HEADLINE> WFP to Launch Emergency Food Relief in Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations World Food
Program (WFP) planned to provide food relief to some 360,000
people living in southern Somalia before the arrival of the main
cereal harvest at the end of July.
</P>
<P>
Some 4,300 tons of food would be provided for the operation
which needs two million U.S. Dollars to pay transport costs, said
a WFP report issued here today.
</P>
<P>
Rains failed to come at the end of last year, resulting in
record-low production levels for Somalia's 1996-97 dry season.
</P>
<P>
The yield of sorghum, one of the two main cereals cultivated
in the dry season, was 20 percent lower than that of last year
and 80 percent lower than pre-war levels, said the report.
</P>
<P>
As a result, malnutrition, particularly among children, was
increasing at alarming rates. Many families in southwestern
Somalia have already begun migrating to urban areas and feeding
centers in search of food and assistance.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Accuses U.S. of Blocking Oil-for-Food Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, June 11 (Xinhua) -- An Iraqi newspaper today held the
U.S. responsible for blocking the implementation of the Memorandum
of Understanding (MOU) signed by Iraq and the U.N. a year ago.
</P>
<P>
In an editorial published here on Wednesday, Ath-tharwa Daily,
mouthpiece of the ruling Baath Party, said the U.S. shoulders
"moral and legal responsibility for the deaths of Iraqi children
and patients who could have been saved."
</P>
<P>
It is reported that more than 1 million Iraqis died of diseases
and malnutrition since the U.N. imposed sanctions on Iraq after
its August 1990 invasion of Kuwait. Most of them are women,
children and the aged.
</P>
<P>
The MOU, known as the oil-for-food deal, allows Iraq to buy 2
billion U.S. dollars worth of oil over six months to buy food,
medicine and other daily necessities. The deal has been renewed
for another six months from June 7.
</P>
<P>
But Iraq has accused the U.S. of deliberately delaying the
approval of the contracts Iraq signed with foreign companies under
the deal. Such contracts must be approved unanimously by the 15
U.N. Security Council members.
</P>
<P>
As a permanent Security Council member, the U.S. insists that
the U.N. impose tight controls to make sure the supplies are
distributed fairly and not used for military purpose.
</P>
<P>
The daily described the U.S. keenness to implement the MOU and
the "pretentious" humanitarian objectives which the U.S. officials
have been advocating as "mere hypocrisy that aims to absorb the
anti-U.S. pressure" inside and outside the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
It cited as an example the U.S. "unwarranted" interference in
the course of negotiations between Iraq and the U.N. held before
the MOU was concluded.
</P>
<P>
The daily asserted that before signing the MOU, Iraq had took
necessary measures to pave the way for oil contracts while making
preparations for the oil export and import of foodstuff, because
Iraq had expected the U.S.-made obstacles in the way of its
implementation.

<HEADLINE> Zanzibar's 1997/98 Budget Proposals Approved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The Zanzibar 1997/98 budget
proposals and development plan were passed today at the House of
Representatives in the town of Zanzibar.
</P>
<P>
According to a report reaching here, the Zanzibar government
pledged to revamp the economy through increased investments and
improved revenue collection.
</P>
<P>
The government will, during the next financial year, spend
55.4 billion Tanzania Shillings (about 92 million US Dollars),
out of which 42.4 billion T.Shs. will be for recurrent
expenditure while the rest will be for development expenditure.
</P>
<P>
Winding up the debate on the budget proposals which began on
Monday, Finance Minister Amina Salum Ali said that the government
will embark on a massive revenue collection drive to be
spearheaded by the new Zanzibar Revenue Board.
</P>
<P>
She said close supervision would be effected on petroleum
trade and the tourism industry to ensure availability of more
revenue.
</P>
<P>
Ali said the government will promote and closely monitor the
investment sector in addition to putting more emphasis on the
collection of revenue from inland sources and reduce dependence
on customs duty which depended on favourable business trends.
</P>
<P>
The government expects to collect 40.5 billion T.Shs. (about
67 million US Dollars) from various internal sources during
1997/98.
</P>
<P>
She said the government would continue to support development
projects through the injection of funds set aside for the
project. She, however, noted that the zeal shown by the people in
spearheading self-help projects was far above government
resources.
</P>
<P>
Winding up debate on the development plan earlier, the Minister
of State in the President's Office, Ali Juma Shamhuna, said that
the government will strive to sustain the Gross Domestic Product
(GDP) which has grown from 3.7 percent in 1995 to 6.3 percent
last year.
</P>
<P>
Shamhuna said the government will ensure that all economic
sectors contribute to the efforts to boost economic growth during
1997/98. He also pledged to improve economic and social
infrastructure including water and electricity, road network and
telecommunications in a bid to raise the living conditions in the
rural areas.

<HEADLINE> Cataract Menace Decried in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Fifty thousand Kenyans are
blinded by cataracts every year, local reports said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Forty percent of the blind patients in the eastern African
country suffer from cataracts, said Central Deputy Provincial
Commissioner Muli Malombe at the opening of a two-week cataract
surgery training session.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Fred Hollows Foundation of Australia, a
charitable organization, said at the session it will offer Kenya
medicine equipment and help the country train eye surgeons
especially in intraocular lens implants
</P>
<P>
The only known treatment for cataracts is surgery, which costs
about 80,000 Shillings (some 1481 U.S. Dollars) in the country's
private hospitals and 1,000 Shillings (46 Dollars) at Kenyatta
National Hospital.
</P>
<P>
Kenya now has about 38 eye surgeons (18 of them are
Nairobi-based) and 21 clinical officers specializing in this
area.

ADDIS ABABA, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The Eritrean government today

A press release issued by the Eritrean foreign ministry said
the Eritrean government "categorically rejects these mendacious
allegations", adding that the allegation "betrays an underlying
intention to launch an attack against Eritrea".
</P>
<P>
"This is indeed demonstrated by the call for general
mobilization being undertaken by the National Islamic Front (NIF)
regime along the common borders between the two countries and the
provocative threats that Sudanese senior officials have made this
week to attack Eritrean cities," the press release said.
</P>
<P>
It concluded that "the Eritrean government reserves its right of
self-defence" and the Sudanese authority "alone carries
the responsibility for its irresponsible acts".

<HEADLINE> Only 2 Million Dollars of Medicine Arrives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Health Minister Omed Medhat
Mubarak said today that only 2 million U.S. dollars worth of
medical supplies bought by Iraq under the "oil-for-food" deal has
arrived in the country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference here, Mubarak said that his
ministry has received only 2 million dollars worth of medical
supplies since the "oil-for-food" deal came into force in
December.
</P>
<P>
The "oil-for-food" deal, which was signed by Iraq and the
U.N. last May and has been renewed Monday, allows Iraq to sell 2
billion dollars worth of oil over six months to raise cash for
the humanitarian goods urgently needed in the country.
</P>
<P>
About 210 million dollars out of the total oil revenues is
earmarked for medicine and other medical supplies.
</P>
<P>
The delay of medical supplies has cost many lives of the
Iraqis, said Mubarak, adding that many of them could have been
saved if the medical supplies arrived in the country in time.
</P>
<P>
He said that the mortality rate among Iraqi children under
the age of five was 520 every month before the Gulf War, but it
has gone up to 4,212 as of last May.
</P>
<P>
He held the U.S. responsible for all this owing to its
obstruction of the medicine contracts signed by Iraq and foreign
companies under the deal.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said the U.S. representative to the U.N. Sanctions
Committee in charge of approving the contracts has held medicine
contracts related to epilepsy and cancer diseases as well as
other medicines used in surgical operations.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. representative, the minister said, is blocking
contracts of medicine, which are very important for the treatment
of the current season diseases.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Orders New Gun Regulations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 11 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Wednesday ordered new regulations requiring licensed gun dealers
to post signs and give buyers written warnings against passing off
firearms to minors, in the hope to disarm teen gangs.
</P>
<P>
"I want every adult who buys a gun to see that sign and think
about it before they give a child a gun that could wind up in gang
violence," Clinton said in outlining the directive to be carried
out through formal Treasury Department rules.
</P>
<P>
The president was speaking at Georgetown University to a youth
violence conference of law enforcement officers, child advocates
and gun-control activists.
</P>
<P>
Although crime rates are generally on the decline for
successive years, Clinton cited Justice Department projections
that current trends, if left unchecked, will see juvenile arrests
for violent crimes more than double by 2010.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Senate is drafting juvenile crime legislation in the
wake of a House-passed bill that rebuffed several Clinton
initiatives opposed by the gun lobby.
</P>
<P>
"A juvenile crime bill that doesn't crack down on guns and
gangs, that doesn't guarantee more prosecutors, more probation
officers and more `prevent programs' after school is a juvenile
crime bill in name only," the president said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton had asked for stiffer penalties against adults
transferring guns to kids, an expansion of the Brady law to
prevent violent juveniles from owning firearms as adults and a
requirement that every gun sold be equipped with child safety
locks.
</P>
<P>
The administration cites 1995 statistics from the federal
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that found that two in
25 high school students reported having carried a gun in the
previous 30 days.
</P>
<P>
The federal Bureau of Justice Statistics says handguns are the
leading cause of juvenile fatalities.
</P>
<P>
Clinton ordered that signs be posted at all handgun dealers
warning federal law prohibits the transfer of handguns to anyone
under age 18.
</P>
<P>
Some 124,000 gun dealers nationwide are regulated by the
Treasury Department's Bureau of Alcohol, tobacco and Firearms.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Military Urges Government to Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The Turkish Armed Forces today
urged the government to make great efforts to curb the rapidly
growing fundamentalist force in the country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference here, Head of
Counter-Intelligence of the General Staff Fevzi Turkeri said that
the fundamentalists were trying to establish an Islamic system in
the secular republic.
</P>
<P>
He noted that these fundamental organizations were quickly
increasing their strength, adding their existence had constituted
"the most dangerous threat to Turkey's secularist system."
</P>
<P>
Turkeri complained that the current coalition government took a
weak stance against these organizations.
</P>
<P>
The military official noted that although the Armed Forces
were reluctant to be linked with the political affairs, they would
"not hesitate to carry out their Constitutional duty to defend the
country's secularism and democracy."
</P>
<P>
He also said that Islamic Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan
maintained warm contacts with some religious leaders known for
their fundamental words and deeds.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the military sources attending the news conference
openly accused Iran of supporting Turkey's fundamentalists, saying
Tehran wanted to see an Islamic regime to be established in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish-Iranian relationship has seriously worsened during
the past months as a result of Ankara's accusation that Tehran
was exporting its Islamic revolution to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
In recent months, Turkish military has been pressing
Erbakan-led coalition government to take tough measures against
the fundamentalist groups.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian President on Restructuring of National </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 11 (Xinhua) --Tanzanian President Benjamin
Mkapa today said that restructuring of the Tanzania National Bank
of Commerce (NBC) was imminent despite public outcry that the
decision was "engineered" by the International Monetary Fund
(IMF).
</P>
<P>
Addressing commanders of the Tanzania People's Defence Forces
(TPDF),President Mkapa said restructuring would rescue NBC from
collapsing.
</P>
<P>
He said the restructuring idea has been long overdue and it
was not a result of external pressure from IMF.
</P>
<P>
"The idea is not new, it was first floated in 1990 by Nyirabu
(Banking) Commission," said Mkapa.
</P>
<P>
But he said that there was delay in working on the idea to
allow the commercial institution operate commercially.
</P>
<P>
Between 1991 and 1995, he said, the government took various
measures to re-organize the bank by injecting 198.1 billion
Tanzania Shillings (about 330 million US Dollars) to be used as
tax payers' money. Despite the measures, NBC operated below
profit line, he added.
</P>
<P>
Under the present set up, NBC which was established in 1967,
would be burden to the government because it was too big to
manage, said the president.
</P>
<P>
When restructured, NBC will creat three subsidiaries, Trade
Bank, Regional Bank and Micro-finance Bank, each with differing
customer groups in the country. too big to manage.
</P>
<P>
He told that the introduction of private banks as a result of
the on-going economic reforms has threatened survival of NBC.
</P>
<P>
President Mkapa further said his government would not inject
more money in NBC at the expense of other vital services.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Denies Threat to End Peacekeeping Forces' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 11 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. diplomat denied here today
that the United States has threatened to end the U.N. peacekeeping
forces' mission in Lebanon if a U.N. draft resolution requiring
Israel to pay war damages goes ahead.
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe that we have done that," said Richard Jones,
the U.S. ambassador to Lebanon, after visiting Lebanese Prime
Minister Rafik Hariri in the latter's office.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters at the end of the meeting, the U.S. envoy
reiterated his country's support for the 4,500-strong U.N. interim
force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), quoting an earlier statement made by
U.S. State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns.
</P>
<P>
Burns "stressed the support of the United States for the
peacekeeping forces and its role in keeping stability in the
region. This statement is very strong and I don't think its
necessary for me to say any more," Jones said.
</P>
<P>
On the draft resolution adopted last Saturday by the
U.N. general assembly's budgetary committee demanding Israel to
pay compensation for damages it caused to the UNIFIL last year,
the ambassador underlined that the issue is exclusively concerned
with the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. general assembly will vote Friday to confirm the
committee resolution requiring Israel to pay more than 1.7
million U.S. dollars for damages resulting from its shelling of a
UNIFIL camp at the south Lebanese town of Qana on April 18, 1996.
</P>
<P>
"I know that Lebanon is handling the issue as if it has
something to do with Qana. But in the view of the United
States, the issue is related to the United Nations especially
the international emergency forces operating in south Lebanon,"
the U.S. diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that it was a "very bad precedent" to ask a
certain country to pay compensation for an operation related
to the United Nations and "it has never taken place in the
United Nations' history."
</P>
<P>
Beirut media quoted U.S. delegate to the U.N. Linda Shenwick
as saying that "the adoption of the draft would make it hard for
Israel or the United States to support the force and make it
difficult for the United States to approve the extension of
UNIFIL's mandate next month."
</P>
<P>
Burns told a news briefing in Washington earlier this week
that it was "beyond the competence of the fifth committee to take
the decisions... fundamentally involving issues of international
peace and security, which are the primary responsibility of the
Security Council."

<HEADLINE> Britain Plans to Review Surrogacy Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 11 (Xinhua) -- British Health Minister Tessa
Jowell said today the government was ready to review laws
governing surrogate motherhood following a number of controversial
cases in the country.
</P>
<P>
"It is important that in an area as sensitive as surrogacy the
law is kept under review in order to ensure that it continues to
meet public concerns," Jowell told a parliamentary questioner.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, a three-member team will assess
whether payment for surrogacy, including expenses, should be
allowed, whether changes are needed in the current laws and
whether surrogacy arrangements should be regulated through a
government body.
</P>
<P>
"We have specifically asked the review team to consider the
issue within the context that surrogacy should not be
commercialized and that any woman who has a baby as part of a
surrogacy arrangement should not be compelled to give it up if she
changes her mind," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
In the past few months, a few controversial surrogate cases
have happened in Britain, causing pressure for the revision of the
law on the surrogate motherhood.

sovereignty and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with a delegation from the Chinese National

would stick to its "one China" policy, recognizing the People's
Republic of China as the sole legitimate government of China.

not to enhance cooperation as the cooperation is a trend toward
the development of the bilateral ties between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and China are the two important states in Asia and
Turkey attaches great importance to the relations between the
two countries, said Erbakan, adding that Ankara and Beijing
should make joint efforts to promote their economic and trade
ties.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that Turkish businessmen would invest
in China and Chinese businessmen would come to Turkey for the
same purpose.

The Chinese NPC delegation arrived in Turkey on June 5 for a
one-week good-will visit.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 11 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-two parliament
members of ruling Basutoland Congress Party (BCP) walked out of
National Assembly today, saying the speaker had legitimised a
coup by Prime Minister Ntsu Mokhehle.
</P>
<P>
Mokhehle on Monday announced the formation of a new party --
the Lesotho Congress for Democracy (LCD), and immediately
transferred the government power to the party.
</P>
<P>
Mokhehle said the new party had controlled a majority of
parliament with the support of 41 of 64 parliament members.
</P>

A spokesman for the BCP, which tried to expel Mokhehle as
leader, condemned the move as a "coup d'etat".
</P>
<P>
Some extra-parliament parties, including the Basutho National
Party and the National Progressive Party, also condemned the
move, which they termed unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
The walkout of BCP parliament members took place just before
the tabling of a motion of confidence in Mokhehle and his new
government by Lesotho Deputy Prime Minister Pakalitha Mosisili,
who is also deputy leader of the LCD.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the walkout, some BCP members questioned Parliament
Speaker Teboho Kolane why he was legitimizing the unlawful
actions taken by Mokhehle, BCP National Executive member Tshiliso
Makhakhe told reporters.
</P>
<P>
BCP members were demanding a normal swearing-in process for
members of the new party, inclduing the prime minister, as well
as notification of the changes to the King Letsie III, Makhakhe
said.

There were several attacks by members of the BCP against the
speaker, accusing him of bias, he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Lesotho Information and Broadcasting Minister
Monyane Moleleki said today that threats by oppostion MPs to make
the National Assembly unworkable would not materialize.

comfortable without unnecessary noise and hackling," he said.

JOHANNESBURG, June 11 (Xinhua) -- South African Deputy
President Thabo Mbeki has said that political transformation from
apartheid in the country is close to stalling because of
resistance by whites.

There was a growing tendency among whites to blame blacks for
the failures of the first Government of National Reconciliation,
Mbeki told the parliament yesterday.

Mbeki pointed out that corruption caused by three centuries of
white domination was to blame for social inequalities which he
said have been escalating crime, corruption and a lack of values.

South Africa could not build a sound moral foundation while
whites continued to insist that apartheid was harmless, Mbeki
said.
</P>

Mbeki also criticized the white for their hostility towards
Archbishop Desmond Tutu's Truth and Reconciliation Commission,
which is empowered to pardon offenders who freely confess to
human rights offenses committed during the apartheid era.

presidential palace, Chirac denied that he has changed attitude
toward European integration by emphasizing more on social aspects
and employment than monetary and financial aspects.
</P>
<P>
"I have not changed my view. I agree with the present requests
of the French government (of Lionel Jospin). There should also be
a coordination of economic policies (among European countries) and
on this point we should also make progress," said Chirac during a
brief meeting with the press.
</P>
<P>
The Socialist government of Prime Minister Jospin has asked the
European Union (EU) to add a chapter on employment and
coordination of economic policy into the Stability Pact on the
future European single currency.
</P>
<P>
"It is nevertheless the case that Europe is not only a
financial and monetary problem, but also one of men and women who
need to be respected and taken into account," said Chirac.
</P>
<P>
Chirac also said that he thought the Stability Pact would be
ratified at the EU Amsterdam summit to be held next Monday and
Tuesday. He said that France, now under cohabitation of
government, would speak "with one voice" at the summit.

<HEADLINE> US Issues Counterterrorism Reward </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. today reissued a two
million U.S. dollar reward for information leading to the arrest
of people who committed terrorist acts against U.S. citizens in
Greece.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government is renewing its appeals to the Greek people
for information regarding terrorism against Americans under a
counterterrorism rewards program in close cooperation with the
Greek government, State Department Spokesman Nicholas Burns said.
</P>
<P>
Four Americans were murdered in Athens in the past 22 years
while 28 others were injured in the terrorism incidents, according
to Burns. A Greek shipbuilder was assassinated in the Greek
capital two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
In February 1996, the American embassy in Athens was attacked
by a rocket and the U.S. issued the reward for help to capture the
people who did it.
</P>
<P>
"We have paid out over 5 million U.S. dollars over the last
decade or so in rewards to people all around the world... who have
helped us to capture terrorists," Burns said.
</P>
<P>
"We have not forgotten about the four Americans who died in
Athens over the last 22 years," he added. "We will not forget
about them until the Greek government and the American government
and others around the world can locate the people who murdered
them and bring them to justice."

<HEADLINE> Emir of Qatar Urges US to Improve Ties With Iran, Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 11 (Xinhua) -- The Emir of Qatar today urged
U.S. President Bill Clinton to reconsider the strategy of "dual
containment" of Iran and Iraq and to improve relations with the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
Qatari Foreign Minister Hamad bin Jasmin told reporters that
the Emir, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, raised the point in
an oval office when he met with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
He said Clinton "respected the Emir's ideas," but he
acknowledged the two leaders had "different opinions" on the
subject.
</P>
<P>
The Emir, who is in Washington to promote a Middle East
economic summit in Qatar's capital in November, told the
Washington Post in an interview published today that he could not
endorse the "dual containment" of Qatar's two neighbors.
</P>
<P>
He said Iran's recently-held presidential elections meant the
United States had "no more excuses" for its policy toward Iran and
"communication with Iraq is better for the United States and
better for the area."
</P>
<P>
On Iraq, the Emir said the Iraqi people had suffered enough
because of U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
But the Emir's proposals were rebuffed and the White House said
the United States would stick to the "dual containment" strategy.
</P>
<P>
"We think our strategy... is a correct one," White House
spokesman Mike McCurry said.
