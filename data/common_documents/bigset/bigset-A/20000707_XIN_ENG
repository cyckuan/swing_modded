<HEADLINE> Davenport Advances into Wimbledon Women's Singles Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Defending champion Lindsay Davenport
of the United States booked a women's singles final meeting with
Venus Williams on Saturday after a straight 6-4, 6-2 victory over
Australian Jelena Dokic.
</P>
<P>
The opening set was a scrappy affair that saw seven breaks of
serve in total.
</P>
<P>
The 17-year-old Australian made the first breakthrough and
raced into a 2-0 lead but Davenport began to find her range and
responded to lead 3-2 until the game moved into a topsy-turvy
affair with neither player able to hold their serve.
</P>
<P>
Reigning champion Davenport finally obliged to take the opening
set 6-4 in 28 minutes.
</P>
<P>
And Davenport seized the advantage once again at the start of
the second set as a backhand into the net from the Australian gave
the American a break in the third game.
</P>
<P>
Dokic was causing Davenport most problems when she was able to
move her around the court but she was still often reliant on
Davenport errors.
</P>
<P>
As the game went on these were becoming fewer and a wayward
cross-court volley from Dokic gave Davenport another break and
move into a 5-2 lead in the second.
</P>
<P>
Without displaying the sort of form that she will need to
defeat Venus Williams, Davenport clinched victory at the first
attempt with a clinical last serve.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Talks Proceed Smoothly in Geneva </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The third round of the U.N.-
sponsored proximity talks for the reunification of the Cyprus
island have been proceeding smoothly in Geneva for the first three
days, local media reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The exploratory phase of the talks, which started on July 5 in
Geneva, is coming to an end and the talks are expected to go into
the substance of the Cyprus issue, reports said.
</P>
<P>
The eastern Mediterranean island of Cyprus has been split into
the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities since 1974 when Turkey
invaded and occupied the northern third of the island in the wake
of a short-lived coup by supporters of union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
Two rounds of U.N.-brokered proximity talks between Cyprus
President Glafcos Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash
were held in New York last December and Geneva last February.
</P>
<P>
Fears of a likely collapse of the third round of talks from the
very beginning followed the earlier statements by Denktash that he
might not head to Geneva for the talks.
</P>
<P>
Denktash had also said that he would only go to Geneva to
express his dissatisfactions with the removal of the addendum from
the latest U.N. Security Council resolution on Cyprus, which
expressed his view that the U.N. peace force in Cyprus could not
operate without the consent of his breakaway state.
</P>
<P>
According to reports from Geneva, however, both Clerides and
Denktash have so far appeared satisfied with the first phase of the
third round of talks.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan's Special Adviser
for Cyprus Alvaro de Soto Friday announced in Geneva that the talks
will be adjourned next Wednesday and will resume on July 24.
</P>
<P>
The suspension of the talks was proposed by the Greek Cypriot
side due to some political developments expected to be made known
when the time is right, political sources said.
</P>
<P>
Denktash asked for suspending the talks so as to attend his
breakaway state's "celebration" for the Turkish invasion of the
island's northern third in July 1974.
</P>
<P>
De Soto said "there are political consideration which led to the
break and it is a subject of compromise."

<HEADLINE> Jordan Spares No Efforts to Support Palestinian Course: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Foreign Minister Abdel Ilah
Khatib stressed here on Friday his kingdom will do its utmost to
support the Palestinians to restore their legitimate rights,
including the establishment of an independent Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks in a meeting with visiting Secretary of the
Executive Committee of the Palestinian Liberation Organization
Mahmoud Abbas.
</P>
<P>
Abbas arrived here earlier in the day to brief Jordan on the
principled Palestinian stand during the upcoming summit between the
United States, Israel and the Palestinians slated for July 11 at
the David Camp near Washington, Jordan's official news agency Petra
reported without elaborating.
</P>
<P>
The visit by the Palestinian official to Amman is part of a
bilateral consultation mechanism between Jordan and the
Palestinians over the Israeli-Palestinian peace process.
</P>
<P>
The kingdom has been a major peace broker between Israel and its
Arab neighbors since it signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994
as the second Arab state after Egypt to reach peace with the Jewish
state.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Jordanian King Abdullah Bin Hussein held
telephone conversations with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, calling on parties
concerned to exert their utmost efforts to pave the way for a
success of the David Camp summit.
</P>
<P>
The monarch stressed that Jordan hopes the three-way summit
will result in a just and durable peace agreement between Israel
and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Jordan believes a solution to the Palestinian issue is the core
to a just, durable and comprehensive peace for all peoples in the
region, including Israelis.

<P>
KUWAIT CITY, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Qatar welcomes the forthcoming
three-way summit by U.S., Israeli and Palestinian leaders next
Tuesday in Camp David near Washington, said a senior Qatari
official Friday.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Hamad Bin Jassim al-Thani expressed hope that
all parties concerned will go into the talks seriously and
earnestly.
</P>
<P>
The summit, which will begin next Tuesday with the participation
of U.S. President Bill Clinton, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak,
and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, will try to resolve the
thorny issues in the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks such as
Jerusalem, Palestinian refugees, borders, Jewish settlements and
water.
</P>
<P>
The two sides will try to reach a framework agreement before the
September target date for a final peace accord.
</P>
<P>
And he voiced hope that all outstanding issues will be mulled
over at the summit with a view to producing positive results that
might push forward the peace process in the region.
</P>
<P>
He highlighted the major role played by Clinton in mediating
between the two sides and acclaimed his eagerness for clinching an
all-out peace deal between the Palestinians and Israel, the Qatari
News Agency monitored here reported.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Administration will seek through convening the summit
to bring closer the positions of the two sides ahead of Clinton's
elapse of term in office next January.

peace efforts as he prepares to leave for a pivotal three-way

CAIRO, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs from
the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
GAZA -- Palestinian Housing Minister Abdul Rahman Hamad said a
power station will be operated by the Palestinians for the first
time in decades early next summer to stop reliance on Israeli
supplies.
</P>
<P>
Hamad told reporters Friday that the new facility would bring to
an end Israeli monopoly of power supplies to the Palestinian self-
rule areas, adding that by 2003 the electricity utility would be
fully dependant on national resources.
</P>
<P>
The minister, also head of the Palestinian Energy Authority
(PEA), mentioned the ongoing efforts to set up power grids and
ensure funds for power projects, especially in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Hamad said his ministry has obtained some grants and loans to
provide all Palestinian rural areas with power and the year 2003
has been set as the deadline for making electricity available to
all villages.
</P>
<P>
The PEA has signed contracts with some local and foreign
companies on the construction of a 144-megawatt power station at
Gaza Valley next year at a cost of 92 million U.S. dollars, said
the minister.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Cairo will host a conference entitled "Egyptian
insurance industry, seeking a place on the world market" on Monday.
</P>

GAZA -- Palestinian Housing Minister Abdul Rahman Hamad and Head
of the Palestinian Energy Authority (PEA) told reporters here on
Friday that the drilling process at the recently-discovered natural
gas field off Gaza coast would kick off next month.
</P>
<P>
"British Gas will launch the drilling operation to fathom the
reserve of the field which lies under full Palestinian control next
or minimally the following month," he added.
</P>
<P>
The test scheme would run until late this summer, he said,
stressing that all studies and research so far have turned out
positive.
</P>
<P>
Initial examinations showed that the natural gas reserves off
the Gaza Strip coast could well cover local needs, which would
allow exports to foreign markets, he said without elaborating on
the figures.
</P>
<P>
Commercial production of Palestinian natural gas would start in
late 2002 or early 2003, he added.

DUBAI -- Dubai emirate of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) signed
a memo of understanding with Jordan on cooperation in trade,
education, management, information technology and custom fields.
</P>
<P>
The memo was the second of its kind in three years after the one
signed between the emirate and Egypt last May.
</P>
<P>
The document involved a potential cooperation agreement between
Jordan's Export Promotion Agency and trade centers and the Dubai-

<P>
LONDON, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams said
Friday that he would travel to the United States this weekend to
brief the political leaders and White House officials on the
current situation in the Northern Ireland peace process.
</P>
<P>
Adams said he would be seeking U.S. backing to ensure that
Britain fulfilled the commitments it undertook in the 1998 Good
Friday Agreement.
</P>
<P>
Adams hit out at recent violent protests by Protestant
hardliners against a ban on the pro-British Orange Order from
marching through Catholic enclaves in Belfast and Portadown.
</P>
<P>
"There is... a focus on the current violence around the Orange
Order's demand to march through nationalist areas in the north.
The desire for unionist domination and supremacy which these
marches reflect is a legacy of our past," Reuters quoted Adams as
saying.
</P>
<P>
"Those who make these demands are against progress, but do not
reflect... the many decent Protestants and unionists who are
appalled by the campaign of intimidation and terror that is
allegedly carried out in their name," he added.

<HEADLINE> EU to Provide 1 Bln Euro For Debt Relief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The European Union will support to
the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative
with total contribution worth of more than one billion euros (one
euro equals some 0.95 U.S. dollars), the European Commission said
here Friday.
</P>
<P>
EU Commissioner for Development Cooperation and Humanitarian
Aid Poul Nielson signed Friday with World Bank administered Trust
Fund for this support to HIPC Initiative.
</P>
<P>
Through the Trust Fund, 680 million euros will help
multilateral development banks give debt relief to the Asia,
Pacific and Caribbean countries, while 54 million euros will go to
Latin American and East Asian countries. Another 348 million euros
will be used to reduce debt owed to the EU.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission said the EU is the single largest
contributor to the HIPC Trust Fund providing almost one third of
the total amount pledged by all donors. The EU also leads in terms
of actual payments. Following the EU's signature today, the first
payment to the Trust Fund of more than 300 million euros will be
made, which is by far the single highest amount paid into the
Trust Fund.
</P>
<P>
Nielson said he hopes the EU's example will encourage the Group
of Seven industrialized nations (G7 Group) and other donors to
take decisive steps to pay what they have pledged. "I now urge
others to pay into this Trust Fund. This is a start -- but
financing will only be secured if other donors now rapidly
contribute to the Fund. We must move to actual payments and build
on this momentum," he said.
</P>
<P>
The HIPC Initiative was launched in September 1996. It
represented a concerted effort by all donors and multilateral
creditors to address the problem of external indebtedness of low-
income countries.

<HEADLINE> Molecular Structure Suggests How A Gene Can "Jump" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 50 years after a landmark
paper proposed the existence of what later came to be called
jumping genes, scientists are getting their first clear snapshot
of one caught in midair.
</P>
<P>
In Friday's issue of the journal Science, a University of
Wisconsin-Madison team describes the 3-dimensional, atomic
structure of an enzyme that allows a transposable genetic element
in a bacterium called Escherischia coli to "jump" from one part of
DNA to another.
</P>
<P>
The structure of the protein, the Escherischia coli Tn5
transposase bound to the Tn5 transposable element, gives
researchers a new framework for understanding how transposable
elements operate, according to the paper's lead authors Ivan
Rayment and Bill Reznikoff.
</P>
<P>
"Transposable elements have the potential to remodel genomes
and to facilitate the movement of genetic information, such as
antibiotic resistance," says Reznikoff, a molecular geneticist.
</P>
<P>
Transposition of DNA is central to genetics and evolution, and
transposable elements are an important source of the mutations on
which natural selection operates. Scientists estimate that
transposable elements make up as much as 30 percent of the human
genome.
</P>
<P>
The team's findings also have implications for AIDS researchers
because the human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) uses a process
similar to DNA transposition to insert itself into human DNA.
</P>
<P>
In 1951, geneticist Barbara McClintock proposed "controlling
elements" to explain genetic patterns she observed in corn. Many
geneticists were slow to appreciate the importance McClintock's
discovery, for which she received a Nobel Prize in 1983. However,
researchers have since made remarkable progress in understanding
the molecular nature of transposable elements.

<HEADLINE> EU Urges Member States to Step Up Euro Information </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission is calling
on 11 member states of the euro zone to step up consumer
information on euro, in particular by promoting dual pricing and
the use of the Eurologo in shops.
</P>
<P>
In the 18 months remaining, it is necessary to ensure that full
information is made available in a timely and user-friendly way,
said the Commission, the European Union's executive body.
</P>
<P>
According to recent opinion poll, half of the citizens in the
euro zone countries felt well informed about the euro while the
other half had little or no information. About one third of the
consumers in the euro zone know their national currency will be
replaced by the euro in 2002.
</P>
<P>
More than half trust retailers to convert prices correctly, but
the others fear being cheated by retailers either when they set
prices or when they get change.
</P>
<P>
The EU executive believes that with 18 months to go before the
changeover to the euro, member states of the euro zone still have
a lot of work to do to ensure that all consumers will be ready and
confident in using the new currency.
</P>
<P>
While results are encouraging, efforts to reach out to those
citizens still unaware of the upcoming introduction of the euro
need to be stepped up, the Commission said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, European consumer and business organizations also
reacted to the poll results with a joint appeal to national
authorities issued today, urging support for campaigns promoting
the use of the Eurologo and similar voluntary codes of conduct.

<HEADLINE> New Study Tallies High Expense of Computer Viruses, Hacking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Viruses and computer hackers
will cost businesses around the world more than 1.5 trillion U.S.
dollars this year, according to a study released Friday.
</P>
<P>
A global survey of 4,900 information technology professionals
across 30 countries, conducted by U.S. trade magazine
InformationWeek and fielded by accounting firm
PricewaterhouseCoopers, found that the key costs involved in
correcting IT systems infected a virus are found in lost
productivity as a result of downtime for computer systems, as well
as lost sales opportunities.
</P>
<P>
In North America, technology professionals this year will
suffer system downtime of 3.24 percent, while downtime to 3.28
percent on a worldwide basis. To look at the impact another way,
the study found that this year alone 6,882 person years of
productivity will be lost in North America and nearly 40,000 will
be lost worldwide.
</P>
<P>
The study estimates that some 50,000 firms in the United States
are sufficiently large enough to be impacted by and accurately
tally up the cost of a software virus. In total, the bill to these
U.S. firms this year for viruses and computer hacking will amount
to 266 billion dollars, or more than 2.5 percent of the nation's
GDP. The price tag worldwide soars to 1.6 trillion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The 266-billion-dollar figure represents the impact of viruses
on U.S. businesses with more than 1,000 employees, or about 50,000
firms. "These are companies with infrastructures of IT
professionals who, because of the dollar impact, are increasingly
tracking the problem and can provide an accurate assessment of the
scope of the issue," InformationWeek said in a report. "In reality,
the true impact of viruses on U.S. businesses, including medium-
sized companies and businesses, is much greater."
</P>
<P>
Viruses and the hackers that deploy them were nonce viewed as
clever pranksters, according to the study, but are now seen as
real threats. "Information technology now runs businesses around
the globe," said the report. "Whatever stops the computer systems
stops business."

<HEADLINE> Clinton Postpones Execution of Federal Inmate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 7 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton has
decided to postpone the execution of a federal prisoner until the
Justice Department announce new federal clemency guidelines, the
White House said Friday.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Jake Siewert said Clinton will stay the
August 5 scheduled execution of Juan Raul Garza, who was convicted
in 1993 in Brownsville, Texas for killing three men.
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department is expected to complete work on the
clemency guidelines within a week or so.
</P>
<P>
"Given that time line, we expect the president will stay Mr.
Garza's sentence to make sure that process has an opportunity to
play itself out," Siewert said.
</P>
<P>
"We want Mr. Garza to have an opportunity to submit a request
for clemency. We want to make sure that there are firm guidelines
in place."
</P>
<P>
Garza's execution will be the first one of a federal death row
inmate since 1963. He is one of 21 federal prisoners awaiting
execution.
</P>
<P>
Since the death penalty was reinstated by the Supreme Court in
1976, there have been 651 state executions, but not even one at
the federal level.
</P>
<P>
A heated debate is currently going on in the United States over
the fairness of the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton, who is a death-penalty supporter, has called
for  "broadest possible use" of DNA evidence to ensure its
fairness and safeguards to ensure defendants are adequately
represented.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Conduct Crucial Test of Missile Defense System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A four-hour launch window opens at 7:00 p.m. local time (0200
GMT Saturday) at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California State
where a target missile is poised for launch.
</P>
<P>
Weather permitting, a Minuteman intercontinental missile with a
dummy warhead on top was scheduled to be launched from the base
toward the Pacific Marshall Islands sometime during the test
window.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. "hit-to-kill" weapon would be fired atop its own missile
from Kwajalein Atoll 6880 kilometers away about 20 minutes after
the Vandenberg launch in an attempt to maneuver, intercept and
smash into the "enemy" warhead.
</P>
<P>
The 55-kilogram weapon, built by Raytheon Co., is designed to
hit and smash the target into space dust at a speed of 24,000 kph
in a flash that would be captured by long-range cameras.
</P>
<P>
The first such test last October was successful, although there
was a problem with finding the approaching warhead. A second such
test failed early this year.
</P>
<P>
Greenpeace claimed that activists had infiltrated the base to
try to stop the 100-million-U.S.-dollar test, but Vandenberg Air
Force Base spokesman John Cherry said there was no evidence of
intruders in the heavily patrolled area around the launch pad.
</P>
<P>
The results of Friday's test will weigh heavily in U.S.
President Bill Clinton's planned decision in the coming months on
whether to begin building the NMD.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said earlier that he will take into account the
feasibility of such a system, its cost, its impact on the overall
national security system and an assessment of the threat to the
Untied States when he makes his decision.
</P>
<P>
The anti-missile system is designed to provide protection for
all 50 U.S. states against ballistic missile attacks. A base with
20 interceptor missiles would be built in Alaska State, along with
a new radar to help guide the missiles to their target. By 2007,
under the current schedule, the system would be expanded to 100
interceptor missiles. The Pentagon estimates the cost at 36
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Arms control experts said the U.S. NMD, opposed by the
international community, will not only spark a new arms race, but
also threaten security and stimulate nuclear proliferation,
instead of promoting security and stemming the spread of nuclear
weapons.

ADDIS ABABA, July 7 (Xinhua) -- A palaeoanthropological site as
old as some four million years has been discovered at Galili
locality in the Mulu Basin, about 250 km east of Addis Ababa, the
Ethiopian Information and Culture Ministry announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
A research, which was conducted since 1998 by an Ethiopian
anthropologist Yohannes Haile-Selassie, unveiled the new site
which yielded a number of hominid and faunal remains, a press

middle Awash, Omo and Konso constitute only a few compared with
the over-all palaeoanthropological potential in the country.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary analysis of the hominid specimens from Galili shows
that these specimen are chronologically more primitive than
Lucy's species, the release said.
</P>
<P>
Lucy species, found in eastern Afar State in 1974, is believed
to be the oldest, most complete human ancestor yet discovered in

LUSAKA, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's ruling party Friday
expelled a senior member for violation of the party's guideline by
announcing his intention to run for presidency of the party.
</P>
<P>
The decision to expel Ben Mwila, who is National Treasurer of
the ruling Movement for Multi-Party Democracy (MMD), was announced
here Friday evening by MMD's publicity and information chairman
Vernon Mwaanga.
</P>
<P>
Mwaanga said the decision was made by the MMD National

<HEADLINE> Iranian Parties Urge Thorough Probe into Student Dorm Incident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Two reformist parties in Iran on
Friday urged government agencies to make thorough investigations
into a student dormitory incident that sparked nation-wide riots
last July.
</P>
<P>
The roots of the incident must be found out and all persons
responsible should be identified and punished, said a statement
issued by the Islamic Labor Party on the occasion of the first
anniversary of the incident.
</P>
<P>
It added that merely trying some soldiers and police commanders
are far from being enough, because the people want those behind the
scenes to be exposed.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Iran Solidarity Party, in a separate statement, also
criticized the court proceeding of the incident, saying the public
has not yet been satisfied with the process, the Islamic Republic
News Agency (IRNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The file of the dormitory case is still open while no
satisfactory results have been achieved, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Anti-riot police and plainclothes men stormed a Tehran
University dormitory on July 8 last year to crack down on student
protests against press restrictions, especially the closure of the
outspoken daily Salam by the conservative authorities.
</P>
<P>
The incident triggered six-day riots around the country, the
worst unrest Iran had experienced since the 1979 Islamic
revolution. At least one person died and a lot of others were
injured in the clashes.
</P>
<P>
Iran's military court ended its three-month trial of some 20
police commanders involved in the dormitory incident in May, but no
verdict has been issued yet.
</P>
<P>
Those tried included former Tehran police commander Brigadier
General Farhad Nazari and commander of the special unit of the
Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Colonel Jamshid Khodabakhshi.
</P>
<P>
All of the suspects denied the allegation that they were
responsible for the dormitory incident, insisting that they had
acted on orders of superiors and in accordance with their legal
duties.
</P>
<P>
They blamed their charges on rumors and accusations and
expressed hope that they would be acquitted.
</P>
<P>
Iran's reformists insist that the investigations and trial are
far from being enough, demanding that those behind the scenes and
really responsible for the incident should be found out and
punished.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Iran's Ministry of Science, Research and Technology
also called for an in-depth investigation into the incident.
</P>
<P>
There must be a firm probe to track down the root cause of the
incident, the ministry said in a statement issued on the occasion
of the first anniversary of the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
Students of Tehran University have decided to observe July 8 as
the "National Day Against Violence" to mark the tragic incident,
IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
The students will offer flowers to the people on the main
squares of Tehran on July 8 to mark the anniversary.
</P>
<P>
"We will offer flowers to the people with a smile" to mark the
anniversary of the incident and "will avoid any action which may
lead to violence," a student organization called "the Office to
Foster Unity" told the agency on Monday.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. special
representative of the secretary-general for children and armed
conflict, Olara Otunnu, Friday welcomed the ratification by Canada
of a new treaty designed to prevent anyone under 18 from
participating in hostilities.
</P>
<P>
Lloyd Axworthy, Canada's minister for foreign affairs and
international trade, deposited Canada's instrument of ratification
of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the
Child on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict at the
United Nations headquarters in New York Friday.
</P>
<P>
Canada was the first member state to sign the Optional Protocol.
</P>
<P>
"I warmly congratulate the government of Canada on this
occasion," Otunnu said.
</P>
<P>
"This development is especially appropriate because Canada has
been playing a very dynamic leadership role in advocating for the
protection of children exposed to abuse and brutalization in
situations of armed conflict," Otunnu said.
</P>
<P>
"Our goal is to have the Optional Protocol come into force by
the end of this year," he said.
</P>
<P>
To date, eight countries have signed the Optional Protocol. The
treaty comes into force when it has been ratified by 10 members
states.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda Has Right to War Reparation: OAU Panel Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 7 (Xinhua) -- An international panel
Friday blamed the international community for the failure to stop
the 1994 Rwanda Genocide, saying that the African country should
receive financial reparations from the world community for the
massacre of more than 500,000 people.
</P>
<P>
The Organization of Africa Unity (OAU), in a report released
here Friday, accused the United States, France, Belgium and the U.
N. Security Council of failing to take action to stop the 90-day
genocide when they had the means to do so.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council "members could have prevented the
genocide to take place. They failed to do so," said the committee
in its 318-page report.
</P>
<P>
The report, entitled "Rwanda: the Preventable Genocide," was
drawn up by seven individuals headed by former Botswana President
Ketumile Masire. The group as formed by the OAU in 1998 to
investigate the causes of the genocide in Rwanda and make
recommendations to avoid the recurrence of such crimes.
</P>
<P>
"In the name of both justice and accountability, reparations
are owed to Rwanda by actors in the international community for
their role before, during and since the genocide," the report said.
</P>
<P>
The genocide was orchestrated by a small group of Hutu
extremists against the Tutsi minority. More than half a million
Tutsi and thousands of moderate Hutus were killed in a slaughter
that ended when Tutsi-led rebels seized control.
</P>
<P>
Hutu extremists killed between 500,000 and 800,000 Tutsi and
opposition Hutus between April and July 1994, said the panel. The
report singled out the United States and France, whose influence
in the Security Council and in Rwanda made them all the more
responsible for the international community's inaction in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
"They were in a position to insist that attacks on the Tutsi
must cease, and they chose never to exert that influence," the
report said.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference here, one of the members of the panel,
Stephen Lewis, who is former Canadian ambassador to the United
Nations, said the U.S. role was a "shame" and reflected badly on U.
S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, the U.S. ambassador to
the United Nations, at the time.
</P>
<P>
"The role of the U.S. at the Security Council, in determinedly
blocking a more effective U.N. intervention force throughout the
entire genocide, is an almost incomprehensible scar of shame on
American foreign policy," Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
"I want to say, as a personal observation, I don't know how
Madeline Albright lives with it," he said.

another important contribution towards efforts to shed more light
on the tragedy that unfolded in Rwanda."
</P>
<P>
"The secretary-general hopes that this report will make an
effective contribution to the success of the international
community's ongoing efforts as it continues to grapple with the
complex challenges of preventing genocide," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The panel recommended Annan appoint a commission to determine
reparations owned by the international community to Rwanda.

<HEADLINE> Russia, Greece Move to Expand Bilateral Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Russian and Greek top defense
officials reached here Friday a consensus on a wide range of
international and regional issues and concluded a package of
accords to strengthen their cooperation in the military and
security fields.
</P>
<P>
The two sides discussed bilateral relations, particularly in
the fields of defense and arms sales, and European security issues,
Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev told the press after a 90-
minute meeting with his Greek counterpart, Apostolos-Athanasios
Tsokhatzopoulos.
</P>
<P>
The two countries hold the same or similar positions on most
international and regional issues, and the security in
Southeastern Europe was given special attention, Sergeyev said.
</P>
<P>
Tsokhatzopoulos who arrived in Russia Thursday for a two-day
visit, emphasized the need for preserving the 1972 anti-ballistic
missile (ABM) treaty.
</P>
<P>
"The world is not eager to get rid of that treaty," he said.
The development of a so-called tactical ABM system by the United
States would "disturb the world balance," said the Greek minister.
</P>
<P>
Both parties confirmed their interest in maintaining peace and
stability in Southeastern Europe and maintaining intact borders,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The two countries strongly oppose separatist movements and
reiterated the need to fight terrorism, Tsokhatzopoulos said.
</P>
<P>
The talks also covered issues concerning free shipping on the
Mediterranean and Black Seas, and the implementation of various
joint projects, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, Alexei Ogaryov, general director of Russia's
top arms trader Rosvooruzhenie, told reporters that the outlook
for the sale of Russian arms to Greece is "very good."
</P>
<P>
Ogaryov attended a series of the meetings that Tsokhatsopoulos
had in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
Rosvooruzhenie supplied Greece with "Osa-AKM"' anti-aircraft
missile systems in 1999, and is now supplying "Zubr" hovercraft-
landing ships under a contract signed in 2000. The company is also
helping with the operation of an "S-300PMU1" anti-aircraft system
and training its Greek crew on the island of Crete.
</P>
<P>
"In light of the successful use of T-80U tanks on Cyprus, we
have a good chance in the current tender to sell this basic tank
to Greece," Ogaryov said.
</P>
<P>
Joint work in modernizing Soviet and Russian defense hardware
owned by Greece is another promising field for cooperation, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Friday, Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Greek
minister exchanged views at the Kremlin on preserving the 1972 ABM
treaty and the setting up of a European ABM system, stressing that
"our views on this issue are similar."
</P>
<P>
Putin noted the importance of "Greek channel" in Russia-NATO
relations, highly evaluating the relations between Russia and
Greece.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan House Speaker Calls for Eligible Members for East African Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan National Assembly
Speaker Francis Ayume Friday urged east African countries to elect
knowledgeable members to the Legislative Assembly of the region.
</P>
<P>
"The East African Legislative Assembly should not be used as a
place for off-loading rejects who have failed to perform in their
respective national assemblies," Ayume said at a one-day meeting
of National Assemblies speakers held here Friday.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that people elected to the assembly should have
rich experience with legislative procedures, adding "they should
also have the East African Community at heart."
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, speakers from Uganda, Kenya and the host
Tanzania exchanged views on the implementation of the East African
Community (EAC) Treaty, especially of that of Article 50, which
provides for the election of members of the East African
Legislative Assembly by national parliaments.
</P>
<P>
The article stipulates that elected members should be able to
translate the treaty into laws that could be easily understood by
common people in the region.
</P>
<P>
The meeting on Friday, which was chaired by speaker of the
Tanzanian National Assembly Pius Msekwa, also deliberated the role
of the east African national parliaments in strengthening and
consolidating the integration process in east Africa.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Envoy Stresses no Change to Blue Line </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 7 (Xinhua) -- U.N. special envoy to the Middle East
Terje Roed-Larsen stressed here Friday afternoon the U.N.-drawn
Blue Line is "final and will not be changed."
</P>
<P>
After meeting with Lebanese leaders, he told reporters there are
some misunderstandings about the Blue Line, which was established
by the U.N. to verify Israel's withdrawal from south Lebanon on May
24.
</P>
<P>
"First of all, I want you to know there is not a concrete
boundary between Lebanon and Israel," he said, adding "U.N. experts
team uses more than 100 maps to set the line. And I also make it
clear that the line is not an international border. It is up to
states to demarcate border."
</P>
<P>
Larsen reiterated the line will not be changed because it is set
just to verify Israel's pullout from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the village of Ghajar that is cut apart by the line,
Larsen said he has not discussed the issue with Lebanese leaders.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. official also defended the international body's
neutrality toward the line.
</P>
<P>
"We are not biased or impure in demarcating the line," he said,
asserting "any problems stemming from the process are technical,
not political."
</P>
<P>
After U.N. cartographers drew the Blue Line in June to mark the
border between Israel and Lebanon, local media and Lebanese leaders
accused Larsen of being biased to Israel on the demarcating
process. Beirut also doubts the U.N.'s ability to correct Israel's
encroachments to the Blue Line.
</P>
<P>
U.N. peacekeeping forces reported 12 Israeli violations of the
Blue Line to the Security Council on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Larsen, who arrived in the southern town of Naqoura from Israel
Friday morning, held talks with Lebanese Parliament Speaker Nabih
Berri, President Emile Lahoud and Prime Minister Salim Hoss.
</P>
<P>
He is due to continue his talks with Lebanese leaders on
Saturday and leave on Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Internet Users in Greece to Increase Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
ATHENS, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Greece's Internet users are
expected to increase from this year's 800,000 to 3.5 million by
2004, according to a survey conducted by the ICAP-Focus-Bari
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The survey attributed the expected significant growth in
Internet users in coming years to the result of the creation of
Greek portals offering a wide range of information applications in
the Greek language and the development of the wireless technology.
</P>
<P>
Greece' portals in the Internet would be raised from three to
10 next year.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Greek Internet users were focusing on obtaining
information and news, with only a small percentage using its
electronic commerce services.
</P>
<P>
Greece lags the other European countries in information
technology and telecommunications spending and ranked at the
bottom of the table with 567 euros per capital last year.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, Greece's average Internet penetration rate was 6.0
percent.
</P>
<P>
The survey said that Greece's low Internet penetration rate
was the result of the high access costs paid for computers,
limited technological infrastructure and high access costs paid by
Internet users in the country.

<HEADLINE> Rafter, Sampras to Meet in Men's Singles Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Five-set specialist Pat Rafter of
Australia gave out his best performance at Wimbledon Friday
afternoon when he defeated second seed Andre Agassi 7-5, 4-6, 7-5,
4-6 and 6-3, setting up a final match against defending champion
Pete Sampras.
</P>
<P>
Rafter's triumph over the 1992 champion means he is the first
Australian to reach the men's final since Pat Cash won the title
in 1987.
</P>
<P>
Sampras had a fairly easy way to the final, beating Belarussian
qualifier Vladimir Voltchkov 7-6, 6-2, 6-4 to give himself a shot
at a record 13th Grand Slam crown and seventh Wimbledon title in
eight years. He is currently tied with Australian Roy Emerson on
12 Grand Slams.
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be tough. Pat played really well today against
Andre... He's one of the best serve-volleyers in the world," said
Sampras.
</P>
<P>
Rafter's surprise win left the 12th seed jubilant. "The final?
That sounds pretty good right now, mate," he grinned.
</P>
<P>
"I hadn't played a big-name guy in quite a while. I was
probably the underdog -- I felt that way -- but I served really
great. I felt really comfortable."
</P>
<P>
The five-set specialist produced a sublime display of all-court
tennis to upset second seed Agassi and reach his first Wimbledon
final. The Australian has now won 13 of the 16 five-setters he has
played.
</P>
<P>
Venus Williams booked her place in a second Wimbledon final and
declared she and her younger sister Serena were an unbeatable
doubles combination.
</P>
<P>
"It's impossible to beat the two of us. It's going to be just
really difficult," Venus said after the pair brushed aside fifth
seeds Anna Kournikova and Natasha Zvereva 6-3, 7-6 in the women's
doubles semifinals.
</P>
<P>
The sisters sorted out any differences after Thursday's singles
semifinal, won against the odds by older sister Venus, and spent
the evening watching a film together.
</P>
<P>
On Friday the pair chatted to each other constantly on the
court, but Serena was very low-key at the post-match news
conference though Venus claimed they were both "very excited" to
have made the final.
</P>
<P>
Venus and Serena -- seeded eighth in the tournament despite not
having a doubles ranking -- will now meet fourth seeds Julie
Halard-Decugis and Ai Sugiyama who beat top seeds Lisa Raymond and
Rennae Stubbs 3-6, 7-5, 6-2 in the other semifinal.
</P>
<P>
Venus plays fellow American Lindsay Davenport in Saturday's
singles final.

<HEADLINE> Forest Fires Reported Throughout Greece </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
ATHENS, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Several forest fires were reported
throughout Greece Friday, with the largest blaze being on the
eastern Aegean island of Samos.
</P>
<P>
With the support of fire-fighting planes and helicopters, some
200 firefighters with 30 fire engines were trying hard to bring a
major fire in Samos under control, the semi-official Athens News
Agency (ANA) reported.
</P>
<P>
In the Attica prefecture, a fire was ravaging woods at the
Souli site near Marathon, and other blazes were reported at the
Kissavos site in the central Greek prefecture of Magnesia, in the
Gerolimena on the southeastern Peloponnese peninsula and in the
Achaia prefecture.
</P>
<P>
Although the Greek government has since April taken preventive
measures to deal with possible forest fires, the forest land
destruction in the country increased 300 percent in June compared
to last year.
</P>
<P>
Police attributed the forest fires to both the current high
temperatures and arsons.

<HEADLINE> Zhu Rongji Meets Italian President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji met here
Friday with Italian President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi and the two
leaders agreed to further enhance bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Ciampi, who had visited China three times, told Zhu that he was
deeply impressed by China's rapid economic expansion and
achievements.
</P>
<P>
China is playing an increasingly important role in
international affairs and Italy especially appreciates its
constructive role during the Asian financial crisis, Ciampi said.
</P>
<P>
He said Italy will continue sticking to a one-China policy and
support China's early accession to the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said bilateral ties have been developing smoothly since the
establishment of diplomatic relations three decades ago.
</P>
<P>
Sino-Italian relations are at their best period ever and the
frequent contacts between leaders of the two countries have
strengthened mutual understanding and friendship. The two
countries have made plentiful achievements amid strengthened
exchanges and cooperation in various fields, the Chinese premier
said.
</P>
<P>
He thanked the Italian government for sticking all along to the
one-China policy and for its support for the great cause of China'
s reunification.
</P>
<P>
China and Italy, both wielding major influences in the world,
have identical or similar views on many important international
issues, with positive roles in maintaining world peace and
enhancing international cooperation, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
He said China attaches great importance to Italy's important
status and the role it plays in the world as well as the
development of comprehensive and long-term cooperation with Italy.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said he has full confidence in the prospects of Sino-
Italian relations because the two countries share many common
points in the political field and their economies are highly
complementary.
</P>
<P>
Before meeting Ciampi, Zhu visited Campidoglio, the Municipal
Palace of ancient-Rome style, accompanied by Mayor Francesco
Rutelli of the capital city.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese premier arrived here Wednesday on an official visit
to Italy, the fifth leg of his current Europe tour.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, he met with Italian Prime Minister Giuliano Amato,
Senate Speaker Nicola Mancino and Chamber of Deputies Speaker
Luciano Violante.
</P>
<P>
Before his meetings with the parliamentary leaders Thursday,
the Chinese premier delivered a speech at the Italian
Confederation of Industrial Employers (Confindustria), calling for
more Italian investment in China and enhanced cooperation between
the small and medium-sized enterprises of both countries.
</P>
<P>
Zhu will arrive in the central city of Florence late Friday to
continue his Italy tour. He will also visit Venice.
</P>
<P>
From Italy, Zhu will travel on to Brussels on an official visit
to Belgium and the EU headquarters based there.

<HEADLINE> Belarus Sniffs U.S. Suspending Most-Favored-Nation Treatment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Minsk said Friday that Washington's
decision to suspend the Global System of Trade Preferences (GSTP)
in relation to Belarus is not of principal and critical
significance for the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
The GSTP provided for the right to duty-free export of a number
of Belarussian goods to the U.S. market.
</P>
<P>
With an average annual trade turnover of 200 million U.S.
dollars between the two countries, the cost of goods that were
subject to the GSTP last year was 26.7 million dollars, and the
preferences themselves did not exceed one million dollars, the
Belarussian Foreign Ministry said Friday
</P>
<P>
"This very sum can be listed among the 'losses' after this
decision comes into force," said the ministry, cited by Russian
news agencies.
</P>
<P>
Belarussian President Alexander Lukashenko said Wednesday that
Minsk "will respond to the United States in kind and take
appropriate steps" as regards Washington's decision.
</P>
<P>
By this decision, the United States "deprived Belarus, the
victim of the Chernobyl disaster, of about one million dollars,"
said Lukashenko, proposing to "give that million to (U.S.
President) Bill Clinton to supplement his pension."
</P>
<P>
Clinton Tuesday signed a bill on denying Belarussian exports
duty-free entry onto the U.S. market, initiated by the American
Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-
CIO) in excuse of "the unsatisfactory labor rights and human
rights situation in Belarus."

<HEADLINE> Delegates Begin Arriving in S. Africa for AIDS Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 7 (Xinhua) -- At least 3,000 delegates are
expected to arrive in Durban, South Africa on Friday ahead of the
13th International AIDS Conference which will start in the city on
Sunday, according to Durban International Airport manager Siva
Pillay.
</P>
<P>
Although a 90 million rand (13 million U.S. dollars)
reconstruction project is underway at the airport, delegates
should not be inconvenienced and they would be taken to a special
joint operations center on arrival, where their transport and
baggage would be sorted out, Pillay said.
</P>
<P>
He said SA Airways and British Airways have increased their
number of flights to Durban, or in some cases were using bigger
aircraft to accommodate all the visitors.
</P>
<P>
There are also aircraft of standby in Johannesburg in case of
any emergency, he said, noting that at least four months of
planning has gone into the operation.
</P>
<P>
The bulk of the more than 13,000 delegates to the conference,
including over one thousand journalists, are expected to arrive on
Saturday and Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Security plans have also been put in place to protect delegates
on their way from the airport to their places of accommodation.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of South African Police Services, defense force and
metropolitan police force personnel would be deployed to the
airport, the conference center and places of accommodation, police
said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The streets of Durban were on Friday full of armed police and
defense force members patrolling the areas around the
International Convention Center.

<HEADLINE> WFP Short of Funds for Food Aid to Displaced Angolans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The delegation of the World Food
Program (WFP) in Angola is still very poor, with only 42 percent
of the requests for fund having been confirmed by international
donors, said WFP spokeswoman Maria Flynn here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Despite great efforts on getting donations from the
international community, the WFP branch in Angola is far short of
funds for buying food for the increasing displaced Angolans,"
Flynn said.
</P>
<P>
She said the situation has not been improved although it has
recently received a donation of some 12.6 million U.S. dollars
from the United States.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian government has also confirmed a 1.3 million-U.S.
dollar grant, she said.
</P>
<P>
According to Flynn, some 12,000 war-displaced Angolans in the
Osire Camp in Namibia are now living in dire poverty and poor
health.
</P>
<P>
There are currently some 3.7 million war-displaced people in

KAMPALA, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
Friday said Uganda supports China's reunification with Taiwan,
noting that there is only one China in the world.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks when meeting with a Chinese delegation led

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Urged to Meet Challenge of Peace: President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 7 (Xinhua) -- South African President Thabo
Mbeki Friday urged the country to respond seriously to the
challenge of peace and stability on the continent.
</P>
<P>
This is an obligation the country should not shy away from and
South Africans should be willing to help cover the cost of the
country's peacekeeping mission to the Democratic Republic of the
Congo (DRC), he told reporters in Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we can say considerations about money would
override participation by South Africa in a situation where you
save lives," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It will cost us something," the president said. "As South
Africans, we ought to say we are prepared to pay that."
</P>
<P>
It was revealed last week that South Africa had budgeted 100
million rand (14.7 million U.S. dollars) for a year-long
deployment of specialized military elements in the DRC, which drew
criticism from the opposition.
</P>
<P>
It is quite legitimate for people to be concerned about the
cost, but it would not be correct to "jealously guard" over the
money that would be involved without caring what is happening in
the DRC, Mbeki said.
</P>
<P>
"Nothing happens without expenditure," he said.

<HEADLINE> Traffic Accident Kills 42 in Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, July 7 (Xinhua) -- An overloaded truck ran out of the
road in Angola's south central Huila province, killing 42 and
injuring 34, the Angolan official news agency Angop reported on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to a report issued by Angop without mentioning the
date, the accident occurred when a Volvo-brand truck ran out of
the road and overturned.
</P>
<P>
Angop quoted an eye-witness of the disaster as saying that the
cause of the accident could be the excessive cargo loaded and the
intoxication of the driver.
</P>
<P>
Road traffic has been rehabilitated in some central provinces
after government troops gained victory in the central highland
late last year.
</P>
<P>
However, the safety of the road traffic is considered as
worrying due to the enormous destruction of the roads and bridges
by rampant battles between government troops and the rebel
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Unemployment Rate Dips to 4 Percent in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. unemployment rate fell
by 0.1 percentage points to 4 percent in June from 4.1 percent the
month before as private-sector hiring outweighed layoffs related
to the winding down of Census 2000, the Labor Department reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Total employment including government workers rose by only 11,
000 in June as 190,000 temporary workers finished work on the
census and left their jobs. That was the weakest growth in four
years.
</P>
<P>
In May, total payrolls rose by 171,000, weaker growth than the
government previously estimated.
</P>
<P>
The private sector added 206,000 jobs last month. In May,
private employers cut 165,000 jobs, compared with the 116,000
decline which was initially reported.
</P>
<P>
Despite the weaker job growth, labor market conditions worsened
during the month as measured by the available pool of labor, an
indicator closely watched by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan.
</P>
<P>
The available pool of workers fell 3.4 percent to 9.837 million
workers, a portent that employers could find it increasingly
difficult to fill vacancies in the months ahead.
</P>
<P>
Average hourly earnings, a key gauge of inflation pressures,
rose 0.4 in June to 13.71 U.S. dollars, while the average work
week increased to 34.5 hours compared to 34.4 hours the month
before. Wages grew by a slim 0.1 percent in May.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve has boosted interest rates six times over
the past year to slow the economy and keep inflation under control.
A number of economic reports, including new home sales and retail
sales, have suggested that the Fed's interest rate increases are
working to slow economic growth.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Defense Minister Unveils NATO Flying Training Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Minister of National
Defense Art Eggleton opened the NATO Flying Training in Canada (
NFTC) program Thursday in Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan.
</P>
<P>
At the opening ceremony, the minister described the 20-year
NFTC program, which is estimated to cost 3.5 billion Canadian
dollars (about 2.4 billion U.S. dollars), as "one of the most
modern and innovative flying training systems in existence."
</P>
<P>
"NFTC makes a very real and direct contribution to (NATO's)
collective defense capabilities," he said.
</P>
<P>
Colonel Ian Milani, director of the project, indicated the
project could be a redress to criticism by NATO chief George
Robertson last September that Canada failed to keep up with its
NATO commitments.
</P>
<P>
The wide-open skies and superior training facilities available
at bases such as Moose Jaw and Cold Lake, Alberta, will make
Canada an ideal destination for foreign air forces, said Milani.
</P>
<P>
The program, jointly run by Bombardier Aerospace and the
Canadian Forces, has already secured contracts of more than 800
million Canadian dollars (about 538 million U.S. dollars) from
Denmark, Italy, Britain and Singapore, the colonel said.
</P>
<P>
More than 130,000 Allied pilots and aircrew received training
at bases across Canada between 1940 and 1945, with Moose Jaw and
her sister air bases turning out over 1,600 pilots a month,
according to the Canadian military.

<HEADLINE> Mossad Agent Get 12-Month Suspended Sentence in Switzerland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The Swiss Federal Court has handed
down a 12-month suspended sentence to an Israeli secret agent who
was caught trying to bug the telephone of a Lebanese-born Swiss
man two years ago, Swiss Radio International reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, was quick to express
his satisfaction at the outcome, and the fact that the agent would
be able to return immediately to Israel.
</P>
<P>
"This was a fair verdict. The defense can live with this
verdict," said defense lawyer, Ralph Zloczower, after the hearing.
"Our client will leave Switzerland in the coming days."
</P>
<P>
The prosecution was equally satisfied. The public prosecutor,
Felix Banziger, said: "I'm very pleased the judgment has more or
less followed our recommendations," Banziger had called for a 15-
month jail sentence.
</P>
<P>
The agent, who was tried under the pseudonym Isaac Bental, was
also barred from Switzerland for five years after he was found
guilty of political espionage, acting illegally for a foreign
country and entering the country under a false name.
</P>
<P>
It was widely expected that the court would hand down a
suspended sentence to avoid further diplomatic difficulties, which
strained Israeli-Swiss relations.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the presiding judge, Hans Wiprachtiger, described
Bental's crimes as "considerable". He said the agent had "violated
the sovereignty of Switzerland in an unrestrained and intolerable
manner".
</P>
<P>
Bental, tried under an assumed name for his own safety, had
admitted to the charges, but insisted he was acting out of
patriotism and was combating terrorism. He also said he was merely
carrying out orders.
</P>
<P>
The Mossad agent was arrested in the Berne suburb of Koniz in
February 1998, when he and four others were caught trying to
wiretap the telephone of a Swiss-Lebanese man, whom Israel
suspected of having links to the Iranian-backed guerrilla group,
Hezbollah.

<P>
BEIJING, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Starting today, millions of Chinese
families will spend a weekend full of expectations.
</P>
<P>
They all hope their children will pass the three-day national
college entrance examinations.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Yuan is one of the 3.88 million examinees this year. There
are about 500,000 more entrants than last year. The 19-year-old
Beijing girl will have a 50-50 chance of being enrolled by a
Chinese college or university.
</P>
<P>
"My dream is to enter Beijing University and major in
international finance, though I know it will be a hard challenge
because it's also the dream of many others," says Zhou.
</P>
<P>
Hot targets chased by the young examinees also include
economics, computer technology and foreign languages.
</P>
<P>
"Children like my daughter have many more opportunities than we
had," says Zhou's mother Shan Guoxia, who accompanied her daughter
to the Beijing No. 101 Middle School to take the exam this morning.

<P>
Although the enrollment quota of Chinese colleges has increased
since last year, the examinations remain highly competitive.
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, meteorological stations report cool weather;
construction sites are banned from making too much noise to make
sure that students preparing for the exams are not disturbed; and
roads are cleared for examinees' buses.
</P>
<P>
Examination venues are doing what they can to ensure that
examinees are able to do their best. Air-conditioners have been
installed for the first time in the exam rooms in east China's
Nanjing City, which is prone to heatwaves in July.
</P>
<P>
Days ahead of the exam, mass media and websites have published
special editions to help examinees to deal with problems during
the tests.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has been improving a system to subsidize
college students, especially those from poverty-stricken regions.
Every examinee received a pamphlet explaining the relevant policy
before the examination.
</P>
<P>
"The examination is indeed important, but people should
understand that colleges are not the only route to success," said
Qu Zhenyuan, an official with the Ministry of Education. "As China
is building a life-time education system, every person will have
the opportunity to get a better education."

<P>
WUHAN, July 7 (Xinhua) -- A flood peak on China's longest river,
the Yangtze, is approaching this capital of Hubei Province, but is
not expected to put too much pressure on local flood-control
facilities.
</P>
<P>
A result of torrential rain on the upper reaches of the Yangtze,
the eastward flood peak has safely passed the Three Gorges Dam
site and the dangerous Jingjiang section, according to experts
with the Yangtze Water Conservancy Committee.
</P>
<P>
They predicted that the flood peak, the biggest since this
flood season began, would not surpass the warning level when
passing through Wuhan, a transportation hub and commercial center
in central China with more than seven million residents.

<P>
BEIJING, July 7 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese official called
today for concrete efforts to promote ethical and cultural
progress as the country is putting emphasis on ideological and
political work.
</P>
<P>
Ding Guan'gen, director of the Central Commission for Guiding
Ethical and Cultural Progress, told a meeting of the commission
here today that top leader Jiang Zemin's recent speech on
ideological and political work is of great significance for the
country's ethical and cultural progress.
</P>
<P>
Promotion of ethical and cultural progress must follow the
spirit of Jiang's speech and stick to Marxism, Leninism, Mao
Zedong Thought and Deng Xiaoping Theory, said Ding, also a member
of the Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party Central
Committee.
</P>
<P>
It is imperative to have more ideological and ethical education,
make socialist ethics dominate the ideological and cultural fronts,
and meet the growing spiritual and cultural demands of the general
public, Ding said.
</P>
<P>
At today's meeting, the participants also discussed the
commission's "Suggestions on Building Ethical and Cultural
Progress Communities in Urban Areas."

<HEADLINE> Blue Line Draws Larsen to Middle East Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 7 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Middle East envoy Terje Roed
Larsen arrived in Lebanon Friday to present a modified map of Blue
Line to Lebanese officials to clear up Israel's continuing
violations of the border.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. official, accompanied by the U.N.'s chief cartographer
Miklos Pinther, talked with Lebanese leaders on some changes of the
Blue Line drawn by U.N. experts according to the 1923 Lebanese-
Palestinian boundary.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), which has been deployed
in south Lebanon since 1978 after Israel launched a 90-day war to
Lebanon, reported 12 Israeli violations of the Blue Line to the U.
N. Security Council on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The bulk of the violations are minor ones, which are mainly
security fences and patrol roads straying north of the Blue Line.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese side has lodged complaints to the U.N., accusing
Israel of deliberate encroachments of the Lebanese territory and
its procrastination of ending the invasion.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Prime Minister Salim Hoss has repeatedly claimed the
government troops will not be deployed unless Israel fulfills an
entire pullout.
</P>
<P>
UNIFIL is reportedly sending patrols along the border every
night to ensure there are no further violations.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to Israel on Thursday, Larsen got an assurance
from Prime Minister Ehud Barak that the border violations will end.
But the Israeli leader had vowed to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan last month that the border encroachments would be solved in
three days.
</P>
<P>
While Lebanon objects to the line's differing from the
international border, Israel does not satisfy the U.N. decision.
</P>
<P>
The Blue Line cuts the village of Ghajar into two parts, two-
thirds of it inside Lebanon and the other third within the Israeli-
occupied part of Syria, creating a security nightmare for the
Israeli army.
</P>
<P>
U.N. sources said the new map carried by Pinther shows the Blue
Line more clearly than before and confirmed the Line is "final and
non-negotiable." Some media reported the new map has some changes,
including the delineation of the village of Ghajar.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has taken great pains to emphasize the Blue Line is
simply a line of withdrawal and it is up to Lebanon and Israel to
delineate their mutual boundary.
</P>
<P>
But there has been no convincing explanation from the U.N. as to
why the cartographic team did not base the delineation of the line
on the 1949 Armistice Demarcation Line (ADL).
</P>
<P>
The ADL exactly follows the 1923 boundary except for the last 6
kilometers in the east.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has admitted key documents outlining the border were
destroyed in a flood. The U.N.'s map of the 1949 ADL has gone "
missing". Cartographers defined the Blue Line according to the maps
in the archives of U.N. and from Britain and France.

<HEADLINE> Turkey to Help Train African Soldiers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Turkey has pledged to help a number
of African countries train their armed forces staff, reported the
Hurriyet(Freedom) newspaper on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Within the forthcoming eight months, according to the report,
Turkey is expected to sign military cooperation agreements
separately with Burkina Faso, Nigeria, Algeria, Mali, Ghana,
Ethiopia, Chad, Zimbabwe and Morocco.
</P>
<P>
The special project, which is part of Turkey's policy of opening
up to African nations, is a joint initiative being carried out by
the Foreign Ministry and Chief of the General Staff's Office.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Armed Forces (TSK), the second largest army after
that of the United States in NATO, have become a regional training
provider by signing military training and education cooperation
pacts with Israel and Jordan in the Middle East, Azerbaijan and
Georgia in the Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish military attaches special importance to cementing
military relations with Jordan and the Turkish-Jordanian military
ties have grown in recent years, coinciding with the increased
military and defense ties between Ankara and Tel Aviv, which
started in 1996 as Israel Aircraft Industry (IAI) won the tender
for upgrading Turkish F-4s.
</P>
<P>
Within the framework of the 1984 Military Training and Education
Cooperation Agreement, Turkey and Jordan have exchanged Cobra
helicopter pilots from the Turkish Land Forces and the Royal
Jordanian Air force.
</P>
<P>
Under a military training agreement with Georgia signed during
former President Suleyman Demirel's visit to Tbilisi at the
beginning of this year, the Turkish Air Force has started to train
Georgian pilots at the Air Force War Academy in Ankara.
</P>
<P>
The TSK have also been training Albanian soldiers and are
reportedly preparing to strengthen military cooperation with
Bulgaria in the Balkans.

MANILA, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The non-performing loans of
Philippine commercial banks dipped to 14.41 percent of the total

Governor Rafael Buenaventura told reporters here,

Earlier, Buenaventura said the limited recover of the economy
continues to hamper the lending performance of the banking sector.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say the worsening peace and order situation in the
southern part of the country is taking its toll on the economy,
forcing the government to lower its overall economic growth target
for 2000.
</P>
<P>
The government is said to be aiming at only a four percent
growth rate for the gross domestic product (GDP), instead of the
original five percent target.
</P>
<P>
Actually, the GDP growth rate in the first quarter is only 3.5
percent in the Philippines, even below the reduced target of four

<HEADLINE> Contraceptive Prevalence Helps Decrease Fertility Rate in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Contraceptive prevalence rate has
increased from merely 8 percent in 1975 to 54 percent among
married women in 1999-2000 in Bangladesh, thus decreasing the
total fertility rate, says a study of the Bangladesh Demographic
Health Survey released Friday.
</P>
<P>
The rate of fertility in Bangladesh has declined to 3.1 percent
for the period 1995-2000 from seven percent between 1970 and 1975,
according to a United Nations Development Program report.
</P>
<P>
In South Asian context, Bangladesh showed a great success in
family planning while fertility rate in Pakistan remains high and
India shows a mixed picture. Family size in Bangladesh declines
steadily by 3.3 percent, said a United Nations Fund for Population
Activities (UNFPA) report.
</P>
<P>
The BDHS study observed that the trend toward smaller families
had been greatly helped by the wider availability of good-quality,
safe and affordable family-planning services, and easier access to
them, especially for women.
</P>
<P>
Pills, by far the most commonly-used method in the country,
have been used by over half (58 percent) of married women both in
urban and rural areas, while injectables, condoms and periodical
abstinence follow one by one.
</P>
<P>
More than three quarters (78 percent) of currently married
women in Bangladesh have had experiences in using family-planning
methods, says the survey report.
</P>
<P>
The study says that the contraceptive use varies in accordance
with women's educational levels. A little more than half of
married women (51 percent) with no formal education used a
contraceptive method, compared with 53 percent of women with
either incomplete or complete primary school education, and 59
percent of those with at least some secondary education.

<HEADLINE> Singapore to Streamline Regulation of Financial Advisers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The Monetary Authority of
Singapore (MAS) will streamline the regulation of financial
advisers and institute a new regime to allow financial
intermediaries to offer an array of financial products and
services under a single license.
</P>
<P>
Singapore Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, who doubles
MAS Chairman, made the statement while speaking at the 1st
Anniversary Dinner of the Securities Investors Association of
Singapore (SIAS) Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
He said the MAS will draw up legislation to regulate financial
intermediaries and to promote emergence of a single class of
independent advisors who can offer comprehensive financial
planning and advice on the entire range of investment options.
</P>
<P>
Under the current regulation, financial advisers who wish to
provide advice and distribute different financial products have to
be licensed or registered, or both, under different statutes.
</P>
<P>
Lee said there are significant advantages to consolidating the
legislation regulating personal financial advice, adding a single
license for all financial advisers will complement the single
license that MAS will be introducing for all securities
intermediaries such as stockbrokers, futures traders, or fund
managers, who deal in securities or manage client funds.
</P>
<P>
According to Lee, the model of a single license would establish
a consistent set of regulatory requirements, allow uniform
professional standards to be maintained and encourage the
emergence of personal financial intermediaries as a class of
financial intermediaries who provide financial advice regardless
of the type of investment products.

PHNOM PENH, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations legal team
led by Hans Corell left Cambodia Friday after concluding their
successful talks on setting up a special court with foreign
participation to bring former Khmer Rouge leaders to trial.
</P>
<P>
The talks were conducted between Hans Corell, U.N.
undersecretary general for legal affairs, and his counterpart Sok
An, Cambodia's chief negotiator and chairman of the Council of
Ministers.
</P>
<P>
Both team leaders confirmed that the negotiations on the trial
issue were finalized while the next step is to go further on
administrative and technical procedures including a debate at
Cambodia's parliament.
</P>
<P>
``It is now the responsibility of the government to ensure that
the parliament passes the draft law in timely fashion in a form
that is in keeping with the understanding we have reached as a
result of our talks,'' said Hans Corell before his departure to
New York.
</P>
<P>
He said that he had presented a draft of memorandum of
understanding to Sok An that would govern mutual cooperation and
operation of the court.
</P>
<P>
Both sides have agreed Cambodia will select three of its judges
and the United Nations will select two foreign judges to sit on a
panel to rule on the indictment disputes.
</P>
<P>
After the successful negotiations, a Memorandum of the
Understanding would be singed by the United Nations and Cambodia
if the Cambodian parliament passes legislation that is in keeping
with the understanding reached between the two parties.

<HEADLINE> Singapore to Set up Rigid Disclosure Requirements for Listed Companies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Speaking at the 1st anniversary dinner of the Securities
Investors Association of Singapore (SIAS), Singapore Deputy Prime
Minister Lee Hsien Loong, who is concurrently MAS chairman, said
that a committee charged with reviewing Corporate Regulation and
Governance Policy will review and change Singapore's disclosure
requirements and practices to ensure that full and prompt
disclosure of material information be reported by listed companies.
.
</P>
<P>
"Listed companies must establish high standards of reporting
and disclosure, " Lee emphasized.
</P>
<P>
He said: "We also intend to change the law to make continuous
disclosure by listed companies a statutory obligation."
</P>
<P>
"This means that non-disclosure or late disclosure of material
information will be a breach of the law that will carry a judicial
penalty, and not just be a breach of Singapore Exchange's listing
requirements," he said.
</P>
<P>
Lee holds that the Singapore Exchange has the duty to make sure
that companies release corporate news and financial results
promptly and fully.
</P>
<P>
"Companies should make full and prompt disclosure a major
corporate priority," he said, noting "This is not just because
disclosure is an exchange or legal requirement, but because it is
the companies' responsibility to shareholders."
</P>
<P>
"Disclosure and transparency are essential to good corporate
governance," he said.

<P>
PARIS, July 7 (Xinhua) -- All doping tests on the first three
stages of the Tour de France cycle race were negative, the
International Cycling Union (UCI) said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The UCI noted that substances like corticoids had been detected
in the urine samples of some riders but that their presence was "
justified by medical prescriptions".
</P>
<P>
Three riders were sent home before the start of the Tour after
blood tests found they had an illegal level of hematocrite.
</P>
<P>
All riders tested on this Tour will also have their urine
samples kept for further analysis when a new EPO test receives an
official go-ahead, probably before the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
On the Tour, the yellow jersey wearer, the stage winner and two
riders drawn at random have their urine tested at the end of each

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Inquiry into Voting Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The South African bid
committee announced on Friday that they would launch an
independent inquiry into the voting process which handed the 2006
World Cup to Germany.
</P>
<P>
Irvin Khoza, president of the bid committee, said committee
member Michael Katz would conduct a thorough investigation into
the abstention from voting by New Zealander Charles Dempsey, the
Oceania Football Confederation representative on the FIFA
executive, and purported shady deals before the actual voting.
</P>
<P>
Dempsey's failure to vote sank South Africa's chance of hosting
the 2006 World Cup and handed the bid to Germany.
</P>
<P>
Bid leader Danny Jordaan, Khoza and the South African Football
Association (SAFA) president Molefi Olifant refused to answer
questions pertaining to any bribery allegations against Dempsey,
saying they would make a statement only after the evaluation.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after his arrival in South Africa, Jordaan made it
clear that South Africa would be in contention for the 2010 cup
despite striking an 11th hour deal with Brazil.
</P>
<P>
Jordaan said the condition of that deal was that South Africa
would only back Brazil in 2010 had they won the rights to host the
2006 World Cup.

<HEADLINE> S. African President Writes to NZ PM over Bid Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 7 (Xinhua) -- President Thabo Mbeki wrote to
New Zealand premier Helen Clark on Thursday, reaffirming the close
ties between their two countries despite the key role a Kiwi
played in wrecking South Africa 2006 soccer World Cup bid.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki thanked Prime Minister Clark and her government for the
support they gave the South African bid in the run-up to the
crucial vote in Zurich on Thursday, Mbeki's spokeswoman Tasneem
Carrim said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his confidence that the support Clark had
expressed for South Africa's bid genuinely reflected her view and
that of the people of New Zealand as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Germany beat South Africa to host the tournament by 12 votes to
11 when Oceania soccer chief Charlie Dempsey abstained from the
third round of voting.
</P>
<P>
The Scots-born New Zealander appeared to defy instructions of
his own federation and the New Zealand government to vote for
South Africa if England were knocked out of the voting.
</P>
<P>
FIFA officials said it appeared that Dempsey had withdrawn his
vote for "personal reasons".
</P>
<P>
On Friday, New Zealand Sports Minister Trevor Mallard branded
Dempsey, "an international embarassment" and expressed fears that
his actions had damaged the international reputation of the entire
country".
</P>
<P>
Mbeki, however, said he was confident that Dempsey's actions
were contrary to Clark's view, that of her government and the New
Zealand people.
</P>
<P>
As much as the people of South Africa and the rest of Africa
deplored Dempsey's decision, Mbeki assured Clark that she and the
people of New Zealand are genuine friends of South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki assured the people of New Zealand that their relations
with South Africa would in no way be harmed by the actions of a
member of the FIFA executive, over which they had no control.

<P>
BEIJING, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Li Peng, chairman of the Standing
Committee of the Chinese National People's Congress (NPC), said
today that China places great importance on the Inter-
Parliamentary Union's role, and actively participates in its
activities.
</P>
<P>
While meeting with Najma Heptulla, president of the Council of
the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU), Li called the IPU an
important international parliamentary organization. He said that
the IPU has worked together with the United Nations on some
important international issues in recent years, thus increasing
the body's influence.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Conference of Presiding Officers of National
Parliaments, to be held in the U.N. headquarters starting in late
August, will be an important event, and he will lead an NPC
delegation to the gathering, and work with Heptulla to ensure its
success.
</P>
<P>
Li added that the Chinese side has put forth some constructive
proposals, including equal sovereignty, non-interference in each
other's internal affairs, respecting every country's people's
choices and safeguarding the authority of the U.N.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that these basic norms governing
international relations will be reflected in the final document of
the conference's declaration.
</P>
<P>
Heptulla, who arrived here earlier today on a five-day official
good-will visit to China, said that this is her fourth visit to
China. She is here to exchange views with Li on how to ensure the
success of the conference. She praised the Chinese NPC's
participation in the IPU, and said she hopes that the NPC will
play an even greater role in it.
</P>
<P>
She said that she has paid close attention to China's
suggestions for the declaration, and will make efforts to address
China's concerns in the forthcoming conference and the millennium
summit of heads of state to be held in September.

BEIJING, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Persistence in ideological and
political work represents a long-standing principle for the
Communist Party of China (CPC) in leading the nation forward, said
a group of members of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC) here today.
</P>
<P>
At a forum on the enhancement of ideological and political work,
the CPPCC members held that the work is of the utmost importance
to the Party and the nation as a whole.
</P>
<P>
The ideals, beliefs, spirit and creativity of the people will
ultimately determine the future of the socialist cause with
Chinese characteristics.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, ideological and political work must be enhanced to
rally the wisdom and strength of the people for the construction
of the country, they said.
</P>
<P>
In their discussions, the CPPCC members also noted that, as it
is largely devoted to uniting people from all walks of life, the
CPPCC must meet the demands of the time and seek new methods to
enhance its ideological and political work.

<P>
MACAO, July 7 (Xinhua) -- An exhibition of contemporary French
art was launched Friday at the Macao Museum of Art.
</P>
<P>
On display are more than 50 items of artistic works created by
11 artists living in Nice City of France. The exhibition will last
till September 3.
</P>
<P>
Nice is a coastal city situated in the southern part of France,
where sunny climate and picturesque views provide an ideal
environment for creative motivation.
</P>
<P>
A number of great artists used to visit the place and made
outstanding achievements. Their radiance, however, became a
barrier for young artists who were hesitant to go forward with
their own ambitions. The problem was how to get away from the huge
shadows of their predecessors.
</P>
<P>
Beginning from the mid-1950s, some young artists gradually
formed the schools of "New Realism," "Supports/Surface" and "
Fluxus." The schools produced not only works of art, but also
confidence and courage to struggle against traditional bondage.

<HEADLINE> S.Lanka's Opposition Tables Motion of Non-confidence Against Speaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Speaker Ratnayake on Thursday allowed UNP's Ronnie De Mel to
wind up the emergency debate although the party had listed Rajitha
Senaratna as its last speaker, said a UNP official while
explaining the party's motion.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, former finance minister Ronnie De Mel broke a
party decision and announced that he would vote with the
government to extend a national emergency, effectively crossing-
over to the ruling People's Alliance (PA).
</P>
<P>
Ronnie De Mel's decision was a major blow to the UNP. He became
the seventh UNP parliamentarian to support the PA in recent times.
Last year five UNP lawmakers crossed over to the government and
another one followed suit last week.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said that several more UNP parliamentarians were
planning to cross over to the government side to help it get a two-
thirds majority in the 225-member Parliament needed to pass its
constitutional reforms aimed at ending the long ethnic conflict.
</P>
<P>
The proposed reforms aim to devolve more powers to regions,
including one administered by Tamils, in an effort to wean the
minority away from Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) rebels
who have been fighting for a separate homeland called Eelam in Sri
Lanka's north and east since 1983.
</P>
<P>
The PA government and the UNP are due to end the bipartisan
talks on the draft constitution on Friday with the UNP saying all
outstanding issues have not been discussed.
</P>
<P>
President Kumaratunga has said that she would introduce the new
constitution to Parliament by the third week of this month.
</P>
<P>
However, constitutional experts said the new constitution needs
to be approved by a two-thirds majority in Parliament and approved
at a referendum. They said since Parliament will have to be
dissolved in the third week of August, there would not be enough
time to complete the entire process.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE have rejected the constitutional proposals, saying the
separatist war will continue as the package fails to address the
issue of Tamil self-determination.
</P>
<P>
Parliament on Thursday extended the national emergency by a
month amid uproar with the UNP opposing the measure complaining
certain procedural lapses in it.
</P>
<P>
The emergency gives sweeping powers to security forces to
arrest LTTE suspects. As per the regulations, the emergency has to
be extended by parliament every month and the UNP till now had
abstained every month whenever the bill on extending emergency
provision by one month came for the approval in Parliament.

<HEADLINE> MILF Claims Shooting Down Philippine Military Chopper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 7 (Xinhua) -- A Philippine military chopper was
reportedly shot down Friday afternoon by the Moro Islamic
Liberation Front (MILF), amid offensives by government troops on
MILF's main camp, a TV report said.
</P>
<P>
MILF spokesperson Eid Kabalu was quoted as saying when making
this claim that they are fiercely defending their main stronghold
Camp Abubakar against military air and ground attacks, the ABS-CBN
news channel said.
</P>
<P>
However, the military denied Kabalu's claim, calling it a rebel
propaganda.
</P>
<P>
"That's Kabalu's propaganda. He is dreaming; he should wake up,
" the government military spokesman Rafael Romero said in reaction
to Kabalu's claim.
</P>
<P>
But Kabalu said the chopper was shot down between 1 p.m. and 1:
30 p.m., saying he witnessed its plunge into the sea in Calatagan,
South Lanao province.
</P>
<P>
Soldiers in the chopper have yet to be accounted for, but
Kabalu said they were most likely killed.
</P>
<P>
The MILF spokesman said they used home-made anti-aircaft
ammunition to shoot down the supposed MG-520 chopper of the Armed
Forces of Philippines (AFP).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the military admitted Friday that Camp Abubakar is
indeed under attack and its fall is imminent.
</P>
<P>
The military spokesman said the strategy is to take Abubakar,
the largest camp of the MILF, "swiftly and as soon as possible."
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, government forces reportedly captured three more
MILF camps near Abubakar.
</P>
<P>
Starting from the beginning of this week, the government troops
have launched air and ground attack at the secessionist group's
biggest camp.
</P>
<P>
The latest fighting came after the government and the MILF
failed to sign an interim peace accord before the June 30 deadline
set by President Joseph Estrada.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Rupiah Continues to Weaken </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian currency Rupiah
continued its weakening trend on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah traded at 9,305 (buying) and 9,315 (selling) per U.S.
dollar on Friday, compared with 9,270/9,300 per dollar on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Bambang Sudibyo Friday admitted that the
weakening of the rupiah exchange rate to more than 9,000 rupiah to
the dollar would have a bad impact upon the country's bid for
economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
"But, we expect the rupiah to rebound soon because the problem
is only a matter of perception regarding political stability in
Indonesia," he said on the sidelines of a House Special Committee
meeting deliberating a Tax Bill.
</P>
<P>
Bank Indonesia has said that the current weakening of the
rupiah has been largely due to domestic political uncertainty,
particularly in the run-up to the General Session of the People's
Consultative Assembly in August.

<HEADLINE> FIFA: Dempsey Receives Death Threat before Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 7 (Xinhua) -- FIFA said Friday that New Zealand's
Charles Dempsey, the delegate whose abstention effectively handed
the 2006 World Cup finals to Germany, had earlier received a death
threat.
</P>
<P>
In a Thursday's executive committee meeting in Zurich, Dempsey
had said that he and his family had been threatened, FIFA
spokesman Keith Cooper said.
</P>
<P>
"Charlie referred at the beginning of the meeting to legal
advice which he had taken because of the difficult personal
situation he found himself in," Cooper said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said he "absolutely subscribe to the description
of intolerable unbearable personal pressure".
</P>
<P>
Asked if the manner of the pressure means death threats, he
said: "If you want to interpret it that way I would not disagree
with it."
</P>
<P>
Dempsey abstained in the third and final vote, after plumping
for England in the first two rounds. It meant that Germany won the
vote 12-11, ending favourite South Africa's hopes of staging the
tournament.

<P>
SHANGHAI, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Work began today in Shanghai on
the construction of what is expected to be China's largest
production base for knitted goods.
</P>
<P>
The "Three Gun Industrial Park," with a total investment of 280
million yuan (about 3.5 million U.S. dollars), occupies an area of
15 hectares. It will produce 30 million sq m of knitted materials
for outer garments and 50 million pieces of knitted underwear.
</P>
<P>
The base will pay particular attention to environmental
protection by setting up a waste water treatment system, according
to company officials.

This is another effort by Shanghai to update its low-efficiency
and polluting textile industry and protect the environment.
</P>
<P>
So far, about 500 factories have been relocated because of
pollution, being permitted to reopen in the suburbs after
installing anti-pollution devices.

<HEADLINE> China's Film Industry Partly Opens to Overseas Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 7 (Xinhua) -- China has taken an official and
bold step to allow overseas investors to enter the local film
industry, though they are still banned from becoming the main
stake-holders in any local film company.
</P>
<P>
The reform step was jointly proposed by the State
Administration of Radio, Film and Television and the Ministry of
Culture which recently issued "Some Comments on the Further
Deepening of Reform in the Film Industry."
</P>
<P>
The Publicity Department of the Communist Party of China
Central Committee has approved the proposals in a circular, urging
the implementation of what the two central government departments
have put forward.
</P>
<P>
The "Comments" says that, after years of active reforms, the
country's film industry has been reinvigorated, but it is still
plagued with many problems that are hampering the development of
the sector. The "Comments" calls for strengthening the reform in
the film industry.
</P>
<P>
The film industry should carry out market-oriented reforms,
while adhering to the guidance of Deng Xiaoping Theory and the
cardinal line and policy of the Party, it says.
</P>
<P>
Top priority should be given to the social impacts of films,
and the relationship between social results and economic gains
should be handled correctly, according to the "Comments."
</P>
<P>
The control of the Party and the government over the industry
must be maintained by appointing the local Party secretary as the
representative of the legal person of a film company group and
ensuring that the state hold the main stake in film production,
distribution and projection units with overseas capital, according
to the document.

<P>
BEIJING, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The municipal government of Beijing
has taken measures to protect the legitimate rights and interests
of people who make purchases via the Internet.
</P>
<P>
In a circular issued here today, the government demands that
all on-line sellers or services providers notify their customers
of their true places of registration and ways of communication.
</P>
<P>
They should make clear the prices of goods and services, the
origins of products and producers and quality conditions. No

stresses.
</P>
<P>
The Internet is developing rapidly in the Chinese capital,
which now boasts over 2,000 websites. On-line transactions are on
the rise.
</P>
<P>
Yet, due to the nature of on-line business, the rights and
interests of some consumers have been found to have been infringed
upon.
</P>
<P>
The circular also calls on consumers to strengthen their sense
of self-protection when making on-line purchases. They can make
complaints to the city's industry and business administrative
authorities if they find themselves swindled, it says.

<HEADLINE> Barak to Proceed with Summit Despite Resignation Threats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Ehud Barak is
determined to proceed with the planned pivotal three-way summit
starting Tuesday in the United States despite resignation threats
of three right-wing partners in his coalition government, Israel
Radio quoted sources close to Barak as saying on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Barak is meeting leaders of the left-wing Meretz party regarding
the upcoming summit between himself, Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat and U.S. President Bill Clinton at Camp David, a
presidential resort in Maryland, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
Meretz quit the government in June to enable the ultra-Orthodox
Shas party, Barak's biggest coalition partner, to agree to stay in
the coalition. Meretz was at loggerheads with Shas over the funding
of Shas' ill-managed religious school system.
</P>
<P>
Meretz vowed to continue supporting Barak's peace efforts,
although it did not want its leader, former Education Minister
Yossi Sarid, to join the summit.
</P>
<P>
It cited the fact that ministers from the three rebellious
parties, namely Shas, the National Religious Party (NRP) and the
Yisrael Ba'aliya, will not be participating despite they were
invited to the summit.
</P>
<P>
Shas' decision-making Council of Torah Sages has demanded to
know Barak's "red lines" with the Palestinians before he leaves for
the summit. Its spiritual leadership has also demanded Barak's
clarification on his position before it decides whether to stay in
the coalition government.
</P>
<P>
The Yisrael Ba'aliya and the NRP have decided in succession to
withdraw from the government over possible concessions Barak might
make during the summit. Their ministers are expected to hand in
their letters of resignation on Sunday at the cabinet's weekly
meeting.
</P>
<P>
In another development, Foreign Minister David Levy is scheduled
to meet Barak on Sunday before the cabinet meeting to finalize
the "red lines" in the negotiations over the thorniest final-status
issues such as Jerusalem, water, border, Jewish settlements and
Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
Barak will go to Jordan Saturday evening for a meeting with King
Abdullah II. He also intends to stop over in Cairo on Monday for
talks with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak before continuing his
trip to the Camp David summit Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Barak's office said on Friday that no decisions have been made
by the prime minister to release more Palestinian security
prisoners or to transfer the Jerusalem area villages to the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that Barak might release more Palestinians
jailed in Israeli prisons and hand over the three Arab villages on
the outskirts of Jerusalem as confidence-building measures to
improve the atmosphere of the summit.
</P>
<P>
Camp David is famous for the U.S.-brokered summit there in 1978
between Egypt and Israel, which led to the signing of a peace
treaty the next year, the first between an Arab country and the
Jewish state.

<HEADLINE> Singapore PM Warns against Erosion of Community Bonding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok
Tong has warned against erosion of community bonding in the New
Economy society and urged Singaporeans to promote volunteerism.
</P>
<P>
"Unless we make a conscious effort, our economic success could
gradually erode the sense of empathy for the less fortunate among
us, and lead to a colder, less caring society," the prime minister
said while officiating at opening the National Volunteer Center
Friday.
</P>
<P>
He said the challenge for the Singapore society is to improve
on the present level of community spirit, mentioning a survey
which proves 74 percent of non-volunteers cited "no time" due to
work and family commitments as their main reason for not
volunteering.
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that both the government and people have a role
to play in promoting volunteerism, saying "the moral test of any
society is how it treats its weakest: children, elderly, sick,
needy and handicapped."
</P>
<P>
He said the government cannot artificially narrow the income
but can put in place schemes to assist the needy in areas such as
education, housing and healthcare and will ensure that "every
Singaporean has equal opportunity to rise to the top."
</P>
<P>
He urged those who have benefited from the general increase in
prosperity in Singapore to reciprocate society.
</P>
<P>
The National Volunteer Center (NVC) is a national-level
coordinating agency for volunteerism in Singapore and works in
partnership with the public, private and people sectors to make
volunteerism a way of life in the city state.
</P>
<P>
NVC is engaged in volunteer promotion, referral, appreciation,
management and training and aims to help strengthen Singapore's
social cohesion, political stability and the collective will,
values and attitudes of the people through its mission of
promoting volunteerism across all sectors and all levels of the
society.

NDCC) said the calamity also left five people injured, 10 others
missing, and some 120,000 families displaced.
</P>
<P>
The entire province of Pampanga in central Luzon has been
placed under a state of calamity after heavy rains submerged two-
thirds of the area in floodwaters, the NDCC said.
</P>
<P>
Other reports said the hardest hit is Guagua city in Bataan
province, where waters rose to as high as six feet, or about 1.8
meters deep.
</P>
<P>
The NDCC pointed out Bulacan also in Bataan province was the
worst hit by the calamity with loses in agriculture amounting to
70 million pesos (1.75 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it placed the value of damaged roads and bridges in
Pangasinan at 19.7 million pesos (492,000 dollars), while damaged
properties in Ilocos Sur were estimated at 12 million pesos (300,
000 dollars).
</P>
<P>
But the government said this should not be a cause for alarm
since the typhoon is already on its way out of the country, and
that water levels in several parts of the country have began to
subside.
</P>
<P>
NDCC Chairman Orlando Mercado, who is also defense secretary,
said the NDCC, along with local government units, have been coping
with the rising number of evacuees.
</P>
<P>
The NDCC said it has set up 44 evacuation centers for the
displaced families and relief operations are now in full swing.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines, being reportedly on the typhoon belt,
experiences an average of 19 storms every year from June to
December.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 7(Xinhua) -- The Rwanda health sector still faces
severe problems including insufficiency of qualified health
personnel and lack of medical facilities and fund, Rwanda News
Agency reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Following the tragic events that befell Rwanda in 1994, the
efficiency of health services was drastically affected because of
shortage of qualified medical personnel and poor health care in
general," Health Minister Ezechias Rwabuhihi was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said the government policy on health encourages the
establishment of training institutions to promote health through
education with particular emphasis on human resource development.
</P>
<P>
Some half million Rwandans, including Tutsis and moderate
Hutus, were killed in the genocide in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Thomas Karengera, director of health care in the
Ministry of Health, said the orientation of the national health
policy is the development of primary health and decentralization
of medical facilitates to cover the entire community.
</P>
<P>
"There is, however, need for human resource development,
increased health information, improvement of collaboration
between the health and education sectors, development of
information technology and liasing with similar organizations on
the national and international levels," Karengera stressed.

<HEADLINE> Germany Dismisses Letter Offering Bribes "Hoax" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The letter offering bribes to FIFA
delegates for votes in favor of Germany's bid for the 2006 World
Cup finals was a hoax, said Germany's soccer federation (DFB) on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the vote up to 10 members of the 24-member FIFA
executive committee had reportedly received the letter under their
hotel doors.
</P>
<P>
The letter was signed by Martin Hansen, who claimed to be
secretary TDES (WM 2006 initiative) and said it was written on
behalf of the German bid chief Franz Beckenbauer.
</P>
<P>
But DFB spokesman Wolfgang Niersbach said that the person named
does not belong to their organisation.
</P>
<P>
"The whole situation is mysterious," Niersbach told Germany's
SID sports news agency.
</P>
<P>
FIFA press spokesman Keith Cooper also said that they were not
taking the hoax seriously.
</P>
<P>
"The whole thing is done so stupidly and in such an amateur
fashion that we don't want to give the issue any more meaning than
it deserves," Cooper told SID.
</P>
<P>
Germany won the vote 12-11 after New Zealander Charles Dempsey,
representing Oceania, abstained. Dempsey, 78, was among the
delegates who received the letter.

HOHHOT, July 7 (Xinhua) -- A grand-scale festival, called "
Nadam" in Mongolian, was held today at the grasslands of the Hulun
Buir League in north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Nadam, which means "entertainment and games" in Mongolian, has
a tradition of more than 700 years. Throughout the history of the
event, horse racing, archery and Mongolian wrestling have been
three major activities.

<HEADLINE> Launch of China's Smallest Satellite Successful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 7 (Xinhua) -- China's smallest satellite,
launched a week ago, has basically finished its testing mission
and is now working well, an official of the Astronautics Research
Center of Qinghua University said here today.
</P>
<P>
This means that some universities, research institutes and
corporations may set foot in this field before long, ending the
monopoly of governmental departments, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The mini-satellite, named "Aerospace Qinghua No.1," was put
into space orbit on June 28 at Russia's Plesetsk Cosmodrome by a
Russian carrier rocket. It soon entered its scheduled sun-
synchronous orbit 700 km away from the earth.
</P>
<P>
The satellite, weighing about 50 kg and measuring 0.07 cubic
meter, took research staff one year and cost some 100 million yuan
(about 12 million U.S. dollars) to develop.
</P>
<P>
"Mini-satellites make it possible for universities to
participate in aerospace research and development," said Xu Xin,
senior engineer with the Center.
</P>
<P>
According to Xu, large and expensive satellites may eventually
be replaced by low-cost mini-satellites weighing less than 100 kg.
"It is a similar revolution to the one which replaced most
mainframe computers with personal computers in the world market,"
Xu said.
</P>
<P>
The world's smallest satellite only weighs a few hundred grams,
and the "Aerospace Qinghua No.1" is the lightest one in China.
</P>
<P>
It is the joint achievement of the China Aerospace
Electromechanical Group, Qinghua University and Britain's
University of Surrey. Qinghua sent ten research staff members to
the University of Surrey for study and cooperation in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The satellite will be involved in the latest scientific
experiments in aerospace and communications technologies, and then
serve commercial clients. It might later be used for disaster
monitoring, navigation, communications and military purposes.

<HEADLINE> Chinese T-bond Market Weekly Review </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese treasury bonds extended the
narrow fluctuations this week, according to Homeway, China's
leading on-line financial and securities advisory company.
</P>
<P>
Three comparatively old bonds closed down 0.28 yuan on average
while the three bonds listed after 1999 picked up by 0.23 yuan in
the average price. The repurchasing transaction highlighted the
market this week with very active turnover.
</P>
<P>
Bond 009905 (3.28 percent, due 2007) and 009908 (3.30 percent,
due 2009) rebounded by 0.21 yuan and 0.15 yuan respectively
following their over drops last week. In contrast, the old bonds
were brought down by 009704, a 9.78 percent bond due 2007, which
dipped 0.39 yuan for the week. Bond 000896 (8.56 percent, due 2003)
and 000696 (11.83 percent, due 2006) lost 0.28 yuan and 0.16 yuan
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Bond 010004, the bond listed this year with a floating interest
rate, has halted correction and risen close to the record high of
102.04 yuan, which it made on June 28. The bond kept moving upward
with active turnover since its debut, attracting a host of bond
investors.
</P>
<P>
As the third quarter of this year has started, securities
investment funds are selling treasuries and moving their capitals
back into the bullish stock market, leaving the T-bond trade thin.
</P>
<P>
There are a number of IPOs early this week, which greatly
affected the money supply and demand on the market. And the tight
money supply in turn impelled the repo transactions. The interest
rate on three-day and seven-day transactions briefly touched 12
percent and 10 percent respectively. On the whole, the interest
rate on China's repo market seems to be on an upward trend.

<P>
BEIJING, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The Shenzhen composite index slid 0.
41 points to 601.65 points on Friday. The sub-index ended at 4751.
99 points, down 78.68 points or 1.6 percent from last Friday's
close of 4830.67 points.
</P>
<P>
According to Homeway, China's leading on-line financial and
securities advisory company, the Shenzhen market's week-long
turnover stood at 47.59 billion yuan (5.73 billion US dollars),
which was 33.22 percent less than that of last week's 71.27
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Early this week, the Shenzhen stock market index turned down
due to the IPO pressure and investors' concern about listed
companies' interim results.
</P>
<P>
From Monday to Friday, over 600 million shares of 11 new A
stocks were issued online through the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock
exchanges and eight transferred rights stocks worth 4.037 billion
yuan of market value were listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange on
Monday. The move attracted a large amount of capital from the
secondary market.
</P>
<P>
In addition, as four new A stocks were listed on the two
bourses this week, the number of China's listed companies exceeds
1,000 and totals 1,004. And the number of listed stocks totals 1,
086.
</P>
<P>
After 43 companies announced their expected losses, the first
listed company's interim report was released on Friday by Lanzhou
Minbei Share-holding (Group) Co. Ltd. The company's profit was 9.
277 million yuan in the first half of this year, of which 300
million yuan was earned from its investment income. The company's
earning per share was 0.079 yuan.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, to further implement the Provisional Methods on
Listed Companies' Share Placement to the Public, China Securities
Regulatory Commission (CSRC) requests securities companies, which
are qualified to be leading underwriters, to strengthen the
internal co-ordination and staff training in order to make
preparation for the additional share issuance. The policy will
slow the market expansion in the near term.
</P>
<P>
Also it was reported today that China's stock market soared 47
percent in the first half of 2000, becoming the best global
performer, according to the Wall Street investment firm Merrill
Lynch. The good news will stimulate the stock market to a new high
next week, Homeway analysts said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The Shenzhen B-share market index
plunged 4.25 points, or 3.70 percent, to 110.49 points this week.
</P>
<P>
According to Homeway, China's leading on-line financial and
securities advisory company, turnover was 438.26 million HK
dollars (464.56 million yuan), 63.26 million HK dollars or 12.61
percent less than the total of last week.
</P>
<P>
The loss forecast from over 30 stocks so far weighed on the
broader market for most of the time amid speculation that more
companies will soon be issuing warnings of corporate losses.
Negative announcements had been running a little high.
</P>
<P>
The most steep losses came on concerns of market expansion.
Foshan Huanxin Packaging Co. Ltd debut on the Shenzhen Stock
Exchange on Thursday amid investor enthusiasm for the first new
issue of B shares in two years on the exchange.
</P>
<P>
The company's successful listing helped lift investors'
interest in two other initial share sales by Chinese companies,
which was in the meantime draining money from those already-listed
shares and left the door open to a rather steep downward move in
the market.
</P>
<P>
The market did stabilize before the weekend as thoughts of the
accelerating reforms in China's stock market helped the markets to
recover from the session lows.
</P>
<P>
China will encourage foreign-invested companies to seek listing
either on the yuan-denominated A-share market or the foreign
currency B-share market. And the nation's securities regulator is
considering a proposal to let companies that already trade their
stocks as H shares in Hong Kong sell A shares.
</P>
<P>
Also, technically, the ability to quickly recover back above
the lows had also sparked some buying interest despite the still
negative inclination.
</P>
<P>
Gains will not be overtly aggressive next week, given the
numerous earning warnings and negative comments. The market
performance is not likely to be very impressive for a period of
time, Homeway analysts said.

<HEADLINE> Vice-Premier Stresses Education in Ideology, Ethics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Li Lanqing has called
on schools nationwide to further strengthen education in ideology
and ethics among both students and teachers.
</P>
<P>
Ideological and political work, the building of the Communist
Party of China (CPC) on campuses and education in ethics in
schools have direct bearings on the cultivation of the young and
the success of China's modernization drive, the vice-premier said.
</P>
<P>
Li, also a member of the Standing Committee of the Political
Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, made the remarks at a
national meeting on Party building in colleges and ethical
education in primary and middle schools.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, party building, and ideological and political
work in colleges and universities have achieved notable results,
and the main ideological trends on Chinese campuses are steady,
healthy and positive. However, lots of problems still exist.
</P>
<P>
The new situation and challenges demand that the party building
and ideological and political work in colleges and universities
must be further strengthened rather than weakened, the vice-
premier said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of education in ethics among students and teachers in
primary and middle schools, Li noted that it is imperative to
combat the phenomenon of emphasizing intellectual development and
book knowledge while neglecting education in ethics and social
practice.
</P>
<P>
The thinking on education in schools must be straightened out,
and priority given to education in ethics in the nation's pursuit
of quality education, the vice-premier said.

<HEADLINE> Westerners Concerned with Turkey's Verdict on Former PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Western countries, the European Union
(EU) in particular, are concerned with the one-year jail term and
lifelong political ban slapped on pro-Islamic former Prime Minister
Necmettin Erbakan, Turkish Daily News reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
In a written statement on Thursday, the Parliamentary Assembly
of the Council of Europe said the conviction, which came at a time
when EU Commissioner for Enlargement Guenter Verheugen will visit
Ankara next week, was a threat to Turkey's efforts for EU
membership.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's Appeals Court Wednesday upheld the one-year jail term
handed down to Erbakan, 74, in March. Diplomatic sources said that
Verheugen will certainly touch upon the matter during his visit.
</P>
<P>
Although the EU, still waiting for the final conclusion of the
legal procedure, has not yet issued a written statement on the
case, its officials have expressed dissatisfaction with the
conviction.
</P>
<P>
EU diplomats in Ankara said the life-time political ban on
Erbakan will affect Turkey's bid for EU membership "negatively."
</P>
<P>
French Ambassador in Ankara Bernard Garcia, whose country has
assumed the EU presidency for the second half of 2000, said that as
an EU candidate, Turkey should make "necessary political reforms"
to improve human rights.
</P>
<P>
If reforms regarding freedom of speech are carried out, Garcia
said, cases like Erbakan's will not take place in the future.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan was found guilty by the Diyarbakir State Security Court
of "inciting hatred and animosity among people on the basis of
racial, religious and social class differences," during a speech in
eastern Bingol province on February 25, 1994.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan, leader of the Islamic Welfare Party who became Turkey's
first Islamic prime minister in June 1996, was forced to resign one
year later under heavy pressures from the powerful military, a
staunch defender of secularism.
</P>
<P>
In January 1998, the Constitutional Court ordered the closure of
Welfare Party for violation of secularism stipulated in the
constitution. Erbakan and other leaders of the party were banned
from politics for a period of five years.
</P>
<P>
Although predominantly Muslim, Turkey has adopted a strict
secular political regime and kept an vigilant eye on the influence
of Islamic parties.
</P>
<P>
By law, Erbakan still has a final recourse before the sentence
is implemented.
</P>
<P>
U.S. State Department spokesman Richard Boucher on Wednesday
also accused Erbakan's indictment as a violation of freedom of
speech.
</P>
<P>
The United States made similar reactions when former pro-Islamic
Istanbul mayor Recep Tayyip Erdogan was convicted and sent to jail
in 1998 on the same charge.
</P>
<P>
Western diplomatic sources said the EU hopes a solution could be
found for Erbakan's case to the effect that he would not be put
behind bars.
</P>
<P>
The EU has also warned against the possible closure of pro-
Islamic opposition Virtue Party, which was accused of being
successor to the outlawed Welfare Party.
</P>
<P>
It was believed that the EU has debated whether to issue a
diplomatic protest if the Turkish Constitutional Court decides to
close the Virtue Party in its pending trial.
</P>
<P>
Some Western diplomats said that in case of a closure decision,
Turkey's EU membership will be delayed for at least one year.

<HEADLINE> Somalis Welcome Forthcoming Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The Somali People from various
walks of life including the intellectuals who fought the late
regime are now trying to pave the way for the forthcoming
government to be established in Djibouti by preparing the grounds,
data and all other necessary means to support it.
</P>
<P>
Among the more practical groups working hard towards that end
is the newly founded Mogadishu Associates for Research and
Statistics (MARS).
</P>
<P>
This group consisting of senior economists from the former
finance and planning ministries has conducted a thorough research
on how the Somalis had survived during the 10-year long civil
strive.
</P>
<P>
In one of its reports, MARS has concentrated on how the economy
had survived, the flow and revaluation or devaluation of the
Somali shillings against the hard currencies in and out of
Mogadishu despite the absence of a government and all of the
public financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
Mogadishu, the capital of Somalia, which is where the heaviest
armed confrontations took place with over 1.5 million inhabitants,
had remained the heart of economy of Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Mohamed Hirabeh, one of the leading figures of the project,
told Xinhua that they have been motivated by the fact that things
on the economical point of view seemed to have been going on
smoothly with the trading, imports and exports continuing and the
small business activities flourishing amid absence of a governing
body for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Hirabeh said the small industries such as the weaving of
clothes, handcrafts, grain and oil milling and others are
mushrooming, encouraging the market-oriented economy needed by the
upcoming government to adopt.
</P>
<P>
It is designing the economical data base line for the
government and other interested agencies for their addressing of
the most critical up-to-date socio-economic problems, Hirabeh
said.
</P>
<P>
The MARS researchers who have been at home during the entire
years of the civil war are suggesting in the end of their report
that the forthcoming government should be aware of the pace the
decentralized and market-oriented economy had been pushing up at
the absence of a government and therefore nobody should try to
stand in their way for the interest of the development of the
country.
</P>
<P>
It is not only this group of intellectuals who are undergoing
positive and tangible efforts, but other social groups such as the
women, youth, artists and business groups are showing their
preparedness to welcome the envisaged government to come from
Djibouti in couple of weeks time.
</P>
<P>
The artists have composed songs, poems and plays all
encouraging the Djibouti conference, while the business community
keep establishing factories and increasing their activities from
where the forthcoming government can get large taxes, but the
women and youth groups continue holding demonstrations in raising
the public awareness in Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
It is another popular uprising now struggling for the
restoration of the law and order, said Ruqia Abdullahi, a business
lady in Bakara market.

<HEADLINE> FIFA to Investigate Bribery Attempt Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 7 (Xinhua) -- World soccer's governing body Friday
said in Zurich it would launch an inquiry into an apparent attempt
to bribe its members before the vote for the 2006 World Cup, but
would not yet call in the police.
</P>
<P>
FIFA spokesman Andreas Herren said: "I can confirm that FIFA
and the German football association will both conduct their own
investigations before going to other authorities."
</P>
<P>
It was revealed Thursday that a number of executive committee
members of the FIFA executive committee had received a letter --
purporting to be from the German bidders -- offering gifts in
return for votes for Germany.
</P>
<P>
Germany beat South Africa in the contest to host the 2006 World
Cup finals by 12 votes to 11 after the Oceania delegate, Charles
Dempsey of New Zealand, abstained in the final round of voting.
</P>
<P>
FIFA spokesman Keith Cooper said Thursday the letter had not
worried those who had received it.
</P>
<P>
Cooper said:"The feeling of those members of the committee who
received this letter purporting to be from a member of one of the
bidding committees was that it was not to be taken seriously."

<HEADLINE> Skate-bikes Popular Among Macao Youngsters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Skate-bikes have become popular
gadgets among youngsters in Macao in recent months.
</P>
<P>
Japan is believed to be the source to pass on the trendy thing
to Macao in April. One skate-bike used to cost as much as 1,300
patacas (about 160 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The skate-bikes were mainly imported from Switzerland and China
's inland areas and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Fierce market competition has pulled prices down. Now skate-
bikes can be bought with only 200 patacas (25 U.S. dollars) or
less.
</P>
<P>
Skate-bikes are normally made of aluminum, iron or alloy. Many
youngsters like to paint colors to make their bikes more
attractive. Some do-it-yourself lovers can even experience a
speedy fun by installing an electric motor.

<HEADLINE> HK Aspires to Be Leading Investment Window in Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 7 (Xinhua) - Hong Kong is determined to be the
leading investment window in Asia by developing the debt markets
of Hong Kong and the region as a whole, said a Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR) government senior official here on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing at Joint Financial Markets Luncheon on Friday, the
HKSAR's Financial Secretary, Donald Tsang, said an important step
has been taken to develop a multi-currency capital market in Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
"The first stage will be the introduction of a U.S. dollar-
denominated capital market," said Tsang.
</P>
<P>
He added that in order to make that possible, a reliable and
efficient U.S. dollar clearing system would be introduced in
phases beginning next month. This would facilitate transactions of
U.S.-dollar denominated securities, including debt securities, in
Hong Kong to be settled within the Asian time zone. The system
would help reduce settlement risk and increase settlement
efficiency.
</P>
<P>
"When the system is fully operational, hopefully by the end of
the year, we will be able to build a new capital market that
offers local and global investors access to a full range of U.S.-
dollar denominated products. This will make Hong Kong the leading
investment window in Asia."
</P>
<P>
Tsang noted that the mainland of China was playing a positive
role as part of this development. The Ministry of Finance has been
actively tapping U.S.-dollar funding from the world debt market.
Eight U.S.-dollar issues have been listed on the Hong Kong Stock
Exchange in parallel with other major markets.
</P>
<P>
"This is a welcome development and we would like to see the
mainland making even more active use of Hong Kong as the center
for these U.S.-dollar funds. In fact, the cost-effectiveness of
such fund-raising activity by the mainland should increase with
the introduction of the U.S.-dollar clearing system," said the
Financial Secretary.
</P>
<P>
Over the past decade, Hong Kong has put in place the
infrastructure and provided various initiatives to kick start
market development. The debt market in Hong Kong has grown
considerably, particularly in the past few years. The total
outstanding public and private sector debt issues jumped 60
percent from 279 billion HK dollars (about 35.77 billion U.S.
dollars) at the end of 1996 to more than 440 billion HK dollars (
about 56.41 billion U.S. dollars) today.
</P>
<P>
"But more needs to be done if we are to develop a mature debt
market in Hong Kong. As part of this push, we are strengthening
our efforts to attract companies outside Hong Kong, especially
mainland enterprises, to issue debt papers here. This will
increase the breadth and depth of our market," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We need to establish links with more central clearing and
depository systems outside Hong Kong. So far, direct clearing,
settlement and payment linkages have been established with
Australia, New Zealand and South Korea, as well as Cedel and
Euroclear. But we have to build on this excellent basis and reach
out further to other jurisdictions.
</P>
<P>
"Our overall program is designed to keep us ahead of our
competitors and to further enhance our claim as Asia's premier
financial center," Tsang said.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar fell half a
U.S. cent Friday as the market was nervous about the speculation
that the U.S. Federal Reserve would raise interest rates again.
</P>
<P>
The currency hit a low of 58.65 U.S. cents this afternoon and
it firmed slightly before the close to end the local session at 58.
74, from 59.15 the previous day.
</P>
<P>
Any increase in the Australia/U.S. interest rate differential
would hurt the local currency because it lures investment away
from Australian dollar bonds and deposits.
</P>

Australian interest rates are at 6.0 percent while the U.S.
dollar's are at 6.5 percent.

<HEADLINE> Russia to Harvest More Grain in 2000 EDS-Corrects dateline from June 7 to July 7. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The gross grain crop in Russia will
reach 65-67 million tons this year, up 10-12 million tons from
1999, Russian Deputy Prime Minister, Agriculture Minister Alexei
Gordeyev said in a latest report to the parliament, according to
media reports Friday.
</P>
<P>
A total of 90,000 hectares have been harvested by the end of
June, the harvest averaging 3.8 metric tons per hectare, better
than last year. The fodder crop harvest has risen 36 percent over
last year, Gordeyev said.
</P>
<P>
Russia produced 54.7 million tons of grain in 1999, compared to
47.8 million tons in 1998.
</P>
<P>
"The need for fodder grain will not be fully met, considering
that last year's grain reserves are limited," said Gordeyev,
urging the creation of strategic grain reserve funds at the
federal and regional levels.
</P>
<P>
The Interfax news agency cited Russia's Grain Union president
Alexander Yukish as saying that Russia will have to import 6-10
million tons of grain in 2001 to meet its food shortage.
</P>
<P>
According to the Grain Union, grain reserves in the country now
amount to about 8 million tons, and transitional reserves as of
July 1, 2000 will be kept at 2-3 million tons. Annual grain
consumption in Russia is estimated at 75 million tons.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Treasuries Hovers On Friday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese treasuries kept hovering
around the current prices on thin trading on Friday, with trading
volume expanding to 1.6 billion yuan, up 120 million from
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Half of the six current bonds declined with losses ranging from
0.01 percent to 0.12 percent while the remaining three, 000696,
009905 and 010004 with floating interest rates, edged up narrowly
by 0.08 percent on average.
</P>
<P>
Starting from this quarter, securities investment funds have
been gradually transferring money away from treasuries into the
equity market for higher investment returns. These big players
seem pretty indifferent to current treasuries while focusing their
attention on the more bullish China's stock market, according to
Homeway, China's leading on-line financial and securities advisory
company.
</P>
<P>
Lack of impetus, the trade volume on the three-day, seven-day,
14-day and 28-day repo transactions contracted by 1.27 billion
yuan further to 5.47 billion. The interest rate on the three-day
transaction dipped by 2.73 percentage points to 1.02 percent,
Homeway said.

<P>
BEIJING, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese astronomers say that as
long as the night of July 16 is clear, people in many parts of
China will have the chance to watch the Moon turn red and a comet
streak through the sky.
</P>
<P>
Li Enjie, an expert with the Beijing Planetarium, said the Red
Moon is caused by the refraction of red sunlight in the atmosphere
during a total lunar eclipse.
</P>

According to Wang Sichao, a research fellow at the Purple
Mountain Observatory, the lunar eclipse is expected to last nearly
four hours, the longest in a century.
</P>
<P>
He said it will begin at 7:57 p.m. (Beijing Time). A total
lunar eclipse will start at 9:02 p.m. and the eclipse will enter
its final phase at 11:54 p.m.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Killer Litter Offenders' Flats Confiscated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Three Singaporeans convicted of
throwing litters from high rise buildings are set to lose their
own houses.
</P>
<P>
Singapore's Housing Board is taking back three flats where the
occupiers had recently been convicted of killer litter offenses,
according to a news report Friday by the local Channel News Asia.
</P>
<P>
The three people were convicted in May for three separate
killer litter offenses, that is, the throwing of empty beer
bottles, the throwing of durian husks, and the throwing of plastic
container and three glasses from their respective high buildings.
</P>
<P>
In Singapore, anyone convicted of causing death by a rash act,
such as throwing killer litter, faces a two-year jail term or a
fine or both.
</P>
<P>
Besides, under the Housing and Development Board ( HDB) Act,
the authorities can also acquire the flat if the person staying in
the flat is convicted of throwing killer litter. The offenders
will also be barred from buying or renting a HDB flat for five
years.
</P>
<P>
The Singaporeans' concern over the threat of litters falling
from high buildings heightened recently after a 5-year-old girl
was killed in April by a flower pot which fell on her as she was
walking at the foot of an HDB block.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers carried articles condemning the act of killer
littering and calling for tougher penalties on the offenders.

<HEADLINE> Soeharto's House Arrest Status Extended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesia's Attorney General
Office (AGO) has extended again, for the fourth time, the house
arrest status of former President Soeharto until August 10, a
report said Friday.
</P>
<P>
It said that the extension of the status is the final one, and
based on the country's crime code, after that, the status could
not be extended any longer.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Soeharto's lawyer Juan Felix Tampubolon confirmed
the extension of the Soeharto's house arrest status, adding that
prosecutors of the AGO will also examine his client.
</P>
<P>
"This morning, I was contacted by the AGO," Tampubolon was
quoted by Suara Pembaruan daily as saying.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto was suspected of abusing power and authority by
issuing decrees and government regulations to amass funds through
seven tax-free charity foundations he set up and chaired during
his 32 years in power.
</P>
<P>
He has been put under house arrest and was banned from leaving
the country since in May.
</P>
<P>
The AGO has pledged to try Soeharto before August 10 this year,
or before the country's law making body of the People's
Consultatives Assembly (MPR) hold its annual session scheduled for
August 7.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Unveils Bidders for Telkom Stake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has unveiled
six pre- qualified firms that had applied for the 49 percent stake
in Telkom Kenya, the former sole state-owned telecommunication
company in the country.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the pre-qualified firms, Kenyan Finance Minister
Chris Okemo said here Thursday that the final winner would be
known by the end of October this year, Kenya's major newspapers
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The six companies are German giant Deutsche Telcom, South
African mobile operator MTN, Egypt's Orascom, British Telecom,
Malaysia Telecom and the Mount Kenya Communications consortium.
</P>
<P>
Okemo said the sale of the 49 percent stake in Telkom Kenya is
part of the government's efforts to liberalize the country's
telecommunications sector.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the bidders would now have an opportunity to
carry out their own audit which involves reviewing the
information on Telkom's operations and talks with the company
management over next eight to 10 weeks.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here hope the move will reduce telephone service fees,
some of the highest on the continent, and place Kenya at par with
its East African neighbors.
</P>
<P>
About 100 Kenyans share one telephone line in the country,
while the figures for South Africa and Mauritius are 11.5 and 21.4
respectively.

<HEADLINE> Russia to Harvest More Grain in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The gross grain crop in Russia will
reach 65-67 million tons this year, up 10-12 million tons from
1999, Russian Deputy Prime Minister, Agriculture Minister Alexei
Gordeyev said in a latest report to the parliament, according to
media reports Friday.
</P>
<P>
A total of 90,000 hectares have been harvested by the end of
June, the harvest averaging 3.8 metric tons per hectare, better
than last year. The fodder crop harvest has risen 36 percent over
last year, Gordeyev said.
</P>
<P>
Russia produced 54.7 million tons of grain in 1999, compared to
47.8 million tons in 1998.
</P>
<P>
"The need for fodder grain will not be fully met, considering
that last year's grain reserves are limited," said Gordeyev,
urging the creation of strategic grain reserve funds at the
federal and regional levels.
</P>
<P>
The Interfax news agency cited Russia's Grain Union president
Alexander Yukish as saying that Russia will have to import 6-10
million tons of grain in 2001 to meet its food shortage.
</P>
<P>
According to the Grain Union, grain reserves in the country now
amount to about 8 million tons, and transitional reserves as of
July 1, 2000 will be kept at 2-3 million tons. Annual grain
consumption in Russia is estimated at 75 million tons.

<HEADLINE> International Agencies Agree on New Approach to Help Poor Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Six international agencies have
agreed on new arrangements to help the 48 United Nations
designated least-developed countries (LDCs) integrate more
effectively into the global economy, according to a press release
by the World Trade Organization (WTO) here Friday.
</P>
<P>
"We have a responsibility, shared with governments and other
agencies and institutions, to do better in assisting the LDCs to
integrate into the world economy," said WTO Director-General Mike
Moore at a meeting of heads and representatives of the six
organizations held Thursday in New York.
</P>
<P>
"Of course, it is the LDC governments themselves that must
determine their policies and priorities, but we must be ready to
give them effective help. It is time these countries see more of
the positive side of globalization," said the WTO chief, who
chaired the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The new arrangements lay considerable stress on ensuring that
trade policy, trade-related technical assistance, and capacity-
building needs are articulated in a broad development context. The
heads of the agencies firmly shared the view held by most
governments and the development community at large, that these
aspects of policy simply cannot be addressed in isolation, said
the release.
</P>
<P>
The International Trade Center, the International Monetary Fund,
the U.N. Development Program, the U.N. Conference for Trade and
Development, the World Bank, and the WTO established the
Integrated Framework for trade-related technical assistance to
LDCs three years ago as a cooperative inter-agency effort to help
the poorest countries integrate more effectively into the global
economy.

<HEADLINE> Part of Belgians Can Opt for Work of Four-day Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 7 (Xinhua) -- From now on, Flemish civil
servants in Belgium can opt for work of a 38-hour, four-day week,
as a new collective labor agreement was signed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Local media said Friday that the flexible working hours for
Flemish civil servants will in the future run from 7:30 a.m. to 7:
00 p.m., which makes trial periods for a four-day working week
possible in this bilingual country.
</P>
<P>
The main official languages in Belgium are French and Flemish.
French-speaking Belgians and Flemish-speaking Belgians usually
live in two different regions -- Wallon and Flanders. Under the
law, they have different rights in certain aspects.
</P>
<P>
In Belgium, civil servants divide into two parts: Flemish civil
servants and French civil servants. All levels of the government
in this country include the two kinds of servants. Therefore,
employment policy for different groups are not same.
</P>
<P>
For the four-day and 38-hour working week, trade unions first
opposed as they wanted a shorter working week, but most union
members wanted the possibility to stay home for at least one more
day.
</P>
<P>
The flexible working hours will allegedly make it easier to
combine work and family life and also help people to avoid the
rush hours. It will permit the Flemish citizens to use the Flemish
services outside the usual office hours.

BEIJING, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The following are the major
national news Xinhua released from July 1 to 7:
</P>
<P>
-- Schools run by the Communist Party of China (CPC), which
previously enrolled only the Party elite, have recently been eyed
by private businessmen as excellent training centers.
</P>
<P>
Created by the Party's committees at different levels, Party
schools are characterized by a special educational system designed
to spread Marxism among cadres. Doctoral programs are available
for the most distinguished students.
</P>
<P>
Now, courses targeting private businessmen have been launched
in Party schools at both central and local levels. Sources say
that the enthusiasm for applying a seat in a Party school is
soaring, particularly in the coastal regions where the market
economy is on a fast track.
</P>
<P>
-- The death toll from an explosion at a fireworks factory
Friday morning in Jiangmen, south China's Guangdong Province, has
risen to 36, and 160 others have been reported injured.
</P>
<P>
More than 30 people are still missing following the blast,
which investigators believe may have occurred when sparks produced
by employees pounding iron nails ignited inside the warehouse
building.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin has expressed deep concern over
the recent fireworks explosion in south China's Guangdong Province,
and the State Council has ordered local governments and
departments concerned to take immediate measures to ensure
industrial safety.
</P>
<P>
-- China has renewed administrative measures governing Sino-
overseas joint-venture hospitals and clinics, hoping the sector's
sound development can provide people a wide range of health care
services.
</P>

According to a rule published by ministries of Health and
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, which went into effect on
July 1, overseas hospitals and firms can launch joint ventures in
China after they get permission from the two ministries.

State-owned big-cap stocks performed actively and became market
bellwethers, as their interim results were well expected,
according to Homeway, China's leading on-line financial and

According to Wall Street investment firm Merrill Lynch, China's

<HEADLINE> Shanghai B-share Market Weekly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai B-share market was
mixed with a strong negative bias this week (July 3rd--7th),
reflecting the overall uncertain sentiment set in the broader
market.
</P>
<P>
The B-share index fell 1.16 points, or 2.07 percent, to 54.86
this week, according to Homeway, China's leading on-line financial
and securities advisory company.
</P>
<P>
The turnover was 66.83 million U.S. dollars (554.69 million
yuan), little changed from last week's total at 65.78 million U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The earnings warning from over 30 stocks so far kept the
broader market on edge for most of the time amid speculation that
more companies will soon be issuing warnings of their own.
Negative announcements have been running a little high.
</P>
<P>
The market failed to hold on to a positive bias and any advance
continued to be restricted. But generally speaking, the downside
pressure proved modest and short lived as the cyclical issues came
to life now and then.
</P>
<P>
The market did stabilize before the weekend as thoughts of the
accelerating reforms in China's stock market paced the way on the
upside during the recovery off the sessions low.
</P>
<P>
China will encourage foreign-invested companies to seek listing
either on the yuan-denominated A-share market or the foreign
currency B-share market, the first official confirmation since
British consumer goods market Unilever Plc filed its application
for a listing on China's A-share market last Friday.
</P>
<P>
In addition, it is said China's securities regulator is
considering a proposal to let companies that already trade their
stocks as H shares on the Hong Kong market sell yuan-denominated A
shares in the country.
</P>
<P>
However, the market seemed to have rather muted reactions,
insisting that earnings profile is still the most important factor
in determining the near-term direction. That was the key factor
why the index had not been pulled out of the doldrums.
</P>
<P>
Gains will not be overtly aggressive next week, given the
numerous earning warnings and negative comments. The market
performance is not likely to be very impressive for a period of
time, Home analysts said.

<HEADLINE> Barak Urges Allies to Rally Public Support for Peace Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
is urging his left-wing allies to get mobilized to rally public
support for his peace efforts as he prepares to leave for a pivotal
three-way summit the United States.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with One Israel ministers on Thursday, Barak said
he regrets that the left is not organizing demonstrations or
raising posters to show support publicly for the peace process and
he is worried that right-wing activists will be the only presence
on the streets to make themselves seen and heard.
</P>
<P>
Barak will meet again Friday with senior figures of his leftist
Labor Party, the backbone of One Israel bloc, to try to ignite
grassroots support for the government.
</P>
<P>
Barak has instructed his ministers and Labor Party Secretary-
General Ra'anan Cohen to get their own activists onto the streets.
He also asked Minister of Immigrant Absorption Yuli Tamir and
coalition chairman Ophir Pines-Paz to coordinate activity with
peace movements outside the Knesset (parliament).
</P>
<P>
Justice Minister Yossi Beilin was entrusted with coordination in
the Knesset to ensure parliamentary majority for the law
establishing a referendum if an agreement is reached with the
Palestinians at the upcoming summit at Camp David, a presidential
resort in Maryland.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the council of settlements and the joint
operations staff of the right-wing movements are preparing
extensive protest activities before and during next week's summit
called by U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Their plans include a hunger strike opposite Barak's residence
in Jerusalem and a huge rally in Rabin Square in Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
The council declared on Thursday a "state of emergency" and
ordered the heads of all the settlements to cease their activities
and fight against the evacuation of settlements and territories.
</P>
<P>
The summit, which will begin next Tuesday with the participation
of Clinton, Barak, and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, will try
to resolve the key issues in the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks
such as Jerusalem, Palestinian refugees, borders, Jewish
settlements and water.
</P>
<P>
The two sides will try to reach a framework agreement before the
September target date for a final peace accord.
</P>
<P>
Preparations are underway for the summit and Israeli Public
Security Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami and Palestinian Council Speaker
Ahmed Qurei will travel to Washington over the weekend and meet
with U.S. officials to get things ready.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, shortly after Clinton announced to host the
summit, Ysrael Ba'aliya, a right-wing partner in Barak's coalition
government, announced resignation from the government. Another
right-wing partner, the National Religious Party (NRP), decided
Thursday to resign.
</P>
<P>
Facing the fresh threats to the coalition, Barak has appealed
for national unity and urged the two ruling partners to recede
their resignation.

<HEADLINE> Middle East Economic Briefs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs from
the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- The Black Sea Economic Cooperation Organization
(BSECO) and the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization
(FAO) held a conference in Istanbul Thursday to discuss food
security and agriculture strategy.
</P>
<P>
Head of FAO's Ankara Office Maharaj Muthoo said that many of the
BSECO countries had slipped into greater poverty with more people
living below poverty line.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, which has been self-sufficient in food production,
pledged to do its best to establish cooperation with Black Sea
countries to fight against aggravating hunger and malnutrition.
</P>
<P>
BSECO has 11 member countries: Albania, Armenia, Azerbaijan,
Bulgaria, Georgia, Greece, Moldova, Romania, Russia, Turkey and
Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- A Siemens AG-led consortium has won an order worth 1.
44 billion dollars to build a power station in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The twin-unit hard-coal-fired power station will have a capacity
of 2 x 650 megawatts and be located close to the southern Turkish
city of Iskenderun, Siemens said in a statement Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In addition to Siemens Power Generation Group (KWU), the
consortium comprises Germany's Babock Borsig power and Turkey's
Gama-Tekfen.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- A draft proposal aimed at speeding up the
privatization of Bezeq, a state-owned communications firm, was
issued early in the week by Yaron Jacobs, director general of the
Government Companies Authority.
</P>
<P>
Communications Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer has ordered that
Bezeq be privatized within 15 months.
</P>
<P>
The principles of the proposed privatization were presented to
the Bezeq board of directors last week. Under the proposal, at
least 50 percent of the company's shares would be offered to a
private investor, who could purchase a portion of the shares
immediately and retain an option for acquiring an additional stake
at a later date.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- The Israeli Finance Ministry will submit a proposal
to the Knesset (parliament) within a month on easing the tax
burdens on high-tech industries. The proposal was approved earlier
this week by the ministerial committee on legislation.
</P>
<P>
Tax commission said it was impossible to estimate what impact
the changes would have on tax revenues in the short term, since no
one knows how many high-tech companies will be set up or their
scale.
</P>
<P>
However, they added, most of the proposed changes will merely
defer tax collection rather than reduce it.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Moody's, an authoritative international credit
rating company, Thursday announced it was raising Israel's credit
rating from A minus to A (A3 to A2) and raised Israel's short-term
credit rating from P2 to P1, their highest rating available for
short-term credit. The rating enables Israel to raise funds
internationally at lower interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The decision, taken unanimously by Moody's credit committee, was
explained as a result of Israel's modern broad-based economy, with
a strong high-tech sector, which leads in exports.

<HEADLINE> Ties Between Indonesia, Australia Back to Normal Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The relations between Indonesia and
Australia which has been deteriorated over the last year is
expected to go back to normal within next one to two years, a
senior official said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
"That is not a big deal. And I think our relations with
Australia will back to normal within next one to two years. And I
don't see any obstacles," Indonesian Minister of Defense Juwono
Sudarsono told Xinhua in an exclusive interview.
</P>
<P>
"Our relations with Australia just have been influenced by East
Timor's issue. Don't be exaggerated. And now, East Timor is no
longer part of Indonesia's territory," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that, "there is no problem in connection with our
military ties with Australia," adding that some Australian
military officers are still continuing their studies in Indonesia
and the same thing with Indonesian military officers in Australia.
</P>
<P>
"And we don't see Australia as a threat," he said.
</P>
<P>
Asked about East Timor issue, Sudarsono said it all depends on
the United Nations (U.N.).
</P>
<P>
"East Timor (destiny) depends on the implementation of the U.N.
's promises. So far, East Timorese were only given promises by the
U.N., but nothing (of its promises) has been met by the U.N.," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the U.N. only questioned cases of human right
abuse which were allegedly committed by personnel of the
Indonesian Military (TNI). " Whereas, it is more important to
think about the future of East Timorese, (think about) their
education and their social welfare. East Timorese have been bored
to be regulated and dictated by the U.N., the United States,
Australia and Indonesia," he said.

<HEADLINE> No Group in Indonesia Able to Launch Coup D'etat: Defense Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Defense Minister Juwono
Sudarsono said here Friday there is no single group in the country
that will be able to launch a coup d'etat against President
Abdurrahman Wahid, including military.
</P>
<P>
"I can say that there is no single group in the country which
could launch a coup d'etat against the government, including
military, as they were devided in groups," Sudarsono told Xinhua
in an exclusive interview.
</P>
<P>
He also admitted that currently the Indonesian Military (TNI)
also has been devided in groups, but he was optimistic such a
thing will be ended when "the younger generations replace the old
ones."
</P>
<P>
"There is a pro-status-quo group and a pro-reforms group, so I
could say that there is not a strong group that may be able to
launch a coup d'etat," he reiterated.
</P>
<P>
Sudarsono also said that pro-status-quo group has been
hammering out a scenario to unseat incumbent President Abdurrahman
Wahid.
</P>
<P>
"And the people of status quo, and I can say they are cronies
of former President Soeharto, want to hamper the process of
investigation into former President Soeharto. They are afraid of
being brought to justice," the minister added.
</P>
<P>
"They are trying to do anything they could to hamper the
investigation process (into Soeharto for corruption cases) by
inciting riots and finance communal bloodshed," he added.
</P>
<P>
"And they have a main target namely creating an impression that
the government is not capable to deal with the situation, and at
last, they want to topple President Wahid," Sudarsono said.
</P>
<P>
He denied suggestions that the ongoing riots and communal
bloodshed which have been taking place in some parts of the
country were designed by the TNI.
</P>
<P>
"That is not possible. TNI is not able to make such a design,
moreover a grand ones," he said.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's White Farmers Offer 400 More Farms for Resettlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The Commercial Farmers' Union of
Zimbabwe has offered a further 400 farms for the government's
resettlement program, bringing its total offer to 600, the weekly
Business reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
If the land reform is done properly, the union can easily give
the additional 400 farms, Deputy Director of the Union Jerry Grant
said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Grant said out of the gazetted list of 804 farms, more than 270
were possessed by the sole owners and so they should not be on the
list for compulsory acquisition.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the government will abandon the
compulsory acquisition and only target multiple owners and
derelict land.
</P>
<P>
Grant said it did not intend to frustrate the government's
efforts to implement its land reform and resettlement program.
</P>
<P>
"We must get the politics out of the land issue and deal with
it as an economic issue," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We do not want to obstruct the government's resettlement
program, but productive farms should be left to those fully
utilizing them," he claimed.
</P>
<P>
Grant said farmers had contested the acquisition of more than
500 farms.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Lands and Agriculture is going through
submissions made by white farmers objecting to the compulsory
acquisition of their farms.
</P>
<P>
However, the government can still go ahead issuing acquisition
orders for the farms despite white farmers' objections.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Import More Power From Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Uganda will increase its power
export to Kenya from the current 10 megawatts to 80 megawatts,
Kenyan Energy Minister Francis Lotodo has said.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's leading newspapers Friday quoted the minister as saying
the supply is expected in mid-July and will ease the ongoing power
crisis.
</P>
<P>
From late May, the Kenyan government introduced an intensifying
power rationing due to a long dry spell which has led to the low
levels of reservoirs, seriously affecting the country's power
generation.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to a crowd outside the parliament buildings here
Thursday, Lotodo said his government will import two "massive"
generators, each with 55 megawatts, to alleviate the power
shortage.
</P>
<P>
The two generating units will be located in Nakuru and Eldoret
cities in Rift Valley Province, central Kenya, the minister added.
</P>
<P>
Kenya now faces a shortage of 100 megawatts.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Government Urged to Pay Debt Owed to Suppliers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government has been
urged to raise money to pay debt owed to the companies which
supplied goods to the former state-run Zambia Consolidated Copper
Mines, currently a private company.
</P>
<P>
The mining corporation owes the suppliers about 400 billion
Kwacha (about 133 million U.S. dollars), which the government has
promised to liquidate through monthly budgetary allocations,
according to Zambia Daily Mail.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper Friday quoted President of the Zambia Federation
of Employers Samuel Musonda as saying here Thursday that the
monthly liquidation of debt is not enough to make them viable.
</P>
<P>
He said that foreign companies are being awarded supplying
tenders by new mine owners because the Zambian companies are
facing serious financial difficulties due to the delay by the
government in paying the debt.
</P>
<P>
The failure by the former state-owned mining corporation to pay
the debt has caused the suppliers to fail to execute the contracts
awarded by new owners of the mines, said Musonda.
</P>
<P>
"As a result, the new mine owners are being forced to look to
foreign suppliers," Musonda said.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that the government would quickly attend to the issue
of liquidating the debt.
</P>
<P>
By the end of March this year, privatization of the former
mining corporation had been completed in a bid to attract foreign
investment and advanced technology and management to revive the
ailing mining industry in the copper-producing country.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Earns Over $80M Through Mineral Exports Last Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania earned a total of
80.4 million U.S. dollars through mineral exports last year,
almost a four-fold increase from 22.6 million dollars in 1998, the
official Daily News reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Minister for Energy and Minerals Abdallah
Kigoda as saying that the achievement was due to the production of
gold in the western Tabora Region and the increased output of
diamonds in the northern Shinyanga Region.
</P>
<P>
Export of precious stones also increased from 8.1 million
dollars in 1998 to 14 million dollars last year, said the
minister.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, many local exporters of raw precious stones
failed to fetch good prices for their products in the world market
despite enjoying royalty exemption.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the minister also admitted that many international
investors in the mining sector were scared away by numerous taxes
and red-tape in some public institutions in Tanzania, adding that
taxes had greatly contributed to smuggling of minerals abroad.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 10 years Tanzania has experienced the expansion
of the mining sector which in turn has resulted in the increase of
export earnings.
</P>
<P>
The expansion of the sector is a relief to the eastern African
country, whose major source of foreign exchange has been
traditional cash crops, which are bringing in less foreign income
as their volumes and prices fall.
</P>
<P>
According to industry officials, Tanzania is expected to emerge
among Africa's top mineral producers after South Africa and Ghana.
The sector will soon be contributing 40 percent of the country's
GDP.

<HEADLINE> Turkmenistan's Grain Yield Hits Record High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Turkmenistan has harvested 1.7
million tons of grain after the summer crown of this year, up 0.2
million tons from the expected amount, breaking the country's
record of grain yield for the whole year, according to latest
media reports reaching here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The grain production target for this year was surpassed in late
June, while in the same time of last year only about 1 million
tons of grain were harvested, the reports quoted the Turkmenistani
Agriculture Ministry as saying.
</P>
<P>
Last year's total grain harvest amounted to 1.51 million tons,
it said.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Turkmenistani President Saparmurad Niyazov told a
cabinet meeting that 1.8 million tons of grain will be produced in
2001, ensuring the country full food security in the next two
years.
</P>
<P>
A program of Turkmenistan's social and economic development for
2000-2010 and the national goal of food safety stipulate a grain
production of 2.5 million tons in 2003, 3 million in 2005, and 5
million in 2010.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, Turkmenistan, which has been buying grain
and flour from neighboring countries, will be able to export about
2.5 million tons of grain by 2010.

<HEADLINE> 4,000-year-old Percussion Instrument Unearthed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, July 7 (Xinhua) -- A rectangular stone musical
instrument, confirmed to be a type of percussion instrument used
in ancient China, was recently unearthed at the site of Qijia
Culture in Qinghai Province, northwest China.
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (
CASS) and the Qinghai Provincial Archaeological Research Institute
said that this is the first such instrument ever found in the
history of Chinese archaeology.
</P>
<P>
They said that the discovery may reverse the traditional theory
that ancient percussion instruments were triangular-shaped or
square.
</P>
<P>
The Qijia Culture flourished in the transitional period from
the Neolithic Age to the Bronze Age, some 3,500 to 4,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Wang Renxiang, a researcher from the CASS, discovered the relic
at the home of a farmer who lives in the Lajia village, where the
ruins of the Qijia Culture are located.
</P>
<P>
The finely-cut and well-polished instrument, 96 cm long and 66
cm wide, is dark blue and still produces a loud, clear sound.
</P>
<P>
A number of jade articles used in primitive religious rituals
were found at the site, as well as a city moat which is dozens
meters wide and five meters deep, experts said.
</P>
<P>
Based on the discovery, experts from the CASS and Qinghai
Provincial Archaeological Research Institute concluded that the
site may have been the center of an administrative region.
</P>
<P>
They also estimated that the ruins cover an area of 200,000 to
300,000 sq m.

<HEADLINE> China Prepares for Yellow River Floods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, July 7 (Xinhua) -- China has mobilized 3.05 million
people along the Yellow River to make preparations for a possible
flood.
</P>
<P>
Sources with the Yellow River Flood Prevention Headquarters
said that the country is transporting mountains of sand bags,
fortification materials and rafts to the river valley, while
reinforcing the dykes.
</P>
<P>
Although north China is being affected by severe drought,
officials say that flooding could still be the biggest danger on
the Yellow River, the country's second longest river, which is
noted for disastrous floods in history.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,000 bank bursts have been reported on the river
over the past 3,000 years, some leaving millions of people
homeless and big cities destroyed.
</P>
<P>
Experts say the riverbed has been continuing to rise these
years because of an accumulation of silt, and future floods will
be even more devastating.
</P>
<P>
Although the country has built dozens of reservoirs on the
river, some of them are in disrepair and cannot prevent big floods.
</P>
<P>
Officials warned that as the Yellow River region has
experienced ten straight years of drought, many people have become
complacent about the possibility of flooding.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading Israeli newspapers on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak Thursday appealed for
national unity in advance of next week's Camp David summit, saying
the country is at an "historic crossroads" that could change its
future.
</P>
<P>
He also cautioned against exaggerated expectations of the
meetings and said the chances of success are 50-50.
</P>
<P>
Fresh threats to the unity of Barak's coalition also emerged as
regards the upcoming summit. Eli Yishai, leader of the ultra-
Orthodox Shas party has already turned down an offer to accompany
Barak to Camp David.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Supreme Court justices Thursday harshly criticized,
and expressed their amazement over, the cabinet's appointment of
Knesset (Parliament) Member Yossi Katz from the ruling One Israel
bloc as ambassador to Germany.
</P>
<P>
The Movement for Quality Government in Israel appealed against
the nomination and the court suggested domestic politics had played
a key role in the appointment, saying that it frees up a Knesset
seat for Foreign Minister David Levy's close associate Moti
Mishani.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- The current heatwave in Israel caused a tragedy on Thursday
when an 18-year-old American girl died from dehydration on a hiking
trip in a cave in the desert area in the southeast part of the
country.
</P>
<P>
The girl was with a group of 12 American and English tourists
who traveled to the cave by mini-bus from Jerusalem Thursday
morning and apparently did not bring enough water with them to the
desert, where temperature neared 40 degrees.
</P>
<P>
A police helicopter and rescue team located the victim's body
near the cave at about 2 p.m..
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- The case against Israeli former Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu and his wife is likely to be closed by Attorney General
Elyakim Rubinstein following a recommendation to that effect by
Jerusalem District Attorney Moshe Lador.
</P>
<P>
Lador submitted what officials described as a well-grounded
brief of about 200 pages explaining why he thinks the state would
find it difficult to get a conviction in court against the former
prime minister and his wife on the basis of the available evidence.
</P>
<P>
The police recommended last March that Netanyahu be indicted on
charges of bribe taking, fraud, breach of trust and obstructing
justice.

<HEADLINE> China Plays Significant Role in Asia: Indonesian Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 7 (Xinhua) -- A senior Indonesian official said
here Friday that China plays a significant role in maintaining the
political and security stability in the Asian region and hoped its
role will be maintained in the future.
</P>
<P>
"Yes, it is clear that China has played a significant role in
creating stability in the region. And we hope the role will be
maintained in the future," Indonesian Defense Minister Juwono
Sudarsono said in an exclusive interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"China and other big countries in the region such as India and
Japan also have to maintain their roles in creating stability in
Asia," he added.
</P>
<P>
Considering the Taiwan issue as an internal affair of the
Chinese government, Sudarsono hoped that it will be handled well.
</P>
<P>
"We leave such a matter to those who are concerned, namely the
Chinese government. We will not make any intervention in their
domestic affairs," he said, hoping that relationship between
Indonesia and China will be better and better in the future.
</P>
<P>
In connection with the Association of Southeast Asian Nation (
ASEAN), the minister hoped that China will be more active in
holding dialogues (with ASEAN members).
</P>
<P>
"And we want that China will also be more active in talks with
Indonesia through ASEAN," Sudarsono said, adding that the
relations between China and ASEAN members could also be
strengthened.
</P>
<P>
"Beside China, we also hope that Japan and India will join
hands to build what I call as an Asian identity based on the
dignity and cultural principles of Asian nations," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We also have to consider creating a joint preventive measures
strategy, involving China, Japan, India, Indonesia and other big
countries in the region (to prevent possible threats from outside
region)," he said.
</P>
<P>
"But we don't hope that Asia will be an exclusive region. Our
relations with Asian countries should be strengthened, but we also
have to maintain our relations with countries outside Asia, such
as the United States," Sudarsono added.

<HEADLINE> Britain to Support Kenya's Poverty Reduction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The British government plans to
provide 30 million pounds (about 58.6 million U.S. dollars) to
Kenya to help implement its poverty reduction strategy, media here
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to the British High Commission in Nairobi, the
support which will be made available during the current calendar
year will go a long way in helping Kenya implement its poverty
reduction strategy.
</P>
<P>
The money will assist in the civil service reform which is aimed
at improving the performance of the public sector in delivering
key services to the people, particularly the poor, the media said.
</P>
<P>
However, the British High Commission said here Thursday that
the availability of the funds depended on whether International
Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank boards approve new assistance
to Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The IMF board will meet on July 26 to discuss its planned new
assistance to Kenya, and the World Bank is expected to hold a
similar meeting.
</P>
<P>
A statement from the British High Commission disclosed that
Britain may make further support available later in the 2000/2001
Kenyan financial year depending on the progress in the
implementation of its economic reform and poverty reduction
program.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Asks for Effective Peacekeeping Mission at Border With Eritrea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia has demanded that the
United Nations peacekeeping mission to be deployed in the buffer
zone between Ethiopia and Eritrea be efficient and effective.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian Herald newspaper Friday quoted Foreign Minister
Seyoum Mesfin as saying that the U.N. peacekeeping mission should
be able to fully cover the security zone and monitor military
activities in both countries.
</P>
<P>
The mission should also strengthen its humanitarian affairs
section to deal effectively with the suffering of innocent
Ethiopians in Eritrea, he said, adding that a lasting solution to
Ethio-Eritrean conflict could be reached only if the suffering of
up to 25,000 Ethiopians in Eritrea is given a definitive end.
</P>
<P>
Seyoum made the remarks Thursday while conferring with the U.N.
 reconnaissance mission led by Major General Timothy Ford.
</P>
<P>
In response, Ford said that his team would report Ethiopia's
demands to the U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan, the newspaper
said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. peacekeeping mission will open a liaison office in
Addis Ababa, capital of Ethiopia, to undertake its mission
smoothly, according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
Since its arrival here Tuesday night, the five-member mission
has held talks with the Ethiopian government and military
officials. They are due to leave for Asmara, Eritrea on similar
mission this weekend.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Private Sector Loses 50,000 Jobs This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's private sector has lost
at least 50,000 jobs since the beginning of this year owing to a
deepening economic crisis, the weekly Business reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The situation will worsen if the pressing problems persist,
like fuel shortages, a staggering domestic and foreign debt, a
ballooning deficit, high inflation and interest rates, the paper
said.
</P>
<P>
President of the Employers Confederation of Zimbabwe Joshua
Nyoka told the weekly that the number of retrenchment was likely
to swell to 100,000 by the end of the year if the problems were
not resolved as a matter of urgency.
</P>
<P>
"Companies in the agriculture, shipping, fertilizer and other
sectors have been hit hard because of the managed exchange rate.
As a result, about 54,000 people who had been fully employed have
lost their jobs in the last six months," Nyoka said.
</P>
<P>
"We are also aware of companies that are now operating on a
three-day working week," he said.
</P>
<P>
General business optimism has plunged to an all time low in
eight years with the manufacturing sector being affected worst, he
said.

<HEADLINE> Traffic Accident Kills 27 in Spain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, July 7 (Xinhua) -- A truck ran into a bus near the
northern Spanish city of Soria Thursday, killing at least 27
people and injuring 13, police said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Police said the truck, loaded with pork, suddenly drove out of
its lane and knocked into the bus carrying 39 teenagers from the
opposite direction before the two vehicles fell into a ditch by
the road, killing 22 people on the spot. Five more people died in
hospital later.
</P>
<P>
Police said most of the victims were high school students aged
between 13 and 15. The two drivers were also killed.
</P>
<P>
The students reportedly came from Barcelona and were taking
their vacation in Soria.
</P>
<P>
The cause of the accident was not immediately known.
</P>
<P>
Authorities said the crash was one of the two worst accidents
in the last five years in Spain. In September 1999, 28 people were
killed when a bus on a regular run between Madrid and Gerona in
northwestern Spain overturned near Zaragoza.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Childhood Immunizations Reaches Record High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, July 6 (Xinhua) -- A record percentage of U.S.
preschool children have received recommended immunizations to
protect them from childhood diseases, but more needs to be done,
federal health officials said here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Immunization coverage has been rising steadily since 1993, but
about 20 percent of American toddlers remain vulnerable to
diseases because they are not fully immunized, the Atlanta-based
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDCP) said.
</P>
<P>
Among children aged 19 months to 35 months, 95.9 percent had
received the recommended three doses of the diphtheria, tetanus
and pertussis vaccine in 1999, and 93.5 percent had been
vaccinated for Haemophilus influenza type b (Hib).
</P>
<P>
The CDCP, basing its figures on a telephone survey of 33,548
households, estimated that 91.5 percent had received the vaccine
covering measles, mumps and rubella and 88.1 percent had received
the recommended three doses of hepatitis B vaccine.
</P>
<P>
Coverage levels for several vaccines increased from 1998 to
1999, the CDCP said, while coverage for poliovirus vaccine
remained relatively unchanged at 89.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
An increasing percentage of children have received the
chickenpox vaccine introduced in the mid-1990s. The chickenpox
vaccination rate rose to 59.4 percent in 1999, the CDCP said.
</P>
<P>
Deaths and illnesses from diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus,
measles, mumps, rubella and Hib are at or near record lows because
of the high vaccination levels, the CDCP said.
</P>
<P>
"Thanks in large part to these high immunization rates, we have
seen a breathtaking decline in suffering and death from most
vaccine-preventable diseases," Health and Human Services Secretary
Donna Shalala said in a statement.

In a letter to Clinton, the U.S. scientists warned that the
deployment of such a system would be "premature, wasteful, and
dangerous." They believed that the 60-billion-dollar system "would
offer little protection and would do grave harm to this nation's
core security interests. "They expressed concern that the U.S.
decision would spark arms race across the world. (US-NMD-Warning)

Pakistan and India cannot be achieved without addressing the core
issue of Kashmir on priority basis," he stated while addressing a
function at the National Defense College of Pakistan. "Kashmir is
a test case of the viability and credibility of the present
international order," he added. The president regretted that the
attitude of the Indian government has not been conducive to peace.
"Their leaders continue to make bellicose and provocative
statements to build up war hysteria," he said. (Pakistan-India-

JAKARTA -- Indonesian Defense Minister Juwono Sudarsono said
that supporters of former president Soeharto are fomenting unrest
to escape justice and destabilize the government.
</P>
<P>
"Based on our intelligence reports there are strong indications
that former cronies of Soeharto are supplying arms and personnel
to areas afflicted with conflicts, particularly in the Malukus,
East Timor, West Irian and certainly in Aceh," Sudarsono was
quoted by the Jakarta Post Friday as saying. He said that the
trouble makers were "a group of cronies who have managed to
abandon ship at the last minute. There are strong indications that
the cronies, not necessarily from the Cendana (the street where
Soeharto and his family live) family, are certainly involved in
some of the unrest and bombings in North Sumatra, part of East
Java and the Malukus," he said. But Sudarsono said it was "quite
difficult" to find the evidence as these people have been working
under the so-called "cell system." (Indonesia-Soeharto)

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Unhappy With Soccer Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, July 7 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Sport, Fitness and
Leisure Minister Trevor Mallard said here Friday that the New
Zealand government is "extremely unhappy and disappointed with
Charlie Dempsey's role in the demise of South Africa's World Cup
Soccer bid."
</P>
<P>
Germany and South Africa had been neck and neck with 11 votes
each and in the final and decisive third round at FIFA House in
Zurich, Switzerland Germany snatched a last-minute winner 12-11
because New Zealand's Dempsey, who was the Oceania member,
abstained from voting.
</P>
<P>
"I'm shocked that one individual seems to have abused his
voting right by disregarding instructions on voting requirements,"
Minister Mallard said in a government press release.
</P>
<P>
"As Oceania's representative, Mr. Dempsey was under instruction
to support the South African bid, once England had dropped out of
the ballot. The government was aware of those instructions and
fully supported them.
</P>
<P>
"Though his abandonment of his delegation, Mr. Dempsey has
damaged the international reputation of the entire country as well
as the sport of soccer in New Zealand. His actions could cast
doubt on New Zealand's reliability on the international stage,"
the minister said.
</P>
<P>
He added the World Cup finals have never been held in Africa
and he is distressed that New Zealand is associated with that
chance being blown.

<HEADLINE> Millions of Farmers Benefiting from Growing Mushrooms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Millions of Chinese farmers in
over 320 counties have escaped poverty thanks to their use of a
mushroom-growing technique over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
According to Wang Yuzhao, director of the China Poverty-Relief
Foundation, these farmers have created an output value totaling 10
billion yuan from growing mushrooms, making mushroom-growing a
pillar industry in the country's aid-the-poor project.
</P>
<P>
The technique, which was developed in the early 1990s by Lin
Zhanxi, a professor at Fujian Agricultural University, uses weeds
and straw in the cultivation process.
</P>
<P>
The method reduces production cost and saves forest resources
compared with traditional methods of mushroom-growing.
</P>
<P>
So far, the technique has been spread to 320 counties in 32
provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities.
</P>
<P>
According to the professor, China can increase mushroom output
by 40 million tons and output value by 224 billion yuan by using
one-third of the country's 400 million ha of grassland and five
percent of the country's 300 million tons of straw. This also can
provide job opportunities for 20 million people.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the professor said, the technique can also help
improve the ecological environment.

<HEADLINE> Cigarette Ads Blamed for Increase in Young Smokers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Cigarette advertisements are to
blame for the increasing number of young smokers in China, said an
official with the committee for smoking-control among youngsters
in Chongqing Municipality.
</P>
<P>
Fan Honglian said that teenagers are lured by the sexy
cigarette ads and start to smoke unaware of the fact that smoking
can cause disease.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that 70 percent of the 30 million Chongqing
residents are smokers, including a great number of young people.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Fei, a middle school student, said that "a man who is
smoking looks very cool." While Yang Tao, a girl student, said
smoking makes women attractive.
</P>
<P>
A professor with Chongqing University said this way of thinking
comes from movies and TV.
</P>
<P>
A survey released by the China Consumers Association earlier
this year shows that China has 322 million smokers, and by 2005,
the death toll from smoking will reach two million. The number of
young smokers is on the rise, said the association.
</P>
<P>
The local government invested 200,000 yuan to take down 320
cigarette billboard ads in the downtown area. It also issued a
regulation banning smoking in public places in 1998.

<HEADLINE> China to Add One Million On-Line Firms in One Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 7 (Xinhua) -- China will connect more than one
million enterprises with the Internet within one year, in an
effort to sharpen the competitive edge of these companies in the
global market.
</P>
<P>
Included will be one million small enterprises, 10,000 medium-
sized enterprises and 100 large firms, according to sources from a
national teleconference held today.
</P>
<P>
According to the grand plan mapped out by the Ministry of
Information Industry and the State Economic and Trade Commission (
SETC), the number of on-line enterprises will double annually in
the next three years.
</P>
<P>
This is the second step in China's three-step campaign to
accelerate information construction and enter the Internet society,
following a governmental on-line project, authorities noted. The
third step is to increase the number of families on-line.
</P>
<P>
The SETC officials said that by hooking up to the Internet,
enterprises can promote management, set up a modern enterprise
system, and become more competitive in the market.
</P>
<P>
To achieve the goal, China's telecommunication departments will
speed up the pace of basic network construction and multi-media
telecom networks, provide a safe, reliable and fast network
environment, and encourage enterprises to use e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
Quite a few famous domestic conglomerates, in the sectors of
oil, automobile, iron and steel, film, air-conditioners, and
aircraft manufacturing, will be the first on-line enterprises.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Slow in Transition to Online Business: Study </HEADLINE>

<P>
WELLINGTON, July 7 (Xinhua) -- A study released by ASB Bank
Friday said New Zealand has been slow to make the transition to
online business, and make economic gains from new technology and
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
The study said e-commerce has the potential to help New Zealand
overcome its two main disadvantages of geographic remoteness and
small size.
</P>
<P>
However it said few businesses in the country currently offer
online sales and purchasing.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand's economy is also still dependent on "old economy"
sectors such as agriculture, and the country is an importer rather
than a producer of high tech equipment, the study said.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand to Open Diplomatic Post in E. Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, July 7 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand has promised that it
will open a diplomatic post in East Timor, which will announce its
independence next year.
</P>
<P>
The promise was given by New Zealand Foreign Minister Phil Goff,
when he was meeting here Friday with visiting President of the
National Council of Timorese Resistance (CNRT) Xanana Gusmao, who
is expected to be East Timor's first president after general
elections late next year.
</P>
<P>
The diplomat, yet to be named, will be New Zealand's liaison
officer to the United Nations Transitional Administration in East
Timor (UNTAET) and he would liaise with both UNTAET and CNRT and
monitor New Zealand's assistance, including recruiting East
Timorese to come to New Zealand to study and train, Goff told
Gusmao.
</P>
<P>
But no decision has been made whether an embassy will be opened
once the territory becomes independent.
</P>
<P>
Goff said the New Zealand government seeks to strengthen its
relationship with the fledgling nation.
</P>
<P>
He said he expects to start scaling down the deployment of New
Zealand troops in East Timor later this year.
</P>
<P>
There are 660 New Zealand troops there at present.
</P>
<P>
Gusmao said East Timor is keen to have a close relationship
with New Zealand and he realizes the deployment of troops in East
Timor is a heavy burden for New Zealand, but they are essential to
maintaining security and stability.
</P>
<P>
He said East Timor is developing its own armed forces but he
hopes peacekeepers will remain in the country until "we have a
guarantee that nothing can happen."
</P>
<P>
One of the reasons for promoting reconciliation within East
Timor and with its neighbor Indonesia, despite its 25-year
occupation, is to ensure stability of the territory, Gusmao said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Crews Still Battle Wildfires in Colorado, Wyoming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Frustrated by strong wind gusts,
high temperatures and bone-dry land, firefighters have made little
headway in containing three wildfires burning in remote areas of
western Colorado, and two more in Wyoming, local officials
reported late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
No injuries have been reported and no structures have been
damaged by the Colorado blazes, which are confined primarily to
public lands, according to federal fire officials in Grand
Junction.
</P>
<P>
The Buster Flats fire, the largest of the Colorado wildfires,
has burned at least 9,500 acres of land in the northwest corner of
the state, 30 kilometers from the border with Wyoming. No
structures have been directly threatened, but authorities
evacuated the nearby Gates of Ladore and Brown's National Wildlife
Refuge campgrounds as a precaution.
</P>
<P>
"There was a period in the afternoon where we had to pull the
crews off because of the wind, and the fire made some strong runs
downhill," according to fire information officer Dennis Saville.
</P>
<P>
The fire is naturally contained by the Green River on the north
and east, and firefighters have contained another 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
Another 800 acres have been consumed by a second fire in
northwest Colorado, while the third fire is burning to the south,
near the town of Gateway. Approximately 3,000 acres have burned
since Monday. The fire has quadrupled in size since it was first
detected.
</P>
<P>
"We were real dry and it's not good to have wind behind the
fire," said Bill Kight, a spokesman for the fire center. He said
that winds gusts have reached 50 kph. Officials are using air
tankers, helicopters and land crews to battle the blazes, which
threaten three homes and several historical mining-camp structures.
</P>
<P>
"We're praying for rain," he said. No rain, however, is
forecast for the area for the next few days.
</P>
<P>
In Wyoming, two wildfires had scorched about 22,500 acres of
juniper and sagebrush. No structures were threatened but one
firefighter was treated for heat stroke, officials said.
</P>
<P>
The fire season is shaping up as the worst since 1996,
according to the National Interagency Fire Center in Idaho. It
began more than a month ago with blazes engulfing areas of Florida
and the Southwest, most notably in Los Alamos, New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
About 44,300 fires covering more than 1.2 million acres have
been recorded nationwide so far, with drought getting worse in the
West.

<HEADLINE> Study: U.S. Men Have Worse Health Habits Than Women </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, July 6 (Xinhua) -- A new study released Thursday
shows that U.S. men are more likely to be smokers, drinkers or
overweight than women, and less likely to have health insurance or
wear seat belts.
</P>
<P>
The differences between men and women were detailed by the
Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDCP),
using statistics from telephone surveys of tens of thousands of
adults in 1996 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
The CDCP said that 62.2 percent of men and 44.5 percent of
women said they were overweight in 1997. Experts said being
overweight increased the risk of chronic health problems such as
high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease and some cancers.
</P>
<P>
Researchers said 25.3 percent of men were smokers, compared
with 21.1 percent of women. The CDCP noted that cigarette smoking

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Modernize its Military </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Defense Minister Juwono
Sudarsono said here Friday that Indonesia will modernize its
military equipment to adjust to new developments in the region and
deal with any possible threats from outside.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua at his office, the
minister said that Indonesia plans to purchase weapons, ammunition
and other military equipment including warships and submarines
from foreign countries to meet the need of its military equipment.
Indonesia also wanted to purchase weapon from China, he added.
</P>
<P>
"Now, we have been calculating accurately, what we need. What
kind of weapons may we need now and in the future," the minister
said.
</P>
<P>
The modernization of the Indonesian Military's (TNI) weaponry
system is in line with our policy in reforming our national
defense system, he said.
</P>
<P>
"But, now we are still facing obstacles due to economic crisis
and lack of fund. So if you ask me how long the modernization
process (in our military) will be, I would say it takes around 5-
10 years," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sudarsono also disclosed that the number of TNI is currently
very limited compared to the number of the country's inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
"Now, the number of the Indonesian Army is just around 230,000,
The Navy 40,000 and the Air Force is between 20,000 and 25,000,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"Ideally, the number of our military personnel should be two
and a half fold of the current figure. But may be it will take 5
to 7 years to reach such an ideal figure," he said.
</P>
<P>
"And the success of our program will depend on the country's
economic condition. If our economic could recover soon, our
program will be fast or could be accelerated," the minister
stressed.
</P>
<P>
Sudarsono also said that the TNI now has been launching an
internal reforms and," in connection with such an internal reforms
we will change our doctrines and defense concepts in line with our
constitution. We hope that sometime, in due course, the TNI will
become a professional and respected institution."

<HEADLINE> Study: Healthy Lifestyle Cuts Heart Risk by 80 Percent for Women </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, July 6 (Xinhua) -- A study released Thursday shows
that eating right, exercising and not smoking can reduce the risk
of heart disease by 80 percent for women.
</P>
<P>
"I was surprised the magnitude was so large -- over 80 percent
reduction in risk," said study leader Dr. Meir Stampfer of Harvard
University.
</P>
<P>
The results are published in this week's New England Journal of
Medicine.
</P>
<P>
Stampfer and other researchers at Harvard tracked the
lifestyles of 84,129 women nurses during 14 years and measured
their susceptibility to heart disease -- the number-one killer of
adult Americans.
</P>
<P>
The women with the lowest risk for heart disease didn't smoke,
ate a healthy diet, exercised at least 30 minutes a day,
maintained a good weight and consumed no alcohol or drank in
moderation (two glasses of wine per day, for example), reported
the researchers.
</P>
<P>
Those results reaffirm what doctors have long believed. "The
vast majority of heart disease could be eliminated if everyone
adopted a healthy lifestyle," Dr. Stampfer said.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Nanette Wenger, Emory University School of Medicine,
Atlanta, said the study's results are what "most of us who believe
so strongly in prevention would want to see -- the fact that women
who do very simple lifestyle interventions get benefits."

<HEADLINE> Clinton Warned on Missile Defense Plan by Nobel Laureates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton was
Thursday warned by 50 Nobel laureates on the proposed National
Missile Defense (NMD) shield.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Clinton, the U.S. scientists warned that the
deployment of such a system would be "premature, wasteful, and
dangerous."
</P>
<P>
They believed that the 60-billion-dollar system "would offer
little protection and would do grave harm to this nation's core
security interests."
</P>
<P>
They expressed concern that the U.S. decision would spark arms
race across the world.
</P>
<P>
France on Thursday also warned Washington of the dangerous
consequences from the deployment of the NMD.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the United States does not make the decision
without measuring the consequences for their European allies and
the reactions of China and Russia," said French Foreign Minister
Hubert Vedrine.
</P>
<P>
He said that the NMD risks provoking negative and dangerous
reactions from certain countries in the world.
</P>
<P>
"The reaction of France and other member countries of the
European Union (EU) will depend on that of Russia," he told
representatives of parliament members of the EU countries and
those of 12 candidates for EU membership who met in Paris.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine said that France and other EU members will give a
strong response if the U.S. unilaterally launches the NMD without
obtaining the agreement of Russia.
</P>
<P>
The new warnings came as the Pentagon plans to launch a third
test for the NMD on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Clinton has received many similar warnings before.
</P>
<P>
On June 29, a group of 45 U.S. China experts wrote to him,
warning that the deployment of the NMD would make U.S.-China
relations difficult.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, 35 U.S. scientists and engineers went to the
Capitol Hill to persuade Congress into rejecting the plan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, former high-ranking U.S. government officials,
including former secretary of state Henry Kissinger, former
presidential security advisors Zbigniew Brezezinki and Robert
McFarlane, as well as former defense secretaries William Perry and
Harold Brown, have asked Clinton to put off the decision.

COLOMBO, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government has
launched a major project funded by the Asian Development Bank to
provide drinking water and sanitary facilities to over one million
residents in the country, the official Daily News reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Lal Premnath, senior official with the National Water Service

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Set to Boost Oil Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's state oil company
Pertamina said it planned to boost oil production through the
development of marginal fields and by encouraging exploration in
deep water.
</P>
<P>
"There are many marginal fields that can boost oil production.
However, the government has to give incentives for the development
of those fields," the Indonesian Observer daily Friday quoted
Pertamina Exploration Director Gatot Wiroyudo as saying.
</P>
<P>
Wiroyudo said marginal fields had previously not been
considered commercially viable because of inefficiencies and poor
technology.
</P>
<P>
"We find that there are areas for efficiencies in exploration,
for example, there are cheaper oil platforms for offshore
activities. We also find that one well can be drilled for only 1.5
million U.S. dollars, compared with 5 million U.S. dollars before,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
"With those efficiencies and technology, marginal fields with
reserves of 10 million barrels of oil can be produced with an
average of around 8,000 bpd (barrels per day). That can be
commercial and we believe can help Indonesia boost oil production
in the future," he added.
</P>
<P>
Wiroyudo said there were about 40 potential marginal fields in
Indonesia, Asia's only member of OPEC. From those marginal fields
he predicted around 320,000 bpd could be pumped.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia produced 1.3 million bpd of crude oil and 150,000 bpd
of condensate in June, below its OPEC quota of 1.317 million bpd,
oil industry sources said.
</P>
<P>
However, Wiroyudo gave no timeframe for when the marginal
fields could begin production at the level of 320,000 bpd.

</P>
<P>
The government has purchased 24,750 tons of cotton in the year,
Nyunt Tin told a meeting here Thursday on extending cultivation of
industrial crops.
</P>
<P>
As there was adequate rain in June this year, the beginning of
the rainy season, the prospects of cotton cultivation look bright,
he added.
</P>
<P>
He called for placing emphasis on cultivation of cotton in
Mandalay, Sagaing and Magway divisions, the three central arid
zones in the country.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, Myanmar produced 4,765 tons
of cotton yarn and 17,823,000 meters of cotton fabrics in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, to maintain the enthusiasm of cotton growers and
relieve the shortage in investment capital, the government not
only provides more than one billion kyats (3 million U.S. dollars)
of loans to the cotton growers in the country annually, but also
grants advance payment for the purchase of cotton.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar's locally-produced cotton fabrics are reportedly not
enough to meet the demand. It has to import from China, India,
Thailand and South Korea.

<HEADLINE> Safety of Foreigners Is Guaranteed in Laos: Deputy FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The Lao government has said that
the safety of foreigners is guaranteed in the country despite
several incidents happened recently, according to reports reaching
here Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The government has ordered the police in Vientiane and other
places of the country strengthen security measures to protect
foreign embassies and international organizations," Lao Deputy
Foreign Minister Pongsavath Boupa was quoted by a diplomatic
source in Vientiane, the Lao capital, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the foreign diplomats and representatives of
international organizations at a special meeting held in Vientiane
Thursday, Pongsavath denounced the rumors about big explosions and
large number of casualties occurred in the capital city as "
groundless".
</P>
<P>
"During the last few months, there are certain incidents of
explosions happened in Vientiane, leaving several injuries and
deaths, but they are all not very serious," he stated.
</P>
<P>
Describing those explosions as terrorist acts masterminded by
some anti-government activists to harm the stability and image of
the country, he said those incidents can not prevent foreigners to
see sights or do business in the country.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the e-mails of threats sent to the foreign
embassies and international organization delegates recently, the
official said those e-mails are "swashbuckling" and told foreign
delegates not to take them too seriously.
</P>
<P>
He promised that those kinds of threats will not happened any
more.
</P>
<P>
When asked about how the Lao government to deal with those
rebels who flu into Thailand and detained by Thai authority after
a clash at a Lao-Thai border check point, Pongsavath said the
government is now negotiating with Thai government and asking for
the extradition of those people.
</P>
<P>
The Lao detainees were among over 100 Lao rebels who on Monday
seized a Lao customs checkpoint across Sirindhorn district of Thai
border province of Ubon Rachathani, 629 kilometers northeast of
Bangkok, and clashed with Lao government troops, leading to
reportedly five dead and several injured.
</P>
<P>
The rebels was finally defeated by Lao government troops and
dispersed.
</P>
<P>
Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai had reaffirmed that the
government will not allow any armed groups to use the country for
activities against the Lao government.
</P>
<P>
The extradition of those people are now in negotiation.

<HEADLINE> Soeharto's Supporters Accused to Foment Unrest in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Defense Minister Juwono
Sudarsono said that supporters of former president Soeharto are
fomenting unrest to escape justice and destabilize the government.
</P>
<P>
"Based on our intelligence reports there are strong indications
that former cronies of Soeharto are supplying arms and personnel
to areas afflicted with conflicts, particularly in the Malukus,
East Timor, West Irian and certainly in Aceh," Sudarsono was
quoted by the Jakarta Post Friday as saying.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that the trouble makers were "a group of
cronies who have managed to abandon ship at the last minute. There
are strong indications that the cronies, not necessarily from the
Cendana (the street where Soeharto and his family live) family,
are certainly involved in some of the unrest and bombings in North
Sumatra, part of East Java and the Malukus," he said.
</P>
<P>
But Sudarsono said it was "quite difficult" to find the
evidence as these people have been working under the so-called "
cell system".
</P>
<P>
"They drop money to people with no written instructions and it'
s very difficult to find legal evidence fomenting unrest in the
regions and in other parts of the country," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
He, however, believes that the police and military intelligence
will "in time" be able to have adequate legal evidence to bring to
trial "at least the public figures and then hopefully we will get
the agitators in Jakarta".
</P>
<P>
His statement, a repeat of his previous allegations of the role
of Soeharto's supporters, came just a couple of days after a
building in the Attorney General's Office compound in Jakarta was
damaged by a bomb blast.
</P>
<P>
The incident took place on Tuesday shortly after the youngest
son of Soeharto, Hutomo "Tommy" Mandala Putra, left the building
after being questioned in connection with his father's alleged
corruption. Another package of explosives was found less than 24
hours after Tuesday's bomb.
</P>
<P>
As the probe into the terrorist bombs in the Attorney General's
Office continue, National Police Chief Gen. Rusdihardjo did not
dismiss the possibility that the incident had much to do with
investigations into corruption, collusion and nepotism practices (
KKN) being conducted by state prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
"The explosive device was planted on the floor where all
documents related to KKN cases are kept," he said, adding that the
explosive device could have destroyed the Attorney General's
Office building.
</P>
<P>
Rusdihardjo said the police would soon summon for questioning
several bodyguards who accompanied Tommy. "There were more than
the normal number of bodyguards," he added.
</P>
<P>
The 79-year-old Soeharto is under house arrest and Attorney
General Marzuki Darusman said he expects to bring a corruption
case against the former ruler by August.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto was pushed from power in May 1998 amid mass social
unrest and economic chaos.

<HEADLINE> Riot Spreads to Waai in Maluku, Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Renewed communal clashes spread on
Thursday to Waai village in Ambon, capital of Indonesia's Maluku
province, prompting hundreds of residents to flee to nearby
forests.
</P>
<P>
The Antara News Agency reported on Friday that the large scale
attacks were launched by Liang and Tulehu villagers arms with hand
guns, mortars, hand grenades, rifles and petroleum bombs.
</P>
<P>
The Waai villagers appeared to be virtually helpless in facing
the attackers, and many children and women abandoned their
villages and fled to nearby forests. Others had to walk great
distances to reach the villages of Passo and Wayari for help and
refuge.
</P>
<P>
The assailants were reported to have set fire on hundreds of
houses, school buildings and some houses of prayer in Waai village
which is only 28 kilometers from Ambon.
</P>
<P>
No details on casualties and material loss were immediately
available.
</P>
<P>
The death toll rose to 71 since communal violence returned in
Ambon on June 21. Hundreds have been injured during the period.
</P>
<P>
In Central Sulawesi, Wirabuana Military Commander Maj. Gen.
Slamet Kirbiantoro overseeing Sulawesi said that a total of 211
people had been confirmed dead as a result of the recent clashes
in Poso town.
</P>
<P>
He added the death toll in the violence was expected to rise as
the peacekeeping task force set up by the military command was
continuing to search for more bodies.
</P>
<P>
The latest round of communal violence in Poso broke out on May
23 and ended on June 4. It followed unrest on April 17 that
claimed two lives.
</P>
<P>
The Jakarta Post quoted observers as saying that the Poso
communal clashes are connected with the prolonged violence in
Maluku and North Maluku, where more than 3,000 people have been
killed since the conflict erupted in January last year.

<HEADLINE> Hotels Profit From "Exam Economy" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Hotels across the country are
providing havens for students taking part in the college entrance
examinations which began today, today's "China Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
Demand for a good environment in which students could study for
these important exams has led many of China's top hotels in big
cities such as Beijing, Shanghai and Chengdu, to offer more
special rooms at discounted prices for students in recent years.
</P>
<P>
"Parents are willing to do everything for their children to
help them get good marks in the upcoming examination, which is
going to determine their fate," said Huang Biao, an official with
the sales department of the Fragrant Hills Hotel in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Since 1998, some hotels in Beijing have been making special
rooms available to students who are about to take part in the
examinations, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
This year in Beijing, six star hotels are providing such rooms
with prices from 200-300 yuan (24.2-36.3 U.S. dollars) per day.

</P>
<P>
"The listing debut of our property insurance arm could happen

<HEADLINE> Fiji's Military seeks Help from Tribal Chiefs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Fiji's military would seek the
help of provincial tribal chiefs to negotiate the release of
ethnic Indian former prime minister Mahendra Chaudhry.
</P>
<P>
According to the Australian Associated Press, a delegation led
by the high chiefs from Naitasiri province met Fiji's military
leader, Commodore Frank Bainimarama, late Thursday last night at a
barracks near the capital Suva.
</P>
<P>
A local radio in Fiji reported Thursday the military had
accepted a whale's tooth, a traditional peace offering, from the
chiefs. Military spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Filipo Tarakinikini
told the radio that Naitasiri leaders would mediate in talks later
in the day between Speight and Bainimarama.
</P>
<P>
The toppled ethnic Indian prime minister Chaudhry and other 26
officials have been held hostage for six weeks by an armed band
headed by George Speight.
</P>
<P>
The military has until now resisted allowing any direct
intervention by members of the influential Great Council of Chiefs
in negotiations with Speight. The number of the original hostages
was more than 40.
</P>
<P>
Social unrest have escalated around the country in the last
week. Landowners from Naitasiri province are demanding protection
of indigenous rights and around 300 of them staged a demonstration
in the capital city of Suva, rejecting an interim indigenous
civilian government sworn in by the military on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Suva and surrounding areas were plunged into darkness late
Thursday night and the international telephone service was
disrupted after the main hydro-electric plant was allegedly
sabotaged by landowners in the rural province of Monasavu. Much of
the country was getting its electricity from diesel generators
Friday.
</P>
<P>
On Fiji's second largest island, Vanua Levu, about 100
landowners have occupied the Labasa military camp, and the nearby
airport was closed by protesters for two hours Thursday.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Describing Kashmir as a "nuclear
flash point", Pakistani President Rafiq Tarar Thursday called on
the international community to persuade India to enter into
meaningful dialogue with Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
"The world has now come to realize that durable peace between
Pakistan and India cannot be achieved without addressing the core
issue of Kashmir on priority basis," he stated while addressing a
function at the National Defense College of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
"Kashmir is a test case of the viability and credibility of the
present international order," he added.
</P>
<P>
The president regretted that the attitude of the Indian
government has not been conducive to peace. "Their leaders
continue to make bellicose and provocative statements to build up
war hysteria," he said.
</P>
<P>
As a tangible sign of its belligerent posture, he said, New
Delhi announced a 28 percent increase in its defense budget and
this "additional allocation is larger than the entire defense
budget of Pakistan".
</P>
<P>
Tarar regretted that the subcontinent has seen "heightening of
tensions between Pakistan and India" for the past decade due to "
the struggle of the people of Kashmir for their right of self-
determination, as promised by the world community through U.N.
resolutions" .
</P>
<P>
Pakistan is committed to render moral, political and diplomatic
support to the cause of Kashmiris, he reiterated.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav Assembly Approves Constitutional Amendments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, July 6 (Xinhua) -- The Yugoslav Federal Assembly on
Thursday approved major constitutional amendments concerning the
election and re-election of the president.
</P>
<P>
Under the amendments, the Yugoslav president will be directly
elected by the public, instead of by the Federal Assembly, and can
hold two terms of office.
</P>
<P>
Under the current constitution, the president's tenure is an
unrenewable four-year term.
</P>
<P>
Observers believe that the amendments have paved the way for
President Slobodan Milosevic's re-election after his current term
of office expires in 2001.
</P>
<P>
The amendments were endorsed by both chambers of parliament --
the Chamber of Citizens and the Chamber of Republics.

<HEADLINE> 72nd Ordinary Session of Council of Ministers Opens in Lome </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOME, July 6 (Xinhua) -- The 72nd Ordinary Session of the
Council of Ministers was opened here Thursday afternoon with its
major topics focusing on the present situation in Africa and the
issues of peace and development that the African countries are
confronted with.
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministers of member states of the Organization of the
African Unity (OAU) and representatives of some regional and
international organizations attended the session.
</P>
<P>
After opening the session by Thomasmtsoahae Thabane, chairman
of the previous Council of Ministers and foreign minister of
Lesotho, Dr. Salim Ahmed Salim, secretary-general of the OAU, said
this session of council is taking place "amidst difficult
circumstances and profound challenges for our Continent and our
peoples as well as for the OAU Itself."
</P>
<P>
While mentioning the phenomenon of protracted and recurrent
conflicts, poverty and natural disasters that continue to menace
the African people, Salim stressed the necessity of strengthening
and reinvigorating the unity, cohesion and solidarity in Africa.
</P>
<P>
He said "the call for the creation of the African Union and the
 acceleration of the implementation of the Abuja Treaty, including
the establishment of the African Parliament stand out in
importance and urgency. "
</P>
<P>
Consequently, he said, one of the most important tasks before
this council is the consideration of recommendations emerging from
the ministerial meeting which was held in Tripoli and which was
preceded by meetings of Legal Experts and Parliamentarians.
</P>
<P>
"I am confident that the council will consider these
recommendations, address some of the outstanding issues, such as
requirements of the transitional period between the existing OAU
Charter and entry into force of the Constitutive Act of the
African Union," he added.
</P>
<P>
Consideration of these questions and others in the
participants' deliberations on this vital subject will lead the
council to forward recommendations to the African heads of state
and government who will attend the 36th annual OAU summit to be
held in the Togolese capital of Lome from July 10 to 12.
</P>
<P>
Togolese Prime Minister Eugene Koffi Adoboli, Deputy Executive
Secretary of the United Nations Economic Committee of Africa
(UNECA) Lalla Ben Barka also delivered speeches at the opening
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The session elected Togolese Foreign Minister Kokou Toseph
Koffigoh as Chairman of the current Council of Ministers.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the African Continent is facing all kinds of
challenges, Koffigoh urged every African country to fully mobilize
its people to contribute to economic development, peace and
stability.
</P>
<P>
During the three-day session, foreign ministers of the OAU
member states will examine Salim's report on the situation in
Africa and major tasks that the OAU is facing, and make full
preparations for the forthcoming OAU summit.

<HEADLINE> World Cup Vote Hit by 'Bribe' Claims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 6 (Xinhua) -- FIFA's decision to award Germany the
2006 World Cup has been hit by revelations that delegates received
letters offering cash gifts in exchange for votes.
</P>
<P>
Jack Warner, the Trinidad representative on FIFA's executive
committee, confirmed to BBC News 24 that he and several of his
colleagues woke up on Thursday morning to
find letters pushed under the doors of their hotel rooms in Zurich.
</P>
<P>
He revealed the letters claimed to be from someone supporting
the German campaign and offered a cash gift in return for their
support in the crucial vote.
</P>
<P>
Warner said he and the other delegates believed the letter to
be a hoax, but added that the matter was discussed ahead of the
final ballot and that FIFA president Sepp Blatter was upset and
very angry at the news.
</P>
<P>
The revelations will cast doubt on the process which saw
Germany pip South Africa by one vote for the right to host the
prestigious tournament, and are likely to prompt an investigation.
</P>
<P>
Attention may also focus on the New Zealand delegate Charles
Dempsey, whose abstention from the final round of voting handed
the Germans victory.
</P>
<P>
It has also been revealed that South Africa's campaign leader
Danny Jordaan had been told to return to Zurich in the light of
the revelations.

<HEADLINE> French League Elects New Chairman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 6 (Xinhua) -- France's national soccer league (LNF)
voted a new chairman on Thursday in a close contest fought out
over the fate of income from lucrative television rights.
</P>
<P>
Gerard Bourgoin, former vice-president of first division AJ
Auxerre, edged Noel Le Graet by 45 votes to 43 in an election by
the LNF's 92-member board. Two ballots were blank and two were
spoiled.
</P>
<P>
Le Graet, who had been seeking a third four-year term, favors
an equitable share-out among clubs of the revenue from the sale of
rights to televise French soccer.
</P>
<P>
Bourgoin wants more money to go to bigger clubs on the grounds
that the income would help elite sides keep their best players in
France.
</P>
<P>
He had the support of the presidents of top clubs Lyon, Lens
and champions Monaco.

<HEADLINE> Japanese War Coin Found in Central China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, July 7 (Xinhua) -- A Japanese commemorative coin
during the invasion of China has been found in central China's
Hunan Province.
</P>
<P>
The silver-plated copper coin, weighing 88.5 g and 55 mm in
diameter, features an armed Japanese soldier carrying a submachine
gun and stepping on the Great Wall. A dead Chinese soldier lies at
his feet.
</P>
<P>
The opposite side of the coin carries a picture of a Japanese
fighter plane flying over the Great Wall, alongside which there is
a North China map with clear inscriptions indicating the location
of major cities, such as Beijing, Tianjin, Zhangjiakou and Datong.
</P>
<P>
Xiao Dongliang, a historian at the Hunan Provincial Academy of
Social Sciences, said that the coin was issued in 1937 to mark the
Japanese invasion of China.
</P>
<P>
On July 7, 1937, the Japanese invaders attacked Lugou Bridge,
known as the Marco Polo Bridge, southwest of Beijing. This marked
the beginning of Japan's all-out invasion of China. It was not
until 1945 that the Japanese invaders surrendered and made retreat
from China.
</P>
<P>
"The coin was awarded to Japanese soldiers drafted into the war,
" said Xiao. "It indicates that the then Japanese militarist
government attached great importance to the Marco Polo Bridge
incident."
</P>
<P>
He said the commemorative coin clearly reveals the Japanese
militarists' wild ambition of occupying Chinese territory.
</P>
<P>
The coin is in the private collection of Kang Jufeng, director
of the Changsha Coin Association, in this provincial capital of
Hunan.
</P>
<P>
Similar coins have been found in northeast China's Liaoning
Province.

<HEADLINE> U.N. to Set up Task Force for Global IT Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The three-day U.N. Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) meeting
has discussed development and international cooperation in the
21st century and the role of IT in the context of a knowledge-
based global economy.
</P>
<P>
Conference participants noted that the emerging new economy
still remains concentrated in the developed countries, and unless
access to IT is broadened, the majority of people particularly in
the developing nations will not enjoy the benefits of the
knowledge-based economy.
</P>
<P>
To bridge the "digital divide", the international community
should address the major impediments to the participation of the
majority of the people in the IT revolution such as lack of
infrastructure, education, capacity building, investment and
connectivity, the declaration said.
</P>
<P>
U.N. figures show that the fifth of the world's people living
in the highest income countries have 86% of world's GDP and 93% of
internet users, while the bottom fifth have only 1% of GDP and 0.2%
of internet users.
</P>
<P>
Delegates emphasized the importance of broader involvement of
governments, multilateral agencies and bilateral donors in the
process as market forces alone cannot cope with the task.
</P>
<P>
Efforts for transfer of technology to developing countries on
concessional and preferential terms are encouraged.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. and its agencies are asked to play a key role in
promoting synergy and coherence of all efforts to expand the
development impact of IT.
</P>
<P>
ECOSOC's working group is expected to make recommendations to
the U.N. Millennium Assembly in September and the mid-July summit
of the Group of 8 countries to be held in Okinawa, Japan and to
focus on IT issues, according to ECOSOC President, Indonesia's
Makarim Wibisono.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Calls for Saving Hard Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Cuban authorities Friday called
again on people to reduce the spending of hard currency because of
the high prices of oil in the international market.
</P>
<P>
Finances and Prices Minister Manuel Millares made this call
when he toured the western province of Matanzas, some 100
kilometers east of Havana.
</P>
<P>
Although the extraction of crude grows gradually in the island,
it is not enough to supply the needs of the country, which depends
on the import of hydrocarbons and byproducts.
</P>
<P>
Cuban crude is used as fuel to generate 70 percent of the
electricity demand of the island.
</P>
<P>
Economy and Planning Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez explained in
a recent meeting with the presidents of the provincial governments
that the price of a Brent crude barrel goes from 28 to 30 U.S.
dollars, well above the 21 to 22 dollars foreseen by the island
finance authorities.

<HEADLINE> Russia Hails Good Prospects for Resumption of Syrian-Israeli Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Russia said Friday that it is
optimistic about the prospects for the resumption of the peace
talks between Syria and Israel, but "does not seek to synchronize
the progress of the Middle East settlement in all directions."
</P>
<P>
"Every track of the Middle East settlement has its special
problems, and therefore it is important that movement forward be
maintained in principle and concrete results be reached, even if
the paces of the progress are different on different tracks,"
Russian presidential envoy for the Middle East peace, deputy
Foreign Minister Vasily Sredin told the press here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The sooner breakthrough is achieved, both in the Syrian and
Palestinian directions, the sooner a just and stable peace will be
settled in the Middle East, Sredin stated.
</P>
<P>
Moscow believes that "the possibility of the resumption of
Syrian-Israeli negotiations and progress on this track still
remains,"because the parties "have already managed to find common
ground on many problems of settlement," he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged the parties to resolve the rest issues on the
principle of"full peace for full withdrawal", including returning
all the Golan Heights to Syria, working out proper security
measures and setting up normal peaceful relations between the two
states.
</P>
<P>
He expressed conviction that the new Syrian leadership headed
by Bashar al- Assad will remain devoted to the course towards
achieving a just peace with Israel."
</P>
<P>
Russia, "as a co-sponsor of the Middle East peace progress,
will do its best to attain this historic goal," the diplomat
stressed.

billion dollars in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The source said that tourism contributes a total of 100 million
dollars a year to tax revenue from general taxes and from
consuming.
</P>
<P>
Tourism creates jobs, said Promperu. The sector employs 350,000
people, about 4.9 percent of the economically active population,
and 13 percent of the total jobs generated by the services sector.
</P>
<P>
The Peruvian government plans foresee to surpass this year one
million tourists received, after last year's figure of 900,000
foreign visitors.
</P>
<P>
The government goal for 2005 is to receive 2.5 million tourists.

<HEADLINE> Gore Focuses Presidential Campaign on Women </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 7 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Vice President Al Gore
focused his presidential campaign on women Friday by pushing his
agenda for health care reform.
</P>
<P>
In a speech in Pennsylvania, Gore said that he would fight drug-
patent extensions that would be "bad medicine for the American
people," especially women.
</P>
<P>
Gore is wrapping up the fourth and final week of his"prosperity
and progress tour", which is aimed at claiming credit for the
nation's robust economy and also seeking to reshape the campaign
debate into a discussion of how to spend the projected budget
surplus.
</P>
<P>
The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee criticized
Republicans in Congress for forming league with drug companies in
pushing patent protections for drugs that cost consumers billions.
</P>
<P>
He contended that women are the biggest victims of "price
gouging and profiteering" by the drug industry.
</P>
<P>
Gore said that women pay more for prescription drugs, live
longer and earn less than men, and have higher overall health
costs, making them the biggest winner under his proposal to
bolster Medicare.
</P>
<P>
"Women's health care often costs as much or more than men's,
even though women have fewer dollars to spend on it," he said.
</P>
<P>
"As president, I'll lead the fight to stop these unfair patent
extensions," said Gore.

<HEADLINE> Mexico Destroys 21 Tons of Marihuana </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Over 21 tons of marihuana
plants cultivated in several points of Mexico's western state of
Michoacan were destroyed during the first six months of this year,
said the State Attorney Office (PGJE) on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Eighteen firearms, 13 of them long and five short, as well as
270 rounds of ammunition of different calibers, 18 kilos of
marihuana seeds were seized, and 44 persons were detained, said
the PGJE in a communique.
</P>
<P>
Ministerial agents and officials of the Experts Services
Direction took part in those operations, with the assistance of
helicopters of the PGJE, which made easier the finding of the
cultives and the places where the drug was processed.
</P>
<P>
The PGJE said that most of the seizures were made in small
communities of Morelia, Apatzingan, Lazaro Cardenas, Uruapan,
Zamora, and Zitacuaro, where the marihuana plants reached a height
of three meters.
</P>
<P>
Racks to dry the plants and installations to package the drug
with presses and other instruments were found in some places,
added the PGJE.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks Rise on More Signs of Slowing Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stock ended higher
Friday as a government report raised hope that the slowing U.S.
economy will prompt the Federal Reserve to end the year-long
cycle of interest rate hikes.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 154.51 at 10,635.98
and the technology heavy Nasdaq composite index rose 62.63 at 4,
023.20.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor'
s 500 index rose 22.23 at 1,478.90.
</P>
<P>
The market rallied after the U.S. Labor Department reported
that private employers added 206,000 in June but the addition of
jobs was offset by the departure of 190,000 temporary workers from
the census. Therefore, total payrolls in the month increased by
only 11,000.
</P>
<P>
The employment report convinced investors that the Federal
Reserve was succeeding in slowing the U.S. economy and the current
monetary tightening cycle is nearly over.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve has raised interest rates six times in the
past year in an effort to prevent the economy from overheating and
keep inflation at bay.
</P>
<P>
The lower-than-expected job increase drove the financial and
retail sectors higher. The financial companies including Chase
Manhattan and BankAmerica rose while retailers such as Home Depot
and Wal-Mart were also up.
</P>
<P>
On the tech sector, Texas Instruments and Gateway rose but
Qualcomm and Yahoo fell.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index rose 8.61 at 654.36 and the American Stock
Exchange index rose 8.60 at 936.48. The Russell 2000 index of
smaller companies rose 4.90 at 528.22.

LONDON, July 8 (Xinhua) -- A British newspaper said on Friday
that Britain is set to take back nuclear fuel from Japan, months

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: A Summit to Make Hard Decisions (by Yan Feng) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Early next week at Camp David,
Maryland, President Bill Clinton will sit down with Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to make
hard decisions necessary for a final peace settlement.
</P>
<P>
The high-stakes summit, though long-anticipated, is by no means
a well-prepared rendezvous.
</P>
<P>
As Barak and Arafat accepted the invitations extended by
Clinton on Wednesday, the two sides remains wide apart on all
major final status issues, including the status of Jerusalem,
borders, the future of Jewish settlers and the fate of Palestinian
refugees.
</P>
<P>
In their communications with Clinton last weekend, neither
Barak nor Arafat were committed to make or face historic
concessions if a summit is convened. All they have agreed is that
it is up to Clinton to decide if or when there should be a summit.
</P>
<P>
When Israeli and Palestinian negotiators opened their third
round of final status talks in Washington on June 13, the White
House had wished that the talks could pave the way for a three-way
summit to hammer out details of a framework agreement pending the
September 13 deadline for a final peace settlement.
</P>
<P>
The week-long negotiations, however, ended in a deadlock.
During her trip to the Middle East in late June, the third in the
month, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright made fresh efforts
aiming to narrow the differences between the Israelis and
Palestinians and tried to sell the idea of a David Camp style
summit, but only returned empty handed. So why this summit, and
why now?
</P>
<P>
Firstly, after crystallizing issues and defining gaps, Israeli
and Palestinian negotiators have actually reached an impasse, that
is, they can take the talks no further at their level.
</P>
<P>
The issues involved in the talks are so complex and so
sensitive that movement now depends on historic decisions that
only leaders of the two sides can make.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, as the stalemate sustains, bitterness between the two
sides grows and threatens to derail the peace process.
</P>
<P>
On July 3, the Palestinian side declared that it will proclaim
an independent state on September 13, with or without a deal with
Israel.
</P>
<P>
Barak warned that Israel can respond with "unilateral" measures
of its own -- presumably including annexation of large chunks of
the West Bank still under Israeli control.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the peace process has come to a juncture where it is
simply no longer an option to delay a summit or to leave the
process remain stalled.
</P>
<P>
As proved in the past, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict knows
no status quo. It can move forward toward real peace, or it can
slide back into turmoil. It will not stand still.
</P>
<P>
Announcing his decision on the summit in Camp David, where
President Jimmy Carter hosted 12 days of talks in 1978 that led
to Israel's historic peace accord with Egypt, Clinton said it is "
the best way" and "the only way" to move forward.
</P>
<P>
"Of course, action does have its perils, but so too does
inaction," said Clinton, who hopes to make a Middle East peace
agreement part of his presidential legacy.
</P>
<P>
But he also noted: "There are no easy answers, and certainly no
painless ones; and therefore, there is clearly no guarantee for
success."
</P>
<P>
Briefing reporters of Clinton's decision on the summit, a
senior administration official has described the peace process as
like riding a bicycle. "Once you stop the bike, you fall off. You
have to keep peddling and keep going forward," he said.
</P>
<P>
There is a risk that the summit may fail, the official said,
but it is the risk of a failed summit that may press the Israeli
and Palestinian leaders into making hard decisions.

<HEADLINE> Mexico Seizes 32 Archaeological Pieces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Thirty-two archaeological pieces
were seized in the northwestern Mexican state of Nayarit, and the
person who was transporting them was detained, the Federal
Attorney General Office (PGR) delegation in that state said Friday.
</P>
<P>
A PGR communique said that Federal Judicial Police (PJF)
agents detained the driver of a Datsun light truck in the Eastern
Detour Road, at the crossing that leads to the Xalisco
municipality.
</P>
<P>
The light truck driver, Luis Gonzalo Garcia, stepped down from
the cabin in a way that picked the curiosity of the agents, who
asked him to show what he was transporting, and discovered a
cardboard box containing 32 prehispanic pieces.
</P>
<P>
The seized pieces are 16 earthenware pots, two plates of the
same material, ten bowls, a volcanic stone mortar with pestle, the
fragment of a head, another of a leg and the lid of a pot.
</P>
<P>
The pieces were classified by archaeologists into four cultural
horizons of Nayarit, in the northwest of Mexico, which go from the
Tumbas de Tiro Tradition, passing through Aztlan, Mololoa, and
Santa Cruz, 300 years BC to 1300 AD.

<HEADLINE> Moscow Criticizes Latvia for Sentencing Soviet Veteran in Jail </HEADLINE>

<P>
Earlier Friday, Latvia's Kurzeme circuit court sentenced
Savenko to two years in jail, on the charge of taking part in the
persecutions against about 60 people in Latvia in 1940.
</P>
<P>
"Savenko committed a grave crime that has no statute of
limitations. He took part in repressing of 57 people, nine of whom
were sentenced to death and another nine died in prison," the
Latvian prosecutor said.
</P>
<P>
However, Russia's Foreign Ministry said in a statement that
Savenko is innocent because he did all under the orders of his
superior.
</P>
<P>
"Latvian authorities is whipping up a political campaign to
exonerate fascism and its followers. The campaign includes court
sentences to various prison terms old and infirm people who, in
their time, liberated Latvia from the Nazi occupation," it said.
</P>
<P>
Riga "attempts to revise the results of the World War II and to
unashamedly maltreat those old and infirm persons, who defended
the world against the Nazi plague," said the ministry.
